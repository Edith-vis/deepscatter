To achieve high utilization of these networks, while providing appropriate grade of service for all connections, the development of powerful traffic management algorithms is a central issue. Due to scalability reasons traffic control functions like flow, congestion and admission control often need simple and efficient characterization of traffic using mainly aggregate characteristics instead of using information about all the individual flows. In this paper, the saturation probability as a possible performance measure of aggregate traffic on a communication link is discussed. This performance metric, also referred to as the tail distribution of aggregate traffic, is essential in traffic control and management algorithms of high-speed networks including also the prospective QoS Internet. In this paper, using the Chernoff bounding method, efficient closed-form bounds have been derived for the saturation probability for the case when little information is available on the aggregate traffic. The performance of these estimates is also shown by means of numerical examples.	multiplexing	Zalán Heszberger;János Zátonyi;József Bíró	2002	Perform.

Clearly, a network node that is used more heavily than others is prone to becoming a performance bottleneck. Therefore we consider the situation that the relay node obtains a share of the capacity that is m times as large as the share that each source node receives. The main performance metrics considered are the workload at the relay node and the average overall flow transfer time, i.e., the average time required to transmit a flow from a source node via the relay node to the destination. Our aim is to find expressions for these performance metrics for a general resource-sharing ratio m, as well as a general flow-size distribution. The analysis consists of the following steps. First, for the special case of exponential flow sizes we analyze the source-node dynamics, as well as the workload at the relay node by a fluid-flow queueing model. Then we observe from extensive numerical experimentation over a broad set of parameter values that the distribution of the number of active source nodes is actually insensitive to the flow-size distribution. Using this remarkable (empirical) result as an approximation assumption, we obtain explicit expressions for both the mean workload at the relay node and the overall flow transfer time, both for general flow-size distributions.	hoc (programming language);profiling (computer programming)	Frank Roijers;Hans van den Berg;Michel Mandjes	2010	Perform.

However, the multiple join experiments carried out by different receivers in order to detect the available bandwidth make it hard to achieve fairness. In the present paper, we present a simple protocol, inspired from TCP-Vegas, that reduces considerably the unnecessary join experiments while achieving intra-session and inter-session fairness as well as being TCP-Friendly.	algorithm;experiment;fairness measure;friendly artificial intelligence;internet;multicast;network switch;real-time clock;simulation;tcp congestion control	Omar Ait-Hellal;Guy Leduc	2004			tcp tuning;computer science;tcp vegas;tcp acceleration;computer network;zeta-tcp;tcp global synchronization;h-tcp;compound tcp;cubic tcp;distributed computing	Networks	-2.0071201425619476	93.6732920530706	18145

This scheme avoids the collision of packets that occur in CSMA (code sense multiple access), and can assign codes fairly to terminals. This assignment of codes to terminals is operated autonomously by terminals themselves. This scheme can improve the characteristics of throughput and access delay. We evaluate the performance of CDMA/CS-CF compared with CDMA/PRMA, and show the validity, numerically.	network packet	Jun-ichi Nishimura;Tomohiro Haruki;Kouichi Mutsuura;Hiromi Okada	2001		10.1109/VTC.2001.956954	chip;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;cellular network;code division multiple access;media access control;channel access method;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;multi-frequency time division multiple access;evolution-data optimized;spread spectrum;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;hidden node problem;computer network	Mobile	9.800447521528474	94.33267996849247	18149
0607058c966e7fd9ea11bb947939535df513d404	a layer 3 movement detection algorithm driving handovers in mobile ip	user mobility;wireless access;layer 3;real time;overlapping coverage areas;movement detection;wireless internet;detection algorithm;settore ing inf 03 telecomunicazioni;cell switching;quality of service;mobile ip;mobile ip handover;heterogeneous network	The evolution and the spreading of wireless access technology and the consequent increase of user mobility will make handover procedures critical for the provision of Quality of Service in the next generation wireless Internet. Often, layer 3 handovers are supposed to be driven by access layer procedures. In this way, the movement detection delay can be reduced, but at the expenses of making the Mobile IP protocol dependent of lower layer implementations. Furthermore, this approach may not be effective when users roam among heterogeneous networks. Nevertheless, movement detection algorithms, which operate at the Mobile IP layer, imply appreciable delays, usually intolerable for real time services. In this paper, we propose a Mobile IP handover scheme based on a novel movement detection algorithm at layer 3, able to timely manage migrations by exploiting advertisements losses, combined with a two-timers mechanism. We analyze the performance of our algorithm in terms of handover delay and throughput, and we show that our solution is able to decrease the movement detection delay as much as 47% with respect to other literature solutions that pursue similar approaches. In addition, this feature implies also higher values of the throughput seen by the TCP layer.	algorithm;assistive technology;cell (microprocessor);cell relay;internet;lazy evaluation;mobile ip;next-generation network;principle of good enough;quality of service;real-time computing;simulation;throughput;timer	Nicola Blefari-Melazzi;Mauro Femminella;F.

The data can only be delivered to the mobile clients as they pass within range of wireless base stations. Example scenarios include the delivery of building maps to firefighters responding to multiple alarms. We cast this scenario as a parallel-machine scheduling problem with the little-studied property that jobs may have different release times and deadlines when assigned to different machines. We present new algorithms and also adapt existing algorithms, for both online and offline settings. We evaluate these algorithms on a variety of problem instance types, using both synthetic and real-world data, including several geographical scenarios, and show that our algorithms produce schedules achieving near-optimal throughput.	algorithm;job stream;map;online and offline;parallel computing;scheduling (computing);synthetic intelligence;throughput	Fangfei Chen;Matthew P.

Since future wireless communications will become packet-switched systems, the packet-level features could be explored to improve the system performance. This is especially true when the TCP-type of elastic applications are running over such packet-switched wireless networks, as the elasticity of TCP applications has more tolerance toward the throughput/delay variation than non-elastic traffic does. In order to efficiently utilize the system resource from an admission control perspective, we propose a TCP-aware CAC scheme to regulate the packet-level dynamics of TCP flows. We analyze the system performance under realistic scenarios in which (i) the call holding time for non-elastic traffic like voice is independent of system states and (ii) the call holding time for TCP type of traffic depends on the system state, i.e., on the TCP flow's transmission rate. Extensive simulations are presented under different scenarios to show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the system performance in terms of call blocking probability, call-level throughput (call/min) and link utilization, in accordance with our theoretical results.	algorithm;blocking (computing);circuit switching;common access card;elasticity (data store);erlang (unit);multistage interconnection networks;network congestion;network packet;packet switching;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Xinbing Wang;Do Young Eun;Wenye Wang	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.06064	real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;control system;wireless network;transmission control protocol;computer performance;zeta-tcp;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;packet switching;computer network	Mobile	1.3152382968974605	101.30101451720144	18209

The enhancement improves the level of channel spatial reuse; thus, it improves overall network data throughput in dense deployments. Our modification, named the location-enhanced DCF (LED), incorporates location information in DCF frame exchange sequences so that stations sharing the communication channel are able to make better interference predictions and blocking assessments. Hence, more concurrent transmissions can be conducted in densely deployed wireless LANs. The potential performance enhancement of LED is studied both analytically and via ns-2 simulations. The results show that the LED method achieves significant throughput improvements over the original DCF.	acknowledgement (data networks);blocking (computing);channel (communications);collision detection;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;interference (communication);simulation;spatial multiplexing;throughput;transmitter	Tamer Nadeem;Lusheng Ji	2007	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2007.1029	communications protocol;transmitter;ieee 802.11;internationalization and localization;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;access control;interference;capture effect;mobile computing;wireless;computer network;data transmission;channel	Mobile	9.589891359549915	92.15142538157527	18251

Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism of IEEE802.11e standard is an attempt to improve QoS in these networks. With EDCA, high priority traffic has a higher chance of being sent. However, because of the variable and dynamic nature of wireless channel, the static scheduling mechanism used by EDCA to map arriving packets to various access categories (AC) does not provide multimedia users with desired level of QoS. In this paper, we propose a new cross-layer mechanism that relies on dynamic mapping of video as well as non-video packets to different access categories. Our approach exploits a fuzzy controller to assign video/data packets to different ACs according to traffic type and queue size of each AC. Simulation results show that our fuzzy-based approach outperforms existing mechanisms in terms of average PSNR, end-to-end delay, and packet delivery ratio.

Instantaneous rate is estimated with the LPF and the maximum instantaneous rate (MIR) observed over the monitoring period is used to determine the residual bandwidth in the method. Hence we call it the MIR method. We developed an analytical model to investigate the performance of the MIR method. We confirmed that the MIR method regulates the number of connections properly even for connections with long holding time. In addition, the MIR method is robust against long range dependent traffic, which degrades the robustness of many previously proposed methods. Because the MIR method does not assume any mathematical model and can be implemented with simple hardware, it is well suited for practical ATM switching systems.	atm turbo;bandwidth management;filter design;low-pass filter	Kohei Shiomoto;Naoaki Yamanaka;Haruhisa Hasegawa	1998		10.1109/ISCC.1998.702479	real-time computing;low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Metrics	-2.8291279527812794	98.42196690369582	18663

Adaptive modulation and coding rate based on IEEE 802.16 standard is used to adjust the transmission rate adaptively in each frame time according to channel quality in order to obtain multi-user diversity gain. Arrival process is considered to be discrete-time Markov chain which is modeled by the Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) as the traffic source. Quality of service parameters are evaluated under several allocated bandwidths to a single queue in the case of two scenarios: 1) different arrival traffic intensity, and 2) different channel quality. As expected, dynamic bandwidth allocation according to channel variations improves quality of service parameters.	markov chain;modulation;multi-user;quality of service;signal-to-noise ratio	M.

Thus, designing communication protocols and QoS control mechanisms for H.264 video distribution over wireless IP networks is a topic of intense research interest. Delivering video streams to terminals via a wireless last hop is indeed a challenging task due to the varying nature of the wireless link. While a common approach suggests exploiting the variations of the wireless channel, an alternative is to exploit characteristics of the video stream to improve the transmission. In this paper, we combine both approaches through an efficient wireless loss characterization and a low-delay unequal interleaved FEC protection. Besides deriving new QoS metrics for FEC block allocation, the wireless loss characterization is as well used to adjust the interleaving level depending on the loss correlation exhibited by the wireless channel. This novel unequal interleaved FEC (UI-FEC) protocol allows graceful video quality degradation over error-prone wireless links while minimizing the overall bandwidth consumption and the end-to-end latency.	forward error correction;h.264/mpeg-4 avc	Abdelhamid Nafaa;Ahmed Mehaoua	2005	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2005.02.006	image quality;communications protocol;degradation;interlacing;telecommunications;computer science;video quality;forward error correction;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;service quality;telecommunications network;computer network	Metrics	-4.169436620127956	102.40620166388173	18747

We tried to analyse the end-to-end congestion control algorithms, i.e., TCP Tahoe, TCP Reno, TCP Newreno, TCP Veno, etc. In the literature, TCP implements a window-based flow control mechanism which leads to vary the window size within a range. Older TCP designed assuming packet loss is always inferred due to congestion on link which leads to degradation of performance in wireless networks where random loss occurred due to transmission error or noise. This well-known problem affects on TCP performance. TCP Veno has been successfully proposed to deal with random loss efficiently and its performance is discussed in the literature. This paper evaluates the complex model for different performance parameters, i.e., throughput, queuing delay, goodput, etc. In addition, we have also proposed new performance metric to measure the network performance. We also tried to study and compare the analytical results with simulated data at different levels of loss rate.	algorithm;network congestion;profiling (computer programming)	Sanjeev Patel;Kritika Rani	2016	IJCNDS	10.1504/IJCNDS.2016.077939	tcp westwood;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-2.646026259229539	92.51839995410278	18764

Packet sampling and flow sampling are main sampling techniques. In order to estimate flow size distribution from sampled data, each sampling method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Flow sampling can extract flows in proportion to the original flow size distribution but is difficult to extract large-sized flows due to the heavy-tailed flow size distribution. On the other hand, packet sampling can extract large-sized flows but complete flows cannot be extracted. In this paper, we propose a hybrid sampling method which performs both flow sampling and packet sampling in parallel to utilize both advantages of above two methods and improve estimation accuracy. We also propose cost-effective implementation which employs a general-purpose switch. By verifying with real traffic data, we confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of reproducibility.	access control list;boson sampling;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;network packet;network switch;sampling (signal processing);sampling in order;traffic analysis;verification and validation;wildcard mask	Takayuki Goto;Chikara Sasaki;Teruyuki Hasegawa;Shigehiro Ano	2010	The IEEE symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546764	sampling;real-time computing;importance sampling;computer science;statistics	Metrics	-3.083699831846203	99.04215444691789	18805

The DPS discipline provides a natural approach for modeling the flow-level performance of differentiated bandwidth-sharing mechanisms. Motivated by the extreme diversity in flow sizes observed in the Internet, we examine the system performance in an asymptotic regime where the flow dynamics of the various classes occur on separate time scales. Specifically, from the perspective of a given class, the arrival and service completions of some of the competing classes (called mice) evolve on an extremely fast time scale. In contrast, the flow dynamics of the remaining classes (referred to as elephants) occur on a comparatively slow time scale. Assuming a strict separation of time scales, we obtain simple explicit expressions for various performance measures of interest, such as the distribution of the numbers of flows, mean delays, and flow throughputs. In particular, the latter performance measures are insensitive, in the sense that they only depend on the service requirement distributions through their first moments. Numerical experiments show that the limiting results provide remarkably accurate approximations in certain cases.	approximation;computer mouse;experiment;internet;numerical method;pictbridge;queueing theory	Gijs van Kessel;R.

In time-varying wireless links, such as LEO satellite networks, a reliable channel estimation scheme with an appropriate code selection technique is essential for adaptive error-control systems. This paper proposes a new channel estimation scheme that uses receiverinitiated messages (ACKs, NAKs, and INCs). These messages feed back to the transmitter which then selects the code rate for sending ackets. In addition, the scheme uses the concept of a zynamic transmittable code set by adjusting the maximum code rate in the set of possible codes from which the transmitter can select. In terms of throughput (from network provider’s viewpoint) and packet error rate (from subscriber’s viewpoint), performance results show that the proposed scheme guarantees the quality of service (QoS) requirements of real-time applications.

Considering an LTE-type cellular network, a call admission control policy called double-thr eshold guard channel policy is proposed there to facilitate the implementation of TFRC. In this report, we present state transition analysis of this TFRC-based call admission control policy for an LTE-type ce llular network. Overall, there are five categories of events that can trigger a transition of the sys tem state: 1) a new call arrival; 2) a handoff user arrival; 3) a handoff user departure; 4) a call terminat io ; and 5) a periodic time-frequency resource conversion. We analyze them case by case in this report and th e validation of the analysis has been provided in [1].	compaq lte;cross-validation (statistics);network congestion;reflow soldering;state transition table	Hangguan Shan;Zhifeng Ni;Weihua Zhuang;Aiping Huang;Wei Wang	2013	CoRR		real-time computing;computer security;computer network	ML	3.989995389266815	98.17713946701305	19276

This scheme uses a distributed decision process with interference measurements and a simple collaboration protocol between groups. Performance figures concerning the optimality of the obtained solution and the convergence time are given. The paper also presents a work that has been done to simulate this allocation scheme in a realistic environment with a mobility scenario on a 3D terrain model.

It shows that despite high link capacities in some cases Ethernet network might be the reason of QoS deterioration. The primary reason is the lack of appropriate QoS differentiation and traffic isolation mechanisms. The shared buffers and priority schedulers available in most of Ethernet switches appear to be not sufficient to guarantee strict QoS. For these cases new solution is proposed which relies on additional traffic control mechanisms available in other network elements. Only additional mechanism supporting typical functionality of Ethernet switch can provide strict QoS guarantees what was verified in simulations studies.	access network;control system;network switch;quality of service;simulation	Robert Janowski;Piotr Krawiec;Wojciech Burakowski	2007	International Conference on Networking and Services (ICNS '07)	10.1109/ICNS.2007.82	real-time computing;media access control;network switch;computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	HPC	-1.6929918989428088	95.71412583041739	19309

In a computer network, syslog messages are used for several purposes such as for optimizing system performance, logging user’s actions and investigating malicious activities. Due to all these essential utilities, a competent transport service for syslog messages becomes important. Most of the current syslog implementations use either the unreliable UDP protocol or the more costly reliable TCP protocol. Neither of these protocols can provide both timeliness and reliability, while transporting inherently prioritized syslog messages in a congested network. In this paper, we both propose and evaluate the use of PR-SCTP, an existing partial reliability extension of the SCTP transport protocol, as a candidate transport service for the next generation syslog standard. In our emulation based experimental results, PR-SCTP shows better performance than TCP in terms of average delay for message transfer. Furthermore, PR-SCTP exhibits less average packet loss than UDP. In both cases, PR-SCTP exploits priority properties of syslog messages during loss recovery.	emulator;malware;network packet;next-generation network;server log	Mohammad Rajiullah;Anna Brunstrom;Stefan Lindskog	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-20931-4_23	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;syslog;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-4.135180540868447	90.96501131868752	19317

dbeadc0f2fc5d2b98d283c29c610c2ee0527532b	optimizing inter-operator network slicing over licensed and unlicensed bands		"""Network slicing has been considered as a key enabling technology for 5G due to its ability to customize and """"slice"""" a common resource to support diverse services and verticals. This paper introduces a novel inter-operator network slicing framework in which multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) can cooperate and jointly slice their accessible spectrum resources in both licensed and unlicensed bands. For the licensed band slicing, we propose the inter-operator spectrum aggregation method which allows two or more MNOs to cooperate and share their licensed bands to support a common set of service types. We then consider the sharing of unlicensed bands. Since all MNOs enjoy equal rights to access unlicensed bands, we introduce the concept of right sharing for MNOs to share and trade their spectrum access rights. We develop a modified back-of-the-envelop method for the MNOs to evaluate their value of rights when coexisting with other wireless technologies. We develop a network slicing game based on the overlapping coalition formation game to investigate the possible cooperation between MNOs. We prove that our proposed game always has at least one stable slicing structure that maximizes the social welfare. To evaluate the practical performance of our proposed framework, we develop a C++-based discrete-event simulator and simulate a possible implementation of our proposed framework over 400 base station locations deployed by two primary cellular operators in the city of Dublin. Numerical results show that our proposed framework can almost double the capacity for all supported services for each operator under certain conditions."""	c++;compaq lte;develop;distributed algorithm;numerical method;optimizing compiler;simulation;vhf omnidirectional range	Yong Xiao;Mohammed Hirzallah;Marwan Krunz	2018	2018 15th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397107	operator (computer programming);computer network;computer science;distributed computing;resource management;wireless;slicing;base station;cellular network	Mobile	23.15765486411725	93.22460075916831	19590

This results in low throughput and congestion collapse. In such networks, an AQM mechanism manages queue lengths in buffers and enables the end-systems to react to such losses by reducing their packet rate, avoiding severe congestion. Random Early Detection (RED) is one of the first AQM mechanisms to be used to avoid congestion in this manner. In this paper, the existing Normal and Gentle RED algorithms of Floyd as well as the justification for the proposed modified exponential RED algorithm have been discussed along with the results obtained on the functioning of the algorithms. Functioning of the algorithm proposed has also been tested using ns2 Simulator.	network congestion	S.

As commodity wireless network cards support the usage of orthogonal channels, allowing multiple simultaneous communications on these channels will improve the performance of wireless networks. Previous MAC protocols either were expensive to implement as they needed more than one packet radio per node or required synchronization or caused network partitioning. We propose a new MAC protocol that uses hash functions to distribute the control overhead over all the channels. In addition, it uses busy tones to reserve the channels and solve the hidden terminal and the channel rendezvous problems in multi channels. We compared our protocol with another multi-channel MAC protocol that uses more than one packet radio per node (DCA) and with 802.11. Our protocol produces comparable results with DCA and performs much better than 802.11. The results show that our protocol utilizes the multiple channels available to increase the capacity of the network. The proposed protocol is expected to improve the usage of ad hoc networks as it does not need synchronization like previous protocols.	hash function;hoc (programming language);network interface controller;network packet;network partition;overhead (computing);throughput	Mohamed Farid Elhawary;Zygmunt J.

107357cc05302c4ad3eadd06c8a9cffbc254a950	wireless network emulation for research on information-centric networking		When developing new approaches in networking research, one of the most important requirements is to evaluate the degree of improvement of a new approach both realistically and cost-effectively. Wireless networks and their adequate emulation play an important role in evaluation, but emulation of wireless links and networks is still difficult to handle. In this paper, we present a low-cost, fixed-network testbed able to emulate the dynamically changing conditions of wireless links caused by client mobility and physical phenomena. We extend the existing fixed-network testbed for the purpose of wireless network emulation using the Linux tools tc, iptables, and NetEm in sophisticated ways. Convenient function blocks are provided to configure wireless network topologies as well as dynamic link and mobility conditions to be emulated with modest efforts. We utilize the testbed's capabilities to investigate the influence of different mobility models on streaming SVC-encoded videos in Named Data Networking (NDN), a novel Information-Centric Networking architecture. Furthermore, we evaluate the benefits of using early loss detection mechanisms for streaming in NDN, by implementing Wireless Loss Detection and Recovery (WLDR). Our results show that the extended fixed-network testbed can precisely emulate wireless network conditions and usage. For instance, the emulation revealed that both the choice of the mobility model and the use of WLDR have a substantial influence on the resulting SVC video streaming performance.	emulator;linux;network emulation;network topology;requirement;scalable video coding;streaming media;testbed;iptables	Philipp Moll;Sebastian Theuermann;Hermann Hellwagner	2018		10.1145/3267204.3267211	wireless network;architecture;network topology;computer network;wireless;testbed;information-centric networking;emulation;computer science;mobility model	Mobile	-1.1064408403255777	89.15903222616392	19935
304619b845ca6836a3cef495447f2e9079a20224	ieee 802.11p-based packet broadcast in radio channels with hidden stations and congestion control		Authors: Yunpeng Zang (Member IEEE), Bernhard Walke (Fellow IEEE), Guido Hiertz (Member IEEE), Christian Wietfeld (Senior Member IEEE) Abstract: The Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) algorithms in ETSI ITS standards [1] address the IEE 802.11p MAC and provide reliability of periodic broadcast messages at high density of vehicles. However, the deterministic relation between controllable parameters, e.g. transmit power, frame duration, frame transmit rate and channel clear assessment threshold, and the effects of DCC algorithms, e.g. channel busy duration, frame interferencefree reception probability and frame channel access delay, is still unknown since a correct mathematical analysis of the hidden station problem in CSMA networks is lacking. In this work, the hidden station problem in a linear IEEE 802.11p broadcast network is analyzed based on analytical results developed in [18] employing a modified MAC protocol model based on [3]. Simulation results validate the new analytical model for linear IEEE 802.11p networks w.r.t reliability and latency performances of Cooperative Awareness Message broadcast. Evidence is given that the model not only is valid for single-lane highways but also provides good approximate results for multi-lane highway scenarios. Our MAC layer analytical model of IEEE 802.11p broadcast reveals the quantitative relation between DCC parameters and congestion control effects in closed-form solution for linear vehicular networks.	approximation algorithm;control system;design rule for camera file system;network congestion;performance;radio broadcasting;simulation;synchronous data link control;transmitter	Yunpeng Zang;Bernhard Walke;Guido R.

This paper analyzes the problem of optimal flow control quantitatively, for a connection that has a cost per unit time and a cost for every transmitted packet. The optimal strategy is defined as one that minimizes the expected cost/throughput ratio, and is allowed to transmit several copies of a packet within a window. We present an algorithm for computing the optimal strategy and study its properties; in particular, we derive bounds on the optimal strategy cost/throughput performance, and show that it increases merely logarithmically with the time price, whereas the cost/throughput of the 'traditional' classic window scheme is linear in the time price."""

This flexibility, which is due to DCF’s contention-based nature, comes at the expense of the overhead associated with contention resolution. The overhead consists of frame collision time and channel idle time, which is particularly severe when channel is saturated. In this paper, we present an enhancement of DCF which aims at reducing its contention resolution overhead by equipping it with a distributed reservation mechanism. The proposed reservation mechanism enhances collision avoidance mechanism of DCF by enforcing a partially ordered medium access through an implicit agreement between neighboring nodes. Simulation results, using ns-2 network simulator, show that the added reservation scheme 1) effectively reduces DCF’s overhead and improves channel utilization particularly when node density and traffic load is high, 2) significantly enhance DCF’s fairness. key words: 802.11 WLAN, reservation-based MAC, DCF, fairness	collision detection;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput	Mehdad N.

A queue mamtger in ATM network nodes will schedule ATM cells’ departing and discarding sequenee based on their delay and loss priorities. Most queue management schemes prapoaed so far only consider either one of these two priority typea. In this paper, the queue manager handles mukiple delay and loss priorities simultaneously. Moreover, a cell dmrding strategy, called push-out, that allows the buffer to be completely shared by all service classes, haa been adopted in the queue manager.

In this paper, we propose to reduce the tail energy by aggregating the data traffic of multiple nodes using their P2P interfaces. This traffic aggregation problem is formalized as finding the best task schedule to minimize energy. We first propose an A* search algorithm, which can reduce the search space for finding the optimal schedule offline, and then introduce an online traffic aggregation algorithm. We have implemented the online traffic aggregation algorithm on Android smartphones, and have built a small testbed. Trace-driven simulations and Experimental results show that our traffic aggregation algorithm can significantly reduce the energy and delay.	a* search algorithm;android;data access;long tail;mathematical optimization;online and offline;peer-to-peer;pervasive informatics;simulation;smartphone;testbed	Wenjie Hu;Guohong Cao	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848020	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Mobile	18.382394278490672	90.64048172930156	20509

A propagation model is used to analyze the coverage for different cases. The coverage of EUL depends on a number of parameters, such as TTI length, number of retransmissions and relative channel power allocation. The simulations show better coverage for EUL using a TTI of 10 ms than 2 ms under comparable conditions, considering the same delay budget. Furthermore, in most of the cases the coverage of VoIP over EUL is comparable or even better than that of CS 64 kbps. VoIP over EUL has the potential to have a comparable or even better coverage than CS AMR 12.2 kbps if more power is allocated to EUL data channel and more transmission attempts are allowed	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;channel (communications);circuit switching;data rate units;simulation;software propagation;telecommunications link	Fan Rui;Fredrik Persson;Mats Nordberg;Stefan Wänstedt;Miao Qingyu;Gu Xinyu	2006	2006 IEEE 63rd Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2006.1682810	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;voice over ip;computer network	Mobile	7.806775479418919	94.0644175513097	20523

Particularly, the scheduling algorithms for WNCSs should be designed to provide maximum level of adaptivity accommodating packet losses and changes in network topology while exploiting periodic nature of the sensor node transmissions. Creating such a schedule has been previously studied for an Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based WNCS. In this paper, we extend the joint optimization problem of power control, rate adaptation and scheduling with the objective of providing maximum adaptivity for general WNCSs employing continuous rate transmission model in which Shannon's channel capacity formulation is used for the achievable transmission rate. Upon proving the NP-hardness of the problem, we provide a framework for the design of a heuristic algorithm for scheduling and propose an optimal polynomial time algorithm for the power control and rate adaptation problem following the derivation of the optimality conditions. We demonstrate via extensive simulations that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing algorithms with performance close to optimal solution and average runtime admissible for practical WNCSs.	algorithm;bit error rate;channel capacity;control system;control theory;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network packet;network topology;optimization problem;p (complexity);requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor node;shannon (unit);simulation;systems design	Yalcin Sadi;Sinem Coleri Ergen	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2015.2411602	real-time computing;telecommunications;schedule;power control;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;scheduling;wireless;computer network	Embedded	16.465269766845637	95.35878575194263	20628

A success probability function is related to each link, which can be controlled by power and rate allocation. The expression for the network's stability region is initially derived where the success function plays a critical role. The investigation considers functions with specific properties which are shown to be satisfied for various expressions of the success probability related to different modulation and coding schemes as well as outage events. A Network Utility Maximization problem (NUM) with stability constraints is further formulated which decomposes into the input rate control and the scheduling problem. Under certain assumptions the latter is relaxed to a simpler form. This allows application of supermodular game theory and the algorithmic approach in is adapted to include the family of success functions of interest. It is shown finally that interference measurements per node drastically reduce the amount of information exchange required for solving the scheduling problem.	aggregate data;automatic repeat request;concave function;converge;convex hull;convex optimization;distributed algorithm;downtime;expectation–maximization algorithm;game theory;global optimization;goodput;hoc (programming language);hop;hop-by-hop transport;information exchange;interference (communication);iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;mathematical optimization;modulation;negativity (quantum mechanics);network packet;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);simulation;social inequality;supermodular function	Anastasios Giovanidis;Slawomir Stanczak	2011	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2011.042111.090486	mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	16.447839084765114	97.02741692925981	20642

Mobile backhauling is the key enabler and also a showstopper for 5G small cells deployments. Scalability and reliability with high data rate and larger bandwidth are important factors to choose the small cell backhauling topology. In this paper, We consider the star and mesh topologies for the MmWave wireless backhauling. Simulations are conducted over random networks. The system throughput, scalability, reliability and fairness are used to compare the two different topologies under different considered scenarios.

However, all of these heterogeneous MAC protocols are designed under the assumption that all nodes in the wireless environment use a common MAC protocol. When multiple sensor networks are deployed in the same wireless environment, this assumption no longer holds since different sensor networks will most likely make use of different MAC protocols. This paper investigates the effect of interference between sensor networks using heterogeneous MAC protocols, based on the network performance of these sensor networks. The network performance of TDMA, CSMA/CA, T-MAC and LPL-MAC, a variant of B-MAC, is examined. Test results show that depending on the interfering MAC protocol, the amount of interference and the load of the network, the average energy consumption can increase by 17% for contention-based protocols and 62% for TDMA based protocols. Moreover this interference can cause the end-to-end data loss to more than double for contention-based protocols while for TDMA protocols the end-to-end data loss can increase from 0.1% to more than 40%.	b-mac;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);network performance;performance evaluation;protocol stack;requirement	Daniel van den Akker;Bart Braem;Chris Blondia	2011	2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2011.59	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	9.294339698882224	88.94738312942869	20746

Recent results have revealed that two of the most important parameters that critically affect the resulting cross-layer designs are channel- and queue-state information (QSI). Motivated by these results, this paper relies on stochastic convex optimization to develop optimal algorithms that use instantaneous fading and queue length information to allocate resources at the transport (flow-control), link, and physical layers. Focus is placed on a cellular system, where an access point exchanges information with different users over flat-fading orthogonal channels. Both uplink and downlink setups are considered. The allocation strategies are obtained as the solution of a constrained utility maximization problem that involves average performance metrics. It turns out that the optimal allocation at a given instant depends on the instantaneous channel-state information (CSI) and Lagrange multipliers, which are associated with the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and the operating conditions of the system. The multipliers are estimated online using stochastic approximation tools and are linked with the window-averaged length of the queues. Capitalizing on those links, queue stability and average queuing delay of the developed algorithms are characterized, and a simple mechanism is devised to effect delay priorities among users.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;channel state information;convex optimization;entropy maximization;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;quality of service;queuing delay;requirement;stochastic approximation;telecommunications link;wireless access point	Antonio Garcia Marques;Luis M.

However, most methods fail to predict bandwidth availability reliably in a wireless setting. It is accepted that the increased variability of wireless channel conditions makes bandwidth estimation more difficult. However, a (satisfactory) explanation why these methods are failing is missing. This paper seeks to provide insights into the problem of bandwidth estimation in wireless networks or, more broadly, in networks with random service. We express bandwidth availability in terms of bounding functions with a defined violation probability. Exploiting properties of a stochastic min-plus linear system theory, the task of bandwidth estimation is formulated as inferring an unknown bounding function from measurements of probing traffic. We present derivations showing that simply using the expected value of the available bandwidth in networks with random service leads to a systematic overestimation of the traffic departures. Furthermore, we show that in a multihop setting with random service at each node, available bandwidth estimates requires observations over (in principle infinitely) long time periods. We propose a new estimation method for random service that is based on iterative constant-rate probes that take advantage of statistical methods. We show how our estimation method can be realized to achieve both good accuracy and confidence levels. We evaluate our method for wired single-and multihop networks, as well as for wireless networks.	bandwidth (signal processing);bandwidth management;failure;heart rate variability;iterative method;linear system;maxima and minima;newton's method;systems theory	Ralf Lübben;Markus Fidler;Jörg Liebeherr	2014	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2013.2261914	stochastic process;information and communications technology;telecommunications;computer science;probability;distributed computing;iterative method;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Metrics	-1.934662710154119	98.35769793357336	20924

The optimization is done in a cross-layer fashion by using parameterized models of application and link layer in order to determine the application data rate and the network resources that fulfill the criteria. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is used as a unified utility metric that encompasses the user-perceived quality under certain receiving conditions for the user application. We consider two partially contrary objectives, which are maximizing the total perceived quality of the whole system and maximizing the utility fairness among all users. A tuning mechanism is proposed, which allows the network operator to change dynamically its operating point of the resource allocation based on its pre-defined policy of any combinations of these two objectives. We implemented the proposed tuning algorithm in an emulated Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system and verified its feasibility through simulations.	algorithm;compaq lte;data rate units;emulator;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;multi-user;operating point;optimization problem;simulation	Srisakul Thakolsri;Serdar Cokbulan;Dan Jurca;Zoran Despotovic;Wolfgang Kellerer	2011	2011 IEEE GLOBECOM Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162395	mean opinion score;optimization problem;link layer;real-time computing;simulation;resource allocation;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Embedded	24.306181238696933	94.60840508345579	21153

In particular, we present fundamental properties of QoS in group communications, which, although quite simple, have been widely overlooked and/or misunderstood. Because distributed multimedia applications require flexible QoS agreements, endto-end QoS negotiation will play an important role. We show how such a negotiation mechanism can be designed, taking the fundamental QoS properties into account. This leads us to the design of an algorithm for QoS negotiation whose computational overhead proves to be independent of the size of the group of receivers.	algorithm;overhead (computing);quality of service	Laurent Mathy;Christopher Edwards;David Hutchison	1999	Telecommunication Systems	10.1023/A:1019132914996	real-time computing;mobile qos;simulation;quality of service;communication in small groups;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	-0.7596362350611123	89.75429111151318	21160

The latter elements have no natural counterparts in wireline scenarios, and create a need for novel performance models that account for the impact of these characteristics on the service rates of users. Motivated by the above issues, we review several models for characterizing the capacity and evaluating the flow-level performance of wireless networks carrying elastic data transfers. We first examine the flow-level performance and stability of a wide family of so-called α-fair channel-aware scheduling strategies. We establish that these disciplines provide maximum stability, and describe how the special case of the Proportional Fair policy gives rise to a Processor-Sharing model with a state-dependent service rate. Next we turn attention to a network of several base stations with inter-cell interference. We derive both necessary and sufficient stability conditions and construct lower and upper bounds for the flow-level performance measures. Lastly we investigate the impact of user mobility that occurs on a slow time scale and causes possible hand-offs of active sessions. We show that the mobility tends to increase the capacity region, both in the case of globally optimal scheduling and local α-fair scheduling. It is additionally demonstrated that the capacity and user throughput improve with lower values of the fairness index α.	cell (microprocessor);experiment;fairness measure;interference (communication);maxima and minima;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);throughput	Thomas Bonald;Sem C.

However, there are many new challenges associated with cognitive-radio-based DSA networks, such as the multi-channel hidden terminal problem and the fact that the time-varying channel availability differs for different secondary users, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient Cognitive Radio-EnAbled Multi-channel MAC (CREAM-MAC) protocol, which integrates the cooperative sequential spectrum sensing at physical layer and the packet scheduling at MAC layer, over the wireless DSA networks. Under the proposed CREAM-MAC protocol, each secondary user is equipped with a cognitive radio-enabled transceiver and multiple channel sensors. Our cooperative sequential spectrum sensing scheme improves the accuracy of spectrum sensing and further protects the primary users. The proposed CREAM-MAC enables the secondary users to best utilize the unused frequency spectrum while avoiding the collisions among secondary users and between secondary users and primary users. We develop the Markov chain model and M/GY/1 queueing model to rigorously study our proposed CREAM-MAC protocol for both the saturation networks and the non-saturation networks. We also conduct extensive simulations to validate our developed protocol and analytical models.	access control;centralized computing;cognitive radio;design rule for camera file system;interference (communication);markov chain;network packet;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;spectral density;transceiver	Xi Zhang;Hang Su	2011	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2091941	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	19.34454701921629	92.7774669935415	21500

We utilize Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms for adaptive multipath routing and use the monitoring feature of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for QoS computation. So, merging these two methodologies we propose a powerful adaptive multipath QoS-aware routing protocol based on ACO (QoRA). The adaptive nature of QoRA signifies the support of multi-rate data transmission determined by the QoS constraints available on the path. The QoRA routing protocol firstly determines multiple routes based on the applications QoS requirements. Secondly, the congestion control mechanism of QoRA prevents the communication flow from entering into the congested node. QoRA performance is tested for real-time multimedia applications over realistic scenarios simulated using SUMO. The real-time video applications are simulated using H.264/SVC encoded video trace files. We provide an in-depth discussion of the operation of the QoRA routing protocol, which is implemented in the ns-3 simulator. The results obtained after simulation indicates that the enhanced QoRA approach shows better performance for delay and jitter constraints in urban scenarios for multimedia applications as compared to our earlier approach.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;computation;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;multipath routing;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;simple network management protocol;simulation;streaming media;traffic flow (computer networking)	Aymen Dawood Al-Ani;Jochen Seitz	2016	2016 9th IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC)	10.1109/WMNC.2016.7543989	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Embedded	-0.22289081987941053	89.95510480399047	21548

A cross-layer scheduling scheme is proposed to exploit Link Going Down information from MIH to predict handover requirements, and then improve the performance of Quality of Service (QoS) enabled transport services given the limited radio spectrum available for handovers in a heterogeneous network environment. According to simulation results, the proposed scheme can effectively increase the effective range of QoS sensitive services at the cell border while executing the handover procedure.

The SCR traffic descriptor (SCR-TD), composed of the sustainable cell rate 1/TSCR and the intrinsic burst tolerance τIBT, is defined with respect to an algorithmic characterization, the generic cell rate algorithm (GCRA). This method makes source parameter enforcement straightforward. Unfortunately, the current specification of the SCR-TD is incomplete, leaving the source with an infinite number of (TSCR, τIBT) couples to choose from, This ambiguity could bear a negative impact on network efficiency.

The aim of procedure is twofold. Firstly, several connections between the MS and BS are created, i.e. basic, primary and secondary management connections to control data transmissions. Secondly, the MS is admitted into the network. According to the IEEE 802.16 standard, a MS always tries to associate to BS with the highest received signal quality. This method is suitable as long as the MS is directly connected to the network via BS. However by introducing relay stations to the WiMAX architecture, the MS entry procedure needs to be modified. Mainly, the point of attachment influences the network performance. This paper proposes an optimized association procedure which takes into account the use of relays stations in the network. The obtained results show improvement of system performance.	broadcast relay station	Pavel Mach;Robert Bestak;Zdenek Becvar	2013	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-011-9661-7	wimax;association;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;statistics;computer network	Robotics	19.24620060423829	91.2610860726547	21755

3456db858c92f424065465bb3efa2f3657f6319b	exact modeling and performance analysis of distance-based registration considering the implicit registration effect of outgoing calls		We consider distance-based registration (DBR). DBR causes a mobile station (MS) to reregister when the distance between the current base station (BS) and the BS with which it last registered exceeds a distance threshold. The addition of implicit registration to DBR (DBIR) was proposed to improve the performance of DBR, and its performance has also been presented using a continuous-time Markov chain. In this study, we point out some problems of the previous DBIR performance analysis, and we propose a new model of the DBIR to analyze its exact performance. Using the new method, we show that DBIR is always superior to DBR, and the extent of the improvement is generally greater than what is currently known. key words: distance-based registration, implicit registration	distributed bragg reflector;image registration;markov chain;profiling (computer programming)	Jang Hyun Baek;Taehan Lee;Che Soong Kim	2012	IEICE Transactions		speech recognition;computer science;data mining;information retrieval	Vision	8.785465762957253	101.32190033215747	22055

We first propose a new multifractal traffic model fo r network traffic based on the combination of a multiplicativ e cascade with an independent lognormal process. This traffic model is able to provide a very accurate fit to the multifracta l characteristics of data traffic including both the scaling f unction and the moment factor, but it is also simple enough from a practical point of view having only three parameters. In addition, the model features many important properties observed in data traffic including LRD, multifractality and lognormality. We also present an approximation for the queue tail asymptot ics in an infinite capacity single server queue serviced at a constant rate driven by a general multifractal input pro cess. We show that in the special and important case of the monofractal fractional Brownian motion (fBm) input traffic our result gives the well-known Weibullian tail. We prove th a the class of Gaussian processes with scaling properties is i n the class of monofractal processes and we derive the relate d characterization functions. Applying the approximation w e provide a new practical method for queueing performance estimation of general multifractal traffic. Finally, we present a practical case study to show the practi c l application of our framework for measured data traffic and also to validate both our multifractal model and our queu eing results.	approximation algorithm;asymptote;brownian motion;computation;exptime;emoticon;expanded memory;gaussian process;image scaling;little's law;multifractal system;multiplicative cascade;network packet;network traffic control;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);profiling (computer programming);server (computing);simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Trang Dinh Dang;Sándor Molnár;István Maricza	2004	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.955	multifractal system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;multiplicative cascade;mathematical model;gaussian process;mathematics;fractional brownian motion;queue;telecommunications network;statistics	Metrics	-0.7466747291046952	99.71749018747303	22075

Our modification, named the location enhanced DCF (LED) for IEEE 802.11, incorporates location information in DCF frame exchange sequences so that stations sharing the communication channel are able to make better interference predictions and blocking assessments. Utilizing an underlying physical layer design that supports frame capture, the LED enhanced interference estimation can increase overall network data throughput by permitting more concurrent transmissions. In this paper we also analytically study the potential performance enhancement of the LED over the original IEEE 802.11 DCF. The results are verified using the ns-2 simulator, which shows that up to 35% of DCF blocking decisions are unnecessary and our LED method can achieve up to 22% more throughput than the original DCF.	blocking (computing);channel (communications);design rule for camera file system;interference (communication);throughput	Tamer Nadeem;Lusheng Ji;Ashok K.

12486a90833fb48e69c3fd3d7b22837efbe01a8a	random access protocol design and optimization for standalone lte-u system		Standalone Long Term Evolution in unlicensed band (SA LTE-U) is a promising technology to address the scarcity of licensed band. For SA LTE-U system, we design a novel random access protocol, and propose an algorithm to calculate the optimal number of Random Access Channels (RACHs) which balances the resources between RACHs and Uplink Shared Channels (UL-SCHs). Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem maximizing the number of UL-SCHs for data transmission, under the condition of discontinuous channel in unlicensed band, and with the constraints of average random access delay and user collision probability. Then, we develop an algorithm to solve it. The performance of the designed protocol with the proposed algorithm is simulated. The simulation results reveal that, under the discontinuous and time-uncertain channel condition and for given delay and user collision probability constraints, the number of RACHs can be optimally adjusted according to the channel time ratio and packet arrival rate so as to balance the collision resolution ability and the uplink data transmission capability.	algorithm;communications protocol;compaq lte;hash table;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;queueing theory;random access;simulation;telecommunications link	Chaohui Zhao;Jiantao Yuan;Aiping Huang;Hangguan Shan	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8170972	real-time computing;computer science;computer network;collision;data transmission;telecommunications link;network packet;time ratio;optimization problem;random access;communication channel	EDA	23.836453216877413	93.22486135198598	22135

Interrupted or dropped calls are an aspect of reliability that stems from the mobility of users. An existing user can move to a cell where there are no resources available to support their call. A natural solution is the reservation of resources in multiple cells that the user is likely to move to. This scheme is called selective reservations and it relies on predicting the next move of the user. Recently, there has been some work on estimating the movement probabilities (also known as the mobility profile) of the user. In this paper, we quantify the usefulness of the mobility profile to improve the reliability of the service perceived by the mobile users. We identify two parameters which characterize the profile: Accuracy and Focus. Accuracy expresses the probability that the host will move as we expect it to. Focus describes how well we can identify patterns in the movement of the users. In our simulations, we examine the effect of the quality of the predictions on the performance of the system. We show that Accuracy and Focus have great impact on the performance of selective reservations. We also show how flexibility in hand-offs can help in decreasing the dropping probability, and how this can be facilitated by letting the users make a second try at moving in case it fails the first time.

e92dbfe5815220fe88b1d62605867e0bd108ec0d	optimal task allocation in near-far computing enhanced c-ran for wireless big data processing		With the increasing popularity of user equipments, the corresponding UE generated big data (UGBD) is also growing substantially, which makes both UEs and current network structures struggle to process those data and applications. This article proposes a near-far computing enhanced C-RAN (NFC-RAN) architecture that can better process big data and its corresponding applications. NFC-RAN is composed of near edge computing (NEC) and far edge computing (FEC) units. NEC is located in the remote radio head,, which can quickly respond to delay-sensitive tasks from the UEs, while FEC sits next to a baseband unit pool, which can do other computation-intensive tasks. Task allocation between NEC and FEC is introduced in this article. Also, WiFi indoor positioning is illustrated as a case study of the proposed architecture. Moreover, simulation and experiment results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation and architecture.	algorithm;baseband;big data;c-ran;computation;computational resource;edge computing;expectation propagation;forward error correction;near field communication;remote radio head;simulation	Lianming Zhang;Kezhi Wang;Xuan Du;Kun Yang	2018	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2018.1700188	computer science;task analysis;computer network;c-ran;big data;architecture;wireless;distributed computing;remote radio head;real-time computing;baseband;edge computing	Robotics	22.73224128158745	88.68530185723357	22371

Data are segmented into 4%byte blocks prefixed by a 5-byte header and transported over the network using the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). An ATM connection-request is a contract between the user and the network; the user specifies a rate requirement, delay constraints, a bound on the cell-loss probability and other quality of service parameters. If the network can meet these requirements, a connection is made. Bursty traffic producing peak traffic rates in excess of the projected average rate could result in congestion and lead to performance degradation. As a result, the network might no longer be able to deliver the negotiated quality of service to existing connections. To lessen the chance of congestion, input rate control must be implemented. This paper contains a performance analysis of the sticky bufir (SB), a moving window input rate control scheme intended to limit the rate at which input traffic may enter a network. Policing is achieved by buffering and hence delaying the entry of ATM-cells into the network. The scheme is determined by parameters (R, T) which specify that no more than R ATM-cells are permitted to enter the network in every window of size T cells. We present an exact analysis, derivin,g the probability generating function of the queue length distribution. A comparison with the leaky bucket is given. Our numerical examples show the required buffer size is comparable to that required by the leaky bucket.	atm turbo;byte;data buffer;digital electronics;elegant degradation;file transfer;flow control (data);integrated services;leaky bucket;multiplexing;network congestion;numerical analysis;offset binary;quality of service;requirement;sandy bridge;sticky bit;sticky keys	Gísli Hjálmtýsson;Alan G.

7a1cbd295e46674f9bddd69e08c32752689c144d	optimised csma/ca protocol for safety messages in vehicular ad-hoc networks		Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) that enable communication among vehicles have recently attracted significant interest from researchers, due to the range of practical applications they can facilitate, particularly related to road safety. Despite the stringent performance requirements for such applications, the IEEE 802.11p standard still uses the carrier sensing medium access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. The latter when used in broadcast fashion employs a randomly selected backoff period from a fixed contention window (CW) range, which can cause performance degradation as a result of vehicular density changes. Concerns regarding the robustness and adaptiveness of protocols to support time-critical applications have been raised, which motivate this work. This paper investigates how the maximum CW size can be optimised to enhance performance based on vehicular density. A stochastic model is developed to obtain the optimal maximum CW that can be integrated in an amended CSMA/CA protocol to maximise the single-hop throughput among adjacent vehicles. Simulations confirm our optimised protocol can greatly improve the channel throughput and transmission delay performance, when compared to the standardised CSMA/CA, to support safety application in VANETs.	backoff;communications protocol;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);network packet;randomness;requirement;simulation;throughput;turing completeness;window function;window of opportunity	Giorgia V.

This paper determines the optimal sleep mode selection for IEEE 802.16e by using the semi-Markov decision processes (semi-MDP). By means of evaluating corresponding cost metrics on system energy consumption and delay performance, we highlight the energy-performance trade-offs among different operational modes and formulate it as probabilistic constrained policy optimization (PO) problems. Our main goal is to search the space of all policies and to find the optimal one that achieves the minimum energy cost or traffic delay under different traffic requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our semi-MDP method.

Although STDMA achieves a hard real-time communication among end-nodes, a packet-sending interval and an one-way delay depend on a STDMA table. This paper therefore analyzes the relation between a control performance and a STDMA table to find an effective design principle of STDMA tables.

One broadcasting method (called periodic broadcasting) is to partition a video into segments, which are then simultaneously broadcast on several data channels. Once clients want to watch the video, they download the segments from these channels. Specially, the skyscraper broadcasting (SkB), client-centric approach (CCA), greedy disk-conserving broadcasting (GDB) schemes were proposed to support a client with a small bandwidth. This paper presents a limited-client-capability broadcasting (LCCB) scheme, which achieves small waiting time, bandwidth consumption, and buffer demand on the client side. In comparison with SkB, CCA, and GDB, LCCB gains smaller waiting time. Extensive simulation results indicate that LCCB also requires lower client buffer spaces than SkB, CCA, and GDB.	client-side;datacasting;download;gnu debugger;greedy algorithm;queueing theory;simulation;skyscraper;video	Hsiang-Fu Yu;Hung-Chang Yang;Chu-Yi Chien;Yao-Tien Wang	2008	Seventh International Conference on Networking (icn 2008)	10.1109/ICN.2008.18	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;broadcasting;computer network	DB	-4.181978689491498	100.05743055738874	22728

Despite the growing research interest in vehicular communications, currently available network simulators have shortcomings with respect to generation of accurate vehicle driving information. In this paper, we present a network simulator that is interoperable with traffic simulators for the purpose of utilizing more accurate vehicle driving information. The carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) of the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) standard is implemented in the network simulator. The interface between the network simulator and the traffic simulator is designed to convert traffic simulation results into an acceptable input format for the network simulator. Our simulation results show that the proposed network simulator successfully demonstrates the inherent characteristic of the CSMA/CA of the IEEE WAVE standard.	ieee 1471;interoperability;network congestion;simulation	Won-Hwa Lee;Tae-Hoon Kwon;Minjin Baek;Sang-Sun Lee	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436998	simulation;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;computer network;wireless;network simulation;interoperability;data modeling;computer science;traffic simulation;traffic congestion	Mobile	3.5775529997354627	89.42858801394357	22775

[1] is better than that of the existing protocol. It was proposed that a frame from an access device is delivered over the access link and then it is multiplexed and packed into ATM cell at an access node and then the cell is carried toward a voice gateway, by using a method to split two sublayers in AAL2. That means one sublayer is implemented at the subscriber access device and the other sublayer is implemented at the access node. Access devices using the protocol achieve higher utilization of CID and waste fewer ATM resource per the access device. Mathematical analysis is performed on the proposed and existing protocol, and both upstream cell rate and padding probability are calculated. The proposed protocol shows lower upstream traffic rate and padding cell probability than the existing protocol.	atm adaptation layer 2;profiling (computer programming)	Sang-Kil Lee;Tae-Kyung Cho;Seong-Ho Kim;Myung-Ryul Choi	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.4.1677	embedded system;digital subscriber line;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;implementation;multiplexing;computer network	Visualization	2.8635361369835444	102.02214470787884	22860

In order to meet the Quality-of-Service (40s) requirements of the VOD service and maximize the network throughput, it is essential that the call admission control algcrithm he carefully designed. In this paper, we propose a new admission control scheme for the VBR MPEG video in the VOD system over ATM-over-DSL access networks. In the proposed scheme, when a new video call is requested, the video server flrst determines the I-frame starting time of the new video call which can minimize the cell loss ratio (CLR) of the multiplexed traffic and then decides if the VOD system can provide the video call with its negotiated QoS without violating the QoS guarantees of existing calls in the network. Experimental results show that the proposed admission control method can calculate the number of acceptable sources more precisely and efficiently than other existing methods.	atm turbo;access network;cell (microprocessor);digital subscriber line;intra-frame coding;moving picture experts group;multiplexing;quality of service;requirement;server (computing);throughput;versant object database;video server;volume boot record	Sang-Hyun Park;Jae-Won Kim;Sung-Jea Ko	2002	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we explore the benefits of directional antennas in security improvements on both single-hop and multi-hop wireless networks. In particular, we found that using directional antennas in wireless networks can significantly reduce the eavesdropping probabilities of both single-hop transmissions as well as multi-hop transmissions and consequently improve the network security.	access control;network security;throughput	Dong Li;Raymond Chi-Wing Wong	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115185	telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;network security;wireless network;computer security;hidden node problem;computer network	Mobile	12.034215068791484	91.83906268412971	23002

This policy takes advantage of mobility in order to reduce the relaying tra c in such a network.

The proposed model captures some of the real characteristics in the wireless cellular environment. The model can adapt to arbitrary cell topologies in which the number of neighboring base stations at different locations may vary. The cell residence time can follow general distributions which captures the fact that the mobile user may spend more time at certain locations than others. The model also incorporates the concept of a trip in which the mobile user may follow a particular path to a destination. For implementation, the decision of location update can be made by a simple table lookup. Numerical results indicate that the proposed model provides a more accurate update boundary in real environment than that derived from a hexagonal cell configuration with random walk movement pattern. The proposed model allows the network to maintain a better balance between the processing incurred due to location update and the radio bandwidth utilized for paging between call arrivals.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);cell (microprocessor);lookup table;paging	Vincent W.

Actual call connection time (ACCT) of a call is investigated, which is the total time a mobile user engaged in communications over a wireless network during a call connection and can be used to design appropriate charging schemes. Our numerical results show that how these measures depend on the new call arrival rate with specific reserved channels for handoff calls in each cell. These results are expected to be useful for the cost analysis for updating location and paging in wireless mobile network.	blocking (computing);numerical analysis;paging;queueing theory;telecommunications network	Wei Wayne Li;Xiuli Chao	2002		10.1145/570758.570776	radio access network;cellular network;mobile identification number;real-time computing;wireless wan;call management;public land mobile network;telecommunications;computer science;cost–benefit analysis;operating system;wireless network;mobile phone signal;call setup success rate;call control;municipal wireless network;mobile station;wi-fi array;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	7.856303657291911	99.30917468121007	23212

In this paper, we propose a novel discrete-time priority queueing network to model SR-ARQ, and study the performance of the resequencing buffer in terms of the mean packet resequencing delay when packets arrive to the network according to a Bernoulli process. Based on the stationary probability distribution of an embedded Markov chain, we derive an explicit expression for the mean packet resequencing delay. Numerical and simulation results of the mean resequencing delay are presented and some performance trends are discussed. This paper presents an analytic framework for accurately computing the mean packet resequencing delay caused by packet retransmission in data communication networks. The proposed discretetime priority queueing network model is expected to be used for performance analysis of ARQ protocols with a more general packet arrival process.	approximation algorithm;automatic repeat request;bernoulli polynomials;bit error rate;communications protocol;encapsulation (networking);markov chain;network model;network packet;queueing theory;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;simulation;stationary process;telecommunications network;transmitter	Jun Li;Yiqiang Q.

A trade-off exists between the costs in location update operations, on one hand, and the additional incurred costs in (position-based) routing due to location errors, on the other hand. In this paper, we develop a stochastic sequential decision framework to analyze this trade-off and provide design guidelines on selecting good location update strategies in practice. Under a Markovian mobility model, the location update decision problem is modeled as a Markovian decision process (MDP). Based on the separable cost structure of the proposed MDP model, we first show that the location update decisions on NU and LU can be independently carried out without loss of optimality. Then we investigate the optimality of simple threshold-based updating rules in NU and LU operations. We finally introduce a model-free learning approach which is practically useful to find a near-optimal solution for the problem.	algorithm;decision problem;hoc (programming language);location-based service;optimization problem;routing;server (computing)	Zhenzhen Ye;Alhussein A.

Our objective is to obtain the feasible region (FR) for the integrated services subjected to their packet level quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The analysis is focused on the upstream channel and the performance of the system is evaluated in terms of voice packet loss probability and the mean data message delay. Two different service classes are provided for voice. The voice packet loss probability is independent of data traffic and an elaborate discrete-time Markov chain model is developed. The data traffic is modeled as a batch Poisson arrival model. Two schemes are considered for data: with or without bandwidth reservation. The integrated voice and data systems are analyzed using the matrix-analytic method.

In this paper, we present a prime based First Come Higher Priority (FCHP) transmission scheduling method for reader collision problems that caused by hidden terminal. FCHP is a simple mechanism for coordinating simultaneous transmissions among multiple readers. A significant improvement of this approach is that FCHP prevents reader collisions by giving contention free scheduling. The second advantage of the proposed technique is that FCHP is adaptive in both static and dynamic RFID environments. The simulation results show that the proposed technique provides superior performance in both static and dynamic instances. The FCHP is shown to be effective in terms of system throughput, system efficiency and easy to implement.	radio-frequency identification;schedule (project management)	Ching-Hsien Hsu;Jong Hyuk Park;Kuan-Ching Li	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-77368-9_58	radio-frequency identification;heuristic;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HCI	9.912255562713892	93.86594403785618	23771
98cf292fcd97cbef6ed4be3aa00be919f485b5ce	novel network coding-based techniques for multi-layer video delivery over multi-hop wireless testbed		The actual performance of video delivery over wireless networks is best captured through experimental studies over real testbed, which is crucial to uncover the technical problems and practical challenges of realizing the proposed video delivery techniques. Network coding (NC) provides a paradigm shift to optimize the network resources for enhancing the video quality as a result of delivery over multi-hop wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for evaluating the performance of NC-based video delivery over multi-hop wireless networks. Based on an experimental testbed implementation of inter-layer video coding and delivery, we propose a new generalized technique for multi-hop interlayer NC in enhancing video delivery quality. We evaluate the trade-off between complexity of multi-hop NC, and video quality gain. We provide clear recommendations for best design choices of NC-based interlayer video coding and delivery over multi-hop wireless mesh network considering link conditions and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The results show that using NC improves the layered video performance in single and multi-hop network. The average number of decoded layers when using NC in single hop outperforms that when using NC in multi-hop.

Unlike conventional RANs, a C-RAN decouples the baseband processing unit (BBU) from the remote radio head (RRH), allowing for centralized operation of BBUs and scalable deployment of light-weight RRHs as small cells. In this work, we argue that the intelligent configuration of the front-haul network between the BBUs and RRHs, is essential in delivering the performance and energy benefits to the RAN and the BBU pool, respectively. We propose FluidNet---a scalable, light-weight framework for realizing the full potential of C-RAN. FluidNet deploys a logically re-configurable front-haul to apply appropriate transmission strategies in different parts of the network and hence cater effectively to both heterogeneous user profiles and dynamic traffic load patterns. FluidNet's algorithms determine configurations that maximize the traffic demand satisfied on the RAN, while simultaneously optimizing the compute resource usage in the BBU pool. We prototype FluidNet on a 6 BBU, 6 RRH WiMAX C-RAN testbed. Prototype evaluations and large-scale simulations reveal that FluidNet's ability to re-configure its front-haul and tailor transmission strategies provides a 50% improvement in satisfying traffic demands, while reducing the compute resource usage in the BBU pool by 50% compared to baseline schemes.	algorithm;baseband;baseline (configuration management);c-ran;centralized computing;cloud computing;cost efficiency;prototype;radio access network;remote radio head;scalability;simulation;software deployment;testbed;user profile	Karthikeyan Sundaresan;Mustafa Y.

In [1] we studied how store carry and forward (SCF) relaying within the cell can be utilized as an underlay message forwarding mechanism to achieve system wide energy savings. In this paper, by deriving optimal routing policies to reduce either the total energy consumption or the total transmit power, we show that the SCF relaying scheme reduces considerably inter-cell interference. We detail the factors affecting the maximum interference reductions, including the delay tolerance of elastic data traffic and flow characteristics of vehicles in the road network which in this case are used as mobile relay nodes.	algorithm;channel capacity;interference (communication);internet backbone;message passing;overhead (computing);relay;requirement;routing	Panayiotis Kolios;Vasilis Friderikos;Katerina Papadaki	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594148	cellular network;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;computer network	Mobile	18.192347234938897	89.85659229971499	23964

It may so happen that in a given set of SLDs, some of the demands are not simultaneous in time, and hence the same network resource could be used to satisfy several demands at different times. In this paper we develop two complementary algorithms-independent sets algorithm (ISA) and time window algorithm (TWA), based on circular arc graph theory, which respectively capture time-disjointness or time-overlap that could exist among SLDs. We compare and evaluate the algorithms based on the number of wavelengths required, number of reused wavelengths, average call acceptance ratio, and the reuse factor. The numerical results obtained from simulation experiments indicate that TWA reuses significant number of wavelengths (reuse factor up to 53%) followed by ISA (reuse factor up to 14%).	algorithm;experiment;graph theory;numerical analysis;routing;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Chava Vijaya Saradhi;Gurusamy Mohan	2005	2nd International Conference on Broadband Networks, 2005.	10.1109/ICBN.2005.1589633	telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;telecommunications service;distributed computing;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Metrics	2.221964955011351	93.27464160695862	24037

The AFEC-SEC aims to reduce the energy consumption in elastic optical network (EON) by adapting dynamically the type of FEC according to the actual lightpath optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). When a demand is solicited, k-shortest paths are selected and the appropriate FEC type is allocated to each one according to the OSNRlimit. Finally, the energy consumption of each k-shortest paths is computed then the lowest among them is selected. The obtained outcomes have been compared with the shortest path (SP) and minimum hops (MH) algorithms. The AFEC-SEC algorithm outperforms SP and MH algorithm in term of energy consumption, blocking probability and energy efficiency.	algorithm;analog front-end;blocking (computing);computer security;erlang (unit);error detection and correction;forward error correction;modified huffman coding;modulation;network performance;shortest path problem;signal-to-noise ratio	S.

Since then, there has been more interest directed towards explicit policy assignment space priority schemes because of their increased efficiency and flexibility over implicit assignment schemes. This paper considers an explicit policy assignment space priority control scheme employing the partial buffer sharing buffer access mechanism. Cell loss probabilities are derived for a traffic model consisting of two source classes. Each source class consists of bursty traffic generated by a multiple number of three-state discrete-time Markov sources. The dependence of cell loss probabilities on traffic load and burstiness characteristics, as well as system parameters such as buffer size and buffer sharing thresholds, is examined. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.	atm turbo;cell (microprocessor);markov chain;markov model;network congestion;quality of service;three-state logic	Chung Gu Kang;Harry H.

We discuss limitations of previously used metrics to measure spatial loss correlation and show that the entropy correlation coefficient, which is based on the mutual information concept of Information Theory, can overcome these limitations. In our experiments, we find that the packet losses among closely located receivers are highly correlated when signal strength is high, but the correlation decreases with decreasing signal strength. The losses become totally independent once the signal strength falls below a threshold. As a first step to model the relationship between spatial loss correlation and signal strength, we find that the relationship can be approximated as a Gaussian cumulative distribution function.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;experiment;information theory;interference (communication);mutual information;network packet;software propagation;streaming simd extensions;transmitter;uncompressed video	Zhe Wang;Mahbub Hassan;Tim Moors	2010	IEEE Local Computer Network Conference	10.1109/LCN.2010.5735774	normal distribution;radio broadcasting;signal strength;entropy;spatial correlation;telecommunications;information theory;cumulative distribution function;wireless network;mutual information;packet loss;correlation;statistics;computer network	Mobile	12.469885878313498	90.28192320391284	24264
6d899e6c35d64206a79f9c8f02f0369f6da384b6	memory matters: bumblebee behavioral models for vehicle-to-vehicle communications		Vehicles forming connected communication networks are routinely challenged with the complex decision problem of either staying with the same wireless channel or moving to a different wireless channel when experiencing highly variable channel quality conditions. In order to obtain a practical solution to this problem, we refer to bumblebee behavioral models, which possess evolved decision-making mechanisms to adaptively solve similar problems while foraging in environments containing multiple floral resources (channels). In order to enable vehicles to adapt to these time-varying channel conditions, we propose in this paper a bumblebee-inspired decision-making algorithm in which channel quality information is stored and updated in vehicle memory. This information is used to estimate qualities of channel options and then weighed against switch costs to determine optimal channel selection. We incorporated our algorithm into a VDSA-based VANET model, while the GEMV2 Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) propagation simulator was used to test its performance under different memory parameters and against existing models. Our results show that a memory system based on the averaging of stored channel information dramatically increased channel selection performance over a memoryless system in both urban and highway scenarios by 52% and 20%, respectively.	algorithm;decision problem;software propagation;telecommunications network;vehicle-to-vehicle	Kuldeep S.

Nowadays there is an increased demand on the QoS requirements and inherently on further optimizing the usage of not only the scarce radio resources but also the overall network performance over the flat IP network more efficiently. Traditional scheduling algorithms are not able to fulfill such complex requirements. In this paper an Optimized Service Aware (OSA) scheduling algorithm is proposed, aiming at addressing the aforementioned challenges. It consists of three main functional units. The paper presents through simulations that the proposed OSA algorithm is able to achieve optimum radio and end user performance. The performance of the OSA is compared against other well-known scheduling algorithms: Weighted Blind-Equal Throughput (w-BET), Weighted Maximum Throughput (w-MaxT), and Weighted Proportional Fair (w-PF).	compaq lte;scheduling (computing)	Nikola Zahariev;Yasir Zaki;Xi Li;Carmelita Görg;Thushara Weerawardane;Andreas Timm-Giel	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30630-3_29	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;radio resource management;lte advanced;operating system;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Crypto	4.341208966978492	96.07945213438165	24511

The algorithm is ideal for high speed networks and is fully compatible with technologies such as ATM and MPLS.	algorithm;wavelet	Claude F. Turner;Rolston M.

443cabd367f8f08f4fb6387f0478ada223d43351	exact secrecy throughput capacity study in mobile ad hoc networks	mobile ad hoc networks;secrecy throughput capacity;physical layer security	Abstract The secrecy throughput capacity (STC) performance study of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is critical for supporting their applications in security-sensitive scenarios. Despite much work on the scaling law results of MANET STC, the exact STC study of such networks remains an open problem. This paper, for the first time, investigates the exact STC of a cell-partitioned MANET with group-based scheduling scheme from the physical layer (PHY) security perspective. We first propose two secure transmission schemes based on the PHY security technology, i.e., secrecy guard zone based and cooperative jamming based schemes. The secrecy guard zone based scheme allows transmissions to be conducted only if no eavesdroppers exist in the secrecy guard zone around transmitters. The cooperative jamming based scheme utilizes non-transmitting nodes to generate artificial noise to suppress eavesdroppers in the same cell, such that transmissions can be conducted only if all eavesdroppers in the transmission range are suppressed. We then derive exact analytical expressions for the STC performance of the concerned network under both secure transmission schemes based on the analysis of two basic secure transmission probabilities. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to corroborate our theoretical analysis and also to illustrate the STC performance of the concerned MANET.	hoc (programming language);throughput	Xiaochen Li;Yuanyu Zhang;Shuangrui Zhao;Yulong Shen;Xiaohong Jiang	2018	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2018.01.012	computer network;throughput;secrecy;mobile ad hoc network;guard (information security);secure transmission;physical layer;distributed computing;scheduling (computing);computer science;phy	Mobile	12.206136977812474	91.968071420594	24671

Compared with current commercially used policies, our scheme can not only guarantee a certain amount of resources to public customers but can also provide immediate access for emergency users and flexibility for providers to adapt to different requirements and operating scenarios. In addition, under the combined preemption and queuing framework, interesting analytical relationships among channel occupancy, gross service time, and success probability for public traffic are revealed. Based on this, guidelines to further improve the satisfaction of public customers can be provided.	hoc (programming language);mesh networking;preemption (computing);requirement;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Jiazhen Zhou;Cory C.

To improve network performance, different rate adaptation algorithms, such as automatic rate fallback (ARF) and receiver-based autorate (RBAR), have been proposed to adapt the data rate according to the current channel quality. Opportunistic auto rate (OAR) protocol is an optimisation for any existing rate adaptation algorithm which leads to a significant performance gain by providing temporal fairness. We analyze the reasons for the high performance gain obtained using OAR, and show that the OAR protocol does not work well for TCP communications in ad-hoc networks where nodes use different data rates to communicate with each other (heterogeneous). Based on these analysis, we propose a congestion reactive opportunistic auto rate (CROAR) protocol, which is a new rate adaption enhancement tailored to improve TCP performance in heterogeneous multi-hop ad-hoc networks. Extensive simulations show that CROAR, compared to OAR and RBAR, produces significant throughput and end-to-end transmission latency improvements while only marginally relaxing temporal fairness	acoustic radiation force;algorithm;data rate units;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;network congestion;network performance;opensimulator;simulation;throughput	Timo Zauner;Luke Haslett;Wen Hu;Sanjay Jha;Cormac J.

The number of the copies gradually increases with the number of retransmissions. Furthermore, for implementation of the DMCR scheme in practical mobile communication system, we also propose a dynamic retransmission scheme by interleaving and a new round-robin scheduling algorithm. We compare our scheme with the previous non-delayed retransmission schemes on the performance of frame loss probability, channel capacity and total transmission time. Numerical results show that the DMCR scheme can achieve higher performance. The effect of the delay time on end-to-end TCP throughput is investigated as well.

It is very useful for capacity planning, routing, operations and management, SLAs, customer reports, etc... But this matrix cannot be measured directly, it would require very costly upgrades of the existing infrastructures. On the contrary SNMP reports give a periodic account on the volume of traffic for each link. The traffic matrix must then be estimated by mathematical methods from the link counts only. This inverse problem is typically ill-posed since the number of OD pairs is much greater than the number of links. One of the existing techniques is Bayesian: it runs Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to simulate the joint distribution of the OD pairs given the link counts. It requires a prior distribution for each OD pair and, most of the time, those priors are arbitrary. A challenging issue would be to train the priors from the only available data, that is to say the link counts themselves. This is exactly what we do in this paper. We prove the validity of our approach on a network on which direct measurements of the OD counts were made available.	algorithm;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;routing;simple network management protocol;simulated annealing;simulation;well-posed problem	Sandrine Vaton;Jean-Sébastien Bedo	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

Specifically, we use the recently developed technique of Lyapunov Optimization to design an online admission control, routing, and resource allocation algorithm for a virtualized data center. This algorithm maximizes a joint utility of the average application throughput and energy costs of the data center. Our approach is adaptive to unpredictable changes in the workload and does not require estimation and prediction of its statistics.	algorithm;data center;estimation theory;heterogeneous computing;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;power management;provisioning;routing;throughput	Rahul Urgaonkar;Ulas C.

This problem can be solved with the limitation mechanism, however, only if properly configured. When the limitation mechanism is badly configured or the network conditions change rapidly the mechanism does not help, and sometimes, it can even exacerbate the problem. This paper shows that it is possible and more efficient to provide dynamic limitations, where the admission limit is not static, but dynamically calculated. It is shown that the proposed mechanism provides better results and is more robust. Also, the issue with configuration is diminished, since the mechanism automatically adapts to the current network congestion level.	central processing unit;control flow;elegant degradation;network congestion;robustness (computer science);router (computing)	Robert Wójcik;Damian Garbacz;Andrzej Jajszczyk	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6654914	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;ip forwarding;computer network	Robotics	-3.5757286183009303	94.37616515540702	25528

Quality-of-service (QoS) support is an important challenging issue of OBS networks, and a number of schemes have been proposed. However, the existing schemes have some limitations, such as QoS performance degradation, low wavelength utilization, and high implemental complexity. This paper proposes a bufferless preemption-based channel scheduling algorithm for service differentiation in OBS networks, which combines a preemption channel selection algorithm and a channel partitioning algorithm. The proposed preemption channel selection algorithm minimizes the length of preempted bursts to improve channel efficiency, and the channel partitioning algorithm controls the degree of service differentiation between service classes with low implemental complexity. An analytical model is derived and simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance. The results showed that the proposed scheme can improve channel efficiency and effectively provide controllable service differentiation for multi-class traffic in terms of the burst blocking probability and end-to-end throughput.	algorithm;differentiated service;optical burst switching;preemption (computing);scheduling (computing)	Byung-Chul Kim;Sung-Hyup Lee;Young-Soo Choi;You Ze Cho	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2006.02.019	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Metrics	1.1197947679772602	101.80560559635605	25591

It is shown that the RF coverage footprint shrinks due to high-speed data, which can be compensated by introducing delays. The queuing theory is used to quantify the delay, where the incoming data forms a queue in a buffer and waits for radio transmission. This delay, which is a function of the bit rate, is used to compensate the deficit in the link budget. Consequently, the RF coverage foot print remains the same for all bit rates.	queue (abstract data type);queueing theory;radio frequency;waits	Saleh Faruque	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology	10.1109/EIT.2008.4554314	traffic engineering;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;queueing theory;queuing delay;computer network	Embedded	6.859126056891343	96.29436156205578	25680

Quality of VoIP calls, usually given by R-score, is studied with respect to delay and loss of packets. We observe that loss is more sensitive than delay, hence we trade delay for loss. We propose a combination of techniques that exploit the flexibility of the WiMax MAC layer to strike a balance between loss and delay. These techniques are forward error correction, automatic repeat request, MPDU aggregation, and minislot allocation. Simulation experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed mechanisms. We assume a three-state Markovian channel model and study the performance with and without retransmissions. We show that the feedback-based technique coupled with retransmissions, aggregation, and variable length MPDUs are effective and increases the R-score by about 40%.	access control;automatic repeat request;channel (communications);error detection and correction;experiment;forward error correction;simulation;three-state logic	Shamik Sengupta;Mainak Chatterjee;Samrat Ganguly;Rauf Izmailov	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.254816	wimax;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;feedback;forward error correction;automatic repeat request;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	Robotics	7.326723740975365	95.17919264850411	25759

We investigate the possibilities and limitations of feedback control in the IEEE 802.15.4 specification and state the problem of scheduling when the controller both utilizes the contention-based and guaranteed parts of the protocol. We propose and compare a number of scheduler-controller codesign algorithms that take both the contention-based and guaranteed parts of the protocol into account using an approximation to an infinite horizon linear quadratic cost function. The simulation studies show that a careful codesign of the scheduler-controller results in significant performance gains, when using both online and offline scheduling policies.	algebraic riccati equation;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;broadcast delay;communications protocol;computational complexity theory;computers, freedom and privacy conference;dynamic programming;emoticon;feedback;johnson–nyquist noise;loss function;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;online and offline;optimal control;rewriting;scheduling (computing);simulation;time-invariant system	Edwin G.

In iCAR, hand-offs can occur not only from a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) to another BTS, but also from a BTS to a so-called Ad hoc Relaying Station (ARS) in the form of relaying, as well as from an ARS back to a BTS. The latter two types of hand-offs effectively increase the hand-off buffer time and thus reduce the call dropping probability. We develop an analytical model for the hand-off performance in iCAR. In addition, we verify the analytical model via simulations and quantify the hand-off performance benefits of the iCAR system over conventional cellular systems. It is anticipated that the analytical and simulation models reported in this paper will serve as a guideline to other researches on the inter-system hand-off involving heterogenous wireless technologies.	bandwidth management;broadcast television systems inc.;hoc (programming language);simulation;throughput;time complexity;transceiver	Hongyi Wu;Swades De;Chunming Qiao;Evsen Yanmaz;Ozan K.

The combined input and output queued (CiOQ) switching has been shown to be a promising solution to meet such demand. However, many of the proposed scheduling algorithms fo r a CIOQ switch cannot be practically implemented due to problems from scalability and complexity. This paper shows how the virtual t ime reference system ( V T R S ) proposed in [15] can be applied to packet scheduling in a CIOQ switch. The V T R S is a unifying scheduling framework to provide scalable support f o r guaranteed services. i n the context of packet scheduling fo r a CIOQ switch, we show that the use of V T R S can eliminates both the scalabili t y and complexity problems associated with many of the scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature. More important, we show that in term of of providing end-toend guaranteed service, packet scheduling using V T R S for a CIOQ switch has the same performance as an output queued (OQ) switch employing weighted fair queueing (WFQ) scheduler.	algorithm;fair queuing;input/output;network packet;quality of service;scalability;scheduling (computing);weighted fair queueing	Yiwei Thomas Hou;Zhi-Li Zhang;Takeo Hamada	2000		10.1109/PADSW.2000.884564	weighted fair queueing;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;operating system;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Networks	-1.0081889820435075	95.760845877956	26052

The capacity of a CDMA system is con ned by interference of users from both inside and outside of the target cell. Earlier algorithms for call admission control is based on the e ective traÆc load for the target cell if one call is accepted. These algorithms ignore the interference e ect of the to-be-accepted call on the neighboring cells. In our algorithms, the call admission decision is based on the e ective traÆc loads for both the target cell and the neighboring cells. In addition, to prioritize hando calls, we also introduce the idea of soft guard channel, which reserves some traÆc load exclusively for hando calls. Stochastic reward net (SRN) models are constructed to compare the performance of the algorithms. The numerical results show that our algorithms can signi cantly reduce the dropped calls with a price of increasing the blocked calls. To show the potential gain due to our algorithms, we introduce two new metrics: the increased blocking ratio for our algorithms and the increased dropping ratio for the conventional algorithms. From the numerical results, it is shown that our algorithms can reduce the dropped calls signi cantly while the blocked calls are increased at a relatively small rate under both homogeneous and hot spot traÆc loads.	algorithm;blocking (computing);common access card;downtime;erlang (unit);interference (communication);naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;numerical analysis;recurrent neural network	Yue Ma;James J.

This results in its inefficient usage. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a recent paradigm which aims at addressing this inefficiency. It allows unlicensed users to opportunistically access vacant licensed frequency bands, as long as any harmful interference to incumbent users is avoided. In this context, providing appropriate medium access control (MAC) protocols is a core issue. However, the existing proposals omit relevant issues, are too complex, or are based on unrealistic assumptions in practical terms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and analyze, through simulation, what we intend to be a really practical CR MAC protocol for distributed (i.e., ad-hoc) multi-hop CR scenarios, with high variability in terms of the availability of vacant frequency bands in time and space. Evaluation results confirm that the proposed approach, designated as CoSBT MAC, can result in relevant benefits.	cognitive radio	José Marinho;Edmundo Monteiro	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30630-3_16	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	HCI	19.5472016340091	92.29541789475942	26335

In this paper we investigate its enhancement based on the use of physical-layer network coding and signature coding, whose main feature is enabling simultaneous resolution of up to K users contending for access, where K ≥ 1. We optimise the slot access probability such that the expected throughput is maximised. In particular, the slot access probability is chosen in line with an estimate of the number of users in the system that is obtained relying on the pseudo-Bayesian approach by Rivest, which we generalise for the case that K > 1. Under the assumption that this estimate reflects the actual number of users, we show that our approach achieves throughput 1 in the limit of large K.	linear network coding;throughput	Jasper Goseling;Cedomir Stefanovic;Petar Popovski	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247490	throughput;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;random access;encoding;computer network	Robotics	9.100828573433503	94.18098247326803	26350

Channel assignment, which directly determines the efficiency of the frequency utilization, is the critical part of multi-channel schemes. Current 802.11-like schemes of multi-channel MAC do not efficiently use the multiple channels due to the overhead caused by channel assignment. Moreover, the control channel saturation problem limits the number of channels of these previous schemes. In this paper, we propose a new scheme called SAM-MAC (Self-Adjustable Multi-channel MAC), which features with one common channel and two half-duplex transceivers for each node. A method called self-adjustment is used to reassign the channels and balance the traffic on different channels. Due to less contention in common channel and smaller channel assignment overhead, this scheme increases the throughput compared with previous approaches. Control channels are free from saturation problem and can furthermore be used for data transmission.	algorithm;duplex (telecommunications);fairness measure;hoc (programming language);multiply–accumulate operation;overhead (computing);throughput;transceiver	Rongsheng Huang;Hongqiang Zhai;Chi Zhang;Yuguang Fang	2007		10.1145/1577222.1577272	vehicular ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.172971533641093	90.78134460534511	26355

Both are significant because they are dependent on the long propagation path of the satellite link. The former is intrinsic and due to radio wave propagation over the satellite channel for both TCP packets and acknowledgements. It is regulated by the control loop that governs TCP. The latter is due to the control loop that governs the demand assignment multiple access (DAMA) signalling exchange between satellite terminals and the network control center, necessary to manage return link resources. DAMA is adopted in DVB-RCS standard to achieve flexible and efficient use of the shared resources. Therefore, performance of TCP over DVB-RCS may degrade due to the exploitation of two nested control loops also depending on both the selected DAMA algorithm and the traffic profile. This paper analyses the impact of basic DAMA implementation on TCP-based applications over a DVB-RCS link for a large set of study cases. To provide a detailed overview of TCP performance in DVBRCS environment, the analysis includes both theoretical approach and simulation campaign.

In this paper, we present a novel multi-class, subadaptation module for forced vertical handoffs. We discuss added arguments required by the multi-class setting, and show the flexibility of our model through its capability to meet different objectives for different service providers.	mobile computing;network congestion;radio resource management;requirement;variometer	Abd-Elhamid M.

The allocation of coding rates amongst flows/users is constrained by network capacity. We propose a proportional fair transmission scheme that maximises the sum utility of flow throughputs. This is achieved by jointly optimising the packet coding rates and the allocation of bits of coded packets across transmission slots.	binary erasure channel;multi-user;network packet;proportionally fair;unicast	Premkumar Karumbu;Xiaomin Chen;Douglas J.

Relying on the spectrum sensing, ongoing licensed operation must not be compromised and the secondary spectrum usage efficiency should be maintained. Thus, it is critical to ensure that the confidence level of the estimated signal status satisfies the primary user’s requirement, whilst keeping the delay and computational complexity to a minimum. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison in terms of performance, reliability and complexity of stand alone sensing schemes for various cognitive radio application areas. We first give some new results on reliability performance, and then evaluate the sensing time required to achieve the target performance. Finally, we compare the computational complexity of various sensing approaches by calculating the number of arithmetic operations required by each approach.	cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;frequency band;requirement;simulation;system requirements;while	Xing Liu;Barry G.

To realize ubiquitous computing, supporting seamless mobility ensures continuous services during inter-networking movement without meddling users. For seamless mobility in a heterogeneous networking environment, an adequate service/network configuration is necessary in accordance with the given environment. We developed the middleware, assisting to decrease human effort for application implementation and to guarantee interoperability for effective sustaining. A protocol of QoS (quality of service) NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol) with advance resource reservation is modeled during the development process; furthermore, the protocol verification prior to be implemented ensures the correctness of the protocol and additionally reduces risks from ambiguous designs.

New applications of vehicular networks are also emerging at the same time. Predicting vehicular staying time is vital to both solving the vehicular system problem and building efficient vehicular networking. How much the vehicular staying duration of visits to different areas can be predicted is still an open and unsolved problem. In this paper, we use real vehicular traces in Beijing and Shanghai to explore the limit of predictability of the vehicular visiting time in different areas in large cities, and we analyze the impact of different precision and slot time on predictability. We conclude that using a proper time slot is an efficient way of prediction, and a higher predictability can be achieved if the requirement for precision is reduced. Among all the cases that we studied, we find the predictability to be 76.3% for Beijing and 82.5% for Shanghai in the case with the smallest slot time and reasonable requirements for precision.	algorithm;communications protocol;data mining;kalman filter;network congestion;predictive modelling;requirement;software deployment;system deployment;telecommunications network;time complexity;tracing (software)	Yong Li;Wenyu Ren;Depeng Jin;Pan Hui;Lieguang Zeng;Dapeng Wu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2013.2271320	simulation;transport engineering;vehicular communication systems;computer security	Mobile	4.147498835092928	88.98378443820802	26892

A massive deployment of connected devices is power hungry. Maximizing the energy efficiency of their batteries reduces the maintenance cost and extends their autonomy and then their utility. To address this issue, this paper proposes the introduction of index modulation on single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) uplink transmissions for cellular IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) networks. It is shown that the proposed SC-FDMA with index modulation (SC-FDMA-IM) scheme achieves 50% of energy efficiency increase, while improving the bit error rate performance by up to 3.5 dB of Eb/N0 for the same spectral efficiency performance. However peak-to average power ratio (PAPR) performance are decreased, and PAPR reduction techniques have to be used for this scheme.

The current state of spectrum allocation indicates that almost all usable frequencies have already been occupied. This makes one pessimistic about the feasibility of integrating emerging wireless services such as large-scale sensor networks into the existing communication infrastructure. Cognitive Radio is the emerging dynamic spectrum access technology to achieve open spectrum sharing flexibly and efficiently. It is an intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its radio environment and is capable of adapting its operation to statistical variations of the radio frequency. Ad-hoc networks in terms of cognitive radio rely on a common control channel (CCC) for operation. Control signals are used to enable cooperation communicate through a common control channel. However, common control channel may not be always available in an open spectrum allocation scheme due to interference and coexistence with primary systems (PS) of the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel common control channel selection protocol (DCP-CCC) in a distributed way based on appearance patterns of PS and connectivity among nodes. Using simulation results, we evaluate the performance of the proposed CCC selection scheme.	algorithm;assistive technology;channel (communications);coexist (image);cognitive radio;frequency allocation;hoc (programming language);interconnection;interference (communication);network topology;performance;radio frequency;simulation;time complexity	Mi-Ryeong Kim;Sang-Jo Yoo	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications	10.1109/WiMob.2009.46	wireless ad hoc network;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	19.731075596278586	91.83789842290228	27075

The proposed mechanism provides the network administrator with the ability to configure the buffer size of a SIP server to a moderately high value without causing the server crash due to retransmissions. A new field on the SIP request line is introduced to identify an incoming SIP request is a new arrival or retransmission without parsing its content completely. Numerical experiments using our analysis tool show that the proposed scheduling mechanism provides significantly and consistently better scalability at high buffer sizes compared to the conventional first-in-first-out scheduling. The proof of concept implementation in the JAIN-SIP stack demonstrates the superiority of the proposed solution using the realistic scenarios.	experiment;function overloading;numerical method;parsing;retransmission (data networks);sipp memory;scalability;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Demir Y.

In this paper, we first demonstrate that a severe throughput imbalance occurs between downlink TCP flows even in the simplest of multi-cell WLANs via simulation and real world experiments; then, to solve this unfairness problem, we derive an analytical model that describes the interaction between TCP flows at the MAC layer, and formulate a throughput allocation problem as a nonlinear optimization problem subject to certain fairness requirements. Our formulation considers real world complexity such as hidden terminals, packet transmission retry limit, and the unique characteristics of TCP traffic. Solving our optimization problem yields the optimal MAC layer contention window settings that can lead each TCP flow to its target end-to-end throughput without the need for any per-flow queuing nor modification of the TCP sender. Simulation results show that our approach can achieve a fair allocation on the end-to-end throughput and attest to the accuracy of our proposed method.	mathematical optimization	Ka-Lok Hung;Brahim Bensaou	2011	Perform.

To accommodate such service requirements, a cost efficient and flexible network architecture considering different service types is desired. The adoption of C-RAN can reduce infrastructure costs especially for dense deployments while at the same time centralize and hence optimize certain operations related with the control and data plane of the associated cells. This paper investigates such C-RAN approach in the context of TDD networks enabling a cell-less experience for users residing within overlapping areas. In particular, users are allowed to utilize selected sub-frames from different cells forming, in this way, a customized cell-less frame in a flexible manner. A queueing model and analysis is provided for optimizing power control and delay targets. A simulation study shows that our cell-less proposal significantly advances the state of the art both in terms of application and system performance.	c-ran;centralisation;cost efficiency;forwarding plane;network architecture;quality of service;queueing theory;requirement;simulation;test-driven development	Vincenzo Sciancalepore;Konstantinos Samdanis;Rudraksh Shrivastava;Adlen Ksentini;Xavier Pérez Costa	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794957	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Arch	22.586893913659935	89.34379141645525	27338

be1a5a83ea2678d83c7248022123e53339767799	software-defined vehicular networks with caching and computing for delay-tolerant data traffic		With the explosion in the number of connected devices and Internet of Things (IoT) services in smart city, the challenges to meet the demands from both data traffic delivery and information processing are increasingly prominent. Meanwhile, the connected vehicle networks have become an essential part in smart city, bringing massive data traffic as well as significant networking, caching and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle network architecture, mitigating the network congestion with the joint optimization of networking, caching and computing. Cloud computing at the data centers as well as mobile edge computing (MEC) at the evolved node Bs (eNodeBs) and on-board units (OBUs) are taken as the paradigms to provide caching and computing resources. The programmable control principle originated from software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm has been introduced to facilitate the system architecture and resource integration. With the careful modeling of the services, the vehicle mobility and the system state, a joint resource management scheme is proposed and formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to minimize system cost, which consists of both network overhead and execution time of computing tasks. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing schemes.	cache (computing);cloud computing;computation;connected car;data center;edge computing;information processing;internet of things;markov chain;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network congestion;network packet;on-board data handling;overhead (computing);partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;programming paradigm;queueing theory;run time (program lifecycle phase);serial digital video out;server (computing);simulation;smart city;software deployment;software-defined networking;systems architecture	Meng Li;Fei Richard Yu;Pengbo Si;Haipeng Yao;Yanhua Zhang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422823	smart city;computer network;vehicular ad hoc network;systems architecture;network congestion;network architecture;mobile edge computing;cloud computing;server;computer science	HPC	21.069604885343537	94.70508179055382	27386

One often needs to decide how much rate oscillation the service can tolerate to obtain a higher average rate. Service satisfaction for each user is quantified by an increasing and concave utility function of instantaneous transmission rate. It is capable of facilitating the resource allocation with flexible combinations of average rate and rate oscillation. Particularly, we are interested in maximizing the time-average aggregate utility by scheduling user transmissions in a time-shared wireless network. A resource allocation policy is developed, namely, time sharing (TS), to exploit the concavity of utility function and the fluctuation of channel gain. This is formulated as a constrained convex optimization problem. Our analysis shows that in the TS policy the optimal scheduler allows multiple users with relatively better channel conditions to share a same time frame in an adaptive time-division manner. In addition, the more concave the utility function is, the higher the probability of time frame sharing is. An extension to quantized time sharing with limited channel feedback (QTSL) for practical systems is all studied. Simulation results show that, two to three bits of channel state information (CSI) are sufficient for the performance of QTSL scheme to approach that of the optimal TS policy when the number of time slots in a time frame is not less than the number of users, especially, in high SNR region.	aggregate data;channel state information;concave function;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;max;multi-user;optimization problem;quantum fluctuation;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time-sharing;utility	Xiaolu Zhang;Meixia Tao;Chun Sum Ng	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.753	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;convex optimization;computer science;operating system;wireless network	Mobile	17.72437932929994	96.30446197001005	27402

Although the capacity of CDMA systems is interference-limited in nature, channel shortages may occur because soft handoff uses several channels simultaneously. To cope with this problem, we propose an improved handoff method that borrows channels from stationary calls participating in soft handoff and allocates the borrowed channels to handoff requests by moving calls when a channel shortage occurs. Borrowing from stationary calls is possible because these calls do not undergo fast-fading and do not require receiver diversity. The proposed method is designed to avoid increased interference resulting from channel borrowing. The proposed channel-borrowing handoff scheme is analyzed in a situation involving both moving and stationary calls. A comparison is made between the performances of the typical IS-95-based handoff scheme and the proposed scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is better than the IS-95 scheme in view of the handoff refused probability, the handoff queuing delay, and total interference.	interference (communication);performance;profiling (computer programming);queuing delay;stationary process	Dong-Jun Lee;Dong-Ho Cho	2000	IEEE Trans.

Most of scheduling algorithms are graph-based, dependent on the exact network topology information and cannot adapt to the dynamic wireless environment. Some topology-independent TDMA scheduling algorithms have been proposed, and do not need accurate topology information. Our proposed algorithm follows a similar approach but with a different design strategy. Instead of minimizing the TDMA frame length, we maximize the minimum expected throughput, and we consider multicasting and broadcasting. The simulation result shows that the performance of our algorithm is better than the conventional TDMA and other existing algorithms in most cases.	algorithm;hop;multicast;network topology;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Qiong Sun;Victor O.

When a packet delay deadline is not met we say that it is clipped, The quality of a real-time session is measured by the individual packet loss and by the average packet gap. We model the aggregated packet arrival process of a real-time session to the access node by a Markov modulated point processes. A new session will be accepted at a network access point if the quality of all sessions already in progress can be guaranteed as negotiated at call set up time and if the node can provide an adequate service to the new user. We show that there exists a switching surface for the optimum admission policy and that the admission decision can be based on the session arrival rates if two conjectures on the stochastic ordering properties of Markov modulated processes hold. The conjectures are satisfied for Poisson processes.	access network;buffer overflow;markov chain;modulation;network access point;network packet;packet analyzer;real-time clock;real-time transcription;uptime;wireless access point	Josep M.

The model predicts the congestion window evolution, throughput and packet loss rate of sustained TCP flows. In other TCP models, packet loss is regarded as exogenous random process. While such assumption is valid in wireless networks, in the wired networks the packet losses are actually the result of network congestion. In this regard, the packet loss rate, the window evolution and throughput of a TCP connection are determined by the bandwidth, delay, buffer size of the underlying network path, the transmitted packet size and number of concurrent TCP flows. We derive formulas to express the TCP congestion window evolution, throughput and packet loss rate as functions of these parameters. The results are verified with simulations and compared with prior works in this area.	algorithm;network congestion;network packet;serial experiments lain;simulation;stochastic process;tcp congestion control;throughput	Jiang Wu;Hosam El-Ocla	2004	Proceedings. 2004 12th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICON 2004) (IEEE Cat.

f8c038c79cd27c50c8e0beeafada98949a0f0c22	optimal virtual network embedding based on artificial bee colony	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	As one of the key challenges in network virtualization, the problem of virtual network embedding has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this problem, it needs to embed virtual networks with both node and link demands into a shared physical network. The main goal of this problem is to embed more virtual networks to gain more revenue. However, the prior approaches still suffer from low performance and await to be further optimized in terms of this goal. In this paper, we design an artificial bee colony-based virtual network embedding algorithm, called VNE-ABC, to solve this problem. The core idea of this algorithm is to leverage the iterations and intelligence of artificial bee colony to achieve a more optimal solution for virtual network embedding. Through simulations, we show that our proposed algorithm gains about 35.4% more revenue than the existing algorithm.		Xu Liu;Zhongbao Zhang;Ximing Li;Sen Su	2016	EURASIP J.

ba2352dc83b7a6af56a1cdc2f9b5b8a327429551	controlling packet loss of bursty and correlated traffics in a variant of multiple vacation policy		This paper presents a finite-buffer single server queue where packets arrive according to a batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP). Partial batch acceptance strategy has been analyzed in which the incoming packets of a batch are allowed to enter the buffer as long as there is space. When the buffer is full, remaining packets of a batch are discarded. The server serves till system is emptied and after that it takes a maximum H number of vacations until it either finds at least one packet in the queue or the server has exhaustively taken all the vacations. We obtain some important performance measures such as probability of blocking for the first-, an arbitrary- and the last-packet of a batch, mean queue lengths and mean waiting time of packet. The burstiness of the correlated traffic influences the probability of packet loss which makes buffer management to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.		Abhijit Datta Banik;Sujit K.

In recent years, dominant trend of development in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) technology makes VoIP services more appealing. However, it is still quite challenging to ensure quality voice communication in MANET. Some of these challenges include packet loss due to network congestion, and variable packet latency. Not only traditional single-path ad-hoc routing but also traditional voice codec fails to perform well under these conditions. In this paper, we depict a framework for VoIP over multipath multihop wireless network, in which we propose multipath ad-hoc routing and traffic allocation approach.	codec;hoc (programming language);multipath propagation;network congestion;network packet;routing;speech coding;wireless router	Binod Vaidya;Nak Yong Ko;Soon-Suck Jarng;Seung Jo Han	2008		10.1145/1352793.1352904	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;multipath routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;voice over ip;packet loss;network congestion;computer network	Mobile	-1.4510080332464563	89.43881602321805	27870

When mobile hosts move from one cell to another cell. to provide uninterrupted service. the new cell should have enough channels to sup­ pan the ongoing communication of the mobile hosts that moved into the cell. If channels are statically allocated. as is the case in current cellular networks. a cell may run out of channels when large number of mobile hosts move to a cell. thus degrading the quality of service. To over­ come this problem. dynamic channel allocation approaches have been proposed. Under dynamic channel allocation. channels are allocated to cells on demand. thus increasing channel utilization and hence improving the quality of ser­ vice. Such channel allocation approaches fall under two categories. namely. centralized and distributed. Central­ ized approaches are neither scalable nor reliable. while dis­ lributed approaches have the potential to be both reliable and scalable. In this paper, we present a distributed dy­ namic channel allocation scheme for cellular networks that is fault tolerant. Our approach can tolerate the failure of mobile nodes as well as static nodes and enhance the qual­ ity of service by making efficient reuse of channels.	algorithm;centralized computing;fault tolerance;interference (communication);memory management;mobile phone;quality of service;scalability;throughput	Jianchang Yang;D.

Each station dynamically controls its contention window (CW) size by monitoring the mean number of idle slots between transmission attempts. In general this quantity is subject to estimation error that is related to the number of transmissions, M, over which it is measured. Previous works in IS assumed all stations use similar CW sizes to contend the channel; an assumption that is not always valid in reality. Therefore, this paper studies the behaviour of the scheme when stations have different CW sizes. An analysis shows that bias caused by the additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm used to control the CW sizes, combined with varying lengths of M can cause a fairness problem. Two classes of stations develop, with the first class gaining most of the channel bandwidth while the second class stays idle.	algorithm;british undergraduate degree classification;fairness measure;first-class function;increment and decrement operators;instability;maximum throughput scheduling;throughput;utility functions on indivisible goods	Wan Hafiza Wan Hassan;Horace King;Shabbir Ahmed;Michael Faulkner	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2463821	probability distribution;database index;throughput;probability density function;real-time computing;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;accuracy and precision;is;statistics;computer network	Metrics	6.27987792934531	100.22513351112474	28041

They readily model the multi-service, multi-resource nature of call admission control (CAC) schemes for such systems, including service prioritization via the use of resource reservation. Third generation wireless networks (3G) are incredibly complex with regard to system resources and supported services. In particular, the 3G radio environment is subject to interference and fading. Recognizing that communications systems are engineered to a nominal “time consistent busy hour”, we seek a method for capturing the behavior of the 3G radio environment over such a time period, and incorporating it into a modified loss model for determining capacity. We present a novel methodology to derive environmental parameters that can be used to characterize the radio environment as it affects individual cells in the network. Consequently we have developed a 3G radio access network (RAN) and transport network (TN) dimensioning tool for Telstra that, on a per cell and hourly basis, estimates spare capacity based on target grades of service (GoS). These incorporate loss probabilities for all services, and throughput requirements for high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) services. This integrated network management tool calculates each resource's utilization at various envelope boundary points to determine the active resource constraints, thereby allowing Telstra engineers to most effectively apply capacity expansions to the RAN & TN.	circuit switching;common access card;industrial engineering;interference (communication);network packet;radio access network;requirement;telecommunications link;telephone number;throughput;time consistency;twisted nematic field effect	Bruce S.

2f6ff096f6e2687b9828053b8f2659353186c9bd	software-defined network controlled switching between millimeter wave and terahertz small cells		Small cells are a cost-effective way to reliably expand network coverage and provide significantly increased capacity for end users. The ultra-high bandwidth available at millimeter (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) frequencies can effectively realize short-range wireless access links in small cells enabling potential uses cases such as driver-less cars, data backhauling and ultra-high-definition infotainment services. This paper describes a new software defined network (SDN) framework for vehicles equipped with transceivers capable of dynamically switching between THz and mmWave bands. We present a novel SDN controlled admission policy that preferentially handoffs between the mmWave and THz small cells, accommodates asymmetric uplink/downlink traffic, performs error recovery and handles distinct link states that arise due to motion along practical vehicular paths. We then analytically derive the resulting capacity of such a small cell network by accounting for the channel characteristics unique to both these spectrum bands, relative distance and the contact times between a given transceiver pair. We then formulate the optimal procedure for scheduling multiple vehicles at a given infrastructure tower, with regards to practical road congestion scenarios. The search for the optimal schedule is shown to be a NP-hard problem. Hence, we design a computationally-feasible polynomial-time scheduling algorithm that runs at the SDN controller and compare its performance against the optimal procedure and random access. Additionally, we present a simulation-based case study for the use case of data center backhauling in Boston city to showcase the benefits of our approach.	algorithm;autonomous car;backhaul (telecommunications);data center;hdmi;intel terahertz;np-hardness;network congestion;polynomial;random access;scheduling (computing);simulation;software-defined networking;telecommunications link;time complexity;transceiver	Angela Sara Cacciapuoti;Subramanian Ramanathan;Kaushik R.

The improvement in throughput comes however at the expense of an increase in the variability of the service rate received over time. While the larger variability only has a limited impact on delay-tolerant data transfers, it does severely affect delay-sensitive applications. In order to examine the merits of channel-aware scheduling for the latter users, we consider a wireless system supporting a combination of streaming and elastic traffic. We first examine a scenario with rate-adaptive streaming traffic, and analyze the flow-level performance in terms of transfer delays and user throughputs for various canonical resource sharing schemes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the analytical results yield remarkably accurate estimates, and indicate that channel-aware scheduling achieves significant performance gains. Next we investigate a scenario where the streaming sources have an intrinsic rate profile and stringent delay requirements. In that case, channel-aware scheduling yields only modest performance gains, and may even be harmful.	clock rate;experiment;heart rate variability;marginal model;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media;telecommunications link;throughput	Sem C.

This paper presents a novel 2D reservation scheme for WLANs; a general prediction technique based both on the analysis of cell stay time (CST) and on the direction probabilities of hand-in and hand-out events of mobile nodes from wireless cells is outlined. In particular, a threshold-based algorithm is presented, trying to take into account the mobility behavior of mobile users, through the analysis of a hand-off directional probabilities (HDP) matrix. Users' mobility has been analyzed, in order to reduce passive resource reservations, with a high gain in system utilization. In particular, an integrated architecture able to make active and passive reservations has been employed as a possible application of the proposed approach. The performances of the 2D wireless system have been evaluated in terms of prediction error and system utilization; in addition, some comparisons with older prediction schemes have been made.	algorithm;computer science tripos;computer simulation;emoticon;matrix analysis;performance;subject matter expert turing test;wireless access point	Floriano De Rango;Peppino Fazio;Salvatore Marano	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.587	probability distribution;communications protocol;real-time computing;index term;telecommunications;computer science;base station;mean squared prediction error;probability;predictive modelling;mobility model;bandwidth;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.525051807148318	99.49049193958973	28254

Before sending data, each sender must check whether the medium is available. However, asymmetric detection and collision-avoidance mechanisms create transmission starvation problems. Hence, this paper addresses starvation problems to improve the quality of service in multihop wireless networks by adapting the transmission power range and carrier-sense threshold to alleviate starvation problems and to improve system performance. The problem is modelled as a mathematical formulation, and a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) approach is applied to obtain the approximation solution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by applying it to several simulated starvation-avoidance routing problems. The results show that the proposed algorithm can near-optimally solve these problems, with an average lower bound–upper bound gap of 12.4%.	access control;algorithm;approximation;effective method;end-to-end principle;entry sequenced data set;heuristic (computer science);lr parser;lagrangian relaxation;lattice boltzmann methods;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;molecular dynamics;quality of service;routing;starvation (computer science);undefined behavior	Shih-Yao Chen;Frank Yeong-Sung Lin;Yean-Fu Wen;Chiu-Han Hsiao	2018	2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2018.00062	computer network;computer science;media access control;wireless sensor network;distributed computing;distributed coordination function;wireless network;quality of service;spread spectrum;lagrangian relaxation;communication source	Mobile	8.076146812382081	91.66310444095231	28309

The collision resolution protocol within the system is based on a modification of the window random access algorithm, which has superior properties compared to the conventional slotted Aloha. The proposed algorithm, which we call packet reservation window multiple access (PRWMA), works in distinct modes for voice and data without prioritization, and the user performs slightly different operations depending on the information type. Simulation results show that PRWMA outperforms PRMA by a significant margin in terms of voice user capacity.	algorithm;hash table;network packet;random access;simulation	Devrim Emrah Ayyildiz;Hakan Deliç	2003	Wireless Networks	10.1023/A:1025952301054	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;random access;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	8.00079234944228	94.42879638785891	28534
2bcfcbfe9e6a94ce1b1e483c39ec495acd90d750	idle sense: an optimal access method for high throughput and fairness in rate diverse wireless lans	wireless lans;802.11;access methods;fairness	We consider wireless LANs such as IEEE 802.11 operating in the unlicensed radio spectrum. While their nominal bit rates have increased considerably, the MAC layer remains practically unchanged despite much research effort spent on improving its performance. We observe that most proposals for tuning the access method focus on a single aspect and disregard others. Our objective is to define an access method optimized for throughput and fairness, able to dynamically adapt to physical channel conditions, to operate near optimum for a wide range of error rates, and to provide equal time shares when hosts use different bit rates.We propose a novel access method derived from 802.11 DCF [2] (Distributed Coordination Function) in which all hosts use similar values of the contention window CW to benefit from good short-term access fairness. We call our method Idle Sense, because each host observes the mean number of idle slots between transmission attempts to dynamically control its contention window. Unlike other proposals, Idle Sense enables each host to estimate its frame error rate, which can be used for switching to the right bit rate. We present simulations showing how the method leads to high throughput, low collision overhead, and low delay. The method also features fast reactivity and time-fair channel allocation.	design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput	Martin Heusse;Franck Rousseau;Romaric Guillier;Andrzej Duda	2005		10.1145/1080091.1080107	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;access method;computer network	Networks	7.841030335394963	92.93259025723812	28569

We prove that the maximal protocol capacity can be achieved at an optimal operating point with the medium idle probability of e-√2/T*c, where T*c is the duration of collision time in terms of slot unit. Our results indicate that the optimal operating point is independent of the number of stations and throughput ratio among ACs, which means the proposed analytical results still hold even when throughput ratio and station number are time-varying. Further, we show that the maximal protocol capacity can be achieved in saturated cases by properly choosing the protocol parameters. We present a parameter configuration algorithm to achieve both efficient channel utilization and proportional fairness in IEEE 802.11e EDCA networks. Extensive simulation and analytical results are presented to verify the proposed ideas.	fairness measure;throughput	Wei Zhang;Jun Sun;Xinbing Wang	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.2.653	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;equity	Visualization	2.5416229624504982	101.93971226807992	28747
43197ecd74fef9504bc8bfebd8a13d014b00bba8	improving sctp performance by jitter-based congestion control over wired-wireless networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;wireless network;congestion control;communications engineering networks	With the advances of wireless communication technologies, wireless networks gradually become themost adopted communication networks in the new generation Internet. Computing devices and mobile devices may be equipped with multiple wired and/or wireless network interfaces. Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) has been proposed for reliable data transport and its multihoming feature makes use of network interfaces effectively to improve performance and reliability. However, like TCP, SCTP suffers unnecessary performance degradation over wired-wireless heterogeneous networks. The main reason is that the original congestion control scheme of SCTP cannot differentiate loss events so that SCTP reduces the congestion window inappropriately. In order to solve this problem and improve performance, we propose a jitter-based congestion control scheme with end-to-end semantics over wired-wireless networks. Besides, we solved ineffective jitter ratio problem which may cause original jitter-based congestion control scheme to misjudge congestion loss as wireless loss. Available bandwidth estimation scheme will be integrated into our congestion control mechanism to make the bottleneck more stabilized. Simulation experiments reveal that our scheme (JSCTP) gives prominence to improve performance effectively over wired-wireless networks.	elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;experiment;fairness measure;internet;lossy compression;mobile device;multihoming;network congestion;network topology;overhead (computing);return channel;simulation;tcp congestion control;telecommunications network;transmitter;x.690	Jyh-Ming Chen;Ching-Hsiang Chu;Eric Hsiao-Kuang Wu;Meng-Feng Tsai;Jian-Ren Wang	2011	EURASIP J.

It is well-known that CSMA policies can incur an access delay that may be correlated over time and may grow exponentially with the network size. This discourages practical implementation of CSMA policies in even mid-sized networks. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the delay performance of CSMA policies. We present recently developed results for two important interference models and show how CSMA policies can be used to ensure an access delay that is memoryless over time or that does not grow with the network size. The two interference models that we consider are primary interference and the “lattice interference graph”. Our results suggest that CSMA policies can achieve a delay performance, as well as a delay-throughput trade-off, that makes them viable to be used in practice.	interference (communication);network packet;rate of convergence;throughput	Mahdi Lotfinezhad;Peter Marbach	2010	2010 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)	10.1109/ITA.2010.5454108	throughput;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;lattice;mathematics;distributed computing;interference;markov process;network topology;computer network	Metrics	13.107523192033634	90.57666403518094	28892

We develop a unified analytical model and obtain explicit expressions for the first two moments as well as the generating function. We show via comparison with simulation that our model accurately predicts the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of the access delay for a wide range of operating conditions. In addition, we show that the obtained generating function is much more accurate than others that have appeared in the literature. Using our model, we prove that the binary exponential backoff mechanism induces a heavy-tailed delay distribution for the case of unlimited retransmissions. We show using numerical examples that the distribution has a truncated power-law tail when a retransmission limit exists.

Although Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are attracting greater commercial interest, current research has not adequately captured the real-world constraints in VANET handover techniques. Therefore, in order to have the best practice for VANET services, it is necessary to have seamless connectivity for optimal coverage and ideal channel utilization: this comes at the cost of overlapping signals of adjacent RSUs. This overlapping effect can be investigated using concepts such Network Dwell Time, Time Before Handover and Exit Times. In this simulation study we investigate the feasibility and benefits of providing a ubiquitous communication in VANET under different mobile environments. We also study the impact of beacon frequency and velocity on Network Dwell Time, Time Before Handover and Exit Times, which will help us to predict the handover times and thus make proactive handover possible. Therefore understanding handover issues is critical in supporting life-safety applications and services in VANETs.	best practice;hoc (programming language);matlab;seamless3d;simulation;throughput;ubiquitous computing;velocity (software development);window function	Arindam Ghosh;Vishnu Vardhan Paranthaman;Glenford E.

However, little is known about the performance of these new mechanisms as well as the interaction with other elements of the network (such as the RED queue management). On the other hand, the control-theoretic approach has proved to be a very useful tool in order to get analytical insight into the performance of congestion control algorithms. In this paper, a control-theoretic research framework is designed and implemented for analyzing high speed transport protocol proposals in network environments with RED active queue management. As a case study, a comprehensive control-theoretic analysis of a promising proposal, namely the HighSpeed TCP is provided. The main contributions of this paper are the following. First, we provide a fluid-flow model for HighSpeed TCP/RED networks. Second, a comprehensive and systematic implementation methodology is described in detail, and a Simulink-based framework is designed for analyzing fluid-based models. Third, we derive a stability condition for HighSpeed TCP/RED networks. The flow-level results are validated by packet-level simulations conducted in Ns-2. Finally, an extension of the framework is presented that makes it capable of describing the interaction of different transport protocols.	active queue management;algorithm;approximation;bandwidth-delay product;control flow;control theory;fairness measure;initial condition;matlab;network congestion;network packet;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;router (computing);simulation;simulink;traffic analysis	Balázs Sonkoly;Boglárka Simon;Tuan Anh Trinh;Sándor Molnár	2009	Network Protocols & Algorithms	10.5296/npa.v1i2.252	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;conceptual framework;queue management system;network congestion;computer security;active queue management;transport layer;computer network;bandwidth-delay product;fluid dynamics	Metrics	-3.652589988489299	95.65189934090562	29213

Network traffic for such games has been analysed using packet size and inter-packet time metrics fitting a statistical model. However, the effect of other network traffic on game traffic was not investigated or considered. This paper explores the traffic generated by an FPS game, taking into account the effects of other Internet traffic. Experiments were conducted in an isolated local network, repeated across the Internet and in a simulator with varying degrees of background traffic. FPS game packet inter-arrival time distribution was observed to spread with the decrease of bandwidth due to other traffic along network paths. The twin peak characteristic of packet inter-arrival time observed in the isolated local network experiment flattens and spreads to a bell-shape as bandwidth decreases due to the increased and non-unique delay of packet arrivals.	double summit;first person shooter;floating point systems;internet;network packet;network traffic control;statistical model;time of arrival;traffic analysis	Qili Zhou;Colin James Miller;Victor Bassilious	2008	2008 11th IEEE International Symposium on Object and Component-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC)	10.1109/ISORC.2008.28	traffic generation model;local area network;statistical model;network traffic control;the internet;simulation;internet traffic;computer science;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;traffic shaping;bandwidth;web server;computer network	Metrics	-2.61827793775656	99.07279893924783	29242

The analysis focuses on the important performance indicators end-to-end throughput and delay, taking into account the effects of an automated repeat request protocol. An extension to a MAC frame based access protocol like IEEE 802.11e, 802.15.3, 802.16a, and HIPERLAN2 is outlined and taken as basis for the calculations. The system is intended for both dense populated areas as an overlay to cellular radio systems and to provide wide-area broadband coverage. The two possible deployment scenarios for both dense urban and wide-area environments are introduced. Analytical and validating simulation results are shown, proving the suitability of the proposed concept for both of the mentioned scenarios. It is established that the fixed relaying concept is well suited to substantially contribute to provide high capacity cellular broadband radio coverage in next generation (NG) cellular wireless broadband systems.	bridging (networking);broadcast relay station;end-to-end principle;frame language;mac address;mobile phone;next-generation network;performance evaluation;population;simulation;software deployment;throughput;vii	Ralf Pabst;Norbert Esseling;Bernhard Walke	2005	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2005.6387858	wireless ad hoc network;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;fixed wireless;automatic repeat request;wireless broadband;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.895658066641792	92.83671106948684	29606

We demonstrate that by considering the interrelationship among the network, data link, and physical layers, we increase the network throughput. The work is based on minimizing a defined objective function which includes the cost related to the transmit power for emptying the buffer with a certain amount of information and the selected route to the final destination.	hoc (programming language);internet;layer (electronics);loss function;network packet;optimization problem;router (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);throughput;wireless router	Christopher A.

e9fa06234ba0a911f96defec0081e9bd77b310ca	data-driven handover optimization in next generation mobile communication networks		Network densification is regarded as one of the important ingredients to increase capacity for next generation mobile communication networks. However, it also leads to mobility problems since users are more likely to hand over to another cell in dense or even ultradense mobile communication networks. Therefore, supporting seamless and robust connectivity through such networks becomes a very important issue. In this paper, we investigate handover (HO) optimization in next generation mobile communication networks. We propose a data-driven handover optimization (DHO) approach, which aims to mitigate mobility problems including too-late HO, too-early HO, HO to wrong cell, ping-pong HO, and unnecessary HO. The key performance indicator (KPI) is defined as the weighted average of the ratios of these mobility problems. The DHO approach collects data from the mobile communication measurement results and provides a model to estimate the relationship between the KPI and features from the collected dataset. Based on the model, the handover parameters, including the handover margin and time-to-trigger, are optimized to minimize the KPI. Simulation results show that the proposed DHO approach could effectively mitigate mobility problems.	clipping (computer graphics);mathematical optimization;mobile phone;next-generation network;seamless3d;simulation;telecommunications network	Po-Chiang Lin;Lionel F.

95fbec8d0f45830a194d0697b6734a296d2640f4	etor: energy and trust aware opportunistic routing in cognitive radio social internet of things	cognitive radio;energy effient;opportunistic routing;social internet of things;trust	In recent years, the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) has become a research hot topic in the field of wireless networks, which are inseparable relationships between human and devices. As a huge numbers of heterogeneous devices will be connected, it needs more frequency spectrum. The Cognitive radio (CR) technology can improve spectrum utilization in an opportunistic communication manner. However, dynamic spectrum availability and heterogeneous devices make it more difficult for routing design in CR-SIoT. Opportunistic routing (OR) can mitigate drawbacks from CR-SIoT, which leverages the broadcast nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose an energy and trust aware OR in CR-SIoT, which jointly considers energy efferent, trust and social feature for designing secure OR. In the proposed scheme, we exploit a new routing metric for selecting forwarding candidates and use network coding for the data transmission between trust nodes in multiple types of flows SIoT. In addition, we propose a game-theoretic approach to allocate channel for SIoT which is based on interference factor. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed secure opportunistic routing performs better compared with existing routing in SIoT in terms of packet delivery ratio, network lifetime and average delay. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed routing scheme is the first OR in SIoT.	algorithm;cognitive radio;cryptography;game theory;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);internet of things;linear network coding;malware;metrics (networking);network packet;routing;separable polynomial;simulation;spectral density	Xiaoxiong Zhong;Renhao Lu;Li Li;Sheng Zhang	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254213	wireless network;computer network;linear network coding;cognitive radio;metrics;network packet;computer science;exploit;routing protocol;communication channel	Mobile	11.508602844030701	89.1435774906539	29895

The main area of interest is to provide realtime traffic with upper bounds on the end-to-end delay, jitter, and loss experienced at various service queues within a satellite network. Various service protocols, each based on a common underlying strategy, are developed in light of the requirements and limitations imposed at each of the satellite’s subsystems. These subsystems include the uplink (UL) earth station (ES) service queue, on-board processing (OBP) queues, and the downlink (DL) ES service queue feeding into a wireline ATM network or directly to an end-user application. Numerous network simulation results demonstrate the tractability, efficiency, and versatility of the underlying service discipline. Key features of our strategy are its algorithmic and architectural simplicity, its non-ad-hoc scheduling approach, and its unified treatment of all real-time streams at all service queues. In addition, the delay and jitter bounds are uncoupled. In this way, end-to-end jitter can be tightly controlled even if medium access requires long indeterminate waiting durations.	atm turbo;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);hoc (programming language);indeterminacy in concurrent computation;on-board data handling;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link	Hervé Le Pocher;Victor C.

Our study presented inhere will prove analytically and via simulations that this should not be necessarily the case. To facilitate our analysis, we consider two binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithms in our study: a standard BEB where a host increases its CW upon every packet loss (collision or transmission error) and another access method with a capability to differentiate between the type of losses; here, a host experiencing a loss will increase its CW only after a collision and remain in the same backoff stage otherwise. We show that the second access procedure outperforms the standard BEB when the network is lightly loaded. However, in a congested network, this quick recovery property results in intensifying the collisions among contending nodes and hence yields a poor system performance. We propose a hybrid method that takes advantage of both access methods to achieve better throughput under various network loads.	exponential backoff	Khoder Shamy;Chadi M.

It eliminates overflow by making the buffer length always cover the queue length adaptively on the fly. The NNC and the AQM (active queue management) mechanism(s) at the system/router level together form a unified buffer overflow prevention solution for the TCP channels. The NNC provides the following advantages: a) it prevents the AQM resources dished out already at the system level from being wasted, b) it shortens the service roundtrip time (RTT) by eliminating the chance of retransmission due to user-level overflow, and c) it alleviates network congestion. The NNC operates by the {0,/spl Delta/}/sup 2/ objective function and the principle is to maintain the given /spl Delta/ safety margin about the reference point symbolically represented by the """"0"""" in {0,/spl Delta/}/sup 2/. The NNC stability and precision are traffic pattern independent for its statistical nature. This independence makes the NNC immensely suitable for Internet applications because Internet traffic can be LRD (long-range dependence), SRD (short-range dependence) or multifractal, and switch suddenly."""	active queue management;artificial neural network;buffer overflow;emoticon;loss function;multifractal system;network congestion;network interface controller;on the fly;optimization problem;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);server (computing);user space	Wilfred W.

This model is based on a novel definition of generation, which is built upon optimal IDNC solutions. Under this model, IDNC and RLNC are only two extreme cases with specific generation sizes. Throughput and delay properties of this model, measured by block completion time and packet decoding delay, respectively, are studied, which fill the gap between IDNC and RLNC and thus provide a good understanding on the throughput-delay tradeoff of network coding. An efficient adaptive scheme is then designed, which allows in-block switch among IDNC and different levels of RLNC, so that the system's throughput and delay can be fine-tuned to meet the real-time requirements of the application. Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate how the proposed generation size interacts with the number of receivers and the channel quality to affect the overall system performance.	definition;linear network coding;network packet;real-time clock;requirement;simulation;throughput	Mingchao Yu;Neda Aboutorab;Parastoo Sadeghi	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2013.6620794	throughput;linear network coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive system;encoding;statistics;computer network	Arch	14.086362343266083	93.62821321337142	30116

This paper investigates the performance of a modified packet reservation multiple access (PRMA) protocol, called PRMA with hindering states (PRMA-HS), for supporting voice and data transmissions in mobile cellular systems with high propagation delays. A scenario based on low earth orbit mobile satellite systems (LEO-MSSs) has been considered, but the analytical approach is general. We have obtained that PRMA-HS achieves a high capacity of voice sources in LEO-MSSs also in the presence of data traffic. A performance analysis has been carried out showing good agreement with simulation results. Finally, the PRMA-HS performance has been evaluated in the presence of different data traffic sources.	access control;leo (computer);msat;mobile phone;multiplexing;network packet;profiling (computer programming);propagation delay;quality of service;requirement;simulation;software propagation	Giuliano Benelli;Romano Fantacci;Giovanni Giambene;Carlo Ortolani	2000	IEEE Trans.

Although significant work has been performed on ABR rate allocation algorithms at network switches, little work has focused on the end system behavior, which is examined in this article. The effect of (1) the speed of the links on the path from the source to the destination and (2) the connection round trip time on the selection of ABR parameter values is studied. Simulation results illustrate the impact of the key parameters that control rate reduction in the absence of network feedback on performance, in terms of connection throughputs, queue lengths at the switches, and link utilizations. These results have been incorporated into the ABR standards and can be generalized to cooperative congestion control with explicit congestion notification in the Internet.	atm turbo;algorithm;end system;explicit congestion notification;memory management;network congestion;network switch;simulation	Sonia Fahmy;Raj Jain;Rohit Goyal;Bobby Vandalore	2002	Simulation	10.1177/0037549702078003526	active traffic management;real-time computing;the internet;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;asynchronous transfer mode;flow control;network congestion;telecommunications network;computer network	Networks	-0.9101952498142549	101.59719823265517	30450

Without exact knowledge of network parameters and internal state, the proposed intelligent jammer optimizes its strategy to be energy efficient while achieving the target throughput. Probabilistic models for jamming FDMA and CSMA-based protocols are described for illustration of the framework: A frequency-hopping voice network is analyzed to determine the optimal jam strategy for proactive frequency jammer; and a CSMA packet protocol is analyzed for varying packet arrival rates at the nodes. Since RA protocols display observable reaction to channel conditions, we propose a feedback-control loop that uses observable feedback to infer network parameters. Both protocols are evaluated through simulation for their energy-throughput tradeoff compared to a naive jammer.	algorithm;backoff;channelization (telecommunications);control system;experiment;frequency band;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;jam;mathematical optimization;network packet;observable;optimization problem;radio jamming;random access;simulation;stationary process;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Jiasi Chen;Soumya Sen;Mung Chiang;David J.

This constraint is due to the ??bandwidth shuffling?? necessary to obtain fairness. We describe an algorithm to compute this equilibrium and derive a lower and upper bound on link utilization. While XCP reduces to max-min allocation at a single link, its behavior in a network can be very different. We illustrate that the additional constraint can cause flows to receive an arbitrarily small fraction of their max-min fair allocations. We confirm these results using ns2 simulations.	fairness measure	Lachlan L. H. Andrew;Steven H. Low;Bartek P. Wydrowski	2009	IEEE/ACM Trans.

In this paper, an adaptive radio resource allocation mechanism for virtual resources sharing a common heterogeneous wireless infrastructure is presented and evaluated. The Virtual Network Radio Resource Allocation (VRRA) being proposed takes advantage of the set of shared resources available within a cluster of wireless resources from different Radio Access Technologies (RATs), optimising their utilisation in order to maintain the contracted capacity. Simulation results show that the introduction of VRRA allows supporting the minimum bandwidth requirement in a wireless cluster, composed of several physical base stations from different RATs. For the Virtual Network providing high data rates and guaranteed services presented in this paper, the Virtual Network Operator Satisfaction Level can be improved by 40% with the introduction of VRRA.	cloud computing;future internet;simulation	Luisa Caeiro;Filipe D.

Even for some innovative MAC protocols that show promise, there remains much uncertainty as to their actual performance under anything other than carefully selected scenarios. In some cases the only published results are simulations undertaken by the protocol proposer, resulting in a lack of independent verification. In this paper we detail independent simulation results for several MAC protocols in underwater acoustic networks, compare these to previously published results and accepted theory and analyze the impact of the large propagation delay on different protocols. The limitations of existing published simulations are then addressed, providing a basis for improved simulations in the future. Finally we review progress towards validation of acoustic MAC simulations, and highlight ways in which real-world tests can be improved.	acoustic cryptanalysis;network packet;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation	Qichao Zhao;Andrew J.

The coexistence of different RATs requires a need for Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) to support the provision of QoS and the efficient utilization of radio resources. RAT selection algorithms are part of the Joint RRM algorithms. Simply, their role is to decide which of the available RATs is most suitable to fit the user to the best connection. Guaranteeing the requirements of QoS and most efficient utilization of the available radio resources are the goals of the RAT selection algorithms. Therefore, there is a need to develop such algorithms for the heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an approach for RAT selection algorithm developed by fuzzy logic and includes different criteria, assessing and making decisions, then selecting the most suitable technology.	artificial neural network;assistive technology;coexist (image);fuzzy logic;particle swarm optimization;quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;selection algorithm;semantic network;user (computing)	Aymen Ben Zineb;Mohamed Ayadi;Sami Tabbane	2014	The 2014 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications	10.1109/SNCC.2014.6866518	real-time computing;telecommunications;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy set operations;computer network	Embedded	8.76202299137574	98.45862091699192	31057

A reliable transport protocol needs to identify the packets which failed to reach a given destination. This is achieved through feedback packets returned to the source. For multicast services, receiver feedback has been shown to lead to thefeedback implosion problem. Feedback implosion is a well-studied problem and various solutions exist in the literature. However, these solutions mainly focus on wireline terrestrial networks and do not take into account the inherent characteristics of the satellite channel and the architecture of the deployed network. Therefore, we need to revisit the problem and provide a new set of solutions for efficient integration to next generation satellite systems. In this paper, we introduce a feedback implosion suppression algorithm, which effectively suppresses the amount of feedback relayed through the satellite channel, while ensuring that the critical information is conveyed in a timely fashion. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulations.	algorithm;feedback;multicast;simulation;terrestrial television;zero suppression	Gun Akkor;John S. Baras;Michael H.

Each node transmits a burst with length sampled from a geometric distribution with parameter q followed by a carrier sense slot. A node repeats the previous operations until it senses a busy slot. A node will access the channel and transmit its payload when it has sensed h idle slots. The parameter q can be adjusted for each node to achieve desired levels of relative priority with little impact on channel utilization and without a need for explicit knowledge about other traffic. Comparison to existing tree-splitting, carrier sensing and bursting protocols through analysis and simulations shows that our algorithm scales very well to the number of nodes. It has very high success probability, channel utilization and fairness. Extensions are provided for hidden terminal scenarios and are shown in simulations to provide adequate performance.	algorithm;authorization;burst transmission;carpal tunnel syndrome;digimon world;fairness measure;finite difference;ieee xplore;internet protocol suite;microsoft windows;multicast;non-functional requirement;rs-232;simulation;throughput;unicast	Greger Wikstrand;Thomas Nilsson;Mark S.

This is a canonical model for multiservice ATM multiplexing, which is hard to analyze and also of wide interest. This paper's approach to the computation of the buffer overflow probability,G(x) = Pr{buffer content >x}, departs from all prior approaches in that it transforms the computation ofG(x) for a particularx into a recursive construction of an interpolating polynomial. For the particular case of two source types the interpolating polynomial is in two variables. Our main result is the derivation of recursive algorithms for computing the overflow probabilityG(x) and various other performance measures using their respective relations to two-dimensional interpolating polynomials. To make the computational procedure efficient we first derive a new system of equations for the coefficients in the spectral expansion formula forG(x) and then use specific properties of the new system for efficient recursive construction of the polynomials. We also develop an approximate method with low complexity and analyze its accuracy by numerical studies. We computeG(x) for different values ofx, the mean buffer content and the coefficient of the dominant exponential term in the spectral expansion ofG(x). The accuracy of the approximations is reasonable when the buffer utilization characterized by G(0) is more than 10−2.	multiplexer	Boris Igelnik;Yaakov Kogan;Vladimir Kriman;Debasis Mitra	1995	Queueing Syst.	10.1007/BF01158433	system of linear equations;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;buffer overflow;stochastic modelling;asynchronous communication;probability;canonical model;mathematics;fluid queue;programming language;algorithm;multiplexing;statistics;recursion	Metrics	-0.04861808437186149	99.70455152692452	31223

Nodes are connected according to an arbitrary configuration and each node in the networks employs an active queue management (AQM) based queueing policy to guarantee certain quality of service for multiple class external traffic. This buffer management scheme has been implemented using queue thresholds. The use of queue thresholds is a well known technique for network traffic congestion control. The analysis is based on a queue-by-queue decomposition technique where each queue is modelled as a GE/GE/1/N queue with single server, R (R P 2) distinct traffic classes and {N = N1,N2, . . . ,NR} buffer threshold values per class under first-come-first-serve (FCFS) service rule. The external traffic is modelled using the generalised exponential (GE) distribution which can capture the bursty property of network traffic. The analytical solution is obtained using the maximum entropy (ME) principle. The forms of the state and blocking probabilities are analytically established at equilibrium via appropriate mean value constraints. The initial numerical results demonstrate the credibility of the proposed analytical solution. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of multiple jumps in the same cycle are obtained. Then, we propose an analytical framework for the optimal choice of the router buffer size. We formulate this problem as a multi-criteria optimization problem, in which the Lagrange function corresponds to a linear combination of the average goodput and the average delay in the queue.

Many mobility management protocols have been developed to match real-time requirements in All-IP networks. In addition, lots of performance studies have been performed. In order to estimate the performance of a certain mobility management protocol compared to some others, a mathematical model for each protocol should be developed or each protocol should be simulated or implemented. In general, the simulation and the implementation take a long time and deliver detailed and accurate results. The mathematical model can be developed faster and results in a good estimation of the performance. Until now there is no generic mathematical model that can be used for a wide range of mobility management solutions. In this paper we propose a model that allows for the evaluation of the performance of a large set of mobility management protocols with respect to the handoff latency and the expected number of dropped packets. Our model takes the dropping of control messages, mobility patterns and network topology into account. The parameters of the generic model are set according to the characteristics of the studied protocols. Mobile IP Fast Authentication protocol (MIFA) and Handoff-Aware Wireless Access Internet Infrastructure (HAWAII) are compared to each other in this paper using the developed model.	authentication protocol;internet protocol suite;mathematical model;mobile ip;network topology;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock;requirement;seamless3d;simulation	Ali Diab;Florian Liers;Andreas Mitschele-Thiel	2007		10.1145/1298126.1298138	telecommunications;computer science;authentication protocol;wireless network;mathematical model;mobility model;computer security;network topology;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	0.06705024559881713	89.03639016686931	31425

Transportation is one domain where cellular networks can play a significant role not only in connecting autonomous vehicles to other vehicles, infrastructures, and people, but also in realizing vehicle teleoperation i.e., vehicle driven by an operator from a distance. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using a cellular network to realise vehicle teleoperation. We identify the network requirements for a teleoperated vehicle use case in an urban environment using a test setup of an LTE network and simulations. Testbed measurements reveal that teleoperation use cases can be supported even with less than excellent signal strength. Through simulation we show that the testbed can scale to cover greater distances and support teleoperation use cases even with background mobile broadband traffic.	autonomous robot;boolean algebra;compaq lte;fits;geographic coordinate system;network performance;quadratic configuration interaction;radio access network;replay attack;requirement;sensor;simulation;testbed;throughput;vehicle routing problem	Rafia Inam;Nicolas Schrammar;Keven Wang;Athanasios Karapantelakis;Leonid Mokrushin;Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan;Elena Fersman	2016	2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795920	control engineering;embedded system;simulation;engineering	Robotics	2.6849892940014817	89.34438372285776	31439

Additionally, the throughput should converge as fast as TCP when the packet-loss conditions change. This study classifies eight typical TCP-friendly schemes according to their underlying policies on fairness, aggressiveness, and responsiveness. The schemes are evaluated to verify whether they meet TCP-equivalence and TCP-equal share. TCP-equal share is a more realistic but more challenging criterion than TCP-equivalence and states that a flow should have the same throughput with TCP if competing with TCP for the same bottleneck. Simulation results indicate that one of the selected schemes, TCP-friendly rate control (TFRC), meets both criteria under more testing scenarios than the others. Additionally, the results under non-periodic losses, low-multiplexing, two-state losses, and bursty losses reveal the causes that bring fault cases to the schemes. Finally, appropriate policies are recommended for an ideal scheme.	converge;fairness measure;internet protocol suite;multiplexing;network congestion;network packet;numerical taxonomy;responsiveness;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;turing completeness	Shih-Chiang Tsao;Yuan-Cheng Lai;Ying-Dar Lin	2007	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2007.4395105	real-time computing;the internet;computer science;tcp tuning;packet loss;network congestion;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;taxonomy;computer network	Networks	-3.898350054129482	94.79556851195524	31444

The ongoing wireless local area network (WLAN) standardization and development activities allow WLAN to provide high data rate in unlicensed spectrum. It motivates cellular network operators to adopt WLAN as a complement to cellular 3G systems in hot spot areas. Consequently, it is imperative to develop a network selection technique to assure quality-of-service (QoS) for the integrated cellular/WLAN system. In this paper, an optimization scheme for mobile users to select a network in an integrated WLAN and universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) system is proposed. In order to provide users a prospect of being always best connected, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and grey relational analysis (GRA) techniques are integrated to make decision. The former defines selection criteria and the latter evaluates network alternatives. The network selection module is built at the link layer, and collects the time-varying QoS information through cross-layer message signaling. Simulations conducted in a heterogeneous system with UMTS and WLAN show that the proposed network selection technique can successfully satisfy QoS requirements for a variety of applications through a fair decision on the optimum network for mobile users at any time.

8e61782652c398c4ad8257dc8f1fcaa21948abdc	concurrent-mac: increasing concurrent transmissions in dense wireless lans		This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of Concurrent-MAC, a MAC protocol for increasing concurrent transmissions and throughput in dense wireless LANs. Based on channel gain measurements and SINR values, sets of concurrent transmitters are identified by the backhaul of APs. A node gaining access to the channel, schedules one of its neighbors for concurrent transmission. Neighbor chosen for concurrent transmission can start transmitting on the channel, immediately after it overhears the privilege given to it for concurrent transmission. Our simulation results show that, in dense wireless LANs, Concurrent-MAC improves network throughput significantly compared to 802.11 DCF.	aggregate data;backhaul (telecommunications);concurrent computing;design rule for camera file system;performance evaluation;server message block;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Ghazale Hosseinabadi;Nitin H.

To be able to utilize CRNs in practical applications, a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS) should be guaranteed to the secondary users (SUs) in such networks. In this paper, we propose a packet scheduling scheme that orders the SUs' transmissions according to the packet dropping rates and the number of packets queued waiting for transmission. A medium access control (MAC) protocol, based on the mentioned scheduling scheme, is proposed for a centralized CRN. In addition, the scheduling scheme is adapted for a distributed CRN, by introducing a feature that allows SUs to organize access to the available spectrum without the need for a central unit. Extensive simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed protocols, in comparison with other MAC protocols designed for CRNs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protocols to guarantee the required QoS for voice packet transmission, while maintaining fairness among SUs.	access control;centralized computing;cognitive radio;fairness measure;network packet;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Khaled Ali;Weihua Zhuang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963188	passive optical network;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.933044770403526	95.01248807436914	31574

By introducing the concepts of ARQ capacity and effective capacity, an analytic model has been derived to evaluate the loss probabilities in both the network layer and the physical layer. In contrast to the previous results, this model quantifies the interaction between the network and physical layers. As shown by the simulation experiments, our analysis can predict the real metrics under a wide range of conditions. This enables the call admission controller in wireless networks to control and optimize traffic QoS using instantaneous channel status information.	approximation;automatic repeat request;control system;error detection and correction;experiment;model–view–adapter;network packet;networking hardware;online and offline;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;queuing delay;real-time transcription;simulation	Zhi Quan;Jong-Moon Chung	2004	2004 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE Cat.

However, we do so from the perspective of Adversarial Queueing Theory where no probabilistic assumptions about traffic patterns are made. Instead, one considers a scenario where an adversary controls service requests and tries to congest the network. Under mild restrictions on the adversary, one can often still guarantee the network’s stability. We illustrate other applications of an adversarial perspective to standard algorithmic problems. We conclude with a discussion of new potential domains of applicability of such an adversarial view of common computational tasks.	adversary (cryptography);computation;queueing theory;routing	Marcos A.

To this end, Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS)—that was introduced in the Release 6 of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS)—is envisaged to play an instrumental role in the proliferation of mobile market. The reason behind the design of MBMS was the need to provide multiple users with the same data at the same time in 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) cellular networks. Still, MBMS performance is limited by the base stations’ transmission power. As an aftermath, efficient power allocation techniques should be implemented so as to ensure the mass provision of multimedia applications to mobile users. This paper proposes a novel mechanism for efficient radio bearer selection during MBMS transmissions. The proposed mechanism is based on the concept of transport channels combination in any cell of the network. Furthermore, the mechanism exploits the performance enhancements emerged from Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas and manages to efficiently deliver multiple MBMS sessions. The proposed mechanism is thoroughly evaluated and compared with the radio bearer selection mechanisms proposed by 3GPP.	half-life 2: episode one;mimo;mobile television;multi-user;multimedia broadcast multicast service;requirement;simulation	Antonios G.

TheEffective Cell Loss is introduced as a cell loss performance measure which combines both the cell loss due to buffer overflow and the cell loss due to excessive delay. ThisEffective Cell Loss measure allows one to design optimal input and output buffer sizes for a given cell loss requirement. Our analysis is versatile enough to easily study the adverse effect due to nonuniform traffic patterns at a switch. Study shows that the nonuniform traffic may jeopardize ATM switches designed under the uniform traffic assumption. For some examples, we have provided both numerical and computer simulation results to show the validity and usefulness of our analysis.	atm turbo;buffer overflow;cell (microprocessor);computer simulation;input/output;network switch;numerical analysis	David S.

Specifically, in this paper we introduce the concept of multimedia sensing as a service (MSaaS), and propose a generalized premium prioritization-based quality of experience paradigm for wireless big-volumes-of-data (BVDs) multimedia communications, with significant energy saving potentials for future multimedia IoT devices and systems. The key contribution of this new framework is its data diversity flexibility at the application layer, which could be flexibly adopted by future multimedia communication systems. Data dependencies in spatial, frequency and temporal domains are analyzed, and interaction with uplink resource allocation optimization are investigated with regards to wireless communication energy cost estimation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed prioritization-based communication paradigm has significant energy saving potentials for BVD MSaaS wireless multimedia communications at cloud edges and fogs.	best-effort delivery;big data;channel capacity;data dependency;forward error correction;internet of things;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;simulation;telecommunications link	Wei Wang;Kazem Sohraby	2017	IEEE Internet of Things Journal	10.1109/JIOT.2016.2578722	human–computer interaction;cloud computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;multimedia;world wide web;computer security;internet of things;wireless;computer network	Mobile	23.54590286306361	95.96982283363165	31921

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is commonly used on top of this MAC for reliable transport. TCPs congestion control scheme assumes highly reliable frame transmission at the link layer Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold in multi-hop wireless network scenarios, leading to severe performance degradation. In this paper we study the interactions between the TCP and 802.11b MAC protocols, and examine the effects of different TCP and 802.11b parameters on the throughput achieved Using simulations and analysis, we highlight the causes of performance degradation when TCP is used over 802.11b MAC in a multi-hop wireless scenario.	design rule for camera file system;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);ieee 802.1x;interaction;interference (communication);network congestion;network packet;refinement (computing);retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;timer;window function	Rui Jiang;Vikram Gupta;Chinya V.

Specifically, it is necessary to consider a more scalable physical layer due to the high-speed mobility of vehicles and the complex channel environment. Adaptive transmission has been adapted in channel-dependent scheduling. However, it has been neglected with regards to the physical topology changes in the vehicle network. In this paper, we propose a physical topology-triggered adaptive transmission scheme which adjusts the data rate between vehicles according to the number of connectable vehicles nearby. Also, we investigate the performance of the proposed method using computer simulations and compare it with the conventional methods. The numerical results show that the proposed method can provide more continuous and reliable data transmission for V2V communications.	anatomy, regional;computer simulation;conflict (psychology);data rate units;drug vehicle;eb-eye;eb/n0;entity–relationship model;evaluation;large;manuscripts;numerical analysis;pei-yuan wei;performance per watt;preparation;probability;scalability;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;scott continuity;throughput;vehicle-to-vehicle;hachimijiogan	Yiqiao Wei;Jingjun Chen;Seung-Hoon Hwang	2018		10.3390/s18030755	electronic engineering;engineering;physical layer;data transmission;scheduling (computing);scalability;network topology;computer network;transmission (mechanics);communication channel	Mobile	18.279084519123877	88.91900029959235	32059

Given the scarcity of radio resources, higher network capacities need to be achieved through more efficient use of the available bandwidth. Current cellular networks utilize frequency planning schemes that are optimized for circuit-switched applications, and thus is inherently problematic for future wireless packet networks with bursty, high peak-rate traffics. Random access schemes such as the ALOHA are seen as better solutions for packet networks. However, co-channel interference may significantly reduce the network throughput when the multicell load is heavy. In this paper, we propose a distributed rate adaptive packet access (DRAPA) scheme to combine the advantages of rate adaptation (in circuit-switched networks) and random access (in packet-switched networks). In particular, DRAPA allows terminal stations to transmit packets in random access fashion in the presence of brusty interference from neighboring cells. The packet code rate is adjusted according to interference level so that the retransmisson is controlled at an acceptable level. The DRAPA scheme subsumes two traditional schemes as the extreme cases, and has superior performance over the traditional schemes in terms of throughput and stability.	circuit switching;code rate;interference (communication);internet;network packet;packet switching;random access;throughput	H.

417bf44f41c849a3e6feda5d7b344aa450a600c2	a framework for less than best effort congestion control with soft deadlines		Applications like inter data-centre synchronisation or client-to-cloud backups require a reliable end-to-end data transfer, however, they typically do not have strong capacity or latency constraints, just a loose delivery deadline. Besides, their potential to disrupt more quality-constrained flows should be kept to a minimum. These applications could be well served by a transport protocol providing a less-than-best-effort (LBE) or scavenger service rather than TCP but, neither TCP nor standard LBE methods like LEDBAT consider any notion of deadline or completion time. TCP simply tries to maximise the use of available capacity, while LEDBAT tries to enforce an LBE behaviour regardless of any timeliness requirements. This paper introduces a framework for adding both LBE behaviour and awareness of “soft” delivery deadlines to any congestion control (CC) algorithm, whether loss-based, delay-based or explicit signaling-based. This effectively allows it to turn an arbitrary CC protocol into a scavenger protocol that dynamically adapts its sending rate to network conditions and remaining time before the deadline, to balance timeliness and transmission aggressiveness. Network utility maximization (NUM) theory provides a solid foundation for the proposal.

A semi-experiment involves artificially modifying a specific aspect of a trace and studying the resulting change in scaling behavior. We demonstrate using MAWI traces that semi-experiments performed without addressing the presence of anomalies give insights that contradict widely accepted theories regarding Internet traffic scaling behavior. For example, a direct semi-experimental analysis seems to suggest that removing large flows does not result in the removal of LRD behavior and that the scaling behavior of MAWI traces is the same before and after the removal of the large flows. This observation hence challenges the well-known hypothesis that the heavy-tailed distribution of flow sizes is the primary factor causing correlation at large time-scales. To mitigate the impact of anomalies, we couple the semi-experiments with a recently proposed sketch-based procedure for robust estimation of scaling behavior. We term these ``robust semi-experiments"""". Our analysis shows that using a robust estimation procedure enables a meaningful semi-experimental analysis and that the conclusions drawn from the robust semi-experiments agree with well-established theories regarding Internet traffic scaling behavior."""	experiment;image scaling;semiconductor industry;theory;tracing (software);whole earth 'lectronic link	Himanshu Gupta;Vinay J.

One problem with the dynamic spectrum access system of cognitive radio is access channel mismatch between two wireless terminals. In the learning-assisted rendezvous channel, before exchanging packets for link connection, the rate of channel occupancy by the other system is estimated within the learning time; it is referred to as the channel occupancy rate (COR). High speed packet exchange is made possible by selecting a low COR channel. However, the optimal learning time and the impact of COR estimation errors have not been clarified yet. This paper analyzes the time to rendezvous channel (TTR), where TTR is the time needed to complete the rendezvous with a certain probability. The results indicate that the learning time and TTR have a concave relationship which means that the optimal learning time can be determined.	cognitive radio	Osamu Takyu;Takayuki Yamakita;Takeo Fujii;Mai Ohta;Fumihito Sasamori;Shiro Handa	2015	IEICE Transactions		cognitive radio;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	HCI	14.740020195990368	91.09823254178015	32229

The main contribution is the design of a low-complexity scheduling algorithm for the system with desired performance (in a large deviations sense). In particular, as the number of users and channels grows, the algorithm ensures an exponential decay of the probability of encountering significant delay at a near optimal decay rate when the arrivals are symmetric and the channel follows an ON-OFF model with multi-packet reception. The algorithm also provides consistently good performance in the larger set up by guaranteeing throughput optimality, and a non-zero decay rate if it is possible under any other algorithm.	algorithm;network packet;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity	Shreeshankar Bodas;Tara Javidi	2011	2011 International Symposium of Modeling and Optimization of Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks	10.1109/WIOPT.2011.5930068	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	16.294065368685416	95.68380403229494	32243

The architecture we consider is similar to the content distribution networks consisting of geographically dispersed servers and user populations over an interconnected set of metropolitan areas. Server selection issues for Web-based applications in such an environment have been widely addressed; the selection is mostly based on proximity measured using packet delay. Such a greedy or heuristic approach to server selection will not address the capacity planning problem evident in multimedia applications. For such applications, admission control becomes an essential part of their design to maintain Quality of Service (QoS). Our objective in providing a solution to the server selection problem is threefold: first, to direct clients to the nearest server; second, to provide multiple sources to diffuse network load; third, to match server capacity to user demand so that optimal blocking performance can be expected. We accomplish all three objectives by using a special type of Linear Programming (LP) formulation called the Transportation Problem (TP). The objective function in the TP is to minimize the cost of serving a video request from user population x using server y as measured by network distance. The optimal allocation between servers and user populations from TP results in server clusters, the aggregated capacity of each cluster designed to meet the demands of its designated user population. Within a server cluster, we propose streaming protocols for request handling that will result in a balanced load. We implement threshold-based admission control in individual servers within a cluster to enforce the fair share of the server resource to its designated user population. The blocking performance is used as a trigger to find new optimal allocations when blocking rates become unacceptable due to change in user demands. We substantiate the analytical model with an extensive simulation for analyzing the performance of the proposed clustered architecture and the protocols. The simulation results show significant difference in overall blocking performance between optimal and sub-optimal allocations in as much as 15% at moderate to high workloads. We also show that the proposed cluster protocols result in lower packet loss and latencies by forcing path diversity from multiple sources for request delivery.	server (computing);streaming media	Padmavathi Mundur;Poorva Arankalle	2006	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2006.03.002	planning;transportation theory;web application;real-time computing;the internet;simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;access control;load balancing;user requirements document;operating system;interconnection;packet loss;implementation;computer security;service quality;client–server model;server;computer network;data transmission;server farm	Metrics	2.6163840832531773	104.40298892577279	32607

Our approach applies two characteristic functions, a time E pant i le function to characterize the source behavior and a function to characterize a maximum amount of network bandwidth served b y the multiplexer. These two functions are computed independently and when used simultaneously, i t allows us to obtain a new and useful notion of the statistical bandwidth allocation. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of our approach on stochastic and deterministic sources. For the deterministic source, we apply our approach to the source characterized by Dual Leaky Bucket-based trafic descriptor. Its upper bound on bandwidth requirement can be easily obtained for performing a CAC function in real time while providing a significant improvement of network utilization when compared to the peak rate-based bandwidth allocation.	atm turbo;common access card;heuristic;leaky bucket;multiplexer	Piya Tanthawichian;Akihiro Fujii;Yoshiaki Nemoto	1998		10.1109/ICCCN.1998.998760	leaky bucket;quantile function;multiplexer;stochastic process;intelligent network;real-time computing;characteristic function;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;upper and lower bounds;computational model;bandwidth;multiplexing;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Theory	-0.49196162535848825	97.27910506077123	32626

Recently, it has been shown that network coding improves network reliability by reducing the number of packet retransmissions in lossy networks. However, the extent of the reliability benefit of network coding is not known. This paper quantifies the reliability gain of network coding for reliable multicasting in wireless networks, where network coding is most promising. We define the expected number of transmissions per packet as the performance metric for reliability and derive analytical expressions characterizing the performance of network coding. We also analyze the performance of reliability mechanisms based on rateless codes and automatic repeat request (ARQ), and compare them with network coding. We first study network coding performance in an access point model, where an access point broadcasts packets to a group of K receivers over lossy wireless channels. We show that the expected number of transmissions using ARQ, compared to network coding, scales as ominus (log K) as the number of receivers becomes large. We then use the access point model as a building block to study reliable multicast in a tree topology. In addition to scaling results, we derive expressions for the expected number of transmissions for finite multicast groups as well. Our results show that network coding significantly reduces the number of retransmissions in lossy networks compared to an ARQ scheme. However, rateless coding achieves asymptotic performance results similar to that of network coding.	automatic repeat request;code;image scaling;linear network coding;lossy compression;multicast;nc (complexity);network packet;network topology;tree network;wireless access point	Majid Ghaderi;Donald F.

04118fc47a09ba6540701fa376c305e272b21616	hierarchical multicast transmission for single cell point-to-multipoint (sc-ptm) in cellular networks		Recently, Single-Cell Point-to-Multipoint (SC-PTM) has been studied in 3GPP as an agile broadcast/multicast mechanism. Due to cell-level support of the multicast service, SC-PTM can adjust the service area dynamically and its scheduling is quite agile. In the conventional SC-PTM, however, a single multicast transmission is set for the worst user and provided for all the users regardless of their channel qualities. Since the transmission is configured with a modulation level and coding rate (MC) so that the user even with the worst channel quality can correctly decode the data, it may be wasteful for most users with better qualities. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multicast transmission to enhance the SC-PTM. In the proposed scheme where the users are categorized into upper group or lower group according to their channel qualities, two hierarchical multicast transmissions in the Single Cell Point-to-Multipoint (SC-PTM) are provided. In addition to the basic transmission, a supplementary transmission is additionally provided for the users with poor channel qualities, i.e., belonging in lower group. Through mathematical derivation, we evaluate the proposed scheme with various group sizes. Interestingly, the amount of resource required for two multicast transmissions is beneficial compared to that of a conventional single transmission.	agile software development;categorization;data recovery;modulation;multicast;multicast-broadcast single-frequency network;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;polynomial texture mapping;scheduling (computing)	Doyle Kwon;Jae Hyun Park;Duk Kyung Kim	2017	2017 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190768	point-to-multipoint communication;multicast;computer network;scheduling (computing);code rate;computer science;unicast;cellular network;communication channel;broadcasting	Mobile	23.135308601546388	94.60819623484556	32798

Specifically, we consider the problem of channel capture by a secondary network that uses spectrum sensing to determine the availability of the channel, and its impact on the primary throughput. We integrate the notion of transmission slots in Bianchi's Markov model with the physical time slots, to derive the transmission probability of the secondary network as a function of its scan duration. This is used to obtain analytical expressions for the throughput achievable by the primary and secondary networks. Our analysis considers both saturated and unsaturated networks. By performing a numerical search, the secondary network parameters are selected to maximize its throughput for a given level of protection of the primary network throughput. The theoretical expressions are validated using extensive simulations carried out in the Network Simulator 2. Our results provide critical insights into the performance and robustness of different schemes for medium access by the secondary network. In particular, we find that the channel captures by the secondary network does not significantly impact the primary throughput, and that simply increasing the secondary contention window size is only marginally inferior to silent-period based methods in terms of its throughput performance.	access control;coexist (image);cognitive network;markov chain;markov model;numerical analysis;robustness (computer science);simulation;throughput	Santhosh Kumar;Nirmal Shende;Chandra Ramabhadra Murthy;Arun Ayyagari	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.012413.112118	cognitive radio;cognitive network;telecommunications;computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;markov process;statistics;computer network	Metrics	9.080737390994171	93.72180563004446	32811

Call admission control (CAC) provides the means to avoid call drops due to lack of resources at a target cell during handover. The purpose of the CAC is to decide if handover should be initiated or if a new call can be established. A specific quantity of resources is reserved to the users entering the cell in the future to avoid call drops. A prediction of user's movement and amount of resources required by the users after handover can be performed in order to optimize amount of reserved resources. In this paper, we address prediction of the number of resources required by the users at the target cell after handover. To that end, we propose new approach for prediction of channel quality indicator (CQI) after handover. The prediction exploits knowledge of handover hysteresis and decomposition of interference into two parts. As the results show, the proposed algorithm increases ratio of successfully predicted CQI up to 1.9 times with respect to existing approaches.

Under the fixed-period sampling, the number of flow-cache lookups during a unit of time or the number of entries in a flow cache is bounded by a constant, which is simply expressed by a few tuning parameters. As an application of the fixed-period sampling, we also focus on the flow-rate estimation from fixed-period sampled packet streams. In particular, we propose a simple estimator based solely on the sampling frequency overestimates flow rates of detected flows. We have conducted simulation experiments using two real traces to show basic characteristics of the fixed-period sampling for the comparison with the fixed-period sampling. We also show the accuracy of the proposed flow-rate estimator through simulations.

In this paper, we have analyzed transmission control protocol (TCP) packet transmission time for mobile IP over wireless local area networks (LANs) using a proposed a new random backoff scheme. We call it as a proxy backoff scheme. It is considered the transmission time of TCP packet on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. From the results, a proposed proxy backoff scheme produces a better performance than an original random backoff in mobile IP over wireless LANs environment. Also, in OFDM/quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) medium access control (MAC), we have obtained that the transmission time in wireless channel decreases as the TCP packet size increases.

Unlike the existing works, we consider the medical packet priority jointly with the delay-dependent dynamic priority in transmission scheduling at sensor nodes. The interaction between priority queues and instantaneous delay limits make the analysis much more complicated. Based on the transient queueing analysis, we develop a buffer-overflowing queueing principle to approximate the over-deadline queueing principle in this prioritized transmission scheduling system. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed approximation queueing model works as a good fit to this prioritized data transmission system in mWBANs, and the proposed delay-dependent falling priority principle makes medical packets' transmission more reasonable in terms of timeliness issues.	approximation algorithm;emergence;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;performance;preemption (computing);priority queue;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);simulation	Zhen Zhao;Changyan Yi;Jun Cai;Huijin Cao	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752668	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;layered queueing network;computer network	Metrics	7.67370567648264	93.75229350345529	33332

The most inspiring improvement is the enhancement for medium access control (MAC) sublayer. To study the performance of IEEE 802.15.4e MAC, in this paper we first present an overview of IEEE 802.15.4e and introduce three MAC mechanisms in IEEE 802.15.4e. And the major concern here is the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode that provides deterministic access and increases network capacity. Then a detailed analytical Markov chain model for TSCH carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) is presented.

In the analytical model, the entrance/exit is uniformly distributed on the road segment and divides the road segment into two segments. On each segment, the vehicle arrival process is a Poisson process. A vehicle node travels through the entrance/exit with a given probability. Based on such assumptions, we consider different cases according to the location distribution of the entrance/exit, and take into account the vehicle arrival rate, the vehicle speed, and the probability that a vehicle node travels through the entrance/exit in deriving the connectivity probability. The accuracy of the analytical model is verified through simulation results and the impacts of different parameters on the connectivity probability are respectively investigated through both simulation and analytical results.	hoc (programming language);mathematical model;queueing theory;simulation;steady state	Yu Wang;Jun Zheng	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510773	telecommunications;probability;steady state;computer security;statistics;computer network	Robotics	4.9450556333929025	89.04283647813372	33451

In this paper, the question of how to efficiently evaluate the capacity of wireless communications systems with a comprehensive consideration of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and packet multimedia traffic source is examined. By investigating the joint effect of AMC and HARQ and modeling the packet multimedia traffic source as a discrete Markov modulated Poisson process (D-MMPP), a four-dimensional discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) is proposed to analyze the system behavior. Based on the stationary state distribution of this Markov chain, system capacity in terms of throughput, delay and packet loss rate is derived in closed-form expressions. Capacity dimensioning results are presented to illustrate the interdependence between system performance and system parameters. Computer simulations are also carried out to verify these results.	advanced mezzanine card;channel capacity;computer simulation;hybrid automatic repeat request;interdependence;markov chain;modulation;network packet;stationary process;stationary state;throughput	Xinsheng Zhao;Hao Liang;Zhenjie Gu	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.86	computer simulation;markov chain;hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Embedded	2.9185106492585255	99.39590426050839	33464

It is therefore challenging to address the mobility management, especially vertical handover in 5G networks. In this paper, an intelligent vertical handover framework is proposed and discussed to simplify the network selection, and to reduce the handover latency and frequency. Integrating Media-independent handover (MIH) and Software-defined network (SDN) technologies, the core of our design is to ensure the handover happens between only two potential networks regardless of the available types of technologies. For this purpose, we exploit three types of handover information with a new pre-selection scheme to eliminate unqualified networks and generate a network ranking. Moreover, with the introduction of steady period, we use the feature of SDN to deliver the best two candidate networks to the two-dimensional (2D) cost function module for the final decision. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can accurately select the optimal network in an efficient manner even if a number of access technologies exist. Furthermore, our framework reduces the vast backhaul traffic during a vertical handover process and keeps the backhaul energy consumption low. Eventually, simulation also shows superiority when the cell sizes are diverse.	backhaul (telecommunications);fifth generation computer;loss function;mimo;overhead (computing);port triggering;requirement;simulation;software-defined networking	Shengdun Hu;Xianbin Wang;Muhammad Zeeshan Shakir	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247072	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;handover;wireless;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	23.32064489727069	90.82148708037593	33505
e88be821e06686f8cd18e53107bc24080baa1c57	stochastic analysis of network coding based relay-assisted i2v communications in intelligent transportation systems		We investigate the information transmission in a typical communication scenario in the intelligent transportation systems (ITS), that is, infrastructures providing ITS services that intend to broadcast independent messages to the vehicles within their coverage areas. Due to the dynamic nature of wireless signal propagation links and interuser interference, it is hard to guarantee satisfactory performance by direct infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) transmissions. To solve this problem, we propose allowing certain vehicles to serve as relays to assist in the information distribution process and applying a class of finite-field network codes to efficiently use the available spectrum resources. Considering that the infrastructure information sources and all vehicles are randomly distributed following Poisson point processes, we model a general urban ITS communication network and based on the stochastic geometry we derive the probability that a vehicle can successfully recover all the desired messages from its serving infrastructure. The analytical and numerical results clearly demonstrate that our proposed network coding based relay-assisted I2V transmission can significantly improve the communication performance of the conventional direct I2V transmission strategy.	linear network coding;relay	Weijun Xing;Fuqiang Liu;Chao Wang;Ping Wang	2017	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2017/5706254	computer science;distributed computing;stochastic geometry;linear network coding;telecommunications network;computer network;wireless;stochastic process;point process;intelligent transportation system;relay	Mobile	16.591802611997576	88.87816150544894	33541

In these retransmission based error recovery schemes, the transmission delay can reach an unacceptable level for traffic with stringent delay constraints in high speed networks because their propagation delay is very large relative to packet transmission times. On the other hand, FEC (forward error correction) adds redundant packets to data ones, all of which are organized into a group called a block, and hence allows the receivers to correct some of the lost packets without retransmissions. This capability is desirable for high speed networks. The authors exactly analyze the distribution of the number of cells lost within a block in ATM networks with correlated cell arrivals, and examine the benefits due to FEC by means of the analysis. >	atm turbo;forward error correction	Kenji Kawahara;Kazumi Kumazoe;Tetsuya Takine;Yuji Oie	1994		10.1109/INFCOM.1994.337575	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;automatic repeat request;transport layer;computer network;retransmission	HPC	-0.9911147033027923	92.8298830716373	33548

Over the years, a lot of research has been performed to identify the causes of these performance related problems. Multiple techniques that can reduce the affects of the problems have been identified, however a solution to the overall problem does not appear to currently exist. This paper details work in progress to continue research in this field. We start by providing a brief background on geostationary satellite links and TCP, before discussing each of the main factors that impact TCP performance. Previous research is discussed and the findings summarised.

Our observations in simulation of TCP and realtime traffic in networks with such small buffers have revealed regions of anomalous performance in which losses for real-time traffic become higher as buffers get larger. The detrimental impact of larger optical buffers is studied in this paper and three new contributions are made. First, we develop a Markov chain model that allows analytical computation of loss. Our model validates observations from simulation, and opens the doors to an analytical understanding of how various factors affect the anomaly. Second, we study the anomaly under realistic traffic mixes containing persistent and non-persistent TCP flows, and show that the traffic mix does not significantly alter the anomaly. Third, we show that larger diversity in packet size between TCP and real-time traffic increases the severity of the anomaly, and is an important consideration when sizing optical switch buffers, particularly since real-time and TCP ACK packets are significantly smaller than the TCP data packets. Our study informs switch manufacturers and network operators of factors to consider when selecting optical buffer sizes in order to achieve desired performance balance between TCP and real-time traffic.	acknowledgement (data networks);anomaly detection;bottleneck (network);computation;experiment;institute for operations research and the management sciences;markov chain;netfpga;network packet;network switch;optical buffer;optical switch;packet switching;queueing theory;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;software bug;throughput	Arun Vishwanath;Vijay Sivaraman;George N.

An arriving cell can be transmitted only if it finds a token in the token buffer, in which case it is transmitted instantaneously by consuming a token. If the token buffer is empty, the cell has to wait until the generation of a new token. For purposes of analysis the authors assume an infinite cell buffer. The control parameter is the token buffer size C. The authors examine the burstiness of the output how as a function of C and show that the burstiness increases with C. In particular the output flow is always less bursty than the input flow. This monotonicity simplifies optimal choice of the token buffer size. The result is true for fairly arbitrary input flows and deterministic token generation times. >	atm turbo;flow control (data);leaky bucket	Venkat Anantharam;Takis Konstantopoulos	1994	IEEE Trans.

66140a41e573b4b70d0a693dfe8bf582ad21cca7	ogcmac: a novel ofdm based group contention mac for vanet control channel		The IEEE 1609.4 standard suggests that the control channel (CCH) should be devoted to the beacon delivery, where the multiple access control (MAC) plays an important role in scheduling the network resources to multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel OFDM-based group contention MAC (OGCMAC) for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), in which a new CCH architecture, a modified multi-carrier burst contention (MCBC) and a group contention strategy are established. The CCH architecture is proposed to reduce the resource consumption of contention windows (CWs). Based on the proposed architecture, MCBC is modified to adapt to VANETs. The proposed CCH architecture supports parallel contention mechanisms and allows losers to change their target resource blocks (RBs) during the modified MCBC. Furthermore, to accelerate the RB assignment, a group contention strategy is developed by dividing the entire frame into several groups with different sizes. With the objective to maximize the ratio of the RBs allocated free of collisions within a single frame, a greedy group partition algorithm is proposed to determine the appropriate group sizes according to the MCBC capability. Evaluations are done to validate the proposed mechanism. Results show that OGCMAC achieves the highest throughput among all the evaluated MACs, because of its high channel usage rate. RBs are allocated faster by employing the proposed optimal group contention policy. It is also shown that the proposed greedy group partition algorithm can reduce the resource waste by properly adopting the existing CWs without extra resource consumption.	access control;elegant degradation;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);microsoft windows;rx microcontroller family;resource contention;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;speedup;throughput	Y.

In this paper, we thus focus on the design of a smart metering network (SMN) for a future scenario where data from residences/customer premises are dominated by electric vehicle charging traffic. Therefore, the well-suited multiple access control (MAC) protocol design for such event-driven data is an emerging research area. However, because the number of smart meters (communication nodes) involved in such a single SMN is much larger than those in today's local area networks, the traditional random access MAC protocol is unlikely to perform well. In order to solve this problem, we propose two grouping-based MAC protocols, namely, TDMA-DCF and group leader DCF-TDMA schemes, in this paper. These two schemes are directed at 802.11-type networks operating at frequencies below 1 GHz, which has been adopted by a new IEEE 802.11ah standardization task group. We also conduct the comprehensive throughput and delay analysis on these schemes for unsaturated traffic conditions and hidden node events. The numerical results show that these two grouping-based MAC protocols significantly outperform the traditional random access protocol DCF in a densely populated network with large coverage such as SMN.	access control;communications protocol;design rule for camera file system;event-driven finite-state machine;extended validation certificate;numerical analysis;population;random access;smart meter;smn theorem;throughput;whole earth 'lectronic link	Sumit Roy	2014	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2014.2332047	media access control;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	20.11811142899929	90.77536923024834	33864

The SU maintains a finite energy queue and harvests energy from natural resources, e.g., solar, wind and acoustic noise. We propose a probabilistic access strategy by the SU based on the number of packets at its energy queue. In particular, when the energy queue is in a certain state, the SU probabilistically uses a total number of energy packets that is at most equal to the number of packets at its energy queue. The probability of using certain amount of energy in a given state is optimizable. We investigate the effect of the energy arrival rate, the amount of energy per energy packet, and the capacity of the energy queue on the SU throughput under fading channels.	acoustic cryptanalysis;cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;maximum throughput scheduling;network packet;power supply;queueing theory;rechargeable battery;superuser	Ahmed El Shafie;Mahmoud Ashour;Amr Mohamed;Tamer Khattab	2015	2015 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069348	bernoulli process;markov chain;throughput;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;probabilistic logic;markov process;energy harvesting;wireless;statistics;computer network	Metrics	18.743885330860135	92.7537077111341	33905

This can result in significant degradation in the performance (goodput) of TCP over wireless networks since non-congestion related packet losses can be misinterpreted by TCP as indications of network congestion, resulting in unnecessary congestion control. In this paper, we propose a technique, TCP with adaptive forward error correction (TCP-AFEC), to improve TCP performance over wireless networks. TCP-AFEC combines the well-established performance characterization of TCP with an understanding of the link layer error control scheme to dynamically select the forward error correction (FEC) that maximizes TCP goodput according to the current channel condition. The benefit of coupling a characterization of TCP performance with link layer FEC to improve TCP goodput is demonstrated by comparing the performance of TCP-AFEC against those of TCP-SACK and Snoop. Simulation results show that TCP-AFEC outperforms TCP-SACK and Snoop for a wide range of wireless channel conditions.	analog front-end;bit error rate;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;forward error correction;goodput;internet protocol suite;network congestion;network packet;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link;snoop	Benyuan Liu;Dennis Goeckel;Donald F.

23bf6da9dca204807455ecd38585fbc2a8be0566	characterization of large-scale smtp traffic: the coexistence of the poisson process and self-similarity	internet;stochastic processes;exponential distribution;heavy tail;poisson process;hurst parameter;internet traffic;servers;world wide web;protocols;correlation;self similarity	Network traffic such as Ethernet, Internet, World Wide Web, and TCP/UDP protocols has been extensively studied, with efforts focusing on the Poisson process and self-similarity. However, although SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) occupies a significant portion of Internet traffic, it has attracted little attention. This paper shows that large-scale SMTP traffic possesses both the characteristics of the Poisson process and self-similarity through an analysis of high quality SMTP traces collected from one of the largest Web portal sites in South Korea over a period of almost nine months. First, we show that, at small (several-second) time scales, interarrival times of SMTP session arrivals are exponentially distributed and independent of each other, which makes it possible to model SMTP session arrivals as a Poisson process. On the contrary, at large (several-month) time scales, SMTP session arrivals exhibit self-similarity. They are strongly autocorrelated across time scales of days and their Hurst parameters are estimated to be somewhere between 0.85 to 0.97. In addition, we find that SMTP traffic consists of many individual ON/OFF sources whose distributions of OFF-period lengths are heavy-tailed, which confirms self-similarity of SMTP traffic.	autocorrelation;benchmark (computing);chi;coexist (image);display resolution;email;hurst exponent;internet;multiplexing;network traffic control;pareto efficiency;self-similarity;server (computing);time complexity;tracing (software);world wide web	Youngjae Lee;Jin-Soo Kim	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computers and Telecommunication Systems		exponential distribution;stochastic process;communications protocol;the internet;internet traffic;poisson process;telecommunications;heavy-tailed distribution;self-similarity;computer science;hurst exponent;world wide web;correlation;server;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-2.701450175218421	99.32475673255463	34161

However, the IEEE 802.11 DCF in a multiple-rate environment may cause a performance anomaly. There have been many studies about the performance analysis and improvement of singleand multi-rate WLAN systems. However, there were a few studies about a generalized analysis on throughput and channel utilization for successful transmissions in multi-rate WLAN systems with different frame parameters and channel errors. In particular, the performance anomaly problem of the multi-rate WLANs still needs to be solved. We propose a more generalized mathematical model for each station with a different data transmission time and mathematically analyze the throughput and channel utilization for successful transmission in error-prone multi-rate WLANs. Moreover, we propose a contention window size adjustment scheme and a payload adjustment scheme to resolve the well-known performance anomaly problem in multirate WLANs by achieving temporal fairness. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme is very effective in achieving temporal fairness.	anomaly detection;cognitive dimensions of notations;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;mathematical model;phy (chip);simulation;throughput;whole earth 'lectronic link	Byoung Hoon Jung;Seong Joon Kim;Hu Jin;Ho Young Hwang;Jo Woon Chong;Dan Keun Sung	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199328	payload;throughput;real-time computing;degradation;telecommunications;computer science;mathematical model;signal-to-noise ratio;fading;physical layer;computer network;data transmission	Embedded	7.2484685495054855	94.8307386534228	34220

Both ZigBee networking (NWK) and IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer protocols are implemented on a single M16C microprocessor. Transport layer functionalities such as fragmentation and reassembly are performed at the application layer, since the ZigBee NWK does not have a fragmentation support.

This paper presents an analytical model for spectrum handoff probability and spectrum handoff rate for CRNs under general distribution of call holding time of secondary users (SUs). The standardized analytical forms of spectrum handoff probability and handoff rate of secondary network under negotiated scenario are derived for a complete service call duration. The effect of mobility parameters: departure rate of SUs ($$upmu )$$μ) and departure rate of spectrum holes ($$uplambda )$$ź) on spectrum handoff are also reported in this paper. Extensive results for all the proposed analytical models are obtained and presented in this paper. Analytical results show that exponential and Erlangian distribution functions are not suitable for call holding time of SU in the analysis of spectrum handoff in CRNs. Moreover, the superiority of lognormal distribution function ascertains its use for call holding time of SU in spectrum handoff estimation for better CRN performances. The Monte-Carlo simulation is also performed for spectrum handoff probability to validate the analytical model.	cognitive radio;monte carlo method;network performance;profiling (computer programming);simulation;superuser;time complexity	Shanidul Hoque;Wasim Arif	2017	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-017-0283-6	handover;real-time computing;cognitive radio;computer network;computer science;expected value;network performance;laplace transform;distribution function;log-normal distribution;call duration	Networks	6.20893847717447	100.02743688922853	34441
1f6c67873f58a5a952232f70fc15162f3e88de2f	a novel cognitive architecture for qos/qoe management in nextg networks based on q-learning and r-mlp approaches	sensors;computer architecture;engines;cognitive radio;cognition;quality of service;next generation networking	Next Generation Networks (NGN) principle or 5G technology, is based on the integration of heterogeneous wireless systems and cognitive networks. NGN is expected to have Quality of Service (QoS) as the major challenging issue. More specifically, NGN aims at providing guaranteed QoS levels and Quality of Experience (QoE), especially for multimedia services. However, with the increase in number of connections, services and data amounts, it becomes crucial to ensure an intelligent network management to ensure target goals. This paper proposes a novel cognitive radio network architecture for the management of cognitive networks and 5G technology. The goal of the proposed architecture consists on using artificial intelligence with learning capabilities to optimize network management decisions. The proposed architecture consists of 4 main states: sensing, decision management, action, and learning. It provides the functionality to manage cognitive components and facilitate the interfaces between the network and its surrounding environment. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed architecture, we present simulation results and comparison with existing load balancing method in terms of throughput, latency and QoE.	artificial intelligence;cognitive architecture;cognitive network;cognitive radio;computer simulation;download;intelligent network;knowledge base;load balancing (computing);machine learning;memory-level parallelism;network architecture;next-generation network;performance;q-learning;quality of service;semantic reasoner;throughput	Aymen Ben Zineb;Mohamed Ayadi;Sami Tabbane	2016	2016 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577176	embedded system;cognitive radio;simulation;cognition;cognitive network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;computer security;computer network	Robotics	9.179680836665845	97.983289588015	34463
36228a15098b37c92598906e3bf4d02c4e5d1d4c	a high-throughput fine-grained rate adaptive transmission scheme for a leo satellite communication system		In order to make full use of the transmission capability of the LEO satellite channel, this paper proposes a variable rate adaptive transmission scheme. We adopt rateless spinal codes to achieve a fine-grained bit rate and adopt the truncated incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request (IR- HARQ) protocol to shorten the transmission delay of a certain message. A variable rate allocation (VRA) algorithm is proposed which uses the probability distribution of the number of symbols needed for successful decoding (the decoding CDF) of a packet and a dynamic programming strategy to calculate the optimal bit rate in every transmission attempt. Simulation results show that our proposed adaptive transmission scheme can increase average throughput by about 5.5% and 8.6% compared with the digital video broadcasting second generation (DVB-S2) standard when maximum transmission times are $K=2$ and $K=3$ respectively.	algorithm;code;communications satellite;dvb-s2;digital video broadcasting;dynamic programming;hybrid automatic repeat request;network packet;simulation;throughput	Hongxiu Bian;Rongke Liu;Xiaoyan Shi;Jhon Thompson	2018	2018 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)	10.1109/AHS.2018.8541475	real-time computing;throughput;redundancy (engineering);decoding methods;transmission delay;hybrid automatic repeat request;computer science;network packet;transmission (mechanics);communication channel	Mobile	11.669828034977874	95.09955478547131	34483

The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technique has been accepted as a basis for future B-ISDN networks. In ATM networks, all information is packetized and transfered in small packets of fixed length, called cells. The packetized information transfer, without flow control between the user and the network and the use of statistical multiplexing, results in a need of a Policing Mechanism (PM) to control the traffic parameters of each virtual connection in order to guarantee the required Quality of Service (QoS). Policing of the peak cell rate is generally not complex. The control of the mean cell rate is more difficult, but is intended to improve the link utilization when it has to handle bursty traffic sources. Conventional PMs, such as the Leaky Bucket Mechanism (LBM) and the Window Mechanisms (WMs), are not well suited to the bursty nature of sources supported by ATM networks, therefore intelligent PMs are needed. In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Policing Mechanism (FPM) to police the mean cell rate of the still picture source. We consider the case when the peak cell rate of the still picture source is not controlled separately by other PMs. The performance evaluation via simulations shows that the FPM efficiently controls the mean cell rate of the still picture source. The FPM has better responsiveness and selectivity characteristics than the LBM.

The channel reuse of this method is an new alternative compared to TDMA, FDMA and CDMA Multiple-Access schemes. In CDPA a single frequency channel is used and parallel transmissions are achieved through the “capture” capability of receivers. CDPA integrates the multiple access and channel reuse issues to achieve a high degree of spectral efficiency. It allows each user to access the entire channel, for brief periods of time. Spectrum sharing is done by exploiting the different path losses suffered by the various signals as they appear at the base stations (BS). Packets that are not captured are almost immediately retransmitted. Need for extra radio traffic in hand over is eliminated, as CDPA is a connectionless approach with any BS. In this paper, the CDPA method has been simulated under various system parameters and its performance is analyzed.	channel (communications);connectionless communication;network packet;packet switching;profiling (computer programming);spectral efficiency	S.

Hence, most of the works are devoted to developing safety-message dissemination algorithms. However, non-safety applications can also contribute to the network efficiency by exchanging traffic information. To support these applications, VANETs adopt the wireless access in the vehicular environment (WAVE) to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) using four different access categories. However, the WAVE could not provide the QoS to the users due to the collisions caused by the small contention-window size for the top priority traffic when top-priority traffic is dominant. Therefore, this small contention-window size setting for the prioritization induces severe performance degradation. In this paper, the Dynamic Service-Channels Allocation (DSCA) method is proposed to maximize throughput by dynamically assigning different service channels to the users. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulation works suggest that the DSCA improves the average throughput by 22% over the uniform channel allocation method. Moreover, the DSCA can be easily implemented in real devices without any protocol modifications.	algorithm;deterministic algorithm;elegant degradation;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);markov chain;priority queue;procedural generation;quality of service;random access;real-time clock;simulation;throughput;transceiver;web traffic	Sungjin Park;Yusun Chang;Faisal Khan;John A.

The goal of the proposed scheme is to provide QoS (in terms of packet delivery probability) to the nodes in such a network, where the existing schemes like polling or scheduled transmissions, CSMA and ARQ will be ineffective because of the unavailability of a receiver module at the nodes. The proposed scheme uses distributed control and allows the nodes to transmit each packet an optimal number of times at random instants in time within the packet generation interval. We define two optimization problems based on minimizing total network traffic and maximizing the delivery probability of the class of nodes requiring the highest QoS, respectively, and develop mathematical formulae and efficient algorithms to solve them. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that our scheme can provide high QoS to networks of different sizes.	access control;acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;automatic repeat request;distributed control system;mathematical optimization;network packet;network traffic control;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quality of service;radio-frequency identification;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter;unavailability	Jia Zhao;Seokhoon Yoon;Chunming Qiao;Raghuram S.

Firstly, several high performance algorithms (offline and online) are developed for efficient performance in multiple user and multiple channel environment under the practicable lookahead prediction of one time slot. Secondly, the presented algorithms and heuristics are shown to be competitive by deterministic and probabilistic analyses. Our results show that a modest consumption of resources for channel prediction and link adaptation may result in a significant throughput improvement.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;heuristic (computer science);mobile app;multi-user;np-completeness;non-functional requirement;online and offline;parsing;quality of service;scheduling (computing);throughput	Amrinder Arora;Fanchun Jin;Gokhan Sahin;Hosam Mahmoud;Hyeong-Ah Choi	2006	Acta Informatica	10.1007/s00236-006-0012-1	heuristic;online algorithm;link adaptation;network analysis;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;wireless network;penalty method;algorithm;adaptation	AI	3.843801602618661	103.49249943473501	34648

A main QoS requirement is the cell loss ratio (CLR). We need a real-time expression for the CLR calculation in ATM networks where the statistical multiplexing is an important factor. The existing analytical methods for the CLR estimation are mostly based on fluid-flow and stationary approximate models. In this paper, we first evaluate these methods against the results obtained through simulation. The simulation is done at the cell level that provides very accurate results with buffer size as a variant. It is shown that the CLR estimation based on existing analytical models are widely overestimated. We have, then, proposed three new approaches that yield significant improvement in the accuracy of the CLR approximation. First, we have found global correction coefficients to compensate for the error of the current analytical methods. Second, we have proposed a new upper bound based on exact modeling of system behavior in the finite buffer case. This is a novel approach that combines fluid-flow and stationary approximate models and outperforms all the previous ones. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified by simulation. Third, we have found a tight piece-wise linear approximation that can be calculated in real-time. We have studied application of these bounds in non-homogeneous as well as homogeneous cases. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The proposed analysis approach takes into account not only the characteristics of the physical layer to support arbitrary BER models, but also the nodal architecture design at higher layers. In particular, we investigate the effects of packet corruption, channel collision, and destination contention on network performance, and obtain steady-state estimation for effective throughput. This throughput estimation sets a tight upper bound for achievable throughput in OCDMA networks with random access schemes. The proposed analytic approach leads to results consistent with simulation experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by analyzing a representative OCDMA scheme with various system parameters. The derived performance metrics have proven effective in characterizing the OCDMA network dynamics.	experiment;network packet;network performance;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);random access;simulation;steady state;throughput;x.690	Fei Xue;Zhi Jun Ding;S.

The definition of management information is proposed to represent, in accordance with international standards, a virtual path with the protection mechanism. To achieve accurate representation, the proposed method features the two distinct managed object classes derived from the “trail” concept, which has been specified in ITU-TS recommendations. The allocation of management information is optimized by using computer simulations. The criterion for the optimization is the rapidity of tracking the change-over/back and setting up a virtual path. The system that exchanges messages and updates management information is modeled as a queueing system to evaluate the rapidity. Several alternative allocation methods are compared, and the best method is determined.	atm turbo;computer simulation;management information system;mathematical optimization;path protection;protection mechanism;queueing theory	Satoru Ohta;Nobuo Fujii	1993	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/BF01036829	computer simulation;network management;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;internal standard;computer security;computer network;broadband networks	HPC	-2.3999603795177156	105.21250843958263	34926
5b8946bd444279e3a135a52daa432505e2fab59b	congestion-control throwdown		Congestion control is a perennial topic of networking research. In making decisions about who sends data when, congestion-control schemes prevent collapses and ultimately determine the allocation of scarce communications resources among contending users and applications.  The field has seen considerable recent activity. Even after three decades of research, basic principles and techniques remain up for debate. In this throwdown-as-paper, the authors find themselves at loggerheads over the fundamental tenets of congestion control.	control theory;network congestion	Michael Schapira;Keith Winstein	2017		10.1145/3152434.3152446	computer science;computer network;distributed computing;network congestion	Networks	12.318120801483332	92.72747274266807	35053

In this scheme, visual entropy is employed as a video quality metric in agreement with the human visual system (HVS), and the associated visual weight is used to obtain a set of optimal powers in the MIMO system for maximizing the visual quality of the reconstructed video. For ease of cross-layer optimization, the video sequence is divided into several streams, and the visual importance of each stream is quantified using the visual weight. Moreover, an adaptive load balance control, named equal termination scheduling (ETS), is proposed to improve the throughput of visually important data with higher priority. An optimal solution for power allocation is derived as a closed form using a Lagrangian relaxation method. In the simulation results, a highly improved visual quality is demonstrated in the reconstructed video via the cross-layer approach by means of visual entropy.	automated planning and scheduling;cognitive dimensions of notations;data compression;enterprise test software;human visual system model;image quality;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mimo;mathematical optimization;network packet;relaxation (approximation);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;wavelet	Hyungkeuk Lee;Sungho Jeon	2008	EURASIP J.

The key determinant factor in driving the throughput improvement is the degree of simultaneity achieved in the relay scheme. In this paper, we propose a new TWR protocol named interference cancellation TWR (IC-TWR), which combines network coding, spatial diversity, and IC techniques to arrive at high degree of simultaneity and in the meanwhile to relax the requirement on channel state information as compared with TWR schemes based on amplify-and-forward. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed IC-TWR is uniformly advantageous over the traditional decode-and-forward scheme in terms of system throughput and end-to-end delay. The proposed scheme may be useful for system designers of high-speed multimedia applications in wireless mobile networks, wireless cellular networks, wireless sensor networks, and so on.

On Ethernet, any Network Interface Card (NIC) can try to send a packet in a channel at any time. If another NIC tries to send a packet at the same time, a collision is said to occur and the packets are discarded. The CSMA/CD protocol was designed to avoid this problem, more precisely to allow a NIC to send its packet without collision. This is done by way of a randomized exponential backoff process. In this paper, we analyse the correctness of the CSMA/CD protocol, using techniques from probabilistic model checking and approximate probabilistic model checking. The tools that we use are PRISM and APMC. Moreover, we provide a quantitative analysis of some CSMA/CD properties.	approximation algorithm;collision detection;correctness (computer science);exponential backoff;model checking;network interface controller;network packet;prism (surveillance program);randomized algorithm;statistical model;time complexity	Marie Duflot;Laurent Fribourg;Thomas Hérault;Richard Lassaigne;Frédéric Magniette;Stéphane Messika;Sylvain Peyronnet;Claudine Picaronny	2005	Electr.

The proposed packet loss propagation model takes into account the link packet drop rate, peer dynamics, and forward error correction protection to capture the heterogeneous packet loss behavior of individual substreams transmitted over a mesh network. The evaluation of candidate peers' contributions is modeled through Markov random fields to significantly reduce complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our peer selection scheme significantly mitigates packet loss in a mesh-based P2P network, compared to other state-of-the-art schemes.	approximation algorithm;error detection and correction;forward error correction;markov chain;markov random field;mesh networking;network packet;peer-to-peer;propagation of uncertainty;simulation;software propagation;streaming media	Chi-Wen Lo;Chia-Wen Lin;Yung-Chang Chen;Jen-Yu Yu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2202072	stochastic process;design;throughput;telecommunications;transmission;computer science;distributed computing;forward error correction;packet loss;statistics;computer network	Metrics	1.9044680941771162	90.36176884279874	35628

The fairness cycle size is determined by the number of communication links involved in every instance of the fairness algorithm (several identical fairness algorithms can be executed concurrently on the same ring). The study compares three fairness algorithms with different cycle sizes: the Globalcycle algorithm (implemented in the Serial Storage Architecture SSA) in which the cycle size is equal to the number N of links in the ring; the Variable-cycle algorithm in which its cycle size changes between 1 and N links; the Onecycle, where there is a fairness cycle on every link. It is shown how varying the cycle size affects the network performance with respect to the Max-Min optimal fairness criterion. The results show that for non-homogeneous traffic patterns, decreasing the fairness cycle size, while increasing the complexity, can significantly improve the performance with respect to the Max-Min optimal fairness criterion.	algorithm;blum axioms;computational complexity theory;fairness measure;network performance;throughput	Giuseppe Anastasi;Luciano Lenzini;Yoram Ofek	2001	Microprocessors and Microsystems	10.1016/S0141-9331(00)00107-1	fairness measure;ring network;real-time computing;max-min fairness;computer science;theoretical computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;network performance;computer network	Theory	16.14233131608763	91.13321047187121	35735

In this paper, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the maximum achievable transmitter throughput (i.e., the capacity) of such networks, in the presence of multicast traffic. Furthermore, the mean access delay of a multicast packet is investigated by means of an approximate approach. The approach is based on the discrete Geom/Geom/1 queue and on the computation of blocking probabilities. The analysis is validated by simulations and the impact of self-similar traffic is shown. This work offers an important and simple analytical tool to compare the impact of multicast on access delays and multicast capacity in future slotted ring networks. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our contributions are threefold as follows. Firstly, we derive the closed-form expressions of throughput gains for primary channel establishment from multi-band selection using the optimal skipping rule, which balances the throughput gain from finding a good quality band with the overhead of measuring multiple bands. Secondly, in order to satisfy the quality of service of overlapping BSS users, we design a space interference avoidance mechanism, which can improve the system throughput for the whole dense WLANs. Thirdly, in order to further improve the transmission performance of dense BSS networks, we propose an unequal bandwidth transmission mechanism based on the VHT WLANs, which can not only clear the redundant network allocation vector duration timely but also use the limited bandwidth efficiently. The proposed protocols and mechanisms exploit both time and frequency diversity sufficiently, and are shown to result in typical throughput gains compared with the traditional IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol.

While most previous studies of real-time systems measure loss as a time-average fraction of excessively delayed packets, this paper characterizes the stochastic properties of time-out loss periods for inn-nite queues, that is, uninterrupted intervals during which the virtual wait is at or above some xed threshold. We present analytic expressions and numerical techniques for computing both \time-based"""" measures such as the distribution of periods during which all arriving packets are lost due to excessive delay as well as \packet-based"""" measures such as the distribution of the number of consecutively lost packets and the number of successful packets between such periods of loss. Both continuous and discrete-time systems are examined. It is shown that the assumption of random packet loss severely underestimates the number of consecutively lost packets. Also, the loss period is found to be independent of the waiting time threshold for the G/M/1 queue and D Geo] =D=1 queue, with very little innuence for other queueing models."""	network packet;numerical analysis;queueing theory;real-time clock;real-time computing	Henning Schulzrinne;James F.

5407458bbb29d8694b7e6ef59776c4b06c3419d6	security-aware routing for artificial-noise-aided multi-hop secondary communications		Physical layer security (PLS) has emerged as a promising technique to guarantee the secrecy of wireless communication against eavesdroppers. Although extensive studies have been devoted to the PLS-based transmission design, the combination of this physical layer technique and network layer mechanisms such as routing still remains an open problem. This paper concentrates on the security issue for the cognitive radio networks. Specifically, we focus on the routing protocol design for the artificial-noise-aided multi-hop multi-antenna secondary communication against randomly distributed eavesdroppers. We first derive the closed-form expression of secure connection probability (SCP) for a single hop link. We optimize the power allocation between the information signal and artificial noise to obtain the maximum SCP of each link. Then a secure routing problem is formulated whose objective is to find the multi-hop path having the highest secrecy throughput. An optimal routing strategy based on a revised Bellman-Ford algorithm is proposed. We also propose a suboptimal strategy based on the Dijkstra algorithm with lower complexity. From numerical results we find that the selected route always makes a detour around the primary user to enhance the secrecy throughput.	bellman–ford algorithm;cognitive radio;communications protocol;confidentiality;cryptographic protocol;dijkstra's algorithm;numerical analysis;one-class classification;randomness;routing;throughput;transmitter	Qian Xu;Pinyi Ren;Hongliang He;Dongyang Xu	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377033	computer network;secrecy;throughput;hop (networking);network layer;physical layer;cognitive radio;dijkstra's algorithm;routing protocol;computer science	Mobile	12.610587976573632	92.0571276075225	36242

Nonetheless, previous research has often neglected to take into account their temporal properties, which in many real scenarios play a pivotal role. Mainly because of mobility, transmission delays or protocol design, a communication network should not be considered only as a static entity. At the same time, network robustness has come extensively under scrutiny. Understanding whether networked systems can undergo structural damage and yet perform efficiently is crucial to both their protection against failures and to the design of new applications. In spite of this, it is still unclear what type of resilience we may expect in a network that continuously changes over time. In this work we present the first attempt to define the concept of temporal network robustness: we describe a measure of network robustness for time-varying networks and we show how it performs on different classes of random models by means of analytical and numerical evaluation. Particularly, we show how static approximation can wrongly indicate high robustness of fragile networks when adopted in mobile time-varying networks, while a temporal approach captures more accurately the system performance.	approximation;communications protocol;complex network;network performance;network theory;numerical analysis;robustness of complex networks;simulation;telecommunications network;time-varying network	Salvatore Scellato;Ilias Leontiadis;Cecilia Mascolo;Prithwish Basu;Murtaza Zafer	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935006	passive optical network;computer science;dynamic network analysis;theoretical computer science;operating system;network simulation;distributed computing;mobile computing;robustness;computer network	Metrics	5.47628392228378	89.75158798380981	36382

Both of these mathematical programs have identical structure.

89df2f9020020ac870e984dd8d665037ed2e424d	interference coordination schemes for wireless mobile advanced systems: a survey		Mobile communication networks have witnessed a perpetual evolution since their launching as voice only networks. In the few past years, the focus was addressed to high data rate networks that offer high quality of service. The lately released LTE-Advanced network was the first to completely fulfill 4G requirements. However, performance gains remain limited due to severe interference levels. This paper is a survey upon the evolution of interference mitigation solutions from Release 8 to Release 11. This problem was addressed since earlier releases by coordinating transmission/reception among different cells. Many enhancements were then carried out by each subsequent specification. The originality of this work resides on the comparison between the different schemes and the perspective of developing a new interference coordination method available for 4G and beyond systems with small cells deployment. Several similarities are noted and differences on performance impact are highlighted.	compaq lte;data rate units;display resolution;interference (communication);quality of service;requirement;self-organization;software deployment;telecommunications network;throughput	Maïssa Boujelben;Sonia Ben Rejeb;Sami Tabbane	2014	CoRR	10.9790/2834-09168090	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	22.90862775152615	89.16953746069937	36588
5b96a27afd6412715e781d8671385f9e7646a686	predicting temporal social contact patterns for data forwarding in opportunistic mobile networks		In this paper, we predict nodes’ social contact patterns from the temporal perspective, and propose a novel approach to improve the performance of data forwarding in opportunistic mobile networks (OMNs). Specifically, considering both the average separating time and the variance of the separating time, we first introduce the definition of temporal closeness and temporal centrality. Then, several intuitive prediction methods are designed to predict nodes’ future temporal social contact patterns based on the observations from extensive real trace-driven simulation results. Afterward, based on the predicted temporal social contact patterns, we propose an efficient temporal closeness and centrality-based data forwarding strategy named TCCB for OMNs. The core idea of TCCB is to capture and utilize the temporal correlations to infer the future temporal social contact patterns in the remaining valid time of the data. Finally, extensive real trace-driven simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of TCCB. The results show that TCCB is close to Epidemic in terms of delivery ratio but with significantly reduced delivery cost. Furthermore, TCCB performs much better than Bubble Rap and Prophet in terms of delivery ratio, but the delivery cost of TCCB is very close to that of Bubble Rap.	centrality;dot-com bubble;operand forwarding;simulation;valid time	Huan Zhou;Victor C.

We extend such distributed TDMA approaches to multiple channels (frequencies). This is achieved by extending the concept of collaborative reactive listening in order to balance the number of nodes in all available channels. We prove the stability of the new protocol and estimate the delay until the balanced system state is reached.

181155dcccffca79cb1f62b2b736465878c5da03	adaptive cooperative communication for maximizing reliability and reward in ultra-dense small cells lte-a toward 5g cellular networking	toward 5g;lte-advanced;hetnets;small cells;multi-cell cooperative communication;dual connectivity	The Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) release 12 specification proposes the small cell enhancement technology that can increase system capacity in the indoor/outdoor hotspots, increase wireless coverage, improve signal quality, reduce the eNB deployment cost, etc. By deploying several small cells in the original LTE-A network, it forms a Heterogeneous Network (HetNets) for achieving cooperative communications. Although the small cell-based HetNets brings above-mentioned advantages, HetNets suffers from increasing interference yielded by neighbor small cells, yielding more inter-cell and intra-cell handoffs, etc. Definitely, several critical issues should be addressed effectively, including 1) the inter-cell interference among several neighbor small cells, 2) the issue of cell selection with a various-scale cells cooperation, 3) the multi-cell cooperative communication for minmizing carrying and maximizing bringing reward, and 4) improving LTE-A radio Resource Block (RB) utilization. This paper thus proposes the Adaptive Cooperative communication for Ultra-Dense LTE-A toward 5G HetNets (namely ACU). The contributions of ACU include: 1) the link reliability determination of the cooperative candidate cells (LRP), 2) Adaptive maximum throughput and QoS-based real-time priority for UEs (AMP), and 3) the Cost-Reward-based optimal Cooperative Communication (CRCC). Numerical results show that ACU outperforms the compared approaches in system capacity, RB loading, net-profit, reward, average packet dropping probability and average packet delay.	compaq lte	Ben-Jye Chang;Syuan-Hong Liou	2017	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2017.01.014	simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Metrics	23.560515098139987	90.79445742734727	36851
fdba882358b7ad056d8e0c10caf6a5fce8ffd223	http/2 performance evaluation with latency and packet losses		A new version of hypertext transfer protocol HTTP/2 was proposed. The protocol is expected to solve the Head of Line (HOL) blocking problem with a single TCP connection. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of HTTP/2 communication with a variety of conditions. We then show that HTTP/2 with a single connection can provide performances similar to those of HTTP/1.1 with multiple connections in many cases. In addition, we show also that HTTP/2 cannot present comparable performance in a network with high latency and high packet loss ratio.	blocking (computing);hol (proof assistant);http/2;hypertext transfer protocol;network packet;performance evaluation	Naoki Oda;Saneyasu Yamaguchi	2018	2018 15th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2018.8319285	the internet;latency (engineering);computer network;http/2;packet loss;hypertext transfer protocol;network packet;hol;computer science;distributed computing;server	Networks	-4.163367538311023	92.96980878244067	36923

Our goal is to maximize data throughput and fairness among mobile users. We formulate packet scheduling as a constrained integer optimization problem, modelling the constraints arising from data rate requirements, power budgets and interference limitations. Given the objective of maximizing the overall carried traffic in a given sector of a cell and power limitations in the neighboring sectors, joint optimization of resource utilization'to control packet flow among the interdependent neighboring sectors is considered, and shown to provide higher performance compared to separate optimization in which each sector attempts to maximize the utilization of the available resources under in-cell and out-of-cell power limitations, without taking into account the traffic load among the adjacent sectors.	expectation–maximization algorithm;network packet;telecommunications link;throughput	Christian Makaya;Sonia Aïssa	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45076-4_31	optimization problem;code division multiple access;constrained optimization;active traffic management;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;scheduling;packet switching;computer network	Mobile	3.3734255521225074	102.81886728974033	36926

In [2] a general approach to address the propblem of fairness is proposed. This approach defines a fairness index and the goal is to minimize this fairness index to achieve fairness. in this paper we propose a fairness index by taking into account both node’s data traffic and routed data traffic of the other nodes for each node and we can easily verify that the fairness index defined in this paper is always lower or equal to the fairness index defined in [2].	access control;fairness measure;routing	Kamal Mehaoued;Larbi Sekhri;Malika Bourenane	2014			fairness measure;access control;vehicular ad hoc network;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;mobile ad hoc network;computer network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;optimized link state routing protocol;computer science;wireless ad hoc network	DB	7.332975081994745	90.35434099666796	37132

In this paper we present a performance comparison of three distinct EUL scheduling schemes (one-by-one, partial parallel and full parallel) taking into account both the packet level characteristics and the flow level dynamics due to the random user behavior. For that purpose, we develop a hybrid analytical/simulation approach allowing for fast evaluation of performance measures such as mean file transfer time and fairness expressing how the performance depends on the user’s location.	best-effort delivery;channel capacity;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;file transfer;interaction;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;mogensen–scott encoding;multi-user;network packet;network scheduler;numerical analysis;open biomedical ontologies;pp (complexity);scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;viz: the computer game	Desislava C.

In a PR network, a single high-speed wideband channel is shared by all PR stations. When a time-division multi-access protocol is used, the access to the channel by stations’ transmissions must be properly scheduled in both time and space domains in order to avoid collisions or interferences. It is proven in this paper that such a scheduling problem is NP-complete. Therefore, an efficient polynomial algorithm rarely exists, and a mean field annealing-based algorithm is proposed to schedule the stations’ transmissions in a frame consisting of certain number of time slots. Numerical examples and comparisons with some existing scheduling algorithms have shown that the proposed scheme can find near-optimal solutions with reasonable computational complexity. Both time delay and channel utilization are calculated based on the found schedules.	algorithm;broadcast delay;computational complexity theory;mean field annealing;np-completeness;network packet;packet switching;polynomial;radio broadcasting;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;throughput	Gangsheng Wang;Nirwan Ansari	1997	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.552074	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;artificial neural network;computer network	Mobile	4.026555130946546	93.95223981679182	37332

This deficiency can be resolved by so-called delay-tolerant networking which exploits the mobility of the nodes by letting them operate as relays according to the store-carry-and-forward paradigm. In this work, we analyze the delay performance of a small mobile ad hoc network by considering a tandem queueing system. We present an exact packet-level analysis by applying ideas from the polling literature. Due to the state-space expansion, this analysis cannot efficiently be applied for all model parameter settings. For this reason, an analytical approximation is constructed and its excellent performance has extensively been validated. Numerical results on the mean end-to-end delay show that the switch-over time distribution impacts this metric only through its first two moments. Finally, we study delay optimization under power control.	alfa (xacml);angular defect;approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;bandlimiting;coexist (image);communications of the acm;computer performance;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;fitness approximation;heuristic;hoc (programming language);international federation for information processing;iteration;load balancing (computing);mathematical optimization;memorandum;naval research logistics;network packet;numerical recipes;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;palm os;polling (computer science);programming paradigm;queueing theory;randomness;relay;routing;server (computing);state space;switchover;tandem computers;time complexity;timer;toeplitz hash algorithm	Ahmad Al Hanbali;Roland de Haan;Richard J.

The results indicate that a Poisson assumption for the internal data arrivals is reasonable. With this assumption, the mean queue analysis at an individual node can be separated from the rest of the network, so that solution of the entire network can be obtained by combining the separate solutions. >	simulation	San-qi Li;Jon W.

It has been reported that there occurs unfairness between downlink and uplink in the 802.11 WLAN. This is mainly caused by CSMA/CA employed in DCF. All stations including an AP fairly compete for shared wireless medium. Thus, in particular, the unfairness has an adverse impact on bi-directional voice calls. Downlink voice connections become a primary factor to limit voice capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel medium access protocol, so called DCFmm, in order to improve QoS of downlink voice traffic as well as fairness between bi-directional voice connections. DCFmm is designed to enhance 802.11 DCF, and is fully compatible with the legacy DCF. In addition, it requires only protocol modifications of an AP. Thus, it can be easily implemented into existing 802.11 WLANs. DCFmm is compared with two conventional techniques through computer simulations. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed DCFmm can improve fairness between downlink and uplink, and consequently, support larger number of voice calls than DCF.

Recently average queueing delay of ErtPS algorithm for VoIP service was investigated, and it was shown that ErtPS allows to admit more users than UGS algorithm. But we need the probability distribution of queueing delay rather than average queueing delay in order to provide a necessary information for QoS. In this paper we obtain the probability distribution of queueing delay of ErtPS for VoIP service by using the matrix analytic method for the GI/M/1 type and the M/G/1 type matrices in cases of the service time being exponential and deterministic respectively. By applying the results on deterministic service time we find the maximum allowable number of VoIP users with the required constraint on queueing delay.

Eifel improves the performance of TCP by using the timestamp option, which requires additional header bytes, resulting in increased overhead in bandwidth constrained wireless networks. Moreover, the destination needs to support the timestamp option. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called DualRTT, which increases the performance of TCP in the presence of delay spikes, without requiring any additional header bytes. It requires changes only at the sender, and hence is easier to deploy in the existing Internet infrastructure. It also does not require the destination to support the TCP timestamp option. Results show that DualRTT increases the performance of TCP, and also achieves a higher transport layer efficiency than previous algorithms.	algorithm;ambiguity function;byte;delay line memory;internet;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);sensor	Shaojian Fu;Mohammed Atiquzzaman	2005	PCCC 2005. 24th IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference, 2005.	10.1109/PCCC.2005.1460533	maximum segment size;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;mobile computing;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;computer network	Mobile	-3.0729254069363447	91.42142826264475	37416

Scheduling in IQ switches is formulated as tracking the behavior of an output-queued (OQ) switch that provides optimal performance. We present the notion of ¿lag¿ as a performance metric that measures the difference between a packet's departure time in an IQ switch over that provided by an OQ switch. We prove that per-packet mean lag is bounded for a maximum weight-matching scheduling policy that uses lag values for its weights and derive a bound on the mean lag value using a Lyapunov function technique. Furthermore, we propose a simple heuristic tracking scheduling policy and evaluate its performance by simulation.	fair-share scheduling;heuristic;lyapunov fractal;matching (graph theory);network packet;network switch;scheduling (computing);simulation;speedup	Amir Gourgy;Ted H.

We found that, the end-to-end throughput is dependant on both the primary usage patterns and the transmission scheduling scheme being used. In addition, to increase the end-to-end throughput of a Cognitive Radio (CR) chain, the scheduling scheme should be adjusted according to the primary usage patterns of the CR links in the chain. In the paper, firstly, we proposed an algorithm to approximate the achievable end-to-end throughput considering the primary usage patterns by abstraction and iteration. Then, a novel layered packets transmission scheduling scheme was proposed in attempt to realize the approximated end-to-end throughput. Finally, extensive simulations were conducted and results showed that, using proposed transmission scheduling scheme, the achievable end-to-end throughput of a CR chain is increased by considering the primary usage patterns and the final end-to-end throughput is close to the approximation.	approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;end-to-end principle;iteration;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Guang Lei;Chunjing Hu;Wei Wang;Tao Peng;Wenbo Wang	2009	2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917755	fair-share scheduling;cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	14.30340072999686	94.23857983892793	37492
3f2bffbb3eb8de427ee69052884a3ad2961db991	qoe-driven multi-user scheduling and rate adaptation with reduced cross-layer signaling for scalable video streaming over lte wireless systems	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;computer science and informatics;communications engineering networks	The scarcity of the available radio spectrum coupled with the growing popularity of bandwidth intensive mobile video applications poses a huge challenge to network operators. The solution of over-provisioning the network is not economical; hence, an appropriate strategy for scheduling and resource allocation among the users in the system is of crucial importance. This work focuses on scheduling multiple video flows on the downlink of a wireless system based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-A (LTE-Advanced) standards. We propose a joint multi-user scheduling and multi-user rate adaptation strategy providing an appropriate trade-off between efficiency and fairness, while ensuring high quality of experience (QoE) for the end users. We consider Scalable Video Coding (SVC) which facilitates the truncation of bit streams, thus allowing graceful degradation of video quality in the event of wireless channel variations or network congestion. The proposed scheduler utilizes QoE-aware priority marking, where video layers are mapped to priority classes and targets at minimizing delay bound violations for the most important priority classes under congestion. In order to reduce congestion, we propose multi-user rate adaptation at the MAC layer via a novel dynamic filtering policy for QoE-based priority classes. Simulation results show that the proposed approach delivers to the end users a similar QoE as delivered by the stateof-the-art cross-layer approaches, where extensive cross-layer signaling, additional video rate adaptation modules at the core network, and frequent link probing from the wireless access network to the rate adaptation modules are required. The latter approaches are not implemented in real systems due to the aforementioned drawbacks, while our approach can be implemented without major modifications in the standard behavior of existing networks and equipment. The proposed framework can deliver delay-sensitive traffic as well as delay-tolerant best-effort traffic.		Nabeel Khan;Maria G. Martini	2016	EURASIP J.

4f3fd26f5e39161369e0c06583c4414ba9f4c8f2	evaluation of ieee 802.11n for multimedia application in vanet	aggregation	Abstract   WAVE by IEEE, CALM by ISO and Car-to-Car are the popular VANET architectures. These architectures mainly focus on safety applications. IEEE 802.11p is the IEEE recommended MAC and PHY layer standard for VANET. Different VANET pro- tocol stacks recommend this standard not only for the safety applications but also other applications. In this paper, we focus on Multimedia-based ad-hoc networking and WLAN aspects for VANETs. The use of Multimedia applications is increasing day by day. Applications like Voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, online gaming and file transfer etc. demand time bounded and high throughput services. To fulfill these demands in a vehicular environment, there is a need to evaluate the current IEEE VANET standard for MAC (IEEE 802.11p) to know its limitations for these applications and move towards exploration of a new standard. IEEE 802.11n claims high throughput up to 300Mbps and proved to be more suitable standard for multimedia applications. In this paper, we have evaluated IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11n specifically for multimedia applications in VANET. Simulation results show, IEEE 802.11n comparatively performs better for multimedia applications in urban environment in low BER (bit error rate) as well as high BER as compared to IEEE 802.11p.

The DCF uses a carrier sense multiple access scheme with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), where the backoff parameters are fixed and determined by the standard. While those parameters were chosen to provide a good protocol performance, they fail to provide an optimum utilization of the channel in many scenarios. In particular, under heavy load scenarios, the utilization of the medium can drop tenfold. Most of the optimization mechanisms proposed in the literature are based on adapting the DCF backoff parameters to the estimate of the number of competing terminals in the network. However, existing estimation algorithms are either inaccurate or too complex. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the IEEE 802.11 DCF that employs an adaptive estimator of the number of competing terminals based on sequential Monte Carlo methods. The algorithm uses a Bayesian approach, optimizing the backoff parameters of the DCF based on the predictive distribution of the number of competing terminals. We show that our algorithm is simple yet highly accurate even at small time scales. We implement our proposed new DCF in the ns-2 simulator and show that it outperforms existing methods. We also show that its accuracy can be used to improve the results of the protocol even when the terminals are not in saturation mode. Moreover, we show that there exists a Nash equilibrium strategy that prevents rogue terminals from changing their parameters for their own benefit, making the algorithm safely applicable in a complete distributed fashion	adaptive optimization;backoff;design rule for camera file system;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;nash equilibrium;network performance;online algorithm;requirement;rogue;simulation	Alberto López Toledo;Tom Vercauteren;Xiaodong Wang	2006	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2006.124	game theory;real-time computing;simulation;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;accuracy and precision;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	Vision	5.339488850256484	100.99887159433852	37631

Markov modulated uid (MMF) models are used for the receivers to capture the dynamics of the wireless links. Our study shows that the phase diierences of the instantaneous throughput capabilities of the receivers are a distinctive feature of multicast connections. The objectives of the multicast ow control algorithms are to cope with the receiver phase diierences (RPD) cost-eeectively in addition to the general goals such as maximizing throughput and minimizing delay. Three ad hoc algorithms have been studied: Listen to Slowest Request (LSQ), Source Estimation (SE), and Open Loop Control. A uid ow analysis technique is applied to study the eeect of receiver phase diierences assuming zero propagation delay. The eeect of propagation delay in multicast connections is then discussed. Simulation results are presented to verify the analysis for the zero-delay case and to compare the performance of the algorithms under non-negligible delays. It turns out that the zero delay case reveals the characteristics of the multicast algorithms and provides good performance bounds for the cases with non-negligible propagation delays.

A pragmatic channel assignment approach strives to maximize network capacity by restraining the endemic interference and mitigating its adverse impact on network performance. Interference prevalent in WMNs is multi-faceted, radio co-location interference (RCI) being a crucial aspect that is seldom addressed in research endeavors. In this effort, we propose a set of intelligent channel assignment algorithms, which focus primarily on alleviating the RCI. These graph theoretic schemes are structurally inspired by the spatio-statistical characteristics of interference. We present the theoretical design foundations for each of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate their potential to significantly enhance network capacity in comparison to some well-known existing schemes. We also demonstrate the adverse impact of radio co-location interference on the network, and the efficacy of the proposed schemes in successfully mitigating it. The experimental results to validate the proposed theoretical notions were obtained by running an exhaustive set of ns-3 simulations in IEEE 802.11g/n environments.	algorithm;faceted classification;interference (communication);location awareness;mesh networking;network performance;simulation;theory;wireless mesh network	Srikant Manas Kala;M.

In this paper, we propose an optimized video multicast scheme. Firstly, we apply prioritized coding scheme and network coding scheme to eliminate the decoding hierarchy and delivery redundancy. Then, we maximize the aggregate throughput at all the receivers by jointly optimizing both the source rate allocation and the routing scheme. The proposed algorithm is fully distributed, thus very suitable for wireless ad hoc networks. Simulation results show that the proposed video multicast scheme yields a superior video quality compared to the double-tree routing scheme.

Such a network is called a piconet, in which a master employs round-robin mechanism to poll and serve the slaves. Many new products have become Bluetooth enabled recently, which may cause a complex mix of traffic. Two types of connection are being offered in this network: the Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO), and the Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL). ACL is proper for best-effort service as in IP networks, which has gained more importance as now a day’s most of the applications have moved to IP, and may carry bursty traffic. In this paper, to analyze the Bluetooth ACL, a general model for complex mix of traffic, which is the superposition of many ON–OFF mini-sources, is considered. Moreover, due to unreliable nature of wireless media, a Channel Failure Rate (CFR) has been assumed. This system has been investigated analytically and its performance has been evaluated. The effects of channel failure and packet size on the mean delay and waiting time have been studied by simulations as well. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As the module falling asleep, packets from base stations are deferred and even useless due to exceeding delay bounds in real time applications such as video streaming. Current resource allocators only skip transmission opportunities of those sleeping UEs, rather than consider their reception cycle and traffic delay bounds. This study proposes a mechanism of resource block allocation called Reception Cycle-aware resource block Allocation (RCA), which defers most transmissions until the last moment, and reserves a minimal resource block for waking up each UEs that has traffic going expired, to reduce packet loss/miss rate (PLR). Simulation results show that RCA can more effectively reduce power consumption and cope with packets missing deadline than traditional methods do. Users may enjoy real-time applications and also a longer battery life just with realization of our mechanism only at the base station side.	compaq lte;discontinuous reception;network packet;public lending right;real-time transcription;simulation;streaming media	Chin Li;Jen-Yi Pan;Ming-Hung Hsu	2013	2013 15th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)		real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;radio receiver;computer network	Embedded	2.916862436498214	94.71605739546443	38134
15560099d6a434c46ad00be76fd4171fcd2f4bb6	applying device-to-device communication to enhance iot services		Massive machine type communication (mMTC) to serve billions of IoT devices is considered to offer the potential to open a potential new market for the next generation cellular network. Legacy cellular networks cannot meet the requirements of emerging mMTC applications, since they were designed for human-driven services. In order to provide support for mMTC services, current research and standardization work focuses on the improvement and adaptation of legacy networks. However, these solutions face challenges to enhance the service availability and improve the battery life of mMTC devices simultaneously. In this article, we propose to exploit a network controlled sidelink communication scheme to enable cellular networks with better support for mMTC services. Moreover, a context-aware algorithm is applied to ensure the efficiency of the proposed scheme and multiple context information of devices are taken into account. Correspondingly, signaling schemes are also designed and illustrated in this work to facilitate the proposed technology. The signaling schemes enable the network to collect required context information with light signaling effort and thus the network can derive a smart configuration for both the sidelink and cellular link. In order to demonstrate the improvements brought by our scheme, a system-level simulator is implemented and numerical results show that our scheme can simultaneously enhance both the service availability and battery life of sensors.	algorithm;legacy system;next-generation network;numerical analysis;requirement;sensor;simulation	Lianghai Ji;Bin Han;Man Liu;Hans D.

35904eae452279796576902e97e5aa66f508cab4	scheduling in instantaneous-interference-limited cr networks with delay guarantees		We study an uplink multi secondary user (SU) cognitive radio system having average delay constraints as well as an instantaneous interference constraint to the primary user (PU). If the interference channels from the SUs to the PU have independent but not identically distributed fading coefficients, then the SUs will experience heterogeneous de lay performances. This is because SUs causing low interference to the PU will be scheduled more frequently, and/or allocated more transmission power than those causing high interference. We propose a dynamic scheduling-and-power-control algorithm that can provide the required average delay guarantees to all SUs as well as protecting the PU from interference. Using the Lyapunov technique, we show that our algorithm is asymptotically del ay optimal while satisfying the delay and interference constr aints. We support our findings by extensive system simulations and show the robustness of the proposed algorithm against chann el estimation errors. I. I NTRODUCTION The problem of scarcity in the spectrum band has led to a wide interest in cognitive radio (CR) networks. CRs refer to devices that coexist with the licensed spectrum owners call ed the primary users (PUs). CRs are capable of dynamically adjusting their transmission parameters according to the e nvironment to avoid harmful interference to the PUs. Hence, CR users are required to adjust their transmission power level s, and -thustheir rates, according to the interference level the PUs can tolerate. This adjustment could lead to severe degradat ion in the quality of service (QoS) provided for the CR users, if not designed carefully. Moreover, CR users, also referred to as the secondary users (SUs), located physically closer to the PUs might suff er larger degradation in their QoS compared to those that are fa r because closer SUs transmit with smaller amounts of power. This problem does not appear in conventional non CR cellular systems since frequency channels tend to be orthogonal in no n CR systems. In other words, in non CR systems, all users are allocated the channels via some scheduler that guarante es those users do not interfere with each other. While in CR systems, the SUs should be scheduled and have their power controlled in such a way that prevents the harmful interfere nce to the PUs since they share the spectrum. The problem of scheduling and/or power control for CR systems has been widely studied in the literature (please se e [1]–[5], and references therein). The algorithms proposed in these works aim at optimizing the throughput for the SUs and, at the same time, protecting the PUs from interference. However, providing guarantees on the queuing delay in CR system s was not the goal of these works. In real-time applications, such as audio/video conference calls, packets are expected to arrive at the destination before a prespecified deadline. Th us, the average packet delay needs to be as small as possible to prevent jitter and to guarantee acceptable QoS for these applications [6], [7]. Queuing delay has gained strong attention recently in the literature and scheduling algorithms have been proposed to guarantee small delay [8]–[10]. In [8], the authors study th e joint scheduling-and-power-allocation problem in the pre sence of an average power constraint. Although in [8] the proposed algorithm offers an acceptable delay performance, all user s are assumed to transmit with the same power. A power allocation and routing algorithm is proposed in [10] to maximize the capacity region under an instantaneous power constraint. Whi le the authors show an upper bound on the average delay, this delay performance is not guaranteed to be optimal. Although queuing theory, originally developed to model packets at a server, can be applied to wireless channels, the challenges are different. One of the main challenges is the fading nature of the wireless channel that changes from a slo t to another. Fading requires adapting the user’s power and/o r rate according to the channel’s fading coefficient. The idea of power and/or rate adaptation based on the channel condition does not have an analogy in server problems and, thus, is absent in the aforementioned references. Instead, existin g works treat wireless channels as on-off fading channels and do not consider multiple fading levels. Among the relevant references that consider a more general fading channel mode l are [10], which was discussed above, [11], [12] where the optimization over the scheduling algorithm was out of the scope of their work, and [13] that neglects the interference constraint since it considers a non CR system. In contrast with [1]–[5] that do not optimize the queuing delay, the problem of minimizing the sum of SUs’ average elays is considered in this paper. The proposed algorithm guarantees a bound on the instantaneous interference to the PUs, a guarantee that is absent in [8], [10]. Based on Lyapuno v optimization techniques [8], an algorithm that dynamicall y schedules the SUs as well as optimally controlling their transmission power is presented. The contributions in this paper are: i) Proposing a joint power-control and schedulin g algorithm that is optimal with respect to the average delay o f the SUs in an interference-limited system; ii) Showing that t e proposed algorithm can provide differentiated service to t he different SUs based on their heterogeneous QoS requirement s. Moreover, the complexity of the algorithm is shown to be polynomial in time since it is equivalent to that of sorting a vector ofN numbers, whereN is the number of SUs in the sy tem. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The network model and the underlying assumptions are presented in Secti on II. In Section III we formulate the problem mathematically. The proposed algorithm, its optimality and complexity are presented in Section IV, followed by the extensive simulati on results in Section V. Finally the paper is concluded in Secti on VI. II. N ETWORK MODEL We assume a CR system consisting of a single secondary base station (BS) serving N secondary users (SUs) indexed by the setN , {1, ...N}. We are considering the uplink phase where each SU has its own queue buffer for packets that need to be sent to the BS. The SUs are assumed to share a single frequency channel with a single PU that has licensed access to this channel. The CR system is assumed to operate in an underlay fashion where SUs are allowed to transmit as long as the power received by the PU from their transmission does not exceed a prespecified threshold Iinst at any given slot. Moreover, in order for the BS to be able to decode the received signal, no more than one SU at a time slot is to be assigned the channel for transmission. A. Channel and Interference Model We assume a time slotted structure where each slot is of durationTs equal to the coherence time of the channel. The channel between SUi and the BS is assumed to be block fading with instantaneous power gain γ i , at time slot t, following the probability density function (PDF) fγi(γ) with meanγ̄i. The channel gain is assumed to be independent across SUs but not necessary identically distributed. SUs can use a rate adaptation scheme selected based on the channel gain γ i . The transmission rate of SUi at time slott is1 Ri (	algorithm;catastrophic interference;channel (communications);coefficient;coexist (image);cognitive radio;differentiated service;elegant degradation;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;network model;network packet;performance;polynomial;portable document format;power gain;propagation constant;quality of service;queueing theory;queuing delay;real-time transcription;routing;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;sorting;superuser;switch;telecommunications link;throughput	Ahmed Emad Ewaisha;Cihan Tepedelenlioglu	2015	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications	Embedded	8.36225506581191	93.46239189517175	38206

cab5189214644263e73a219fb87e4d298f0e115c	dynamic resource sharing in 5g with lsa: criteria-based management framework		Owing to a steadily increasing demand for efficient spectrum utilization as part of the fifth-generation (5G) cellular concept, it becomes crucial to revise the existing radio spectrum management techniques and provide more flexible solutions for the corresponding challenges. A new wave of spectrum policy reforms can thus be envisaged by producing a paradigm shift from static to dynamic orchestration of shared resources. The emerging Licensed Shared Access (LSA) regulatory framework enables flexible spectrum sharing between a limited number of users that access the same frequency bands, while guaranteeing better interference mitigation. In this work, an advanced user satisfaction-aware spectrum management strategy for dynamic LSA management in 5G networks is proposed to balance both the connected user satisfaction and the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) resource utilization. The approach is based on the MNO decision policy that combines both pricing and rejection rules in the implemented processes. Our study offers a classification built over several types of users, different corresponding attributes, and a number of MNO’s decision scenarios. Our investigations are built on Criteria-Based Resource Management (CBRM) framework, which has been specifically designed to facilitate dynamic LSA management in 5G mobile networks. To verify the proposed model, the results (spectrum utilization, estimated Secondary User price for the future connection, and user selection methodology in case of user rejection process) are validated numerically as we yield important conclusions on the applicability of our approach, which may offer valuable guidelines for efficient radio spectrum management in highly dynamic and heterogeneous 5G environments.	academy;cognitive radio;computer engineering;computer science;download;electrical engineering;ibm systems network architecture;informatics;network performance;rs-232;rapid refresh;rejection sampling;round-robin scheduling;simulation;upload	Zhaleh Sadreddini;Pavel Masek;Tugrul Çavdar;Aleksandr Ometov;Jiri Hosek;Irina Gudkova;Sergey Andreev	2018	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1155/2018/7302025	computer science;resource management;spectrum management;orchestration (computing);computer network;distributed computing;mobile network operator;radio spectrum;shared resource	DB	24.3778894379495	90.0974950541971	38411

PDD can be achieved using a few algorithms, one of the most well-known being Waiting Time Priority(WTP). Using WTP [Proc.

Simulation results also show that STP is able to emulate the performance of WTP. q 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed anti-jamming scheme is aimed at evading a jammer that sweeps across the whole wideband spectrum range in which the WACR is expected to operate. The WACR makes use of its spectrum knowledge acquisition ability to detect and identify the location of the sweeping jammer. This information and reinforcement learning is then used to learn the optimal communications mode to avoid the jammer. In this paper, we discuss a specific reinforcement learning mechanism based on Q-learning to successfully learn such an anti-jamming operation over a several hundred mega-Hz of wide spectrum in realtime. We describe a cognitive anti-jamming communications protocol that selects a spectrum position with enough contiguous idle spectrum uninterfered by both deliberate jammers and inadvertent interferers and transmits till the jammer catches up to it. When the jammer interferes with the cognitive radio's transmission, it switches to a new spectrum band that will lead to the longest possible uninterrupted transmission as learned through Q-learning.

We show that using the standard binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism in noisy environments results in a poor throughput performance due to its inability to differentiate between the causes of unsuccessful packet transmissions and verify the analytical model using the ns-2 simulator. We propose an enhanced BEB mechanism that enhances IEEE 802.11 with a capability of differentiating between different types of unsuccessful transmissions. We study the proposed mechanism analytically, verify it using ns-2 and show that the new mechanism enhances the network performance by up to orders of magnitude with respect to the network error rates.	design rule for camera file system;error message;exponential backoff;network packet;network performance;throughput;time complexity	Tamer Nadeem;Ashok K.

It is developed for high-rate communication between low-power devices in a Wireless Personal Area Network WPAN. The standard defines Medium Access Control MAC and physical layer protocols that support real-time communication over an area of ten square metres. IEEE 802.15.3 MAC consists of a combination of Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance CSMA/CA and Time Division Multiple Access TDMA protocols. The channel is divided into superframe structures where each superframe consists of a beacon, a Contention Access Period CAP and a Channel Time Allocation Period CTAP. In this paper we analyse the performance of the CAP period using both analytical and simulation-based methods. We simulate CSMA/CA protocol in the CAP period using NS-2. The simulation results are compared with those obtained from analytical approximations in terms of different parameters including throughput and optimal CAP periods.	profiling (computer programming)	Sana Ullah;Min Chen;Waleed Alsalih	2013	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2013.055466	network allocation vector;real-time computing;media access control;channel access method;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;internet of things;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	9.23923686423641	93.56946088606556	38865

Wavelength converter sharing, also referred to as partial wavelength conversion, corresponds to the case of a number of converters shared amongst a larger number of wavelength channels. In this study, we present a probabilistic framework for exactly calculating the packet blocking probabilities for optical packet/burst switching systems utilizing wavelength converter sharing. In our model, packet arrivals at the optical switch are first assumed to be Poisson and later generalized to the more general Markovian arrival process to cope with very general traffic patterns whereas packet lengths are assumed to be exponentially distributed. As opposed to the existing literature based on approximations and/or simulations, we formulate the problem as one of finding the steady-state solution of a continuous-time Markov chain with a block tridiagonal infinitesimal generator. To find such solutions, we propose a numerically efficient and stable algorithm based on block tridiagonal LU factorizations. We show that exact blocking probabilities can be efficiently calculated even for very large systems and rare blocking probabilities, e.g., systems with 256 wavelengths per fiber and blocking probabilities in the order of 10-40. Relying on the stability and speed of the proposed algorithm, we also provide a means of provisioning wavelength channels and converters in optical packet/burst switching systems.	algorithm;approximation;blocking (computing);electronic switching system;internet;markov chain;network packet;numerical analysis;optical burst switching;optical switch;orthogonal polarization spectral imaging;packet switching;provisioning;queueing theory;simulation;spatial variability;steady state;wavelength-division multiplexing	Nail Akar;Ezhan Karasan;Kaan Dogan	2006	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2006.258224	exponential distribution;optical burst switching;index term;poisson process;lu decomposition;telecommunications;computer science;continuous-time markov chain;probability;mathematics;markov process;steady state;optical switch;burst switching;packet switching;wavelength-division multiplexing;markovian arrival process;statistics;computer network	Metrics	0.9116104425853518	97.81286587372364	38987

This paper introduces a method on how to manage radio resources and provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for heterogeneous traffic by using admission control, deterministic queuing, and scheduling methods. The proposed solution is based on the use of a RT feasibility test in the admission control and earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling and queuing. This deterministic solution handles heterogeneous traffic through a novel combination of RT downlink and two types of RT uplink dynamic scheduling mechanisms. The uplink scheduling consists of a control packet based mechanism for sporadic RT traffic and a periodic short-latency mechanism for periodic RT traffic. The method presented in this paper is investigated by computer simulation, evaluating its performance and determining the maximum number of nodes supported, given a worst-case user scenario. To the best of our knowledge this is the first centralized protocol designed for a military training network providing application-specific RT support for heterogeneous traffic.	ac (complexity);best, worst and average case;centralized computing;computer simulation;earliest deadline first scheduling;file spanning;network packet;packet switching;platoon (automobile);quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;scalability;scenario (computing);scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Hawar Ramazanali;Magnus Jonsson;Kristina Kunert;Urban Bilstrup	2014	2014 IEEE 19th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)	10.1109/CAMAD.2014.7033244	real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	5.28340362924006	96.2607955718812	39188

A Markov modulated process based on an infinite Markov chain is described. The work described is motivated by applications in telecommunications where LRD is a known property of time series measured on the Internet. The process can generate a time series exhibiting LRD with known parameters and is particularly suitable for modeling Internet traffic because the time series is in terms of ones and zeros, which can be interpreted as data packets and interpacket gaps. The method is extremely simple, both computationally and analytically, and could prove more tractable than other methods described in the literature.	cobham's thesis;dependence;exhibits as topic;markov chain;modulation;network packet;time series	Richard G.

Increasing the buffering time improves the fidelity, whereas it degrades the latency. This paper makes the subjective tradeoff between fidelity and latency clear in a quantitative way. In addition, we examine the effect of tasks on the subjective tradeoff. In evaluating the effect of tasks, we use two tasks according to ITU–T Recommendation P.920. An experiment was conducted to measure user–level QoS of an interactive application with the psychometric methods. We then investigate the subjective tradeoff quantitatively by QoS mapping. The experimental results confirm that there exists the buffering time which makes user–level QoS the highest. The results also show that the optimum buffering time depends on the kind of task. key words: user–level QoS assessment, interactive audio–video application, subjective tradeoff	data buffer;internet protocol suite;interrupt latency;network packet;quality of service;sound card	Yoshihiro Ito;Shuji Tasaka	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.5.1112	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;bicarbonate buffering system;operating system;service quality;telecommunications network;computer network	HCI	-3.5266600152000396	102.59544716143982	39283

The Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) scheduling strategy has been widely studied as a promising way to provide differentiated QoS due to its service protection feature. Most of the previous studies reported in the literature, however, have focused on the analysis of GPS under either Short Range Dependent (SRD) or Long Range Dependent (LRD) traffic only, neither of which is able to capture the heterogeneous properties of realistic traffic in multi-service networks solely. To fill this gap, this paper develops a new analytical performance model for GPS systems subject to both LRD self-similar traffic and SRD Poisson traffic. More specifically, using an approach based on Large Deviation Principles, this study contributes to performance modelling and evaluation of GPS scheduling by deriving the analytical upper and lower bounds of the aggregate and individual queue length distributions of heterogeneous traffic flows. The comparisons between analytical bounds and extensive simulation results validate the accuracy and merits of the analytical model which can be adopted as a practical and cost-effective evaluation tool for investigating the performance behaviour of GPS systems under heterogeneous network traffic with various parameter settings.	aggregate data;generalized processor sharing;global positioning system;network traffic control;quality of service;scheduling (computing);self-similarity;simulation	Xiaolong Jin;Geyong Min	2007		10.1145/1244002.1244055	generalized processor sharing;real-time computing;simulation;cost-effectiveness analysis;heterogeneous network;quality of service;computer science;traffic flow;upper and lower bounds	Metrics	2.288378645559089	97.57021391470995	39321

Given a set of communication requests in arbitrary networks, the scheduling complexity describes the amount of time required to successfully schedule all requests. The most basic and important network structure in wireless networks being connectivity, we study the scheduling complexity of connectivity, i.e., the minimal amount of time required until a connected structure can be scheduled. In this paper, we prove that the scheduling complexity of connectivity grows only polylogarithmically in the number of nodes. Specifically, we present a novel scheduling algorithm that successfully schedules a strongly connected set of links in time O(logn) even in arbitrary worst-case networks. On the other hand, we prove that standard MAC layer or scheduling protocols can perform much worse. Particularly, any protocol that either employs uniform or linear (a node’s transmit power is proportional to the minimum power required to reach its intended receiver) power assignment has a Ω(n) scheduling complexity in the worst case, even for simple communication requests. In contrast, our polylogarithmic scheduling algorithm allows many concurrent transmission by using an explicitly formulated non-linear power assignment scheme. Our results show that even in large-scale worst-case networks, there is no theoretical scalability problem when it comes to scheduling transmission requests, thus giving an interesting complement to the more pessimistic bounds for the capacity in wireless networks. All results are based on the physical model of communication, which takes into account that the signal-tonoise plus interference ratio (SINR) at a receiver must be above a certain threshold if the transmission is to be received correctly.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;interference (communication);nonlinear system;polylogarithmic function;scalability;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;strongly connected component	Thomas Moscibroda;Roger Wattenhofer	2006	Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2006.23	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	16.062581887347505	90.57944581457251	39335

The basic element of the model is a single Pareto arrival stream, in which packet interarrival times (IATs) are iid Pareto distributed. The model proposes that two such streams be multiplexed or superimposed, to produce a composite stream in which the marginal IAT distribution is Pareto-like, and which exhibits power law correlation not only in block packet count (BPC) (the definition of self-similarity) but also in the IAT process. The presence of long range IAT correlations creates the potential for the more extreme queueing behavior associated with self-similar traffic.	digital footprint	J. J.

Each cell can reserve fractional bandwidth for handoff calls to its adjacent cells. It is important to determine the right amount of bandwidth reserved for handoff calls because the blocking probability of new calls may increase if the amount of reserved bandwidth is more than necessary. An adaptive bandwidth reservation based on a mobility graph and a 2-tier cell structure is proposed to determine the amount of bandwidth to be reserved in the cell and to control dynamically its amount according to network conditions. We also propose a call admission control based on this bandwidth reservation and """"next-cell prediction"""" scheme using a mobility graph. In order to evaluate the performance of our call admission control mechanism, we measure metrics such as blocking probability of new calls, dropping probability of handoff calls, and bandwidth utilization.

Amongst the class of applications that can be supported is real time video services (such as IPTV, broadcast of live events etc.). These applications are bandwidth hungry and have stringent delay constraints. Thus, scalable support for such applications is a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we consider a combination of approaches using multicast, layer encoded video and adaptive modulation of transmissions. Using these, we develop algorithms to ensure efficient, fair and timely delivery of video in WiMAX networks. The corresponding resource allocation problem is challenging because scheduling decisions (within a WiMAX base station) are performed in real-time across two dimensions, time and frequency. Moreover, combining layered video with appropriate modulation calls for novel MAC algorithms. We model the multicast resource allocation problem in WiMAX and demonstrate this problem to be NP-hard. We present a fast greedy algorithm that is (i) provably within a constant approximation of the optimal solution (based on a metric that reflects video quality as perceived by the user), and (ii) performs within 87-95% of the optimal as demonstrated by realistic simulations. We also demonstrate that our algorithm offers a 25% improvement over a naive algorithm. Moreover, in terms of the average rate received by each user, our algorithm out-performs the naive algorithm by more than 50%.	access network;approximation;greedy algorithm;iptv;internet access;modulation;multicast;np-hardness;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation	Supratim Deb;Sharad Jaiswal;Kanthi Nagaraj	2008	IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.218	greedy algorithm;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;resource management;computer network	Embedded	21.535878413263475	97.25922163918622	39613

Synchronization is one of the key issues in a multimedia system. Most of the current approaches do not support an integrated solution to the problem of synchronization. In this paper we propose a mechanism for synchronization of multimedia data in distributed environment where the accuracy of the protocol can be tailored to the application. The system model supports live and video-on-demand service. We present a scheme where the specification of the temporal requirements provided by the application can be directly mapped to obtain the information necessary to enforce the synchronization required.

Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) is an emerging killer application which requires high data rate and stringent quality of services (QoS) in terms of delay and packet loss. In this paper, we propose a method to efficiently support high definition video flows in a mmWave-based WPAN with QoS guarantee, considering the characteristics of both the IPTV traffic and the mmWave communication technology.

Considering the overheads of the protocol stack in mmWave WPANs, we then quantify the minimum channel time needed for each IPTV flow. Since mmWave-based WPANs will deploy directional antennas to not only extend the transmission range, but also reduce the interference level to neighboring flows, we further propose an admission control scheme and scheduling algorithm to improve the network resource utilization by taking advantage of concurrent transmissions. Extensive simulations with NS-2 using real video traces have validated our analysis and demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which will be an enabling technology for future mmWave-based WPANs supporting IPTV services.	algorithm;computer engineering;email;gigabit;iptv;interference (communication);killer application;markov chain;network packet;protocol stack;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;tracing (software);uncompressed video;victoria (3d figure)	Lin X.

3808a73a9e7fc413e783d5d4866daa61bf4640b1	modeling tcp throughput: an elaborated large-deviations-based model and its empirical validation	markov chain model;networks;stochastic process;probability;performance;multi scale;simulation experiment;internet traffic;network traffic;empirical validation;large deviations;transport protocol;quality of service;large deviation;large classes;tcp modeling	In today’s Internet, a large part of the traffic is carried using the TCP transport protocol. Characterization of the variations of TCP traffic is thus an important issue, both for resource provisioning and Quality of Service purposes. However, most existing models are limited to the prediction of the (almost-sure) mean TCP throughput and are unable to characterize deviations from this value. In this paper, we propose a method to describe the deviations of a long TCP flow’s throughput from its almost-sure mean value. This method relies on an ergodic large-deviations result, which was recently proved to hold on almost every single realization for a large class of stochastic processes. Applying this result to a Markov chain modeling the congestion window’s evolution of a long-lived TCP flow, we show that it is practically possible to quantify and to statistically bound the throughput’s variations at different scales of interest for applications. Our Markovchain model can take into account various network conditions and we demonstrate the accuracy of our method’s prediction in different situations using simulations, experiments and real-world Internet traffic. In particular, in the classical case of Bernoulli losses, we demonstrate: i) the consistency of our method with the widely-used square-root formula predicting the almost-sure mean throughput, and ii) its ability to additionally predict finer properties reflecting the traffic variability at different scales.

Existing 2G and 3G equivalent technologies are and will be used to allow for a sufficient network coverage. Due to the long investment cycles within the public sector, for a long time small band 2G Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) networks will be the backbone of mission critical voice communication. To enable enhanced data exchange 4G networks will provide this capability as an add-on. It is a well known fact that every transmission technology has its own footprint of delay and delay-spread (jitter). This lead to challenges within heterogeneous system environments, because different behavior introduces unfairness into the system, negligent users in legacy networks. The proposed solution in this paper is based on the identification of the unique footprint of the used networks to increase the fairness. In this paper, the authors present an Active Delay Management (ADeM) PSC System that allows for critical group communication in next generation public safety communication network based on ×G technologies. Therefore, the performance limitations of an IP overlay for heterogeneous communication networks have been studied and analyzed for different mobile radio technologies, based on mobile field trials performed in commercial 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Build upon this study, the gathered information is used to classify the transmission networks to enable the proposed ADeM system to actively consider network dependent delays in its Active Queue Management (AQM) decisions. Thereby, enhanced fairness for the different information streams as well as an improved performance in critical communication scenarios can be achieved.	active queue management;add-ons for firefox;compaq lte;fairness measure;heterogeneous computing;internet backbone;mission critical;multi-function printer;next-generation network;pmr446;performance evaluation;quality of service;semantic network;telecommunications network	Sebastian Subik;Patrick-Benjamin Bok;Dennis Kaulbars;Christian Wietfeld	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2014.6881198	real-time computing;global network;public land mobile network;telecommunications;radio resource management;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	22.20131034535719	89.18482386109977	39940

Densifying the network might provide a solution. However, this will lead to tremendous network infrastructure and increased power consumption (PC). Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has emerged as a solution to curtail the PC and deliver spectrum sharing in a cost-effective and energy-efficient way. Since the PC is an important key success for the upcoming generations, and in order to study and evaluate the power reductions achievable by C-RAN, a reliable power model (PM) is required. This study proposes a component, linear and parameterised PMs to explore the individual components relevant for PC analysis, particularly for C-RAN architecture. The models quantify the EE by capturing the power consumed by individual components, and the amount of power reduced in the network. The model shows a dramatic reduction in the cooling PC (87.4%), whereas the total PC is reduced to about (33.3%) compared with macro base stations deployment. Finally, accuracy comparison of the component and parameterised models has been presented.	radio access network	Raad S. Alhumaima;Muhammad Khan;Hamed S.

af71bf6946dd9d0010be6c30f38b0efd83b58ccf	analyses of relay nodes deployment in 4g wireless mobile multihop relay networks	mobile multihop relay;rs deployment;ieee 802 16j;lte advanced;adaptive cost function	In 4G cellular networks: LTE/LTE-Advanced and the mobile WiMAX network, some key impact factors: white Gaussian noise, wireless interference, shadow fading, etc., degrade signal transmission quality and reduce wireless service coverage significantly. The degradations can be improved by deploying more eNBs or BSs, but the expensive eNB/BS extremely increases network cost. The specifications of LTE-Advanced and IEEE 802.16j thus propose a relay-based scheme, namely mobile multihop relay (MMR) networks, to cooperate with the existing cellular network while not obviously increasing the relay station (RS) deployment cost. Various types of RSs: Fixed RS, Nomadic RS and Mobile RS, can be adopted in MMR networks. To efficiently deploy different types of RSs becomes a critical issue. Thus, this paper first analyzes the impact factors: transmission quality, deployment price, service coverage and RS overlap index, and then models the cost-effective issue of the RS deployment as an optimization problem. The paper proposes an adaptive cost-based RS deployment (ACRD) approach to form a cost function in terms of all impact factors, and then solves the optimization problem by determining the RS deployment with the least network cost as the solution. Numerical results demonstrate that ACRD outperforms the compared approaches in network cost, transmission quality, RS deployment price, service coverage, and RS overlap index. Additionally, ACRD deploys more RSs on the areas with high-density populations and thus increases transmission quality and guarantees the quality of service (QoS). Finally, the worst case running time of ACRD is analyzed, which requires $$ T(n) = O(I \cdot P) $$T(n)=O(I·P).	relay	Ben-Jye Chang;Ying-Hsin Liang;Shin-Shun Su	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2443-x	telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	24.143393196464576	90.2498570158327	40223

The concept consists of two modes, TDMA-based FMA1 and CDMA-based FMA2, which have contributed to the standardization processes of third-generation systems. FMA1 uses the TDMA slot structure where spreading can be applied inside the slot or, alternatively, plain TDMA-type transmission can be used. FMA2 is a single-carrier wideband CDMA solution using a 4.096 Mchips/s basic chip rate. The FMA concept facilitates common upper-layer protocol structure as well as GSM backwards compatibility for evolution from second-generation systems to third-generation mobile radio systems. The defined concept fulfils the UMTS/IMT-2000 requirements in providing the services needed for the next millennium.

According to the size of video layer, SS distribution, and available symbols, our method adaptively changes the modulations of each video layer in each group of picture (GOP) time.

FiWi networks are usually composed of an optical and a wireless component. Since both components are designed to work independently, some mechanisms, such as the different power saving methods in both components, may not cooperate with each other and this may result in an undesirable performance. In this paper, we identify that the conflicting power saving mechanisms cause unnecessary energy consumption and introduce additional delay to the overall FiWi network. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel ONU sleep method, which dynamically control the ONU sleep period based on the STAs energy control mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed method has shorter latency and is more efficient in term of energy consumption than the existing method.	algorithm;interrupt latency	Hiroki Nishiyama;Ko Togashi;Yuichi Kawamoto;Nei Kato	2015	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2014.2360405	embedded system;passive optical network;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;wireless;computer network	Embedded	10.551911849140934	89.97074485700297	40589

However, the fundamental assumptions of TCP are disrupted by the properties hold by wireless network, such as high bit error rate, large delay and drastic bandwidth oscillation, which lead to the consequences of spurious time outs, spurious retransmission, and sending rate lagging behind the variation of bandwidth, degrading the wireless utilization greatly. To solve the problem, we design a cross-layer flow control algorithm which based on the bandwidth information of the current network environment and calculate a reference value to adjust the sending rate of the multiple senders. The experimental results show that the wireless bandwidth resource is sufficiently utilized, the queue length is stable and the sending rate is insensitive to the round trip time when using this algorithm.	algorithm;bit error rate;flow control (data);retransmission (data networks);telecommunications link	Xiaomeng Huang;Nan Jiang;Jinzhe Yang	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Information Security	10.1109/WCINS.2010.5542310	real-time computing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;high-speed downlink packet access;wireless network;flow control;oscillation;round-trip delay time;transport layer;network topology;bandwidth;wireless;robustness;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	-3.141236169583811	93.27044368721157	40748

The network model consists of the core RTP/IP network as well as the wireless access parts with lots of mobile hosts. This model is designed to include the means of provisioning Quality of Service (QoS) strategy according to the requirements of each particular traffic flow as well as the header compression method for real-time multimedia applications. Performance evaluation is carried out for showing the effectiveness of the proposed traffic control scheme.	real-time transcription	Moonsik Kang	2012		10.1007/978-94-007-5860-5_78	multi-frequency network;distributed computing;wi-fi array;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Mobile	2.304165333957626	95.76925176240704	40888

The algorithm, called JoBS, provides delay and loss differentiation independently at each node, without assuming admission control or policing. Contrary to most existing algorithms, scheduling and buffer management decisions are performed in a single step. Both relative and (whenever possible) absolute QoS requirements of classes are supported. Simulation examples, including results for a heuristic approximation, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach, to compare the new algorithm to existing methods for loss and delay differentiation. 1	active queue management;approximation algorithm;computation;differentiated services;end-to-end principle;experiment;heuristic;integral theory (ken wilber);network congestion;quality of service;requirement;router (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control	Jörg Liebeherr;Nicolas Christin	2002	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(02)00268-2	real-time computing;quality of service;differentiated service;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Networks	-0.7320802235422879	95.34101527875107	41078

This is typically accomplished using the declared worst-case traac descriptors for incoming calls, a solution which results in poor bandwidth utilization. A measurement-based admission scheme is an appealing alternative: not only does it ooer adaptivity to changing traac conditions, it also allows statistical multiplexing gains to be exploited. In this paper, we examine the problem of determining which traac characterization a measurement-based admission control algorithm should require of sources requesting access. Building on the work of Jamin et al. (1995), we also propose an adaptive measurement-based admission control algorithm that simpliies the estimation process, and show that it can achieve a high level of utilization without violating its delay-based QoS guarantees.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;high-level programming language;integrated services;molecular descriptor;multiplexing;network packet;quality of service	Claudio Casetti;James F.

This phenomenon occurs irrespective of whether the cause of retransmissions is due to channel failures in the data link layer [7] or collisions in ALOHA-type protocols in the MAC layer [9]. These theoretical findings are in agreement with empirical measurements in [18], showing that the utilization of the 802.11 protocol is only 40%, basically due to retransmissions.  In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a new dynamic packet fragmentation algorithm that can adaptively match channel failure characteristics. This algorithm is based on the mathematical insights developed in [7, 8]. As a first order approximation to the channel dynamics, we assume that the channel is either available for a period of time or unavailable. Then, our fragmentation algorithm divides the original packets into smaller ones whose size is bounded by the kth largest value among the last k+m channel availability periods. We also discuss mechanisms for aggregating smaller packets into larger ones, which, in combination with fragmentation, can further improve the performance.  Under the renewal assumptions on the channel dynamics, we prove that our fragmentation method results in k additional moments for the total transmission time until all the fragments are successfully transmitted, i.e., the transmission time has a much more concentrated distribution and, in particular, the channel will always have a positive throughput. In addition, we argue that by tuning the parameter m, the number of introduced new packets can be kept reasonably small as well. Furthermore, we demonstrate through simulations that the superior performance of our fragmentation algorithm extends beyond the renewal assumptions used in the analysis to time varying and/or correlated channels. For practical implementation of the algorithm, we also discuss approaches to measuring the channel availability periods, especially in situations when the channel dynamics may not be directly observable.  It is worth mentioning that our algorithm can be used for designing efficient checkpointing schemes in other systems that are prone to failures, e.g., distributed computing systems.	algorithm;application checkpointing;distributed computing;fragmentation (computing);ip fragmentation;network packet;observable;order of approximation;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;time complexity	Predrag R.

c6fea0099de13d9fd95eeaa81f8203e17cf81577	self-organization towards reduced cost and energy per bit for future emerging radio technologies - sonnet		Self-organizing network (SON) is seen as playing a pivotal role towards reducing the management costs of networks for the exposure of 5G and beyond 5G networks. SON is capable of collecting information from the network, so as to perform self- configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, etc., so as to reduce the operation cost through less human involvement, and to optimize the service quality through robust and prompt network optimization. SONNET aims to drive further cost savings in the way networks are managed today by amplifying further the coverage zone of SON within the network. We believe that key technologies such as network sharing and Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) can benefit from SON technology solutions. Hence, this paper will give the overview of SONNET project (http://sonnet- project.eu/) by defining the state of art technologies (CoMP, network sharing, SON Context-aware) and innovations brought by SONNET. Moreover, this paper will also highlight the 5G use cases recently standardized by 3GPP, which act as a baseline for novel SONNET use cases proposed in this paper. The selected use cases will be used for demonstration purposes with the aid of Ray tracer and System Level Simulator.	baseline (configuration management);eb/n0;mathematical optimization;multipoint ground;organizing (structure);ray tracing (graphics);reduced cost;self-organization	Shahid Mumtaz;Kazi Mohammed Saidul Huq;Jonathan Rodriguez;Saptarshi Ghosh;Emeka Emmanuel Ugwuanyi;Muddesar Iqbal;Tasos Dagiuklas;Stavros Stavrou;Loizos Kanaris;Ilias D.

The vulnerability comes from the fact that an attacker can easily manipulate the input and control variables of those controllers. In our previous works, we analyzed threats of some special low-rate Denial-of-Service attacks (LRDoS) to the feedback control systems used in web servers and TCP flows. In this paper, based on hybrid system theory, we derive general results from two aspects. First, we propose a new proportional-integral feedback controller for web servers to mitigate the impact of generalized LRDoS attacks. The stability and convergence properties of the controller are analyzed. Second, we model the impact of generalized LRDoS attacks on TCP by use of Zeno control. We investigate both the scenario when TCP uses fixed parameters in its congestion control algorithm and the scenario when TCP uses adaptive control to adjust those parameters. We also examine the case when there is no Zeno solution. Limit cycle analysis is employed to model the behavior of TCP's congestion control mechanism with periodic solutions. The globally asymptotic stability of those periodic solutions is proved.	algorithm;control system;control theory;denial-of-service attack;feedback;hybrid system;limit cycle;network congestion;server (computing);systems theory;web server	Qing Hui;Xiapu Luo;Wenke Lee	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717825	control engineering;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp global synchronization;adaptive control;tcp pacing;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;distributed computing;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start	Embedded	-3.6196857092667947	95.62345039839457	41752

This paper presents a proposal of a simulation architecture for the analysis of signaling in GSM and IS41/136 mobile cellular networks. Procedures like power up, power down, call setup, handover and location updating are implemented. The simulation tool CELSA (cellular signaling analyzer) has implemented this architecture.

In one model the traffic of the two connections is mapped to a single Traffic Stream, and in the second model the traffic of the two TCP connections is split into two different Traffic Streams. We assume Error-Free and Error-Prone channels, the Two-Level aggregation method and the Reverse Direction capability of IEEE 802.11ac. The Goodput of the two models is about the same, however, in the first model shorter dedicated transmission periods, denoted Transmission Opportunities (TXOP), are sufficient to achieve the optimal Goodput because TCP Acks are interleaved. Also, using Reverse Direction prevents collisions and improves the Goodput by   10−15%      10  −  15  %         over contension based access.	scheduling (computing)	Oran Sharon;Yaron Alpert	2017	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2017.02.009	real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;telecommunications;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Mobile	4.986966689493406	93.61136679905826	41939

It is best to write the simulator in a higher level programming language, in our case we use Mathematica and are able to obtain fast results with excellent graphing capabilities. The goal of our research is to find a method for obtaining an estimate of the average access delay for advanced token ring based networks such as FDDI (fiber distributed data interface) or FFOL (FDDI follow on LAN). We have developed a method that will generate exact results at low to medium loaded networks. As the load level increases, the error rate also increases, this however is monitored and can be used as a confidence measure for the results obtained. A symme:tric multimedia environment is used as the model, with bimodal traffic consisting of short data packets and longer video packets.

In this work, we developed a test-bed to evaluate the performance of the steering mechanism. In addition, to mimic the mobility of UAVs, we analyze our work by applying Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) to evaluate the performance of the testbed results. The results obtained from our analysis and testbed-based evaluation show the efficiency of the proposed connection steering mechanism.

Such indices depend on network parameters such as TTL, buffer size, time and load which are at times highly correlated. Factors impacting network measurements include cross traffic, architectures of intermediate nodes, complex interaction of hardware resources and protocols at various levels, as well as implementations that often involve competing and conflicting requirements. Load-balancing at an intermediate node may result in out-of-order arrivals and excessive jitter, and network congestion may manifest as packet losses or large jitter. Out-of-order arrivals, losses, and jitter in turn may lead to unnecessary retransmissions which increases the load. Network load is mainly the result of bandwidth exploited, buffer availability and processing time at intermediate nodes. Indeed, network load is a key parameter with a potentially large impact on network protocols. Besides, Network load is responsible for traffic delay and is sometime confused with congestion. In brief, load is an objective network index, whereas congestion is a subjective measurement from the perspective of a user. With the growth of the Internet in size, speed and traffic volume, and the advent of new network architectures such as MANets/DTN, understanding the impact of underlying network resources and protocols on packet delivery and application performance has assumed a critical importance. Measurements and models explaining the variation and interdependence of delivery characteristics are crucial not only for efficient operation of networks and network diagnosis, but also for developing solutions for future networks. In this paper we give an analytical definition and propose a novel metric to measure network load for mobile ad-hoc and traditional networks by means of an equation of state.	communications protocol;delay-tolerant networking;hoc (programming language);interdependence;internet;load balancing (computing);network congestion;network packet;packet delay variation;requirement;transistor–transistor logic	Adriano Galati;Chris Greenhalgh	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Networking and Services	10.1109/ICNS.2009.62	traffic generation model;media delivery index;communications protocol;network planning and design;network traffic control;real-time computing;computer science;load balancing;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;network congestion;mobile computing;network delay;computer network	Networks	-3.8960767469777817	89.35993101235707	42000

The convexity properties are then extended to address the problem of optimally routing arbitrary input streams over a collection of K queues in parallel with different (possibly time-varying) server rates (/spl mu//sub 1/(t),...,/spl mu//sub K/(t)). Our convexity results hold for stream-based routing (where individual packet streams must be routed to the same queue) as well as for packet-based routing where each packet is routed to a queue by probabilistic splitting. Our analysis uses a novel technique that combines sample path observations with stochastic equivalence relationships.	background process;convex function;network packet;routing;server (computing);stream (computing);turing completeness	Michael J.

NTCD/MB is a buuer management scheme that implements loss and delay priority queueing strategies in order to satisfy a wide range of quality-of-service requirements. We consider a heterogeneous mix of traac which consists of real-time traac with a stringent cell delay requirement, and nonreal-time traac with a stringent cell loss requirement. Moreover, a proportion of real-time cells has an additional stringent loss requirement. Cell arrivals are modeled using a uid-ow modeling approach. The system we analyze consists of two buuers interacting via a common server. The steady-state probability distribution for the buuers' content as well as other performance statistics are obtained. Our approach is based on computing the conditional probability distributions of the buuers and using this information to nd the desired unconditional stationary distributions. This approach can be used, in general, to analyze multiple dependent systems of buuers. Numerical examples based on the analysis are used along with simulations to study the performance of NTCD/MB. It is shown that NTCD/MB can be used eeectively to provide performance guarantees on diierent cell loss and delay requirements of the traac.	atm turbo;cell signaling;interaction;markov chain;modulation;multiplexer;numerical linear algebra;quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;stationary process;steady state	Marwan Krunz;Hennan Hughes	1994	J.

d5e2ca99690b2ac401e5013fb684e99d40b37dfa	markov-based vertical handoff decision algorithms in heterogeneous wireless networks	期刊论文	In this paper, we propose a received signal strength (RSS)-based single-attribute handoff decision algorithm at first, and investigate handoff decision model based on connection lifetime, which can keep mobile terminals (MTs) staying long enough in the preferred network. Since the preferred quality of service (QoS) parameters may be distinct among different MTs, we then formulate the vertical handoff decision problem as a Markov decision process, with the objectives of maximizing the expected total reward and minimizing average number of handoffs. A reward function is constructed to assess the QoS during each connection, and the G1 and entropy methods are applied in an iterative way, by which we can work out a stationary deterministic handoff decision policy. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed schemes compared with other existing algorithms.	algorithm;markov chain	Zhaolong Ning;Qingyang Song;Yejun Liu;Fanzhao Wang;Xinyu Wu	2014	Computers & Electrical Engineering	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2013.10.012	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;computer network	DB	21.85421767761019	95.01059105771462	42272

One peer, called the proxy, downloads multimedia content via a telecommunication link, and distributes it (which we call chumcast) to the ad hoc network formed from the set of nearby peers. Each peer in the ad hoc network takes turns serving as a proxy. Every peer is associated with a server that resides in the internet. The server for the proxy, called the active server, manages peer information, schedules the next proxy, selects a set of rebroadcasting peers, and detects partitioning of the ad hoc network. With support from the servers in the internet, peers receive benefits of reduced telecommunication bandwidth, computation power, as well as several security features. Simulation results show that 80% of the telecommunication cost is saved with as few as six peers.

baa1dbca3ed7de6590382c337bd7852901be614f	oqmcar: an enhanced network coding-aware routing algorithm based on queue state and local topology	coding aware routing;queue state;unified framework;multiple rates;packet coding algorithm	Existing coding aware routing algorithms focused on novel routing metric design that captures the characteristics of network coding. However, in packet coding algorithm, they use opportunistic coding scheme which didn’t consider the queue state of the coding node and are equivalent to the conventional store-and-forward method in light traffic load condition because they never delay packets and there are no packets in the output queue of coding node, which results in no coding opportunity. In addition, most of the existing algorithms assume that all flows participating in the network have equal rate. This is unrealistic since multi-rate environments are often appeared. To overcome above problem and expand network coding to light traffic load scenarios, we present an enhanced coding-aware routing algorithm based on queue state and local topology (OQMCAR), which consider the queue state of coding node in packet coding algorithm where the control policy is of threshold-type. OQMCAR is a unified framework to merge single rate case and multiple rate case, including the light traffic load scenarios. Simulations results show that our scheme can achieve higher throughput and lower end-to-end delay than the current mechanisms using COPE-type opportunistic coding policy in different cases.	algorithm;linear network coding;routing	Cunbo Lu;Song Xiao;Yinbin Miao	2015	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2015.08.007	linear network coding;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	EDA	2.125781120561054	90.93944878145582	42592

Some previous works have remedied this issue with multiple instances of the scheduler, but the baseline scheduler (Q-CSMA) itself remains untouched. By noticing the inherent inefficiency in the contention mechanism of Q-CSMA, we propose looks ahead (LA)-CSMA algorithm in which each link LA its state update in advance and utilizes this free information during the contention stage. We show that our algorithm achieves optimal throughput with reduced correlation in the service process, thereby leading to significantly smaller delay without any additional overhead.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);detailed balance;markov chain;overhead (computing);rough set;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);throughput	Jin-Ghoo Choi;Do Young Eun	2016	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2016.2596745	throughput;real-time computing;schedule;computer science;distributed computing;spread spectrum;scheduling;correlation;computer network	Mobile	7.951559091663629	92.3758121734037	42675

Measurements of the long-term mean and the autocorrelation function of cell interarrival times allow the parameter estimation of the ARMA model. The video source is then described by an ARMA model. Furthermore, it is shown that the multiplexed stream of video cells is an ARMA process, too. Such a cell stream is then applied to a model of a queueing system to obtain performance measures of the system. Perturbation analysis is then performed on the functional behavior of the queueing system by appropriate perturbation of the model parameters to determine cell waiting time sensitivity due to slight variations of the input process.	autocorrelation;autoregressive model;codec;estimation theory;moving-average model;multiplexing;perturbation theory;queueing theory	Reto Grünenfelder;John Cosmas;Sam Manthorpe;Augustine Odinma-Okafor	1991	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.76626	codec;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;autoregressive model;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-1.2662851693647559	100.03885556097312	42722

This congestion parameter allows valid predictions on the future behavior of the network, on which one can base efficient routing strategies. We show how to implement the computation of the probabilistic congestion, and we illustrate several applications for improving unicast and multicast protocols.	computation;fractal;multicast;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;routing;self-similarity;unicast	José Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin;Pierre Fraigniaud	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24693-0_90	simulation;fractal;telecommunications;computer science;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-0.9825029045918987	101.30548325441693	42786

Despite this, several real time schedulers have been developed that aimed at providing QoS to ad hoc nodes. The quality of service (QoS) is standardized in terms of capacity, reliability, link quality, delays/jitters, and network cost. Thus, for QoS, the better transmission should be maintained at end user as well as at the transmitting unit. QoS of a network is affected by delays and bandwidth allocated for transmission. For an efficient network, it is required to predict these metrics during transmission. For this, in this paper, integration of quaternion-based Kalman filter is performed that predicts the required bandwidth and the network delays with higher accuracy. From the analysis, it is shown that bandwidth can be optimized but it is not possible to aloof delays in the network. Thus, while implementing such admission control procedures, estimation process allows control over delays and sustain them from going beyond a certain threshold value. The model proposed is a novel approach and has not been formulated in any of previous work related to QoS in MANETs. The effectiveness of model is demonstrated using both simulation and real time results.	quality of service	Vishal Sharma;Rajesh Kumar	2016	Computing and Informatics		throughput;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;bandwidth;computer network	HPC	-4.536215408991619	96.60947537729973	42881

The proposed scheme can be considered as a generalization of various multihop wireless relaying schemes, where storing and carrying an information message by a mobile relay node is not allowed. The key motivation of utilizing SCF relaying within the cell is that energy consumption levels can be dramatically reduced by capitalizing on the inherent mobility of nodes and the elasticity of Internet applications. In that respect, we consider a novel multihop cellular architecture to achieve energy savings both at the network side (i.e., Base Stations) and at the user terminals. The proposed scheme makes use of mobility information of relays (vehicles) while roaming inside the cell to device flows that could achieve maximum energy savings. We show that under SCF relaying large energy savings can be achieved by tolerating a controlled delay over the initiated service.	baseline (configuration management);cellular architecture;codel;elasticity (data store);internet;linear programming;relay	Panayiotis Kolios;Vasilis Friderikos;Katerina Papadaki	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5379030	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	18.233086683517225	89.857274876513	42922

In an ATM switch, admitting a hard real-time connection requires the delays of cells belonging to the connection meeting their deadline without violating the guarantees already provided to connections that are currently active. Previous studies have shown that the real-time connection traffic and the available service can both be described by piecewise linear functions in terms of time. By utilizing the inverse of the arrival and service functions, we obtain an efficient and effective method to complete the worst case delay of a connection to an ATM switch. We analyze and compare the performance of an ATM switch with priority driven and FIFO scheduling policies under different utilization. We also compare the performance using our proposed integrated method with the traditional independent method. From simulation experiments, we found that our method always obtains a higher admission probability and a better estimation of cell delay within an ATM switch.	atm turbo;best, worst and average case;effective method;experiment;fifo (computing and electronics);linear function;piecewise linear continuation;real-time clock;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);simulation	Joseph Kee-Yin Ng;Shibin Song;Wei Zhao	1997	Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium	10.1109/REAL.1997.641290	independent component analysis;embedded system;real-time computing;quality of service;piecewise linear function;performance;network switch;computer science;operating system;asynchronous transfer mode;probability;distributed computing;computational model;scheduling	Embedded	-0.07568449575767407	96.40677113022592	42937

These distribution functions are simple, memory less, and easy-to-use, however,they are difficult to represent the task arrival process of multimedia stream data or audio data having real-time properties. This paper proposes a method for obtaining approximate probability distribution functions for given task arrival process for multimedia systems by using the Cox distribution function. The Cox distribution function can represent arbitrary distribution functions but their parameters are difficult to be determined for representing the given function. In the method, first, an objective probability distribution function is approximated by a linear combination of exponential distribution functions and Erlan distribution functions, then the parameters of the Cox distribution function is determined from the linear combination of the functions obtained above. The examples of the approximations show that the method is effective for approximating given probability distribution functions.

In practice, on the contrary STAs are distributed unevenly among access points (APs), causing hot-spots and under utilized APs in a wireless network. Considering a WLAN is made up of multiple APs, having some APs carrying excessive loads (i.e. hot-spots) degrades both the considered APs as well as the overall network performance. The system performance can be improved by associating incoming STAs effectively throughout the network, in a sense to balance the network load evenly between APs and relieve the hot-spot congestion. Currently employed user association method in IEEE 802.11 WLANs considers only the received signal strength of APs at STAs, and associates STAs to the closest (in signal strength sense) AP, ignoring its load and interference value.Novel user association algorithms are required for congestion relief and network performance improvement. In this work, a new distributed association algorithm taking into consideration not only the received signal strength of the APs at STAs but also AP loadings and interference is proposed. A new AP load calculation method acknowledging the interference between STAs and APs is presented. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the overall system throughput performance more than 50% and offers a better load distribution across the network compared to conventional association algorithm.	algorithm;hot spare;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);network congestion;network performance;simulation;throughput;wireless access point	Özgür Ekici;Abbas Yongaçoglu	2006		10.1145/1143549.1143694	signal strength;embedded system;ieee 802.11;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;weight distribution;load balancing;operating system;wireless network;computer performance;network performance;hot spot;computer network	Metrics	20.946198198825602	92.36118657163792	43037

We develop two complementary vulnerability definitions using set theoretic and circuit theoretic interpretations of the security of network traffic, allowing a network analyst or an adversary to determine weaknesses in the secure network. We formalize node capture attacks using the vulnerability metric as a nonlinear integer programming minimization problem and propose the GNAVE algorithm, a Greedy Node capture Approximation using Vulnerability Evaluation. We discuss the availability of security parameters to the adversary and show that unknown parameters can be estimated using probabilistic analysis. We demonstrate vulnerability evaluation using the proposed metrics and node capture attacks using the GNAVE algorithm through detailed examples and simulation.	adversary (cryptography);approximation algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;integer programming;np-hardness;network packet;network traffic control;nonlinear system;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;routing;set theory;simulation	Patrick Tague;David Slater;Jason D Rogers;Radha Poovendran	2009	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2008.60	communications protocol;computer science;information security;wireless network;distributed computing;routing protocol;network access control;computer security;computer network	Security	13.021633653057089	92.69805656996652	43041

Existing papers on this blind rendezvous process mainly focus on the sequence design of channel hopping but do not consider the selection of available channels. Their time to rendezvous (TTR) and operation complexity increase with the number of available channels, which is against the concept that cognitive radios should perform better when there are more unused channels in primary networks. Thus, a new blind rendezvous design that can address this paradoxical issue is desirable. In this paper, we propose a joint design of channel selection and channel hopping for guaranteed blind rendezvous. For the first time, the TTR is significantly reduced to O(1) with a low operation requirement. An analytical model of TTR is also proposed and validated against the simulation. More importantly, under our proposed protocol, TTR decreases with the increasing number of available channels in the network. This is a very attractive feature in spectrum-under-utilized scenarios which has not been achieved by any existing CRAHN rendezvous work.	algorithm;cognitive radio;exposing to the right;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hoc (programming language);mean time to repair;requirement;simulation	Xingya Liu;Jiang Xie	2015	2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2015.7338343	communications protocol;algorithm design;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;computer network	Mobile	10.23266754510034	91.2151253454453	43055

On the other hand the use in ATM networks of a packet switching technique introduces some problems related to packet delay, cell loss and packet delay jitter. One possible solution to these problems is the transmission of the video information over the network with different levels of protection with respect to the packet losses . The information used to guarantee a video connection with minimum acceptable quality is transmitted in a very protected way . On the contrary, the other information necessary to increase the quality of the coded images up to the desired level is not intrinsically protected against data loss. In the paper two different realizations of this type of video coder are presented and their performances are compared .	atm turbo;data compression;network packet;neural coding;packet delay variation;packet switching;performance	Stefano Tubaro	1991	Sig.

On the contrary, in this paper we propose a combined approach where service-level adaptation is considered first and, provided that no suitable parameter combination is capable of providing enough QoE, a change of network state will be suggested. In order to do so we analyze the performance of the end-to-end (e2e) performance metrics in this convergent scenario, the root causes of possible degradations and, finally, the combined effects of the different network segments and their impact on the user perceived QoE. We show the map of best performing VoIP configurations for every state of the network segments. Furthermore, considering each of these configurations, we analyze the acceptability of the service or the convenience of trying to modify the network state. Finally, a lightweight implementation based on simple network state estimation and decision heuristics is proposed and validated in terms of accuracy and responsiveness. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, when the multi-beam directional antennas are introduced in this system, the ever popular contention-based medium access control protocol such as IEEE 802.11 MAC is no longer effective, and many challenging problems, such as beam-synchronization problem, beam-overlapping problem, mobility and receiver blocking problem (deafness problem), need to be resolved. In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol to carefully address these problems. In addition to improving communication efficiency, we also consider the backward compatibility in our design, whereby an IEEE 802.11 terminal can transparently access a multi-beam access point. Furthermore, we present an analytical model to evaluate the performance of multi-beam wireless LANs.

Previous researches have shown that uni-access mode is an efficient way to reduce intracell interference caused by other transmitting users, and hence higher performance is attained compared to traditional multi-access mode. However, due to the constraint in the practical system, a single user might not fully utilize the available bandwidth. Consequently, the system capacity as well as throughput will be not optimized.This paper introduces a novel Transport block size based Adaptive Scheduling Scheme (TASS) that utilizes radio resource more efficiently and sufficiently. Different from both uni-access and multi-access mode, the TASS can be seen as a mixed version of them called hybrid-access mode. Via the transmission strategy, less power is required while achieving equivalent throughput and thus higher performance is expected. In order to guarantee the delay time of each user, the scheduling algorithm earliest deadline first (EDF) is applied. As a result, the TASS is suitable for real-time traffics. The experiment results demonstrate that this new transmission strategy carries advantages in system capacity, average delay and overall throughput.

Here, it overcomes shortcomings of previous methods by adopting a novel and efficient clock updating algorithm.

We derived the balance equation and evaluated various system performance metrics including blocking probability, dropping probability, spectrum utilization, throughput and mean queuing time by a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model. Numerical results show that this CAF with queuing strategy greatly lowers the dropping probability without obviously impacting the blocking probability, and slightly increases the spectrum utilization and throughput of the secondary network compared with the non-queuing case. Moreover, by tuning the bandwidth requirement of each secondary user, different system performance can be achieved.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;erlang (unit);fragmentation (computing);markov chain;mathematical optimization;sap composite application framework;simulation;telecommunications network;throughput	Lei Li;Sihai Zhang;Kaiwei Wang;Wuyang Zhou	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362531	throughput;cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;probability;mathematical model;computer performance;markov process;queueing theory;bandwidth;measurement;statistics;computer network	Mobile	4.597855484859988	99.0378425972178	43981

The LLDN provides a TDMA-based medium access mechanism in which the network cycle time grows linearly with the number of nodes. As a result, to offer low cycle times to applications requiring a high number of nodes, the LLDN specifications suggest to create multiple networks operating on different channels by embedding multiple transceivers in the coordinator. However, such an approach entails high costs and increases the design complexity. Moreover, the LLDN protocol foresees a star topology that limits the network area coverage. This paper proposes a novel approach, called a MultiChannel LLDN, based on a hierarchical network structure in which nodes communicate on different channels at the same time. The approach supports a high number of network nodes while maintaining short cycle times without the need for multiple transceivers in the coordinator and also provides backward compatibility with the standard LLDN. The paper presents the MultiChannel LLDN and comparative performance assessments.	a* search algorithm;backward compatibility;communications protocol;data aggregation;end-to-end principle;interrupt latency;multichannel multipoint distribution service;requirement;star network;subnetwork;transceiver;transmitter;tree network	Gaetano Patti;Giuliana Alderisi;Lucia Lo Bello	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Emerging Technology and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005204	embedded system;communications protocol;payload;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;network topology;computer network;transceiver	Embedded	9.480685903929652	88.84690402702043	44282

In this paper, the CF energy benefit is studied for networks with unicast sessions and modeled by connected graphs. This benefit is defined as the ratio of the minimum energy consumption by traditional routing techniques, not using broadcast and superposition features, and the corresponding CF consumption. It is shown to be upper bounded by min(d̅, K, 12√K), where d̅ and K are the average hop-count distance and the number of sessions, respectively. Also, it can be concluded that the energy benefit of network coding (NC) is also upper bounded by the same value, which is a new scaling law of the energy benefit for NC as a function of K.	linear network coding;quantum superposition;routing;throughput;unicast	Zhijie Ren;Jasper Goseling;Jos H.

We investigate the sublinear term in the block delay required for unicasting n packets and show that there is an unbounded gap between network coding and routing. In particular, we show that delay benefit of network coding scales at least as √n. Our analysis of the delay function for the routing strategy involves a major technical challenge of computing the expectation of the maximum of two negative binomial random variables. Previous characterizations of this expectation are approximate; we derive an exact characterization and analyze its scaling behavior, which may be of independent interest. We also use a martingale bounded differences argument to show that the actual coding delay is concentrated around its expectation.	approximation algorithm;average-case complexity;image scaling;linear network coding;network packet;routing;unicast	Theodoros K.

It consists in a risk-aware optimization approach that takes into consideration the randomness of the user profile associated with each base station (BS). The proposed approach jointly determines 1) the instants of time at which the current active BS configuration must be updated due to an increase or decrease of the network traffic load and 2) the set of minimum BSs to be activated to serve the networks’ subscribers. Probabilistic metrics modeling the traffic profile variation are developed to trigger this dynamic on/off switching operation. Selected simulation results are then performed to validate the proposed algorithm for different system parameters.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;network packet;randomness;simulation;user profile	Nadhir Ben Rached;Hakim Ghazzai;Abdullah Kadri;Mohamed-Slim Alouini	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2792001	real-time computing;quality of service;randomness;artificial neural network;computer science;energy consumption;algorithm;probabilistic logic;base station;user profile;cellular network	Embedded	22.33091840672816	94.26799003239329	44481

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme which combines dynamic buffer management with active queue management to assist routers in provisioning loss differentiated services. In order to support several levels of different traffic classes, we extend a dynamic threshold buffer management method in the case of multiple loss priorities. We detail the implementation of the scheme on routers. Simulation results confirmed that our scheme is able to adapt to load changing conditions and offer different guarantees for hybrid traffic flows in terms of their loss priorities.	differentiated services;provisioning;router (computing)	Suogang Li;Jianping Wu;Ke Xu	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-30582-8_33	best-effort delivery;active traffic management;the internet;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;bicarbonate buffering system;traffic flow;node;implementation;computer security;service quality;active queue management;computer network	Networks	0.4235822473271668	102.21669683496285	44589

This is motivated mainly by the emergence of large scale networks characterized by the lack of centralized access to information and time-varying connectivity. Control and optimization algorithms deployed in such networks should be completely distributed, relying only on local observations and information, and robust against unexpected changes in topology such as link failures. We will describe protocols to solve certain control and signal processing problems in this setting. We will demonstrate that a key challenge for such systems is the problem of computing averages in a decentralized way. Namely, we will show that a number of distributed control and signal processing problems can be solved straightforwardly if solutions to the averaging problem are available. The rest of the thesis will be concerned with algorithms for the averaging problem and its generalizations. We will (i) derive the fastest known averaging algorithms in a variety of settings and subject to a variety of communication and storage constraints (ii) prove a lower bound identifying a fundamental barrier for averaging algorithms (iii) propose a new model for distributed function computation which reflects the constraints facing many large-scale networks, and nearly characterize the general class of functions which can be computed in this model.

Cut-through packet forwarding is known to be an effective method to reduce forwarding latency. However, it suffers from the reliability issue, which is especially severe in highly mobile scenario, due to multi-path fading. This paper tries to establish a reliable cut-through forwarding scheme by applying diversity combining method to collision warning messages. By exploiting the nature of the multi-hop forwarding of a broadcast packet in CDMA wireless networks, the diversity combining scheme does not incur any additional communication overhead or delay. The simulation results show that diversity combining schemes, especially Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC), can effectively reduce BER by orders of magnitude.		Oyunchimeg Shagdar;Mehdad N.

Moreover, the problem of (partly) limited capacity in time and space requires the joint treatment of spatio-temporal data traffic and intercell interference dynamics. Concerning this matter, we propose a performance evaluation framework, which is capable of estimating various cell-specific and user-specific key performance metrics considering the complex spatio-temporal interaction of traffic and interference dynamics. We provide methods for obtaining these metrics with low complexity, making the framework attractive to self-organizing network solutions for future (ultra)dense networks. We stress the framework's broad applicability and demonstrate the effects of internal flow and external interference dynamics on network performance under various conditions. In particular, we highlight the dominance of these dynamics over the impact of the speed of the variation of intercell interference, the scheduler, the file size distribution, and fast fading.	assistive technology;backhaul (telecommunications);control plane;dataflow;forwarding plane;holism;interference (communication);network performance;organizing (structure);performance evaluation;phantom reference;point of view (computer hardware company);queueing theory;related-key attack;scheduling (computing);self-organization;software deployment;streaming media;throughput	Henrik Klessig;David Ohmann;Albrecht J.

We calculate the size distribution of spectral white spaces to find that large fractions of a band can be wasted even for small probabilities of false positives in single bins. To ameliorate this problem, we propose an algorithm consisting of random bin sampling followed by density clustering. The clustering algorithm yields a dramatic enhancement of the false positive rejection rate due to large differences between the densities of true and false detections. Simultaneously, a reduction in sensing time is possible due to the fact that the number of randomly sampled bins need only be a small fraction of the total number of bins. We explain the theory behind this method, compare to simulation, and derive heuristic guidelines for its implementation.	algorithm;cluster analysis;heuristic;network congestion;randomness;rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;white spaces (radio)	Andrew Robertson;Joseph Molnar	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415789	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics;statistics	EDA	14.300157565779843	101.2401334789639	44903

Previous approaches for rate adaptation mainly focused on the factors related to the wireless medium. However, applications' demands and timing constraints of the underlying protocols were not considered. The solution proposed in this paper tackles these shortcomings with a novel approach by performing rate adaptation according to the changing channel conditions, application preferences and timing constraints of the underlying protocols. The proposed rate adaptation is based on a loss differentiation mechanism which identifies the real cause of channel variations and takes an appropriate action thereafter. The design provides flexibility of tuning various parameters according to application type and offers minimal complexity. The simulation results assert considerable improvements over previous solutions in terms of the algorithm response to application requirements and dynamic adjustment with variation in underlying protocol performance.	algorithm;clock rate;complexity;control theory;data rate units;ieee 802.1x;loss function;network performance;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation	Shahbaz Khan;Sahibzada Ali Mahmud;Hamed S.

However, a realistic simulation of network traffic through analytical models is difficult, because the classic distributions are usually ineffective when applied to traffic-related random variables. A modeling and simulation approach using heavy-tailed mixture distributions is introduced in this paper. In the case study, this approach is used to build analytical models for random variables of several major Internet applications (FTP, HTTP, SMTP, POP3, SSH) of a campus network. Several statistical features of an NS2 simulation are compared against those of the traffic traces being simulated. The comparison indicates that the simulation is statistically similar to the real traffic.	deployment environment;experiment;hypertext transfer protocol;internet;intrusion detection system;mixture model;network packet;simulation;tracing (software)	Song Luo;Gerald A.

When there is a power outage, a smart meter tries to report it instantaneously to the electric utility. In a densely populated residential/industrial locality, it is possible that a large number of smart meters simultaneously try to get access to the communication network to report the power outage. If the number of smart meters is very high on the order of tens of thousands (metropolitan areas), the power outage data flooding can lead to Random Access CHannel (RACH) congestion. Several utilities are considering the use of cellular network for smart meter communications. In 3G/4G cellular networks, RACH congestion not only leads to collisions, retransmissions and increased RACH delays, but also has the potential to disrupt the dedicated traffic flow by increasing the interference levels (3G CDMA). In order to overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a Time Hierarchical Scheme (THS) that reduces the intensity of power outage data flooding and power outage reporting delay by 6/7th, and 17/18th when compared to their respective values without THS. Also, we propose an Optimum Transmission Rate Adaptive (OTRA) MAC to optimize the latency in power outage data collection. The analysis and simulation results presented in this paper show that both the OTRA and THS features of the proposed MAC results in a Power Outage Data Collection Latency (PODCL) that is 1/10th of the 4G LTE PODCL.	compaq lte;downtime;interference (communication);interrupt latency;locality of reference;network congestion;nyquist rate;population;random access;simulation;smart meter;software deployment;sun outage;telecommunications network	Shravan Garlapati;P.

In such a network, the communication links compete for the scarce and time-varying wireless channels. Recently, opportunistic scheduling that exploits variation of channel conditions at each link has drawn great attention to improve system performance. Taking advantage of the multiuser diversity and being aware of the potential contention among neighboring transmissions, we formulate the opportunistic scheduling problems with QoS requirements and present the optimal scheduling policies for both single- and multi- hop ad hoc networks. We also proposed COS, a distributed Cooperative and Opportunistic Scheduling algorithm, which realizes the optimal scheduling policies by introducing the cooperation among neighboring transmitters. Simulation results indicate that our implementation achieves higher network throughput and provides better QoS support than existing solutions.	algorithm;cos;crew scheduling;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);multi-user;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Qian Zhang;Zhisheng Niu	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.610	vehicular ad hoc network;fair-share scheduling;wireless ad hoc network;job shop scheduling;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;distributed computing;computer performance;round-robin scheduling;computer network	Mobile	15.077117671015333	93.58929040454233	45461

We analyze a simple queueing model where customers may be randomly disordered, before arriving at a single server queue. The performance index chosen is the variance of the server waiting time, which is a measure of the `jitter' suffered by the application. The analysis reveals that not resequencing customers does improve the service regularity for a wide range of loss probabilities and service times. It shows also that, contrary to the conclusions of previous analyses, resequencing does not necessarily make the performance of the system worse.

As the number of stations increases, the performance dramatically decreases since the probability of packet collision increases. Due to these reasons, there have been many research efforts to reduce the packet collisions via backoff reservation schemes. However, the schemes have limitations in that they cannot be implemented in currently deployed wireless devices since they require the header of IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) frame to be modified. In contrast to the pre-existing schemes, without the modification of the MAC frame header, the proposed scheme, DBRS, mitigates the packet collisions using a novel distributed backoff reservation and scheduling scheme. Through extensive simulations, the DBRS scheme is proved that stations achieve higher throughput and better fairness compared with the legacy IEEE 802.11 DCF.	access control;backoff;collision domain;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;network packet;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Eunjun Choi;Wonjun Lee	2008	2008 International Conference on Information Networking	10.1109/ICOIN.2008.4472740	network allocation vector;real-time computing;distributed coordination function;computer science;operating system;probability;distributed computing;scheduling;statistics;computer network	Mobile	7.495980545079442	92.70723980170088	45643
251cf0754fbe9c361109523b8ce6f94f40476fd8	network coding for severe packet reordering in multihop wireless networks		Network coding is known to be effective in overcoming packet losses and packet reordering in multihop wireless networks. Despite the benefits, network coding is hard to deploy without being compatible with TCP. To address this problem, a seminal paper proposed a network coding scheme that adopts an ACK-based sliding-widow network coding approach. In this paper we show that the previous scheme may not suffice to mitigate the effects of packets received out of order in multipath wireless networks where severe packet reordering persists. We propose a modified network coding layer where the receiver acknowledges every degree of freedom by using the sequence number of a newly seen packet instead of using that of the oldest unseen packet so that the network coding layer can be compatible with a TCP variant for severe packet reordering. To reduce the decoding matrix size and the coding buffer size, our scheme allows retransmission at the network coding layer. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the exiting scheme in multipath wireless networks particularly when severe packet reordering persists.	linear network coding	Chansook Lim	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/379108	linear network coding;packet analyzer;telecommunications;computer science;packet segmentation;processing delay;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;transmission delay;packet switch;computer network	Mobile	-1.4329348585020865	91.0830038252564	45656

Indeed, flow throughputs can span orders of magnitude from near starvation to many times greater than the mean. In this paper, we address the foundations of this disparity. We show that the fundamental cause is not merely differences in the number of contending neighbors, but a generic coordination problem of CSMA-based random access in a multi-hop environment. We develop a new analytical model that incorporates this lack of coordination, identifies dominating and starving flows and accurately predicts per-flow throughput in a large-scale network. We then propose metrics that quantify throughput imbalances due to the MAC protocol operation.

Thus, an important requirement for conducting simulation studies of telecommunication networks is the ability to generate long synthetic stochastic self-similar sequences. A new generator of pseudo-random self-similar sequences, based on the fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) and a wavelet transform, is proposed and analysed in this paper. Specifically, this generator uses Daubechies wavelets. The motivation behind this selection of wavelets is that Daubechies wavelets lead to more accurate results by better matching the selfsimilar structure of long range dependent processes, than other types of wavelets. The statistical accuracy and time required to produce sequences of a given (long) length are experimentally studied. This generator shows a high level of accuracy of the output data (in the sense of the Hurst parameter) and is fast. Its theoretical algorithmic complexity isO(n).	computational complexity theory;dreamwidth;experiment;fractal;high-level programming language;hurst exponent;pseudorandomness;self-similarity;simulation;synthetic intelligence;wavelet transform	Hae-Duck Joshua Jeong;Donald C.

9a74bda84a6b429c289fd16262b4d4b5e31a92cc	improved performance with adaptive dly-ack for ieee 802.15.3 wpan over uwb phy	tecnologia electronica telecomunicaciones;802 15 3 wpan;tecnologias;grupo a;uwb;dly ack;burst size	Dly-ACK scheme in IEEE 802.15.3 MAC is designed to reduce the overhead of the ACK frame in MAC layer and improve the channel utilization. However, how to using the Dly-ACK is open for implementation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Dly-ACK scheme for both TCP and UDP traffic. We first point out the problems of applying fixed Dly-ACK scheme to these two traffic scenarios and show that the system performance is rather poor and the causes of these problems are presented. Based on our observations, two enhancement mechanisms for fixed Dly-ACK are then proposed. The first one is to request the Dly-ACK frame adaptively or change the burst size of Dly-ACK according to the transmitter queue status. The second is a retransmission counter to enable the destination DEV to deliver the MAC data frames to upper layer timely and orderly. Simulation results show that, with our enhancements, the system performance can be improved significantly compared with the conventional Imm-ACK and fixed Dly-ACK. We also investigate the impacts of some important parameters such as the buffer size on the system performance. Some important guidelines for the Dly-ACK design are given. Finally, it is worth to point out that our Dly-ACK enhancements are compatible with the standard and it is transparent to the upper layer protocols, i.e., either UDP or TCP.	acknowledgement (data networks);phy (chip);ultra-wideband	Hongyuan Chen;Zihua Guo;Richard Yao;Yanda Li	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.9.2364	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;computer network	Visualization	-0.5915726249471686	93.06361508748185	45940

Our model is appropriate for video on demand, as well as other on-demand multimedia applications. In particular, we allow users to specify when the sources begin transmission; we also allow the user to invoke VCR actions such as pause and temporal jumps. We suppose that the quality of service (QoS) requirement allows for a small amount of packet loss. We develop a stochastic model which captures the random phases of the sources. We then apply large deviation theory to our model to develop global admission rules. The accuracy of the large deviation approximation is verified with simulation experiments employing importance sampling techniques. We also propose a refined admission rule which combines the global test and a myopic test. Numerical results are presented for theStar Wars trace; we find that the statistical multiplexing gain is potentially high and often insensitive to the QoS parameter. Finally, we develop efficient schemes for the real-time implementation of our global test. In particular, we demonstrate that the Taylor series expansion of the logarithmic moment generating function of the frame size distribution allows for fast and accurate admission decisions.	approximation;experiment;importance sampling;multiplexing;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;sampling (signal processing);series expansion;simulation;videocassette recorder	Martin Reisslein;Keith W.

HiperLAN type 2 is an ETSI broadband wireless access network standard operating in license-exempt 5GHz band. The MAC protocol of HiperLAN type 2 is based on TDMA/TDD and resources in one MAC frame can be allocated dynamically by Access Point(AP). In this paper, we propose a dynamic random channel allocation scheme for HiperLAN type 2. The AP scheduler controls the number of Random Channels(RCH’s) in a MAC frame according to transmission results of the previous MAC frame. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher efficiency of resource and lower access delay than fixed RCH’s allocation schemes.	access network;frame language;memory management;nsa product types;scheduling (computing);simulation;test-driven development	Gyung-Ho Hwang;Dong-Ho Cho	2002		10.1109/ICC.2002.997247	channel allocation schemes;real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;mobile computing;scheduling;time division multiple access;radio control;computer network;data transmission;broadband networks	Mobile	5.7800408084266515	96.83053363493904	46444

Marine Internet (MI) is the basic infrastructure of ocean informatization, so developing the MI technology is of great significance. There are several access networks maybe available in a MI system, and a network user has to choose the best one to support the application. The selection scheme needs to consider may factors in order to make a smart decision, which is a multi-index decision problem. These factors include user preferences, business types, and the performance as well as cost of alternative access networks. Combining with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) algorithm and entropy theory, we develop a method for the user to select access networks in a smart way. It adopts subjective and objective weights and a utility function to select the target access network. The simulation results carried out on the Exata platform show that the proposed scheme can improve the network performance with reduced cost.	access network;selection algorithm	Liang Zhou;Shengming Jiang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68121-4_47	reduced cost;analytic hierarchy process;the internet;selection algorithm;access method;decision problem;access network;network performance;engineering;distributed computing	Theory	21.63810619488308	94.12956084667991	46607

To meet this need, a novel distributed graph coloring based time division multiple access scheduling algorithm (GCSA), considering real-time performance for clustering-based sensor network, is proposed in this paper, to determine the smallest length of conflict-free assignment of timeslots for intra-cluster transmissions. GCSA involves two phases. In coloring phase, networks are modeled using graph theory, and a distributed vertex coloring algorithm, which is a distance-2 coloring algorithm and can get colors near to (δ +1), is proposed to assign a color to each node in the network. Then, in scheduling phase, each independent set is mapped to a unique timeslot according to the set’s priority which is obtained by considering network structure. The experimental results indicate that GCSA can significantly decrease intra-cluster delay and increase intra-cluster throughput, which satisfies real-time performance as well as communication reliability.	algorithm;cluster analysis;color;fairness measure;graph coloring;graph theory;independent set (graph theory);interference (communication);like button;netbeans ide;performance evaluation;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;simulation;throughput	Hui Kang;Ya-nan Zhao;Fang Mei	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1052-9	real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;graph coloring;distributed computing;cluster analysis;greedy coloring;time division multiple access	Embedded	16.580245097551757	91.9970388771695	46622

Specifically, we consider a multi-hop WANET with malicious eavesdroppers and cooperative jammers, and formulate the SOQR as an optimization problem. To deal with this problem, we first derive the closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for any given end-to-end path, which serve as the performance metrics of communication QoS and transmission security, respectively. Then, we explore the minimum COP conditioned on that SOP is below a pre- specified threshold and obtain the corresponding achievable power allocation strategy. With the help of analysis of a given path, we further propose the SOQR algorithm which selects the secure path between a pair of source and destination nodes in a distributed manner to achieve the optimal QoS performance. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of our theoretical results, as well as to illustrate the QoS-security tradeoffs.	algorithm;computer simulation;condition number;dijkstra's algorithm;downtime;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quality of service;radio jamming;routing;transmission security	Yang Xu;Jia Liu;Osamu Takahashi;Norio Shiratori;Xiaohong Jiang	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925687	computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.876914514784271	92.23443650972028	46719

The soft handoff (SHO) method provides seamless roaming, but makes heavy use of battery and radio resources. In this paper, we propose a conservative soft handoff (cSHO) which maintains the benefits of SHO and reduces the consumption of resources. Instead of using both radio interfaces during the handoff period, the mobile station (MS) activates and deactivates its radio interfaces and switches between them to maintain the best possible radio connection. Since multimedia packets are already duplicated in the network and buffered in the base stations, fast switching between interfaces is possible. We investigate the performance of our proposed scheme by simulation and compare the performance of the cSHO scheme with the SHO and hard handoff (HHO) mechanisms.	network packet;network switch;next-generation network;seamless3d;server (computing);simulation;thyristor	Abolfazl Nazari;Philip Branch;Jason But;Hai Le Vu	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506614	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	19.41132963581019	90.81797451195821	46911

Inspired by the growth of interest in building hybrid streaming systems that consist of backbone trees supplemented by other overlay structures, we revisit the minimum delay streaming problem and design practical min-delay algorithms to support the streaming in the backbone trees. What mainly distinguishes our multi-tree push from the conventional ones is an unbalanced tree design guided by the snow-ball streaming, which has a provable minimum delay. We design algorithms to construct and maintain our SNowbAll multi-tree Pushing (SNAP) overlay.

128d4397380d7808a326bd10b178451e96865035	rethinking mobile devices' energy efficiency in wlan management services		With the rapid popularization of large data stream mobile applications, wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been a top choice for mobile users (MUs), because of the high data rate and low monetary cost. However, the battery life of mobile devices, which is the most concerned feature of MUs, may suffer from WLAN management services, such as mobility management and load balancing services. Unfortunately, few existing WLAN systems take into account both the energy efficiency of mobile devices and the performance of management services. Even worse, to improve the performance of WLAN management services, various existing management mechanisms sacrifice mobile devicesu0027 energy. In this paper, we propose BELL, a novel WLAN system that provides two energy-efficient management services for its associated MUs by reproducing and scheduling the beacons broadcast from access points (APs). We name them BELL- handoff and BELL-2M services. We have implemented the proposed BELL-handoff using commercial Wi-Fi adapters. The experimental results reveal that BELL-handoff significantly decreases both mobile devicesu0027 energy consumption and latency during handoffs, compared with the commercial WLAN mobility management service. Furthermore, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate APsu0027 load and mobile devicesu0027 battery life within a large-scale deployment of BELL. Simulation results demonstrate that BELL not only balances the load among APs, but also prolongs the battery life of mobile devices.	bell's theorem;data rate units;load balancing (computing);mobile app;mobile device;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;wireless access point	Haoxin Wang;Jiang Xie;Xingya Liu	2018	2018 15th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397137	computer network;computer science;latency (engineering);local area network;scheduling (computing);handover;mobility management;mobile device;wireless;load balancing (computing)	Mobile	-3.9162163252733633	91.66766495726263	46985
08f61d912ee94ecae027a837f501ebed2064029a	routing, network coding and tcp support for wideband hf communications		High frequency (HF) communications provide beyond line-of-sight (BLoS) links for robust and reliable delivery of critical messages over long distances. HF communications suffer from low data rates and are susceptible to highly dynamic HF channel effects. Wideband HF (WBHF) communication technologies aim to support higher throughput rates that can be achieved with higher bandwidth. While there has been progress in the design of WBHF technologies at the physical layer, there is a lack of network and transport layer solutions that can support WBHF communications with improved end-to-end network performance in terms of throughput, reliability, delay, and overhead. First, a high-fidelity WBHF network simulator is presented to implement, test, and evaluate network protocols under realistic HF channel conditions that show unique characteristics compared to other spectrum bands. The WBHF network simulator runs real packet traffic with the real network protocol stack on virtual HF radios. The integrated HF channel simulator models long, intermediate, and short time-scale HF channel effects. Second, routing is combined with packet-level coding to support reliable communications for unicast and multicast traffic while limiting the need for end-to-end feedback messages. To support interoperability with transmission control protocol (TCP) applications, a performance-enhancing proxy (PEP) is used to improve the throughput achieved with TCP for WBHF communications. These network solutions are evaluated with the high-fidelity WBHF network simulator and their feasibility to improve the WBHF network performance is demonstrated.		Tugba Erpek;Yalin E.

The OBP gives sources the capacity to look inside the network and to make their congestion control decisions, based, not only on packets loss or packets delay, but also based on another kind of information. For example, the most restricted interface capacity, the available bandwidth, the RTT variations or the presence of heterogeneous transmission means. In the paper we describe the OBP and discuss its evaluation results based on ns-2 simulations. The results show the OBP ́s capacity to provide traffic sources with the required information, in static or dynamic network scenarios, and to make correct and quick congestion control decisions. Also, it is visible that the OBP avoids the full queue problem and tries to keep the queues near zero occupation.	network congestion;simulation	Paulo Loureiro;Saverio Mascolo;Edmundo Monteiro	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75444-2_48	network traffic control;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;packet loss;network congestion;computer network	Networks	-2.2903929596660326	96.32664440811827	47068

With Quick-Start, TCP hosts can request permission from the routers along a network path to send at a higher rate than allowed by the default TCP congestion control. The explicit router feedback avoids the time-consuming capacity probing by the TCP Slow-Start and is therefore particularly beneficial for underutilized paths with a high bandwidth-delay product. In this paper, the performance of the Quick-Start TCP extension is analyzed and the impact of router admission control strategies is studied. The main contribution is an analytical model that quantifies the improvement compared to default TCP Slow-Start. The model is validated by simulation results and by initial measurements with a Quick-Start implementation in the Linux operating system. Our results confirm that Quick-Start can significantly reduce the completion times of mid-sized data transfers.	bandwidth-delay product;best-effort delivery;linux;network congestion;operating system;profiling (computer programming);router (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control	Michael Scharf	2007	2007 Fourth International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems (BROADNETS '07)	10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550538	tcp westwood;best-effort delivery;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;computer science;bic tcp;transmission control protocol;feedback;distributed computing;h-tcp;internet protocol suite;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;linux kernel;bandwidth;computer network;bandwidth-delay product	HPC	-4.3725184809960025	94.26885025589613	47069

Under fairness and QoS constraints, they use opportunistic scheduling to efficiently utilize the available spectrum. Opportunistic scheduling algorithms rely on the collaboration among all mobile users to achieve their design objectives. However, we demonstrate that rogue cellular devices can exploit vulnerabilities in popular opportunistic scheduling algorithms, such as Proportional Fair (PF) and Temporal Fair (TF), to usurp the majority of time slots in 3G networks. Our simulations show that under realistic conditions, only five rogue device per 50-user cell can capture up to 95 percent of the time slots, and can cause 2-second end-to-end interpacket transmission delay on VoIP applications for every user in the same cell, rendering VoIP applications useless. To defend against this attack, we propose strengthening the PF and TF schedulers and a robust handoff scheme.	algorithm;crew scheduling;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;proportionally fair;rogue;scheduling (computing);simulation;tf–idf	Radmilo Racic;Denys Ma;Hao Chen;Xin Liu	2010	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2009.146	cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;information security;handover;operating system;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	2.279075384638935	102.68189398785134	47085

The throughput gain is achieved by introducing an algebraic method for combining multiple input streams of packets which are addressing one output port at an intermediate node. We present a practical implementation of network coding in conjunction with error control schemes, namely the Stop-and-Wait (SW) and Selective Repeat (SR) protocols. We propose a modified NC scheme and apply it at an intermediate SW ARQ-based link to reduce ARQ control signals at each transmission. We further extend this work to investigate the usefulness of NC in the Butterfly multicast network which adopts the SR ARQ protocol as an error control scheme. We validate our throughput analysis using a relatively recent discrete-event simulator, SimEvents ®. The results show that the proposed scheme offers a throughput advantage of at least 50% over traditional SW ARQ, and that this is particularly noticeable in the presence of high error rates. In the multicast network, however, simulation results show that when compared with the traditional scheme, NC-SR ARQ can achieve a throughput gain of between 2% and 96% in a low bandwidth channel and up to 19% in a high bandwidth channel with errors. repeat request …	approximation algorithm;archive;automatic repeat request;data rate units;error detection and correction;hyperlink;linear network coding;multicast;network packet;round-trip engineering;selective repeat arq;server (computing);shared web hosting service;shattered world;shrink wrap contract;simulation;throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video	Alaa Alsebae;Mark S.

Although some research works have been devoted to this topic, only a little attention has been paid to the stability of the network equipped with the energy conservation mechanisms. In fact, we find that the stability of networks can be undermined in the worst case if it isn't considered with care by the energy conservation mechanism.In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient scheduling protocol which can guarantee the stability of the network in all cases. We start by building a new model which can be used to verify the stability of the network equipped with the energy conservation mechanisms. With this model, we transform the packet scheduling problem to a Job Shop Scheduling problem. For this problem, we propose a time-stamp based work-conserving scheduling algorithm - G-FSA. Compared with existing methods, this scheduling algorithm guarantees a tighter bound on the make span of the jobs. Then, we integrate G-FSA with a time partition approach to generate our energy-efficient packet scheduling protocol. It is proved that the obtained protocol can guarantee the stability of network in all cases. And its approximation ratio in terms of energy efficiency can be bounded by O((1+∈ )α) for any ∈ > 0, where is an input parameter depending on the hardware infrastructure. Typically, 1 <; α ≤ 3.	approximation algorithm;basic stamp;best, worst and average case;broadcast signal intrusion;communications protocol;imax;job shop scheduling;network packet;network switch;overhead (computing);packet switching;parameter (computer programming);scheduling (computing);traffic collision avoidance system;urra=hubullu	Yangguang Shi;Fa Zhang;Zhiyong Liu	2013	2013 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications	10.1109/NCA.2013.20	fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;job shop scheduling;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;flow shop scheduling;energy conservation;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;genetic algorithm scheduling;two-level scheduling;deadline-monotonic scheduling;stride scheduling;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;scheduling;least slack time scheduling;lottery scheduling;round-robin scheduling;multiprocessor scheduling;i/o scheduling;packet switching;proportionally fair;computer network	Embedded	1.0505730645452163	92.91255699011778	47183

In the literature, SF is often assumed to be a serious problem specifically in a dynamic traffic context. It is mostly related to the bandwidth blocking ratio due to the lack of relevant comparison criteria and efficient metrics. Besides, in operator core network, traffic behavior is instead incremental and it is forecasted for short periods of time in addition to some operational constraints that make of it a specific context. In this work, we present an exhaustive analysis and an accurate evaluation for SF issue in flexible optical networks. We also propose new metric for fragmentation measurements and some approaches to address such a problem.	alternating bit protocol;blocking (computing);computation;control plane;entity framework;entropy (information theory);erlang (unit);fragmentation (computing);logical topology;numerical method;performance;provisioning;shannon (unit);time complexity;transponder	Djamel Amar;Esther Le Rouzic;Nicolas Brochier;Jean-Luc Auge;Catherine Lepers;Nancy Perrot	2015	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-015-0487-1	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	HPC	9.539313502789616	101.72424550236498	47307

The dissemination service, however, is limited by the wireless throughput in hotspots and cannot scale to a large number of users. This paper designs a new architecture that significantly improves the throughput of info-stations. We observe that usually the number of collocated infostations is smaller than the number of orthogonal channels in IEEE 802.11, leaving some orthogonal channels unused, and thus wasting their capacity. We also observe that many users of an info-station download the same objects. Thus, we advocate an architecture, called hybrid-WLAN (H-WLAN), where mobile nodes can retrieve objects (multimedia content or information) from the info-station in the infrastructure mode, or exploit the idle 802.11 channels to cooperatively share their content with neighboring nodes in an ad-hoc manner. Our H-WLAN contains two components. The first component directs each object request to a nearby ad-hoc node that has the requested object, while avoids overloading any of the nodes. The second component balances the load across channels taking into account the popularity of the disseminated objects. We evaluate our design via simulations. The results show that our H-WLAN improves channel utilization and provides significantly higher throughput. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The whole scheme only uses a small set of packet classes in a core-stateless network. At the ingress of the network each flow packet is marked into one of the sets of classes, and within the network, each class is assigned a different discarding priority. The AC method is based on edge-to-edge per-flow throughput measurements using the first packets of the flow, and it requires flows to send with a minimum rate. We evaluate the scheme through simulations in a simple bottleneck topology with different traffic loads consisting of TCP flows that carry files of varying sizes. We use a modified TCP source with a new algorithm that forces the source to send with a minimum rate. We compare our scheme with the besteffort service and we study the influence of the measurement duration on the scheme’s performance. The results prove that the scheme guarantees the requested throughput to accepted flows and achieves a high utilization of network resources.

Optimal selection of a serving base station guarantees high quality calls and a minimum number of handoffs. Traditional algorithms rely on hysteresis levels to determine the serving base station when a handoff is requested. In this work, optimal hysteresis levels are generated using Bayesian Hypothesis Tests allowing to incorporate in the hysteresis level information such as call processing costs, mobility profiles, cell sizes and traffic unbalance. Hysteresis impact on handoff uncertainty is assessed through an entropic indicator.	algorithm;display resolution;hysteresis	Fernando Jaimes-Romero;David Muñoz Rodríguez	2000	IEEE Trans.

We consider vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communications for a vehicle that aims to upload a file when it is within the APs' coverage ranges, where both the channel contention level and transmission data rate vary over time. The vehicle will pay a fixed amount each time it tries to access the APs, and will incur a penalty if it cannot finish the file uploading when leaving the APs. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal transmission policy with a single AP and random vehicular traffic arrivals. We formulate it as a finite-horizon sequential decision problem, solve it using dynamic programming (DP), and design a general dynamic optimal random access (DORA) algorithm. We derive the conditions under which the optimal transmission policy has a threshold structure, and propose a monotone DORA algorithm with a lower computational complexity for this special case. Next, we consider the problem of finding the optimal transmission policy with multiple APs and deterministic vehicular traffic arrivals thanks to perfect traffic estimation. We again obtain the optimal transmission policy using DP and propose a joint DORA algorithm. Simulation results based on a realistic vehicular traffic model show that our proposed algorithms achieve the minimal total cost and the highest upload ratio as compared with some other heuristic schemes. In particular, we show that the joint DORA scheme achieves an upload ratio 130% and 207% better than the heuristic schemes at low and high traffic densities, respectively.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;data rate units;decision problem;dynamic programming;heuristic;internet access;random access;simulation;upload;wireless access point;monotone	Man Hon Cheung;Fen Hou;Vincent W.

With the available two-hop relay schemes, a node, whenever getting an opportunity for transmission, randomly probes only once a neighbor node for the possible transmission. It is notable that such single probing strategy, although simple, may result in a significant waste of the precious transmission opportunities in highly dynamic MANETs. To alleviate such limitation for a more efficient utilization of limited wireless bandwidth, this paper proposes a more general probing-based two-hop relay algorithm with limited packet redundancy. In such an algorithm with probing round limit τ and packet redundancy limit f, each transmitter is allowed to conduct up to τ rounds of probing for identifying a possible receiver and each packet can be delivered to at most f distinct relays. A general theoretical framework is further developed to help us understand that under different setting of τ and f, how we can benefit from multiple probings in terms of the per node throughput capacity and the expected end-to-end packet delay.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);hop;internet relay chat;linear algebra;markov chain;moore neighborhood;network packet;performance prediction;randomness;routing;simulation;throughput;transmitter;waypoint	Jiajia Liu;Juntao Gao;Xiaohong Jiang;Hiroki Nishiyama;Nei Kato	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.091812.120346	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	13.329434836380745	89.61948920278176	47574

These carriers are the component carriers (CCs) that belong to the same carrier frequency. They are bonded together in order to fulfill the requirement of wide spectrum in LTE-Advanced. We first derive the analytical model for a bursty birth-death traffic model with fixed payload size for OFDMA with different frequency domain packet schedulers. Applying this model for a multi-carrier system, we compute the performance for different system setups. The obtained analytical results are verified using extensive system level simulations. Based on the analytical and simulation results, it is suggested to assign the users on all CCs if a cell is not heavily loaded. Otherwise, assign each user with only one CC using the load balancing method of Round Robin is preferable, in the sense that it maintains good performance with low uplink overhead.	algorithm;carrier frequency;compaq lte;load balancing (computing);network packet;overhead (computing);queueing theory;round-robin scheduling;simulation;telecommunications link;trunking	Yuanye Wang;Klaus I.

Specifically, in our proposed scheme, the antenna beamwidth is varied according to the vehicular speed. Varying the beamwidth allows us to attain a higher quality of service, because the effective transmission area specific to a safety application depends on the speed of the transmit vehicle. The proposed protocol has the additional benefit in terms of implementation, since it does not need additional negotiation overheads with other vehicles, hence allowing us to dispense with any change in the current standard. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of achieving a lower packet error ratio as well as lower communication latency than is the conventional system using omnidirectional antennas.	autonomous robot;bit error rate;hoc (programming language);network packet;omnidirectional treadmill;quality of service;simulation	Shota Soeno;Shinya Sugiura	2015	2015 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2015.7385558	vehicular ad hoc network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;artificial neural network;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	7.096239468303064	91.2453353648136	47726

End-to-end QOS is recognized as a function of terminal capability and network performance. The key feature of B-ISDN is that both terminal capability and network performance are selectable and controllable. In order to capture the basic characteristics of end-to-end QOS, it is necessary to conduct experiments using a prototype system. We present a prototype system comprised of an ATM switch and video codecs. The ATM switch is based on distributed-memory-switch architecture, and it will provide for nonblocking cell-switching capability with a very low cell-transfer delay. Developed codecs conform to H.261 with an additional function of controlling average coding bit rate. We choose coding bit rate as, a parameter of terminal capability and cell-loss ratio as a parameter of network performance. From experiments using a prototype system, a relationship between coding bit rate and cell-loss ratio was obtained.	atm turbo;cell (microprocessor);cell relay;codec;data compression;digital electronics;distributed memory;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;hdmi;integrated services digital network;network performance;prototype;quality of service	Katsuyuki Yamazaki;Masahiro Wada;Yasuhiro Takishima;Yasushi Wakahara	1993	IEEE Trans.

7c9caec7f29615f24a80f9416e29dd039ac520b5	dynamic mobile edge caching with location differentiation		Mobile edge caching enables content delivery directly within the radio access network, which effectively alleviates the backhaul burden and reduces round-trip latency. To fully exploit the edge resources, the most popular contents should be identified and cached. Observing that content popularity varies greatly at different locations, to maximize local hit rate, this paper proposes an online learning algorithm that dynamically predicts content hit rate, and makes location-differentiated caching decisions. Specifically, a linear model is used to estimate the future hit rate. Considering the variations in user demand, a perturbation is added to the estimation to account for uncertainty. The proposed learning algorithm requires no training phase, and hence is adaptive to the time-varying content popularity profile. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm asymptotically approaches the optimal policy in the long term. Extensive simulations based on real world traces show that, the proposed algorithm achieves higher hit rate and better adaptiveness to content popularity fluctuation, compared with other schemes.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);cache (computing);digital distribution;edge computing;linear model;quantum fluctuation;radio access network;simulation;tracing (software)	Peng Yang;Ning Zhang;Shan Zhang;Li Yu;Junshan Zhang;Xuemin Shen	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254034	computer network;cache;real-time computing;latency (engineering);distributed computing;algorithm design;radio access network;computer science;hit rate;linear model;exploit;mobile computing	Mobile	24.018166811987953	96.86288284649302	47859

This article presents a simulation based traffic analysis tool for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches. The simulator for the ATM Cell scheduler models a complex Hierarchical Scheduling (HS) discipline with multiple levels of scheduling. The interaction of the first level per virtual circuit (VC) scheduler with second level class scheduler among multiple class types is very complex. It is useful to use the simulator to derive theoretical outcomes of traffic configurations both in live networks and in lab environments. Connection Admission Control (CAC) algorithms are also incorporated in the simulator for Effective Bandwidth (EBW) calculation and scheduler weight allocation.

I. I NTRODUCTION F ORWARD-ERROR correction (FEC) techniques are thepreferred error-control schemes for multicast or interactivestreaming applications. In this case, packet-level FEC schemes[1], [2] provide an efficient way to fight against losses, althoughthe perfect recovery cannot be guaranteed.Several studies have been performed to compute the FEC ef-ficiency or the probability for data to be recovered in case ofloss [3]–[5]. However, this parameter does not bring enough in-formation about the loss process in multimedia streaming appli-cations, and more particularly for video and audio streams. Tocorrectly model the video quality, for example, at least two pa-rameters, namely the packet loss ratio (i.e., the proportion oflost packets) and the average burst length , shall be computed[6]. The aim of this paper is to compute these two parametersin the case of a renewal error process. The FEC efficiency de-pends on both the network performance and the media-indepen-dent FEC parameters and .The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents a briefoverview of FEC error-control and develops the set of equationsneeded to compute and . Both parameters are then com-puted in Section III for a Gilbert-model loss process. The an-alytical values are validated against experimental data.

In particular, an original queuing architecture and a dynamic routing-scheduling-coding strategy are introduced for serving multiple sessions when linear network coding is allowed across sessions. This policy provides a novel extension to the class of back-pressure policies by incorporating inter-session coding decisions via simple rules on the relevant queue-length levels. Despite the fact that the capacity region of inter-session coding is a challenging open problem, in this paper, we prove that our algorithm can support any set of rates in a nontrivial characterized region of achievable rates. In addition to its practical implications, this work also provides a theoretical framework in which the gains of inter-session network coding and pure routing can be compared.	algorithm;computer programming;convolutional code;hop;interference (communication);lagrange multiplier;linear code;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;multicast;network congestion;network model;network topology;norm (social);optimization problem;relevance;routing;scheduling (computing);throughput;unicast	Atilla Eryilmaz;Desmond S.

In general, a QoS scheme requires close collaboration between all layers in the protocol stack. At the base of the scheme is a QoS capable MAC protocol. In ad hoc networks nowadays, the widely deployed distributed coordination function (DCF) proposed by the IEEE 802.11 standard is a random access scheme and suffers from a fairness problem. In order to provide a guarantee of minimal throughput and improve the fairness of bandwidth sharing, a class of collision-free MAC scheduling algorithms is proposed. When implementing these algorithms, the set of node identifiers (IDs) that can connect to the network should be known in advance. In addition, neighborhood information sharing is required. Compared with their counterparts proposed in the literature, these algorithms can guarantee a minimal throughput and do not rely on per-packet information exchange. Simulation results show that these algorithms can provide better long term fairness when compared with IEEE 802.11 DCF, even when they are implemented in coarse time granularity.	algorithm;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;global serializability;hash table;hoc (programming language);identifier;information exchange;maximal set;network packet;protocol stack;quality of service;random access;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Zuyuan Fang;Brahim Bensaou;Jin Yuan	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

7d251d505cfb3fa607b06f0e3129eabd133bfad4	enhanced core stateless fair queuing with multiple queue priority scheduler		The Core Stateless Fair Queuing (CSFQ) is a distributed approach of Fair Queuing (FQ). The limitations include its inability to estimate fairness during large traffic flows, which are short and bursty (VoIP or video), and also it utilizes the single FIFO queue at the core router. For improving the fairness and efficiency, we propose an Enhanced Core Stateless Fair Queuing (ECSFQ) with multiple queue priority scheduler. Initially priority scheduler is applied to the flows entering the ingress edge router. If it is real time flow i.e., VoIP or video flow, then the packets are given higher priority else lower priority. In core router, for higher priority flows the Multiple Queue Fair Queuing (MQFQ) is applied that allows a flow to utilize multiple queues to transmit the packets. In case of lower priority, the normal max-min fairness criterion of CSFQ is applied to perform probabilistic packet dropping. By simulation results, we show that this technique improves the throughput of real time flows by reducing the packet loss and delay.	core router;fifo (computing and electronics);fair queuing;fairness measure;fully qualified name;max-min fairness;multistage interconnection networks;network packet;router (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;stateless protocol;throughput	Sivasubramaniam Nandhini;Senniappan Palaniammal	2014	Int.

The channel state is not directly observable, and thus the transmission decisions must be based on partial or incomplete channel state information, provided to the user by the base station over a feedback channel. More specifically, we assume that the delayed channel state information is provided to the sender at the end of those time slots during which packet transmissions are made. We cast the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Despite the difficulty associated with the incomplete channel information, we obtain the optimal transmission scheme, which can be interpreted as a back-off rule: at the end of the transmission, depending on the channel quality during the past time slot, the transmission may be suspended for some time slots, which can be computed in advance.

Conventional congestion control algorithm, such as TCP, suffers from the performance degradation in multihop wireless networks, due to the characteristics of the shared wireless media. Lack of precise congestion indication and coordination among nodes that compete for the share wireless channel, TCP fails to allocate resource efficiently and fairly among flows. In this paper, we present a novel Explicit Wireless Congestion Control Protocol (EWCCP) for stationary multihop wireless networks. By exploiting explicit coordination and multi-bit explicit feedback from routers, EWCCP gains fine-grain control and is robust to the dynamics of the wireless channel. EWCCP stabilizes at a lower but more optimal sending window regarding to TCP, and achieves low buffer occupation and low delay. With explicit coordination, EWCCP allocates resource fairly among flows that compete for the shared channel. With an analytical model, we show that EWCCP achieves proportional fairness in multi-hop wireless networks. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of EWCCP. It is shown that EWCCP is a viable congestion control scheme for multihop wireless networks.	algorithm;elegant degradation;fairness measure;network congestion;proportionally fair;simulation;stationary process	Kun Tan;Qian Zhang;Feng Jiang;Xuemin Shen	2005	2005 Second Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks, 2005.

Network coding is a recent and highly regarded technology for capacity enhancement with multiple unicast and multisource multicast networks. We have analyzed the performance of network coding on a two-hop wireless relay access system employing the slotted ALOHA under a balanced bidirectional traffic. The relay nodes will generally undergo this unbalanced multidirectional traffic but the impact of this unbalanced traffic on network coding has not been analyzed. This paper provides closed-form expressions for the throughput and packet delay for two-hop unbalanced bidirectional traffic cases both with and without network coding even if the buffers on nodes are unsaturated. The analytical results are mainly derived by solving queueing systems for the buffer behavior at the relay node. The results show that the transmission probability of the relay node is a design parameter that is crucial to maximizing the achievable throughput of wireless network coding in slotted ALOHA on two-hop unbalanced traffic cases. Furthermore, we show that the throughput is enhanced even if the traffic at the relay node is unbalanced.	linear network coding;multicast;network packet;relay;throughput;unbalanced circuit;unicast	Daisuke Umehara;Tomoya Hirano;Satoshi Denno;Masahiro Morikura;Takatoshi Sugiyama	2009	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2009.090607	telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Networks	12.450391228729078	90.85709384696413	48638

MBS (Multicast Broadcast Service) based on WiBro has numerous applications including DMB. Since the current MBS implementation uses only common channel which is managed by scheduling, it cannot effectively support many users requesting the service at the same time. This paper proposes a new counting scheme with which the channel mode can be properly switched between common channel and dedicated channel by considering the number of users and their mobility. It thus allows efficient use of limited radio resource in WiBro supporting the MBS. The simulation results with NS-2 show that it is significantly more efficient than the existing scheme when many users request the same broadcasting service channel.	multicast;scheduling (computing);simulation	Nak Beom Sung;Kyung Tae Kim;Sun Sik Park;Hee Yong Youn	2009	2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2009.58	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	5.527749828062902	96.03566259938871	48757

We also investigate the affects of other traffics and network characteristics on application performance. The examined signaling protocols are JIT, JET and Horizon. We apply the exponential and hyperexponential distributions on these traffics for producing the inter-arrival times of the packets. We present a communication between a source client node and a destination client node over an ingress and one or more multiple intermediate switches.

For achieving robust and efficient transmission, the transmission rate is controlled by exploiting the multi-rate capability of the IEEE 802.11 physical layer (PHY) to respond to the time-varying channel condition. In this paper, we propose a novel rate adaptation scheme, called RA-MCE, in which the transmitter estimates channel quality in the MAC layer to enhance throughput performance without the need to use the RTS-CTS mechanism nor to modify the IEEE 802.11 standard. RA-MCE adaptively controls the transmission rate according to the estimated channel quality by the MAC layer channel quality estimator (MCE) that uses only local MAC layer measurements.

Therefore, a fast handover approach to minimize the blocking time of real-time traffic is necessary for providing QoS. In this paper, we present a novel network architecture for IEEE 802.16e, which is still compatible to the IEEE 802.16e standard. Based on this architecture, a network assisted fast handover scheme (NFHO) is proposed to shorten the handover time. Performance evaluation has shown that our proposed NFHO scheme reduces the service disruption time by 98.2% and 96.8% compared to association levels 1 and 2 / Choi et al. of the IEEE 802.16e, respectively, for scanning just one base station (BS). Our improvements will be even better if scanning more BSs. In addition, the proposed NFHO scheme reduces the service disruption time by 78.4% with five neighbouring BSs scanning compared to Lee et al.	blocking (computing);denial-of-service attack;ieee 1471;ieee 754-1985;managed security service;network architecture;network packet;performance evaluation;real-time clock	Lung-Sheng Lee;Kuochen Wang	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394650	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer network	Embedded	6.727918250024577	97.75180597611367	48796

Several mechanisms, based on feedback control, have been recently proposed in the literature, where the feedback information is a single-bit carried in the cell header for source rate adaptation. This paper proposes a new single-bit feedback scheme that can convey congestion information, e.g. queue(s) size and link(s) utilisation at the switches, more accurately than existing similar ones, and without extra implementation cost. Results from both theoretical analysis and simulation are presented to demonstrate its higher degree of accuracy. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.	atm turbo;control system;data compression;feedback;network congestion;network switch;simulation	Hong Liu;Enmin Song;Mohamed Ould-Khaoua;Reza Sotudeh	1998	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(98)00179-0	real-time computing;computer science;flow control;feedback;network congestion;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-3.2681900932365444	95.7790605446397	48858

While in traditional telephone networks this was easily done by Erlang's formula, it became much harder in today's complex networks that carry very heterogeneous traffic. We present a simple, efficient method to estimate the blocking probability and link utilization for general multirate, heterogeneous traffic, where the individual bandwidth demands may aggregate in complex, nonlinear ways. The estimation is derived without adopting conventional performance modeling assumptions, such as Poisson arrivals or exponential holding times, thus allowing non-standard behaviour patterns, including special phenomena of IP networks, such as self-similarity. Despite its generality, our estimation maintains an optimally tight exponent and is capable of handling apparently very different cases in a unified way. The approach also makes it possible to make estimations under incomplete information. We show that the results are easily applicable for fast, robust link dimensioning, especially in case of complex traffic patterns, under partial information. Moreover, it is very well fitted for embedding into network level optimization tasks, due in part to simplicity and in part to convexity properties.	blocking (computing);computation;erlang (unit)	András Faragó	2008	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2007.02.009	erlang distribution;network planning and design;active traffic management;aggregate;flow network;simulation;systems modeling;poisson process;telephone network;convexity;telecommunications;computer science;perfect information;traffic flow;embedding;mathematics;dimensioning;complete information;blocking;bandwidth;complex network;engineering design process;statistics	Networks	0.16645159051048442	100.92637779607087	49018

Several distributions are considered as the non-Poissonian traffic. The resulting model uses matrix algebraic techniques only, thus not requiring any complex and/or tedious transform techniques. The authors also incorporate various control policies in their modeling framework using acceptance functions. Through computational studies, they conclude that the second and the third moments of the non-Poissonian traffic have significant impact on various performance measures. >	profiling (computer programming)	Deep Medhi;Appie van de Liefvoort;C.

Due to different traffic characteristics, it poses some challenges for traditional random access procedure and resource allocation algorithm in LTE network. We propose a polling service that avoids contention. This service is integrated into LTE access network, fully compatible with the standard access mechanism and able to manage a large range of polling periods (typically from 1 minute to 28 days). This proposed service reduces the transmission overhead and thus improves the energy efficiency for MTC devices. It also reduces access network overload in radio access network by avoiding random access. Compared with traditional random access mechanism, numerical results show that with proposed service one eNodeB (eNB) can easily support up to 15000 MTC devices without network access collision.	algorithm;compaq lte;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);radio access network;random access	Qipeng Song;Xavier Lagrange;Loutfi Nuaymi	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7390837	radio access network;payload;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;resource management;distributed computing;access stratum;computer network;network access point;network access device	Mobile	21.073178963087525	90.57603041672802	49316

A key challenge in such a system is sharing network resources between small MTDs, which have limited memory and computational capabilities. In this paper, a novel learning with finite memory framework is proposed to enable MTDs to effectively learn about each others message state, so as to properly adapt their transmission parameters. In particular, an IoT system in which MTDs can transmit both delay tolerant, periodic messages and critical alarm messages is studied. For this model, the characterization of the exponentially growing delay for critical alarm messages and the convergence of the proposed learning framework in an IoT are analyzed. Simulation results show that the delay of critical alarm messages is significantly reduced up to 94% with very minimal memory requirements. The results also show that the proposed learning with finite memory framework is very effective in mitigating the limiting factors of learning that prevent proper learning procedures.	internet of things;propagation constant;requirement;simulation;throughput	Taehyeun Park;Walid Saad	2016	2016 Annual Conference on Information Science and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2016.7460572	random variable;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;information science;computer science;theoretical computer science;reliability;distributed computing;wireless;statistics;memory management	EDA	18.05170463460991	92.97012303982932	49345

In this paper, we use the idea of data randomization to proactively randomize the spectrum (re)allocation to improve connections' security. As it is well-known that random (re)allocation fragments the spectrum and thus increases blocking in elastic optical networks, we analyze the tradeoff between system performance and security. To this end, in addition to spectrum randomization, we utilize an on-demand defragmentation scheme every time a request is blocked due to the spectrum fragmentation. We model the occupancy pattern of an elastic optical link (EOL) using a multi-class continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) under the random-fit spectrum allocation method. Numerical results show that although both the blocking and security can be improved for a particular so-called randomization process (RP) arrival rate, while with the increase in RP arrival rate the connections' security improves at the cost of the increase in overall blocking.	address space layout randomization;blocking (computing);data security;end-of-life (product);erlang (unit);fragmentation (computing);frequency allocation;markov chain;numerical method;queueing theory;rp (complexity);scott continuity;spectrum reallocation	Sandeep Kumar Singh;Wolfgang Bziuk;Admela Jukan	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841622	data modeling;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;radio frequency;computer network	Metrics	4.297735907353505	99.37228014196165	49585

More and more new services compositions request more bandwidth and network resources, which lead to serious traffic congestion and low channel utilization. Suffering from isolated link connection and changeable delay under the satellite environment, current bandwidth allocation schemes could not satisfy with the demand of low delay and high assess rate for new satellite services. This paper focuses on bandwidth allocation method for satellite communication services compositions. The novel models of services compositions with single-hop Poisson distribution are designed to simulate original traffic arrival. Isolated independent coefficients take an original distribution to adapt to isolated disconnections. Services queue waiting time would be judged by acceptable delay threshold. Models provide new services compositions with more precise arrival distributions. In order to improve traffic congestion, the method combined services models, and a network performance is proposed. Optimal reserved bandwidth is set according to the priority and arrival distribution of different services compositions, which classify services with feedback transmission performance. We design minimum fuzzy delay tolerant intervals to calculate delay tolerant threshold, which adapt random delay changes in the services network with delay tolerant features. The simulation in OPNET demonstrates that the proposed method has a better performance of queuing delay by 16.3%, end-to-end delay by 18.7%, and bandwidth utilization by 13.2%.

The special focus of this paper is on a fairness definition for the third traffic category as applied mainly to customer premises or local ATM networks. The paper provides a quantitative standard for the apportionment of the spare capacity among traffic streams of the third category, taking into consideration special capacity requirements of different sources.

Retransmissions of interrupted secondary sessions may lead the system towards an unstable condition. Therefore, it is important to develop mechanisms to alleviate performance degradation due to reconnected secondary sessions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, mechanisms based on limiting the number of reconnections for reducing failure rate have been neither analyzed nor evaluated in the literature. In this paper, limiting the maximum number of reconnections in CRNs with RESTART retransmission strategy for delay tolerant traffic is evaluated as a mechanism to reduce the negative impact of retransmissions and to widen the conditions under which system stability can be achieved. Numerical results show that limiting reconnections is an effective mechanism to alleviate performance degradation due to connection failure. Also a tradeoff between the call completion probability and the supported offered traffic load that can be controlled by varying either the number of reserved channels or the number of allowed retransmission is observed.	coefficient;cognitive radio;control theory;elegant degradation;failure rate;interrupt;numerical method;reserved word;retransmission (data networks)	S.

In initiatives for digital/social inclusion, this improvement is of utter importance, particularly in scenarios where the infrastructure becomes a barrier in communication. An alternative to improve communication and thus providing quality of service is to adjust the use of resources/bandwidth required by the applications. This paper presents an application-scheduling algorithm, based on fuzzy logic, to optimize the use of bandwidth and guarantee QoS for existing applications. Simulations were made from a built testbed for xDSL technology; results showed that the proposed scheduler is able to optimize the channel, guaranteeing minimum levels of QoS based on the particular needs and characteristics of each application.	algorithm;computer simulation;digital subscriber line;fuzzy logic;quality of service;scheduling (computing);testbed	Ádamo L. de Santana;Diego L.

Our scheduler has low computational complexity. We define the computational architecture and describe the exact computations that need to be done at each time step (1 milliseconds). Our computational framework is very general, and can be used to implement a wide variety of scheduling rules. For LTE, we provide quantitative performance results for our scheduler for full buffer, streaming video (with loose delay constraints), and live video (with tight delay constraints). Simulations are performed by selectively abstracting the PHY layer, accurately modeling the MAC layer, and following established network evaluation methods. The numerical results demonstrate that queue- and channel-aware QoS schedulers can and should be used in an LTE downlink to offer QoS to a diverse mix of traffic, including delay-sensitive flows. Through these results and via theoretical analysis, we illustrate the various design tradeoffs that need to be made in the selection of a specific queue-and-channel-aware scheduling policy. Moreover, the numerical results show that in many scenarios strict prioritization across traffic classes is suboptimal.	compaq lte;telecommunications link	Bilal Sadiq;Ritesh Madan;Ashwin Sampath	2009	EURASIP J.

Selection of the server which can offer equal performance to collaborative nodes is necessary to offer equalized performance. Therefore, to achieve this problem, we propose a server selection method that select the server by calculating the circumcenter of collaborative nodes according to the distance between nodes obtained by performance measures. However, depending on the location of nodes, there is a problem that using circumcenter is not always sufficient to find the most appropriate server. In this paper, we also propose a method to improve the accuracy of server selection by solving the problem of using circumcenter by downhill simplex method. We show probability of selection of the most suitable server can be improved around 55 % compared to the the method using circumcenter.	cloud computing;communications of the acm;consensus dynamics;gradient;nelder–mead method;network packet;server (computing);simplex algorithm;simulation	Shin'ichiro Higashi;Shingo Ata;Akihiro Nakao;Ikuo Oka	2011	The International Conference on Information Networking 2011 (ICOIN2011)	10.1109/ICOIN.2011.5723152	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;probability;distributed computing;server;statistics;computer network;collaboration	Mobile	0.5914320417312436	90.23085481802484	49916

The end-to-end performance of a tandem wireless router network with batch arrivals is optimized. The mean of the transmission delay (or 'response time') is minimized subject to an upper limit on the rate of losses and finite capacity queueing and recovery buffers. The optimal ratio of arrival-buffer size to recovery-buffer size is determined, which is a critical quantity, affecting both loss rate and transmission time. The impact of the retransmission probability is investigated: too high a value leads to congestion and so higher response times, too low and packets are lost forever, yielding a different penalty	end-to-end principle;network congestion;response time (technology);retransmission (data networks);router (computing);wireless router	Nalan Gülpinar;Peter G.

By giving different service classes different CWs, the distribution of backoff intervals (chosen randomly, on the interval [O, CW]) will reflect the desired service classes. However, these protocols cannot deliver firm service guarantees while maintaining high network utilization, particularly under congested network conditions. In this article we propose a new MAC protocol featuring a sliding CW (SCW) for each network flow. The SCW dynamically adjusts to changing network conditions, but remains within a per-class predefined range in order to maintain a separation between different service classes. Each flow's SCW reacts based on the degree to which class-defined QoS metrics are satisfied. Simulation results show that compared to the enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF) scheme of 802.11e, SCW consistently excels, in terms of network utilization, strict service separation, and service-level fairness.	backoff;differentiated service;fairness measure;flow network;ieee 802.1aq;quality of service;randomness;simulation;window function	Abdelhamid Nafaa;Adlen Ksentini;Ahmed Mehaoua;B. lshibashi;Youssef Iraqi;Raouf Boutaba	2005	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2005.1470682	service set;real-time computing;flow network;wireless wan;heterogeneous network;quality of service;service level;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;wireless lan controller;wi-fi array;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005;satisfiability	Embedded	-0.36923217771244843	95.74670403790897	50229
02a23ce2d01385feb9e703dcc790e354ab6f26dc	a proposal of new price-based call admission control rules for guaranteed performance services multiplexed with best effort traffic	proportional fair;guaranteed performance services;pricing;bandwidth allocation;qos guarantee;differentiated service;internet service provider;best effort;ip quality of service;best effort services;proportional fairness;quality of service;flow control;call admission control;user acceptance;asynchronous transfer mode;integrated services	Pricing for the use of telecommunication services is an issue widely treated in the literature. In the last years it has received a growing attention in order to establish various fairness criteria in the bandwidth allocation for each type of traffic class. A number of pricing models have been proposed and analyzed in the context of Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed networks (e.g. ATM, IP Integrated Services, IP Differentiated Services) and more recently, also for Best Effort (BE) environments. In the context of QoS networks the pricing scheme can influence the Call Admission Control (CAC) rules. On the contrary, for a BE service, users accept a variable bandwidth allocation, they are not subject to CAC and their pricing policies, according to the Proportional Fairness Pricing, are integrated within the flow control. In this paper we investigate the condition where both BE traffic and traffic explicitly requiring QoS (Guaranteed Performance, GP) are present. We propose three CAC rules for the GP traffic. The aim is to maximize the Internet Service Provider’s overall revenue and to establish a bound over the GP traffic prices. Numerical results are presented to show the good performance of the proposed techniques. q 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

For tracking the idle MTs, a wireless access network invokes them to conduct location update whenever they enter into a new location. This allows the network to route a call successfully. To provide any IP packet based service, Mobile IP (MIP) is very important protocol undeniably. However, Proxy Mobile IP was developed by IETF without considering idle mode condition of MTs. Consequently, an idle MT needs to conduct MIP binding (Layer 3 location update) whenever it moves to a new area of a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) although it does not have any incoming or outgoing packets during idle periods. This phenomenon unnecessarily increases location update signaling cost. In our previous work, we proposed a mechanism using which only Layer 2 location update is needed when an MT is in idle mode and the Layer 3 location update is conducted after a call arrives for an idle MT in Optical and Wireless Converged Access Networks (OWCAN). This allows saving energy in the mobility management nodes (e.g. MAG, Base Stations) significantly. Based on our previous work, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the Optical Network Units (ONUs) of an OWCAN. This algorithm decides when to interrupt modules of a sleeping ONU to wake up and which frames should be forwarded for uplink transmission. We have found that adopting this algorithm an ONU of an OWCAN can save energy significantly. Therefore, our solutions mainly contribute in two-fold to make a green OWCAN. First, it minimizes energy consumption in the mobility management nodes. Second, our solution also reduces energy consumption and improves bandwidth utilization in the optical backhaul.	access network;algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);idle (cpu);mobile ip;network packet;packet switching;passive optical network;proxy mobile ipv6;queueing theory;telecommunications link;wireless access point	S.

This issue is crucial in the sense that this Tra c Contract could be invalid if it were impossible to de ne an unambiguous conformance testing procedure. We show that most of the cell conformance testing mechanisms that could be naturally considered su er from an undesirable phenomenon, namely measurement phasing which jeopardizes their use. We then propose a mechanism for cell conformance testing which does not su er from any problem of measurement phasing and which can account for cell tagging. Along with this mechanism we propose a method of computing reference Cell Loss Ratios for connections with both CLP=0 and CLP=1 cells.	atm turbo;aggregate data;conformance testing;declaration (computer programming);design by contract;like button;measurement problem	Fabrice Guillemin;Charles Levert;Catherine Rosenberg	1995	Computer Networks and ISDN Systems	10.1016/0169-7552(94)00013-J	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous communication;conformance testing;atmosphere;service quality;standardization;algorithm;telecommunications network;computer network	SE	0.9819510138255462	101.65595046522324	50383

We are especially interested in algorithms which have low communication overhead and low processing complexity. The interference in the network is modeled using a conflict graph whose vertices correspond to the communication links in the network. Two links are adjacent in this graph if and only if they interfere with each other due to being in the same vicinity and hence cannot be simultaneously active. The problem of scheduling the transmission of the various links is then essentially a fractional, weighted vertex coloring problem, for which upper bounds on the fractional chromatic number are sought using only localized information. We present some distributed algorithms for this problem, and discuss their worst-case performance. Our results on this fundamental problem imply that for some well known classes of networks and interference models, the performance of these distributed algorithms is within a bounded factor away from that of an optimal, centralized algorithm.	best, worst and average case;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;fractional coloring;graph coloring;interference (communication);overhead (computing);quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);serializability;vertex (graph theory)	Ashwin Ganesan	2009	2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications	10.1109/NetCoM.2009.17	distributed algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	16.74586105763047	92.52586528902914	50488

To achieve this energy saving without scarifying streaming quality, the base station must carefully construct the burst schedule for all TV channels. This is called the burst scheduling problem. In this paper, we prove that the burst scheduling problem for TV channels with arbitrary bit rates is NP-complete. We then propose a practical simplification of the general problem, which allows TV channels to be classified into multiple classes, and the bit rates of the classes have power of two increments, e.g., 100, 200, and 400 kbps. Using this practical simplification, we propose an optimal and efficient burst scheduling algorithm. We present theoretical analysis, simulation, and actual implementation in a mobile TV testbed to demonstrate the optimality, practicality, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;burst transmission;correctness (computer science);data rate units;differentiated services;distortion;level of detail;mathematical optimization;mobile device;mobile television;np-completeness;numerical analysis;open-shop scheduling;optimization problem;power of two;radio frequency;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media;testbed	Mohamed Hefeeda;Cheng-Hsin Hsu	2010	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1145/1816262.1816283	job shop scheduling;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	20.901714756297263	97.52434013100752	50519

This study shows that these models are far from being accurate on average. Actually, our simulations show that 70% of their predictions exceed the boundaries of TCP-Friendliness, thus questioning their use in the design of new TCP-Friendly transport protocols. Our study also shows that the inaccuracy of the PFTK model is largely due to its inability to make the distinction between the two packet loss detection methods used by TCP: triple duplicate acknowledgments or timeout expirations. We then use supervised learning techniques to infer models of the TCP rate. These models show important accuracy improvements when they take into account the two types of losses. This suggests that analytical model of TCP throughput should certainly benefit from the incorporation of the timeout loss rate.	algorithm;internet protocol suite;machine learning;microtransaction;network packet;simulation;supervised learning;throughput	Ibtissam El Khayat;Pierre Geurts;Guy Leduc	2006		10.1007/11753810_41	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;transmission control protocol;supervised learning;tcp tuning;computer network	Metrics	-0.6848379634722432	101.40064187506016	50523

Consequently, they provide convenient and important ways to access the Internet. Another type of communication model, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication on the Internet, has also attracted much attention, and P2P over wireless LANs will soon be very common. There are concerns about the capability of wireless stations (STAs) to send a large amount of traffic on an uplink. In this paper, we first clarify some issues that arise in this context by examining the feature of the Access Point(AP). Furthermore, we consider the role of the AP and propose, as a solution, ways of enabling both efficient and fair transmission over both the downlink and uplink. We evaluate the proposed schemes through simulations and show that communications over the uplink and downlink can share the wireless LAN access resource effectively. Furthermore, we show that coordinating our solution with the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) can meet the different requirements of various types of traffic.	telecommunications link	Yutaka Fukuda;Yuji Oie	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.4.1577	telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wi-fi array;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.835616567095298	104.01419783626758	50649
bfa73a6a2fe028cce8bf2d8b34492ae497d7ee33	fuzzy reinforcement learning for routing in multi-hop cognitive radio networks		Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are composed of cognitive, spectrum-agile devices capable of changing their configuration on the fly, based on the spectrum assignment policy. Moreover, the CRNs technology allows sharing of licensed spectrum band in an opportunistic and non-interfering manner. Routing and the spectrum management are the challenges in these networks. To solve these problems, in this paper, a fuzzy reinforcement learning method is proposed, where a new fuzzy reinforcement learning procedure is built in each secondary user (SU). The proposed procedure learns the best routing with a guarantee that the interference at the primary receivers is below the threshold and focuses on the problem of effective routing solutions in multi-hop CRNs.	cognitive radio;hop;reinforcement learning;routing	Jerzy Martyna	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-60042-0_13	spectrum management;fuzzy logic;on the fly;cognitive radio;hop (networking);reinforcement learning;distributed computing;cognition;cognitive network;computer science	ML	20.441666210430732	93.8008086221037	50857

In this paper, the approximate dynamic programming approach for a new wireless mesh network scheduling model having node programming information saving locations and network link gateway designs is orchestrated. The experiment results show that, in addition to maintaining many wireless network characteristics, the scheduling algorithm is effectively executed and approximate dynamic programming effectively simulates dynamic programming and has performances superior to genetic algorithm.	approximation algorithm;categorization;conformity;decision theory;design closure;dynamic programming;genetic algorithm;mesh networking;network packet;performance;programming model;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter;usb on-the-go;wireless mesh network	Chien-Liang Chen;Wan-Yu Liu;Shu-Huai Chang;Chun-Cheng Lin	2014	9th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China	10.1109/CHINACOM.2014.7054269	wireless mesh network;data modeling;programming;genetic algorithm;logic gate;dynamic priority scheduling;reactive programming;computer science;theoretical computer science;dynamic programming;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	4.500075477223017	90.822134097729	50934

Developing a distributed implementation that can fully utilize the spectrum opportunities for secondary users (SUs) has so far remained elusive. Although throughput optimal algorithms based on the well-known maximal weight scheduling (MWS) algorithm exist for cognitive radio networks, they require central processing of network-wide SU information. In this paper, a new distributed algorithm is introduced that asymptotically achieves the capacity region of the cognitive radio systems. The proposed algorithm achieves the full SU capacity region while adapting to the channel availability dynamics caused by unknown primary user activity. Extensive simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm.	algorithm design;cognitive radio;distributed algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;maximal set;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;whole earth 'lectronic link	Shuang Li;Eylem Ekici;Ness B.

MCR is the minimum cell rate guaranteed by the network and can be used to provide an acceptable quality of service for applications. In this study, explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI) and explicit rate indication for congestion avoidance (ERICA) switches were adopted in a current transitional ATM network. First, we transfer trac with ABR service to realize the interoperability of EFCI and ERICA switches. Second, we implemented the virtual source/virtual destination (VS/VD) feature into a homo or heterogeneous EFCI and ERICA switch environment in order to observe the performance.

Even though many admission control approaches exist, most of them suffer from the fact that they are based on some very rigid assumptions about the perflow and aggregate underlying traffic models, requiring manual reconfiguration of their parameters in a “trial and error” fashion when these original assumptions stop being valid. In this paper we present a fuzzy reinforcement learning admission control approach based on the increasingly popular Pre-Congestion Notification framework that requires no a priori knowledge about traffic flow characteristics, traffic models and flow dynamics. By means of simulations we show that the scheme can perform well under a variety of traffic and load conditions and adapt its behavior accordingly without requiring any overly complicated operations and with no need for manual and frequent reconfigurations.	aggregate data;autonomic computing;item unique identification;multi-agent system;network congestion;program composition notation;q-learning;reinforcement learning;requirement;router (computing);simulation;world wide web	Stylianos Georgoulas;Klaus Moessner;Alexis Mansour;Menelaos Pissarides;Panagiotis Spapis	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30633-4_4	fuzzy logic;real-time computing;simulation;quality of service;computer science;artificial intelligence;reinforcement learning;computer security;computer network	Networks	-3.6724905088119155	96.29749584625014	51626

1927de3ddaddbc3bf53257cc5ee6e8ba127819a0	virtualized congestion control	datacenters;ecn;tcp;dctcp;virtualized congestion control;hypervisors;algorithmic virtualization	New congestion control algorithms are rapidly improving datacenters by reducing latency, overcoming incast, increasing throughput and improving fairness. Ideally, the operating system in every server and virtual machine is updated to support new congestion control algorithms. However, legacy applications often cannot be upgraded to a new operating system version, which means the advances are off-limits to them. Worse, as we show, legacy applications can be squeezed out, which in the worst case prevents the entire network from adopting new algorithms.  Our goal is to make it easy to deploy new and improved congestion control algorithms into multitenant datacenters, without having to worry about TCP-friendliness with non-participating virtual machines. This paper presents a solution we call virtualized congestion control. The datacenter owner may introduce a new congestion control algorithm in the hypervisors. Internally, the hypervisors translate between the new congestion control algorithm and the old legacy congestion control, allowing legacy applications to enjoy the benefits of the new algorithm. We have implemented proof-of-concept systems for virtualized congestion control in the Linux kernel and in VMware’s ESXi hypervisor, achieving improved fairness, performance, and control over guest bandwidth allocations.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;data center;fairness measure;hypervisor;linux;multitenancy;network congestion;operating system;server (computing);throughput;virtual machine	Bryce Cronkite-Ratcliff;Aran Bergman;Shay Vargaftik;Madhusudhan Ravi;Nick McKeown;Ittai Abraham;Isaac Keslassy	2016		10.1145/2934872.2934889	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;data center;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;transmission control protocol;explicit congestion notification;distributed computing;hypervisor;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-2.8550329585958374	93.66686972724621	51683

It is based on two schemes: channel reservation and network diagnosis. When compared to other CAC mechanisms, CAC-RD can guarantee network availability, reducing priority classes blocking and guarantying some network QoS requirements. Due to computational resource limits, simulations cannot answer related to admission control in big networks with thousands of users. This work presents a method to extrapolate scientific questions like CAC's behavior with thousands of users and many antennas. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach for CAC-RD in UMTS 3G networks is presented. Its main goal is ANN training with the CAC-RD behavior. It is expected that the ANN can answer questions related to real cellular 3G networks admission control.	artificial neural network;blocking (computing);common access card;computational resource;extrapolation;many antennas;quality of service;requirement;ruby document format;simulation;terrestrial television	Anna Izabel T.

This requires a wide variety of knowledge, from theoretical issues such as graph theory or information theory, to issues at the physical and network layers. A potential solution is the recently proposed network coding because it offers a number of desired properties such as resource efficiency, robustness and security. This paper focuses on two research directions for multimedia transmission over wireless networks based on network coding: (i) source-aware network coding and (ii) physical-layer network coding. These directions follow the cross-layer framework in designing the communication protocol stack. Challenging issues which are related to the practical design of network-coding enabled wireless networks are addressed and discussed.	communications protocol;graph theory;information theory;lu decomposition;linear network coding;protocol stack;prototype;source-to-source compiler;throughput	Nguyen Linh-Trung;Vo Nguyen Quoc Bao;Pierre Duhamel;Mérouane Debbah	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)	10.1109/ISSPIT.2012.6621273	multi-frequency network;linear network coding;wireless wan;network architecture;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;bridging;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;statistics;computer network;source code	Mobile	13.78058171207772	91.89457646290319	51848

Existing works use simplified spectral efficiency (SE) models that lead to conservative outcomes. For computing cell-wide and cell-average Pb the exact but mathematically intractable Kaufman Roberts Algorithm (KRA) is indispensable. The Erlang approximation (EA) tractably computes only cell-average Pb but ignores bandwidth allocation granularity leading to an error of around 25% in typical scenarios. In this work, by using an accurate SE model we show a significant reduction in projected base station (BS) density requirement for maintaining satisfactory cell-average Pb. We show that cell-average Pb does not completely depict the GoS situation within a cell since there is significant variation of Pb inside it. Further, we enhance the EA in two ways. Firstly, we improve its accuracy to within 2% of KRA by accounting for bandwidth allocation granularity. Secondly, we extend it to compute cell-wide Pb like the KRA. The resulting method helps to explain properties such as the linearly increasing trend of region-wise Pb vs. region-index in case of low bit-rate streaming calls. We also use the aforementioned linearly increasing trend to arrive at another alternative to KRA. The development of these two alternatives to KRA highlights certain interesting properties of region-wise and cell-average Pb as well as the Subhendu Batabyal G. S.

Thus, two types of frame aggregations are defined: MAC Service Data Unit Aggregation (A-MSDU) and MAC Protocol Data Unit Aggregation (A-MPDU). As frame aggregation is mainly defined to increase the efficiency of the MAC layer, this feature is very needed to support multimedia traffic such as High Definition TV (HDTV). The multicast transport is another way to increase the MAC layer efficiency by transmitting the same information only once to many receivers. However, the 802.11 standard does not define a reliable multicast and consequently the 802.11n is unable to provide a reliable transport for multicast streams. The 802.11aa remains the only draft to handle the unreliability issue of the multicast, but the proposed solution is defined only for the legacy 802.11 standard and does not consider the aggregation feature of the 802.11n. In this paper we design a new extension for the 802.11aa in order to take a full advantage of the 802.11n capabilities and we provide a new analytical model to evaluate the performance of the MAC layer. We particularly study the impact of the frame aggregation type on the MAC throughput for the multicast transport. Our results show that in an ideal channel (no losses), A-MSDU slightly outperforms A-MPDU when using the data rate of 6.5Mbps and both schemes have the same performance with rates of 130 and 300 Mbps. However the use of A-MPDU aggregation becomes more efficient in a noisy channel.	data rate units;multicast;noisy-channel coding theorem;throughput;transmitter;uncompressed video	Yousri Daldoul;Toufik Ahmed;Djamal-Eddine Meddour	2011	2011 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2011.6098211	real-time computing;multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Mobile	7.032538908893983	95.90703832469987	51909

Traffic anomalies arise when there is overload due to failures in a network. We present general formulae for the variance of the cumulative traffic over a fixed time interval and show how the derived analytical expression simplifies for the case of voice over IP traffic, the focus of this paper. To detect load anomalies, we show it is sufficient to consider cumulative traffic over relatively long intervals such as 5 minutes. This approach substantially extends the current practice in IP network management where only the first order statistics and fixed thresholds are used to identify abnormal behavior.	abnormal behavior;anomaly detection;internet protocol suite;sample variance	Michel Mandjes;Iraj Saniee;Alexander L.

Due to the short transmit-receive distance, femtocells can greatly lower transmit power, prolong handset battery life, and enhance the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS). On the other hand, technical challenges still remain, mainly including interference mitigation, security and mobility management, intercepting wide deployment and adoption by both mobile operators and end users. This paper introduces a novel energy-centric handover decision policy and its accompanied algorithm, towards minimizing the power consumption at the mobile terminal side in the integrated LTE macrocell–femtocell network. The proposed policy is shown to extend the widely-adopted strongest cell policy, by suitably adapting the handover hysteresis margin in accordance with standardized LTE measurements on the tagged user’s neighbor cells. Performance evaluation results show that significantly lower interference and power consumption can be attained for the cost of a moderately increased number of network-wide handover executions events. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Previous works have shown that the combined capacity region of such systems depend on the service allocation policy that assigns user sessions to the available subsystems. The currently available service allocation policies typically operate off-line implying that the actual service mix is assumed to be known prior to the service allocation taking place. In this paper we consider the on-line problem according to which sessions arrive one after the other and no assumptions on the service mix can be made. We adopt four on-line bin-packing algorithms to the multi-access environment and study their performance by means of simulation in terms of the class-wise blocking probability and throughput. We find that the algorithm termed Less Voice provides the best performance in terms of the blocking probabilities and imposes the least slow down for elastic sessions	access network;algorithm;bin packing problem;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);online and offline;set packing;simulation;throughput	Dênio Mariz;Igor Cananéa;Djamel Fawzi Hadj Sadok;Gábor Fodor	2006	2006 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks(WoWMoM'06)	10.1109/WOWMOM.2006.102	bin packing problem;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;speech;computer network;access network	Metrics	4.787852280058755	97.59503812000887	52028

The cognitive radio enables the Secondary Users (SU) to opportunistically access the spectrum unused by the Primary Users (PU). There are two basic objectives of Cognitive Radio Medium Access Control (CR MAC): controlling interference and avoiding PUs and avoiding collision between SUs. We propose a MAC protocol for single channel which opportunistically utilizes the spectrum unused by the PUs. It has a licensed channel in the primary network. The time in the network is divided in terms of slot time. Slot time is of equal length and packet transmission in carried out in slots. It is partitioned in two phases which are the contention phase and the data transmission phase. The first phase selects a SU based on 802.11 DCF with RTS/CTS mechanism. The second phase is for data transmission. The SU is allowed to occupy all the time remaining after the contention phase. In case of collision, a dynamic backoff scheme is applied. We compare the results of the OSA MAC for single channel with dynamic MAC scheme. The results show that throughput of proposed scheme is better than the conventional OSA scheme.	access control;algorithm;backoff;carpal tunnel syndrome;cognitive radio;design rule for camera file system;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);network packet;rs-232;superuser;throughput;time complexity;two-phase commit protocol	Smit B.

Optimal cooperating set cardinality curves are derived, and they can be used to determine the optimal routing strategy based on the required reliability, transmission power, and path loss coefficient.

8263e9c1ade32029f643de3a83fcecdaca41971f	design strategy for measurement scheduler in lte small cell-associated user equipment	inbound handover;henb;cell discovery;csg	Small cell deployment using Home eNB improves the LTE/LTE Advanced network coverage and capacity providing its relay and data offloading functions. However, latency of inbound mobility to the small cell is a critical obstacle to the deployment because it spends much time detecting an associated small cell due to its sparse deployment and identifying the target small cell because of the delay caused by the verification procedure required before performing inbound handover to the target. Therefore, the inbound handover latency should be minimized to encourage the deployment of the Home eNB. To tackle the handover latency problem, this paper proposes a practically possible solution for design of Layer 1 search/measure scheduler in LTE small cell-associated user equipment. The proposed strategy especially enhances the performance of the LTE Home eNB discovery and guarantees to meet the requirements defined in the corresponding conformance test specifications. Performance evaluation by computer simulation shows that the proposed scheme provides a proper guideline on the Layer 1 software implementation.	compaq lte;scheduling (computing)	Jae-Wan Kim;Seong-Ro Lee;Yang-Ick Joo	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2347-9	embedded system;real-time computing;operating system;computer network	Mobile	23.574447698841322	89.95421575455953	52329

The basic ideas behind these models are to decompose an MPEG compressed video sequence into several parts according to motion/scene complexity or data structure. Each part is described with a self-similar process. These different self-similar processes are then combined to form the respective models. In addition, the Beta distribution is used to characterize the marginal cumulative distribution (CDF) of the self-similar processes. Comparison among the three models shows that the latest model (called the simple models) is the most practical one in terms of accuracy and complexity. Simulations based on a real MPEG compressed movie sequence of Star Wars have demonstrated that the simple model can capture the ACF and the marginal CDF very closely.	moving picture experts group	Nirwan Ansari;Yun Q.

However, the employment of such techniques evidently affects the QoS provisioning algorithms at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we propose a space-time infrastructure and develop a set of cross-layer real-time QoS-provisioning algorithms for admission control, scheduling, and subchannel-allocations. We analytically map the parameters characterizing the space-time diversity onto the admission-control region guaranteeing the real-time QoS. Our analytical analyses show that the proposed algorithms can effectively support real-time QoS provisioning. Also presented are numerical solutions and simulation results showing that the space-time diversity can significantly improve the QoS provisioning for real-time services over wireless networks.	access control;algorithm;digital subchannel;numerical analysis;processor control region;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;std bus;scheduling (computing);simulation	Xi Zhang;Jia Tang	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

4b254d417f136506dc919e52eee99dea47e4b851	echo state networks for proactive caching in cloud-based radio access networks with mobile users		In this paper, the problem of proactive caching is studied for cloud radio access networks (CRANs). In the studied model, the baseband units (BBUs) can predict the content request distribution and mobility pattern of each user and determine which content to cache at remote radio heads and the BBUs. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly incorporates backhaul and fronthaul loads and content caching. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the machine learning framework of echo state networks (ESNs) with sublinear algorithms is proposed. Using ESNs, the BBUs can predict each user’s content request distribution and mobility pattern while having only limited information on the network’s and user’s state. In order to predict each user’s periodic mobility pattern with minimal complexity, the memory capacity of the corresponding ESN is derived for a periodic input. This memory capacity is shown to capture the maximum amount of user information needed for the proposed ESN model. Then, a sublinear algorithm is proposed to determine which content to cache while using limited content request distribution samples. Simulation results using real data from Youku and the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications show that the proposed approach yields significant gains, in terms of sum effective capacity, that reach up to 27.8% and 30.7%, respectively, compared with two baseline algorithms: random caching with clustering and random caching without clustering.	access network;algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);baseband;baseline (configuration management);cache (computing);cluster analysis;echo state network;machine learning;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation	Mingzhe Chen;Walid Saad;Changchuan Yin;M.

In this paper we propose a new QoS control algorithm, referred to as Gureen Game, for wireless sensor networks. Gureen Game not only improves the Gur Game for QoS control but also significantly addresses the power consumption weakness of the original Gur Game based QoS control for senor networks. We study the logic behaviors of the proposed Gureen Game, and evaluate its QoS performance compared with the original Gur Game and a recent control algorithm called Shuffle for energy-efficient QoS control. Our simulation results demonstrate the merits of the proposed Gureen Game.	algorithm;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;quality of service;rate of convergence;self-organization;simulation;video game developer	Megan Ayers;Yao Liang	2011	2011 International Green Computing Conference and Workshops	10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008613	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	17.7961819733601	91.30826845548171	52876

The management layer that deals with this dynamically changing RF environment and aims at continuously providing the best possible RF channel between a mobile terminal and the fixed network is the radio resource management layer. This article presents a thorough examination of RRM in CDPD networks. In particular, it outlines the scope of RRM and it discusses in detail some essential RRM procedures, such as the quality evaluation of RF channels, the assessment of neighbor cells, the acquisition of CDPD channels and the cell transfer procedure.

Many solutions have been proposed, however, none of them solved it fundamentally. In this paper, we take a deep dive into the causes of incast problem, and find out that the root cause of TCP incast is the droptails induced by TCP congestion control algorithm based on packet losses. According to the root cause, we design a new TCP based on FAST TCP, a delay based congestion control algorithm, to radically solve TCP incast problem. The new TCP aims at maintaining a relatively small queue length that does not exceed the switch buffer and meanwhile fully occupy the bottleneck link. The simulation results demonstrate that our method cuts off most of the timeouts and attains high goodput under various conditions.	algorithm;bottleneck (network);data center;goodput;network congestion;network packet;queuing delay;simulation;tcp congestion control	Feng Zheng;Yongfeng Huang;Donghong Sun	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883815	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-3.4987596787262873	92.82543107134838	53089
b6719da640851d5da2c07f2c6d824f2a22aa750a	an efficient slot-reuse scheme for crma high-speed networks	crma;slot reuse;metropolitan area networks;high speed networks;mac protocols;local area networks;delays	Cyclic-Reservation Multiple-Access (CRMA), based on slotted unidirectional dual-bus structure, is an access scheme for high speed local and metropolitan area networks. In CRMA, the headend generates reserve commands periodically. Each node reserves a number of slots which it needs when each reserve command passes by. Finally, the headend generates a sequence of cycles, corresponding to each reserve command, service the reservations commanded by each node. The length of cycle is equal to the total number of slots reserved by the nodes. It is desirable to have some mechanisms to reduce the length of a cycle since slot reuse can reduce the number of slots used to carry the same amount of user information, whereby reducing network congestion. It had been shown that the problem of finding a shortest cycle length is NP-complete [2]. Recently, a reservation scheme based on finding single-level regions (FSR) to make a shorter cycle length had been proposed [3]. That is to say, some of used slots can be reused by downstream nodes and hence the throughput and access delay are improved.In this paper, we propose an efficient slot reuse scheme based on finding multiple-level regions (FMR). As compared with the original CRMA reservation scheme and the one proposed in [3], the new scheme makes the cycle length much shorter. Besides, the resulting throughput (slots utilization) and the access delay are better than those of the other two schemes. We also address the differences and effects on slot-reuse schemes applied in CRMA-II (using destination release), [14] and [15], and FSR/FMR (using cycle compression).

Flow control may be performed by the network, as is the case in asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks (the available bit rate (ABR) transfer capacity), or by the users themselves, as is the case in the Internet [transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP)]. We study in this paper both situations using optimal control and dynamic game techniques. The first situation leads to the formulation of a dynamic team problem, while the second one leads to a dynamic noncooperative game, for which we establish the existence and uniqueness of a linear Nash equilibrium and obtain a characterization of the corresponding equilibrium policies along with the performance costs. We further show that when the users update their policies in a greedy manner, not knowing a priori the utilities of the other players, the sequence of policies thus generated converges to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we study an extension of the model that accommodates multiple traffic types for each user, with the switching from one type of traffic to another being governed by a Markov jump process. Presentation of some numerical results complements this study.	atm turbo;flow control (data);greedy algorithm;internet protocol suite;markov chain;nash equilibrium;network congestion;numerical analysis;optimal control;quality of service;telecommunications network	Eitan Altman;Tamer Basar	1998	IEEE Trans.

Wireless mesh networks use several wireless hops in order to forward packets to their destination. A significant issue is that the standard does not map network characteristics into the access protocol parameters it provides. This paper investigates different configurations of the IEEE 802.11e access parameters in wireless mesh networks and proposes two configuration settings. Both proposals provide voice traffic service guarantee without significantly degrading the performance of other multimedia traffic classes, as demonstrated by simulation experiment results.

Nowadays we can observe media convergence as a global tendency. Therefore, those networks have to carry different kinds of traffic with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. Applying QoS in the Internet is already a challenge because of its distributed nature and the best effort mechanism of its base protocol, IP (Internet Protocol). The wireless medium brings even more challenges, considering its limited bandwidth, error-prone radio channels, shadow areas, and signal and climate interferences. So, providing QoS for wireless networks has become a research area of great interest, resulting in standards like IEEE 802.11e (IEEE Standards Association, 2007). Many commercial products already implement some mechanisms of the standard or a subset of them launched by WiFi Alliance, called WiFi Multimedia (WMM) (Wi-Fi Alliance, 2004). However, studies in the literature (Ramos et al., 2005) state that the values suggested in the standard for medium access parameters are not suitable for all kinds of wireless networks. The standard does not map access parameters to network characteristics, such as traffic pattern, network load, mobility pattern, and so on. The responsibility of applying the QoS policy on the network, calculating and announcing the parameters, and adjusting them to the current status of the network, lies over the wireless access point (AP). Traffic classification and prioritization in ad hoc networks are mentioned, but they are out of the scope of the standard. This work investigates the influence of each IEEE 802.11e access parameter (AIFS, CWmin, CWmax, and TXOPLimit) in QoS metrics, such as throughput, end-to-end delay, collision rate and loss rate, over wireless mesh networks. This work also proposes two new configuration settings for those access parameters: a static one and another that includes a mechanism for dynamic adjustment of the TXOPLimit parameter. The main goal is to provide voice traffic service guarantee in wireless mesh networks, keeping its end-to-end delay below 150ms and its loss rate between 1% and 3% (Kawata & Yamada, 2007), without degrading significantly the performance of the other traffic classes. This work is an extended version of the paper of Gerk and Muchaluat-Saade (2012) presented on the 2012 International Conference on Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section overviews key aspects of IEEE 802.11e standard mechanisms. The following one presents related work found in the literature. The fourth section explains in detail the proposed configuration settings. The fifth section evaluates the proposal through simulation experiments, comparing them with the standard. Finally, the last section concludes the paper suggesting future work. IEEE 802.11E STANDARD IEEE 802.11e (IEEE Standards Association, 2007) extends the IEEE 802.11 standard to provide QoS for transmissions over wireless local area networks. It introduces a new access mechanism called Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF), which has a contention-based access mode called Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA), and a controlled access mode called HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). The new mechanisms are built over the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) basic access mechanism. In non-infrastructured networks, that is ad hoc networks, EDCA is used. It provides traffic differentiation at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer by defining eight priorities based on those defined in IEEE 802.1D/Q mapped into four access categories (AC), which constitute independent backoff instances. The ACs are, in descendant order of priority, voice (AC_VO), video (AC_VI), best effort (AC_BE) and background (AC_BK). Table 1 shows priority level mapping into the IEEE 802.11e access categories. The prioritization of medium access to each category is given by four access parameters (Mangold et al., 2003): 16 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/voice-traffic-service-guaranteewireless/75128?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

In this paper, we focus on energy-efficient operation of base transceiver stations (BTSs) in cellular network. We present a distributed wake-up scheduling algorithm (DWS) for the BTSs that use three different modes of operation: off, sleep and active. In DWS, a BTS dynamically takes decision on its operation mode according to the measured traffic load of itself and its neighborhood BTSs in a distributed manner. Our simulation results show that the DWS can save as much as 28% more energy compared to a state-of-the-art Eco-Inspired [6] algorithm.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;broadcast television systems inc.;dictionary writing system;mobile phone;scheduling (computing);simulation;transceiver	Tamal Adhikary;Amit Kumar Das;Md.

The characteristics of MTC communications are different from that of conventional Human-to-Human (H2H) communications. The execution of an MTC device is task-based and triggered by the MTC application server. In most of scenarios, the time period for an MTC to perform a task is short. The number of MTC devices is expected to be several magnitudes higher than the number of H2H communication device. In MTC communications networks, an MTC device is addressed by its Mobile Subscriber ISDNs (MSISDNs) that is also used to address the H2H devices. Due to that huge number of MTC devices may coexist in the network, it is a challenge that the number of MSISDNs may insufficient to support both MTC communications and H2H communications. In this paper, we propose a grouping ID based device trigger mechanism for 3GPP MTC communications to resolve the issue “insufficient number of MSISDN.” Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the performances of the mechanism.	application server;coexist (image);devslp;experiment;performance;ps (unix);retransmission (data networks);server (computing);simulation;telecommunications network	Chi-Wei Tseng;Hau Chen;Phone Lin	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906451	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;isdn digital subscriber line;computer network	Mobile	19.91715468004359	91.0548641752311	53385
0d6693f50f519a0daa4b00ab78af1503b1845b11	interference mitigation and traffic adaptation in full-duplex small cell networks		Recent achievement in self-interference cancellation algorithms enables potential application of full-duplex (FD) in 5G radio access systems. FD communication promises to double the spectral efficiency by enabling the same time-frequency uplink and downlink transmissions. Yet for cellular access network with FD small cell base stations (BS) serving multiple user equipment (UE), additional BS-to-BS and UE-to-UE interference due to FD operation could diminish the performance gain if not tackled properly. Existing works all strive to achieve close to 2x FD gain at network scale, in this paper, we demonstrate that much higher FD gain (≫ 2x) can be achieved under realistic nonfull buffer traffic due to significant latency reduction. We develop practical interference mitigation strategies such as adaptive power control, joint scheduling and inter-cell interference coordination to cope with the newly introduced interference in FD cellular systems. We validate the flexible traffic adaption of FD system under bursty traffic model by our LTE-based system level simulator, where significant FD gain of upto 13x in mean throughput and 19x in cell-edge throughput can be achieved under different traffic loads over an existing LTE half-duplex system.	access network;algorithm;catastrophic interference;compaq lte;duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);performance evaluation;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;user experience	Jingwen Bai;Shu-ping Yeh;Yang-Seok Choi	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292624	real-time computing;computer network;throughput;latency (engineering);power control;duplex (telecommunications);scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;computer science;small cell;spectral efficiency	Mobile	24.492558239708494	89.14124630033606	53445

A switch connectsm input ports to a single output port. Each input port is equipped with an incoming FIFO queue with bounded capacityB. A switch serves its input queues by transmitting packets arriving at these queues, one packet per time unit. Since the arrival rate can be higher than the transmission rate and each queue has limited capacity, packet loss may occur as a result of insufficient queue space. The goal is to maximize the number of transmitted packets. This general scenario models most current networks (e.g. IP networks) which only support a “best effort” service in which all packet streams are treated equally. A 2-competitive algorithm for this problem was designed in [5] for arbitraryB. Recently, a (17/9 ≈ 1.89)-competitive algorithm was presented forB>1 in [3]. Our main result in this paper shows that forB which is not too small our algorithm can do better than 1.89, and approach a competitive ratio ofe/(e − 1) ≈ 1.58.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;competitive analysis (online algorithm);fifo (computing and electronics);internet protocol suite;network packet;network switch;queueing theory;throughput;transmitter	Yossi Azar;Arik Litichevskey	2005	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-005-1190-x	fifo;internet protocol;competitive analysis;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;packet loss;queue;packet switching;computer network	Metrics	0.42013026985423074	100.86866987088347	53488

In order to deal with admission control for high-speed networks, in a previous work we proposed a fuzzy based admission control scheme, which is flexible and adaptive and makes an intelligent decision for call acceptance. In the previous work, we considered only two indicators for QoS and congestion control. However, for multimedia applications more QoS and CC parameters should be considered. In this paper, we extend our previous work by proposing two additional schemes, which are integrated in the previous scheme. The new scheme is called fuzzy admission control for multimedia applications (MFAC). In this paper, we introduce the conventional admission control schemes and give some simulation results of their performance. We explain the proposed MFAC scheme and present the design of fuzzy QoS controller (FQC) and Fuzzy congestion controller (FCC). The performance of the new scheme and the comparison with conventional ones is for the future work.	approximation;common access card;fly-by-wire;fuzzy logic;network congestion;newton's method;performance evaluation;quality of service;scheme;simulation;stationary process	Leonard Barolli;Mimoza Durresi;Kaoru Sugita;Arjan Durresi;Akio Koyama	2005	19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA'05) Volume 1 (AINA papers)	10.1109/AINA.2005.14	fuzzy logic;real-time computing;quality of service;resource allocation;computer science;network congestion;fuzzy control system;computer network	Embedded	-2.8209870576543747	96.59622622448089	53499

It has the task of ensuring that each traffic source complies with the traffic parameter negotiated in order to avoid network congestion. In this article we focus on a dual aim. The first is to analyse the performance of a policing mechanism based on Fuzzy Logic for the control of packetized voice sources. The results obtained show an excellent selectivity, close to that of an ideal policer, and a responsiveness, assessed by the combined measures of reaction time and rise time, which is decidedly better than that of the Leaky Bucket.

Analysis by simulation proves that fuzzy policer is extremely flexible in the combined control of these two traffic descriptors.	algorithm	Giuseppe Ficili;Daniela Panno	1999	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(98)00265-5	leaky bucket;fuzzy logic;mental chronometry;traffic policing;active traffic management;telecommunications;computer science;atmosphere;generic cell rate algorithm;network congestion;traffic shaping;computer network	Networks	-2.873772501488313	96.60227673182828	53530

The purpose of this paper is to study the fundamental limitations of dual bus networks, in terms of full utilization, fairness and bounded access delay. A new protocol called FUFA (fully utilized and fair) is used to demonstrate some of these basic properties. We define full utilization, and fairness precisely, and show that both are achieved together in the FUFA protocol. In addition, the protocol provides bounded access delay that is linear in the round trip propagation delay, and at most a constant away from its minimum possible value for any bus protocol that is both fully utilized and fair. The main idea is to compute, for each station, the latest estimate on the number of active downstream stations, according to the information available, and serve them in a round robin scheme.	downstream (software development);fairness measure;propagation delay;round-robin scheduling;software propagation	Angela L.

For a given SU data rate and fixed header length, it has been shown that there exists an optimal payload length for SUs packets which maximizes the aggregate goodput. Using the derived results, the impact on the aggregate goodput by three channel allocation methods i.e., intuitive, optimal, and proposed heuristic is investigated in a multiple channel CR network. Numerical studies show that the goodput of the proposed heuristic method is about 90–95% of that of the optimal method, and about 20–25% better than that of the intuitive method.

The source receives packets for transmission into a high-speed network according to a renewal process. The credit manager regulates the flow of data into the network by the following method. First, credit is generated at a fixed rate and is allowed to accumulate subject to an upper bound. Second, a packet is allowed to start transmission only if the accumulated credit is at least as large as the service time of the packet. Otherwise, the packet waits until the required amount of credit has been accumulated. Third, the credit bank is depleted at the onset of service by an amount which equals the service time. The main purpose of the credit manager is to smooth out the burstiness of the input process, thereby making it easier for the network to handle large amounts of data without undue delays, congestion, or buffer overflows. Despite the difficulty of this problem, the authors find the distributions of queue length, sojourn time, and interdeparture time by assuming a special structure for the service-time distribution and the credit bank. Numerical examples are included. >		Kin K. Leung;Raymond W. Yeung;Bhaskar Sengupta	1993	IEEE/ACM Trans.

The users' experience-oriented scheme allows users to enjoy the optimal service quality for real-time applications in respective access networks. In addition, the scheme sustains on-going sessions during the vertical HO. The proposed scheme consists of two methods — the bicasting of Different Quality-level Streams (DiffQS) and the Delay Difference Absorption (DDA) method. Initially, the authors propose two plausible methods for the SIP-based bicasting of DiffQS. This document introduces a SIP-capable network element named the HO Assistive Server (HOAS). HOAS controls bicasting of DiffQS and provides users with the optimal service quality for real-time applications via respective access networks as well as avoiding packet loss during HO. The DDA method is also proposed to prevent a service interruption and smoothly continue a real-time service during HO. Evaluation results show that the scheme achieves the seamless service continuity from the users' perspective for HO between cellular and high-speed wireless access via the implementation of a prototype system.

In the paper, we will discuss the rate control in MPEG encoder for low-delay real-time video communications over variable bit-rate (VBR) channel. In low-delay video communications, the video transmission is subject not only to the channel rate constraints, but also to the end-to-end delay constraints. In the paper, we employ leaky-bucket model to describe the traffic parameters and monitor the encoder's output. First, an ad hoc bit-allocation method is introduced. Although satisfying the rate constraints perfectly, it provides the objective quality of the decoded image to be just comparable to that of CBR rate control using MPEG2 TM5. Then, a new rate–distortion model is developed, based on which an advanced rate control algorithm is designed, producing almost uniform distortion within a frame as well as consistent video quality between frames. Experimental results show that, when compared to both the MPEG2 TM5 and the proposed ad hoc bit-allocation method, the advanced rate control algorithm maintains not only a constant buffer delay, but also a stable decoded image quality in the scenario of VBR transmission.	data compression;distortion;real-time clock;volume boot record	Junfeng Bai;Qingmin Liao;Xinggang Lin;Xinhua Zhuang	2002	Sig.

However, as demonstrated in this paper, existing window-based queueing models [26,30] are often not capable of precisely capturing the transient behavior (i.e., self-clocking and burstiness) of TCP-like protocols and their resulting analysis may be inaccurate in practice. As one example, we show that stability conditions of FAST TCP based on traditional queuing models [17] that do not considering transient dynamics of the queues are inconsistent with ns2 simulations. We explain the origin of this problem and overcome it by developing a novel approach called Self-clocking Queuing Model (SQM) that accurately describes both the steady-state and transient queuing behavior of windowbased control systems. Using SQM and explicitly incorporating control interval hi in the queuing model and derive a sufficient condition for its local stability under homogeneous delay, which strengthens prior results [29,30] obtained using traditional queuing models. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a multi-channel MAC protocol for data channel competition. Theoretical and simulation results show that this protocol resolves all channel collisions in only a few iterations. Moreover, the collision resolution time is dominated by the number of channels, rather than the number of D2D transmitters. Thus, even in scenarios with densely-distributed D2D devices, the proposed protocol can guarantee short collision resolution time.	access control;approximation;arcserve;channel (communications);collision domain;duplex (telecommunications);hash table;iteration;simulation;transmitter	Mei-Ju Shih;Guan-Yu Lin;Hung-Yu Wei	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2014.2379614	internet protocol;reverse address resolution protocol;transmitter;real time streaming protocol;media access control;atomic broadcast;user datagram protocol;convergence;telecommunications;internet protocol control protocol;computer science;global broadcast service;link control protocol;distributed computing;link access procedures, d channel;link-local address;internet protocol suite;computer network;internetwork protocol	Mobile	8.574839552673822	91.48735622747859	54470

The basic ideas behind these models are to decompose an MPEG compressed video sequence into several parts according to motion/scene complexity or data structure. Each part is described by a self-similar process. These different self-similar processes are then combined to form the respective models. In addition, Beta distribution is used to characterize the marginal cumulative distribution (CDF) of the self-similar processes. Comparison among the three models shows that the latest model (called the simple IPB composite model) is the most practical one in terms of accuracy and complexity. Simulations based on many real MPEG compressed movie sequences, including StarWars, have demonstrated that the simple model can capture the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the marginal CDF very closely.	acf;autocorrelation;data compression;data structure;ips community suite;marginal model;moving picture experts group;self-similarity;tracing (software)	Nirwan Ansari;Yun Q.

We investigate weighted round-robin type scheduling for differentiating the service classes together with two types of packet schedulers: a radio-aware packet scheduler at the radio access network, and a conventional packet scheduler at the edge of the core network. The results show that for the EGPRS-like system simulated: (i) incorporating radio link conditions and radio resource management into the scheduling can improve the overall delay performance by more than 20%; (ii) a weighted round-robin scheduling to differentiate service classes may not be suitable for an interference limited environment. Our ongoing work will consider using multiple time-slot assignments for providing differentiated services.	differentiated services;interference (communication);network packet;network scheduler;radio access network;radio resource management;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);weighted round robin	Jian Cai;Li-Fung Chang;Kapil K.

The optimum transport mode is commonly determined so as to maximise the throughput. Although this approach may be appropriate for best-effort services, its suitability for multimedia services, usually characterised by tight delay and error performance constraints, has been questioned. As a result, a number of alternative algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this context, this paper presents and evaluates in a dynamic radio environment several Link Adaptation algorithms designed to enhance the provision of delayand error-sensitive multimedia packet-data services over wireless systems. The obtained results demonstrate that significant improvements in terms of throughput, transmission delay, error performance and operation of Link Adaptation itself can be obtained with the proposed schemes.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;network packet;radio resource management;throughput	Miguel López-Benítez;Javier Gozálvez	2010	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-008-0156-8	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	5.511476730389513	100.14540477208422	54966

A key challenge faced by WirelessHART is to ensure the character of real-time data transmission in the network. Identifying a priority assignment strategy that reduces the delay in flow transmission is crucial in ensuring real-time network performance and the schedulability of real-time network flows. We study the priority assignment of real-time flows in WirelessHART on the basis of the multi-channel time division multiple access (TDMA) protocol to reduce the delay and improve the ratio of scheduled. We provide three kinds of methods: (1) worst fit, (2) best fit, and (3) first fit and choose the most suitable one, namely the worst-fit method for allocating flows to each channel. More importantly, we propose two heuristic algorithms-a priority assignment algorithm based on the greedy strategy for C (WF-C) and a priority assignment algorithm based on the greedy strategy for U(WF-U)-for assigning priorities to the flows in each channel, whose time complexity is O ( m a x ( N ∗ m ∗ l o g ( m ) , ( N - m ) 2 ) ) . We then build a new simulation model to simulate the transmission of real-time flows in WirelessHART. Finally, we compare our two algorithms with WF-D and HLS algorithms in terms of the average value of the total end-to-end delay of flow sets, the ratio of schedulable flow sets, and the calculation time of the schedulability analysis. The optimal algorithm WF-C reduces the delay by up to 44.18 % and increases the schedulability ratio by up to 70.7 % , and it reduces the calculation time compared with the HLS algorithm.

Then we introduce our solution, in which a Neural Network-based cognitive engine learns how environmental measurements and the status of the network affect the performance experienced on different channels, and can therefore dynamically select the channel which is expected to yield the best performance for the mobile users. We carry out performance evaluation of the proposed system by experimental measurements on a testbed implementation; the obtained results show that the proposed cognitive engine is effective in achieving performance enhancements with respect to state-of-the-art channel selection strategies.	artificial neural network;cognition;cognitive network;mathematical optimization;network performance;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;software deployment;testbed;throughput	Nicola Baldo;Tamma Bheemarjuna Reddy;B.

3b988049dd8f62f772281e90196bbd793700c86b	pfabric: minimal near-optimal datacenter transport	packet transport;flow scheduling;datacenter network	In this paper we present pFabric, a minimalistic datacenter transport design that provides near theoretically optimal flow completion times even at the 99th percentile for short flows, while still minimizing average flow completion time for long flows. Moreover, pFabric delivers this performance with a very simple design that is based on a key conceptual insight: datacenter transport should decouple flow scheduling from rate control. For flow scheduling, packets carry a single priority number set independently by each flow; switches have very small buffers and implement a very simple priority-based scheduling/dropping mechanism. Rate control is also correspondingly simpler; flows start at line rate and throttle back only under high and persistent packet loss. We provide theoretical intuition and show via extensive simulations that the combination of these two simple mechanisms is sufficient to provide near-optimal performance.	data center;network packet;network switch;prototype;scheduling (computing);simulation	Mohammad Alizadeh;Shuang Yang;Milad Sharif;Sachin Katti;Nick McKeown;Balaji Prabhakar;Scott Shenker	2013		10.1145/2486001.2486031	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-2.3588874356099034	93.91490498379243	55141

Moreover, in the case a simulation model of the communication system is not available, a trace file can efficiently substitute it. The results obtained with reference to a specific case study confirm the validity of the proposed approach and the advantages it offers over using just simulators.	complex systems;performance evaluation;simulation;telecommunications network	Orazio Mirabella;Michele Brischetto	2010	The IEEE symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546535	embedded system;complex systems;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;simulation modeling;operant conditioning;component;communications system;wireless;computer network	Embedded	0.21460581803400172	88.89381014517181	55152

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.	advanced transportation controller;anomaly detection;approximation algorithm;autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;coefficient;coupling (computer programming);denial-of-service attack;finite difference;inbound marketing;instruction unit;internet backbone;network packet;network traffic control;next-generation network;relevance;syn flood;sampling (signal processing);scalability;self-similarity;sensor;simulation;stationary process;time series;tracing (software)	Cyriac James;Hema A.

44ecf1fa209013f34a38f6c163f0bd89bff8167d	self-optimised coordinated traffic shifting scheme for lte cellular systems		Mobility load balancing is widely used in LTE cellular systems to deal with the uneven load distribution. Its basic idea is to shift traffic from a hot-spot cell to less-loaded neighbouring cells, called partners. Conventional schemes focus on the hot-spot cell’s load reduction and pay less attention to the performance of partners. This paper proposes a self-optimised coordinated traffic shifting scheme. In the proposed scheme, the coordination among partners is considered. Meanwhile, the shifted traffic is adjusted dynamically according to the load balancing (LB) performance. Simulation results show the proposed scheme can keep low call blocking probability of partners. It can also keep the number of Ping-Pong LB and the LB handover dropping probability at low levels.	blocking (computing);compaq lte;erlang (unit);hot spare;lattice boltzmann methods;load balancing (computing);ping-pong scheme;simulation	Lexi Xu;Xinzhou Cheng;Yue Chen;Kun Chao;Dantong Liu;Huanlai Xing	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19746-3_9	computer network	Metrics	21.46353363528643	92.61972425162392	55223

The interest is on the multicopy two-hop relay (MTR) protocol, where the source may generate multiple copies of a packet and use relay nodes to deliver the packet (or a copy) to its destination, and on the twohop relay protocol with erasure coding. Performance metrics of interest are the time to deliver a single packet to its destination, the number of copies of the packet at delivery instant, and the total number of copies that the source generates. The packet copies at relay nodes have limited lifetime (time-to-live TTL). Via a Markovian analysis, the three performance metrics of the MTR protocol are obtained in closed-from in the case where the number of the copies in the network is limited. Also, we develop an approximation analysis in the case where the inter-meeting times between nodes are arbitrarily distributed and the TTLs of the copies are constant and all equal. In particular, we show that exponential intermeeting times yield stochastically smaller delivery delays than hyper-exponential inter-meeting times, and that exponential TTLs yield stochastically larger delivery delays than constant TTLs. Finally, we characterize the delivery delay and the number of transmissions in the two-hop relay protocol with erasure coding and compare this scheme with the multicopy scheme.	approximation;erasure code;hoc (programming language);hop;internet relay chat;mtr;network packet;performance evaluation;time complexity;time to live;transistor–transistor logic	Ahmad Al Hanbali;Arzad Alam Kherani;Philippe Nain	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72606-7_17	erasure code;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;relay channel;statistics;computer network	Metrics	13.703554478626614	89.63299238360075	55225

Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols exploit sensing stimuli to build up a spectrum opportunity map (cognitive sensing). Available resources are scheduled (dynamic spectrum allocation), improving coexistence between users that belong to heterogeneous systems (dynamic spectrum sharing). Furthermore, MAC protocols may allow cognitive users to vacate selected channels when their quality becomes unacceptable (dynamic spectrum mobility). The contribution of this survey is threefold. First, we show the fundamental role of the MAC layer and identify its functionalities in a cognitive radio (CR) network. Second, a classification of cognitive MAC protocols is proposed. Third, advantages, drawbacks, and further design challenges of cognitive MAC protocols are discussed.	access control;advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;backup;channel capacity;coexist (image);cognition;cognitive network;cognitive radio;communications protocol;elegant degradation;frequency allocation;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);interrupt;local oscillator;mac address;modulation;network packet;open research;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;quality of service;radio frequency;radio resource management;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;spectral leakage;synchronization (computer science);transceiver;transmitter;wireless access point	Antonio De Domenico;Emilio Calvanese Strinati;Maria-Gabriella Di Benedetto	2012	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2011.111510.00108	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;software-defined radio;computer security;computer network	Mobile	22.79119129034342	90.76351996501778	55291

Markov decision theory is used to construct a state-dependent routing policy. Optimality conditions for a load sharing routing are derived from the first-order Kuhn-Tucker equations. These models together with a direct routing scheme are used in a simulation study to determine the best approach for control of traffic with delayed call setup. State-dependent routing is found to be superior to direct routing and load sharing routing, although its operation is much more complex. >	flow control (data)	Zbigniew Dziong;Ke-Qiang Liao;Lorne Mason	1990		10.1109/INFCOM.1990.91231	wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;circuit switching;routing information protocol;statistics;computer network	ML	-0.34490980889171025	98.09895832589176	55464

Although frame slot ALOHA based and splitting tree based collision resolution protocols are widely adopted, for the resolution of different number of tags, these protocols and their variants perform differently. The performance evaluation and comparison of these protocols are seldom researched and reported. In this paper, the time and message complexity of some typical collision resolution protocols are evaluated and compared through theoretical analysis and computation. Results indicate that the splitting tree based protocols, especially the k-ary tree protocol, perform much better than the frame slot ALOHA protocols, and it is difficult for the frame slot ALOHA protocols to resolve the collision happened in dense RFID tag environment.	communications protocol;computation;hash table;k-ary tree;performance evaluation;radio-frequency identification	Xinqing Yan;Zhou-Ping Yin;Youlun Xiong	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking	10.1109/FGCN.2008.13	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	10.629189326511465	93.44343496270986	55477

We propose a collision-free MAC protocol called BROADEN based on CSMA/CP. To the best of our knowledge, BROADEN is the first distributed MAC protocol that can achieve 100% collision-free transmissions in both the control channel and data channel in multihop ad hoc networks. Furthermore, BROADEN can solve the hidden, exposed, and moving terminal problems at the same time. It also improves the performance of previous MAC protocols in terms of average packet delay and network throughput. Moreover, our protocol effectively supports quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning based on prioritization and reservation.	channel (communications);differentiated service;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);network packet;provisioning;quality of service;throughput;transceiver	Tiantong You;Chi-Hsiang Yeh;Hossam S.

For a certain loading of the network, the value of the parameter p r  must be appropriately set. Improved delay-throughput and fault tolerance can be achieved in multiple channel LANs. In this paper, some selection criteria of the retransmission probability based on the observable parameter of the number of idle channels are given. These near optimal selections of p r  show performance characteristics very close to the optimal selection rule.	retransmission (data networks)	Md.

The switches are assumed to schedule outgoing packets using the Packet-by-Packet Generalized Processor Sharing (PGPS) scheduling discipline. We propose an algorithm for call admission control (CAC) and a number of resource reservation policies that are used to map the end-to-end delay requirement into a local rate to be reserved at each switch. The proposed reservation policies are the uniform reservation (EVEN) policy, the capacity proportional (CP) policy, and the remaining capacity proportional (RCP) policy. We present extensive simulation results to evaluate the performance of these resource allocation policies for various topologies and traffic characteristics. We also propose a resource-based routing algorithm and show the performance gain when it is used.	algorithm;common access card;end-to-end principle;generalized processor sharing;network packet;network switch;performance evaluation;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation	Khaled M.

0c68e96e0d1330ee02d720d6da44333ee7bcc858	embracing corruption burstiness: fast error recovery for zigbee under wi-fi interference	zigbee ieee 802 11 standard forward error correction interference delays decoding encoding;xor coding zigbee bursty corruptions error recovery	The ZigBee communication can be easily and severely interfered by Wi-Fi traffic. Error recovery, as an important means for ZigBee to survive Wi-Fi interference, has been extensively studied in recent years. The existing works add upfront redundancy to in-packet blocks for recovering a certain number of random corruptions. Therefore, the bursty nature of ZigBee in-packet corruptions under Wi-Fi interference is often considered harmful, since some blocks are full of errors which cannot be recovered and some blocks have no errors but are still requiring redundancy. As a result, they often use interleaving to reshape the bursty errors, before applying complex FEC codes to recover the re-shaped random distributed errors. In this paper, we take a different view that burstiness may be helpful. With burstiness, the in-packet corruptions are often consecutive and the requirement for error recovery is reduced as “recovering any k consecutive errors” instead of “recovering any random k errors”. This lowered requirement allows us to design far more efficient code than the existing FEC codes. Motivated by this implication, we exploit the corruption burstiness to design a simple yet effective error recovery code using XOR operations (called ZiXOR). ZiXOR uses XOR code and the delay is significantly reduced. More, ZiXOR uses RSSI-hinted approach to detect in packet corruptions without CRC, incurring almost no extra transmission overhead. The testbed evaluation results show that ZiXOR outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of the throughput (by 47 percent) and latency (by 22 percent).	code;cyclic redundancy check;exclusive or;forward error correction;interference (communication);memory corruption;network packet;overhead (computing);sampling (signal processing);testbed;throughput;tinyos	Zhiwei Zhao;Wei Dong;Gonglong Chen;Geyong Min;Tao Gu;Jiajun Bu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2016.2630696	computer network;redundancy (engineering);throughput;latency (engineering);burstiness;forward error correction;real-time computing;decoding methods;computer science;distributed computing;network packet;exploit	Mobile	-1.2163922759697283	90.89763414520665	55649
2c3d86e6fcb4f931ef90c2a5e075562cbfeb9c65	"""reprint of """"virtual cut-through: a new computer communication switching technique"""""""		In this paper a new switching technique called virtual cut-through is proposed and its performance is analyzed. This switching system is very similar to message switching, with the difference that when a message arrives in an intermediate node and its selected outgoing channel is free (just after the reception of the header), then, in contrast to message switching, the message is sent out to the adjacent node towards its destination before it is received completely at the node; only if the message is blocked due to a busy output channel is a message buffered in an intermediate node. Therefore, the delay due to unnecessary buffering in front of an idle channel is avoided. We analyze and compare the performance of this new switching technique with that of message switching with respect to three measures: network delay, traffic gain and buffer storage requirement. Our analysis shows that cut-through switching is superior (and at worst identical) to message switching with respect to the above three performance measures.	message authentication code	Parviz Kermani;Leonard Kleinrock	2014	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2014.04.006	real-time computing;optical burst switching;telecommunications;computer science;label switching;cut-through switching;operating system;message switching;computer security;computer network	Visualization	-0.864585243712687	93.17591060784312	55717

However, due to the hardware limitation, the carrier sensing mechanism can not help much in single transceiver and multi-channel scenarios. In this paper, we propose a pipelining multi-channel (pi-Mc) MAC protocol for multi-channel ad hoc networks. The core idea of pi-Mc is similar to the pipeline technique. Without collecting each channel usage information, pi-Mc not only uses overall channel resources for transmission, but also can prevent DATA collisions. The performance of pi-Mc is compared with two well-known multi-channel MAC protocols and IEEE 802.11 DCF. Simulation results show that pi-Mc is able to achieve 2.50 times the throughput of IEEE 802.11 DCF, as well as respectively outperform DCA and MMAC with a factor of up to 1.43 and 1.32 under three available channels.	collision detection;design rule for camera file system;hoc (programming language);multiply–accumulate operation;pipeline (computing);simulation;throughput;transceiver	Kuei-Ping Shih;Yen-Da Chen;Shu-Sheng Liu	2010	2010 IEEE 24th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2010.58	vehicular ad hoc network;ieee 802.11s;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;network allocation vector;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.813909110910313	90.00282109087351	55914

Impulsiveness implies a heavy-tailed marginal distribution, thus lack of finite second-order statistics. Hence, traditional methods for quantifying the long-range dependence of traffic based on its second-order statistics are not applicable. Long-range dependence and self-similarity play an important role in traffic engineering. We have recently shown that the generalized codifference can quantify the dependence structure of impulsive self-similar processes, such as high-speed network traffic. We propose an estimator for the generalized codifference and provide the conditions for it to be asymptotically consistent. We show that these conditions are satisfied for the EAFRP which is a process proposed for modeling high-speed network traffic. We provide simulation results to demonstrate the properties of the proposed estimator, and show how it can be a useful tool in maintaining fairness among users sharing limited network resources.

e6f2876af2582204eb95d601533716cfdd5f83b8	analytical modelling of multiservice switching networks with multiservice sources and resource management mechanisms	switching networks;multiservice traffic;blocking probability	This article proposes a new analytical method of determining occupancy distribution and blocking probability in multiservice switching networks with admission control mechanisms and resource management mechanisms. The proposed method is a universal one, which allows for determining blocking probability using the same model, regardless of the type of admission control mechanisms and resource management mechanisms. The versatility of the method is demonstrated in the article for two selected mechanisms, i.e. a threshold mechanism and a resource reservation mechanisms. The switching networks under consideration are offered multiservice traffic streams, generated by the so-called multiservice sources, according to Erlang, Engset and Pascal distributions. The proposed method is based on a generalised way of determining traffic characteristics for inter-stage links of switching networks with resource and call management mechanisms. Particular attention is given to determining the influence of the introduced mechanisms in outgoing links of the switching network on the traffic properties of inter-stage links of the network. The results of analytical calculations are then compared with the results obtained in digital simulation for a number of selected switching networks.

The main objective of AMP is to distribute load within a network domain in a continuous manner by offloading congested links in real-time. The algorithm's recursive signaling structure represents one of our central contributions, as it restricts information exchange to neighboring nodes while still maintaining global propagation of congestion information. This paper starts with a comprehensive survey of related literature, before we introduce AMP in depth and present our exhaustive performance evaluation which is carried out using full implementations of the algorithm both in packet-level and flow-level simulation environments. The investigated state-of-the-art topologies and traffic models provide a detailed insight into the behavior of AMP in realistic operators' networks of substantial size and complexity, whereas our results demonstrate both the traffic engineering efficiency and the stability of AMP. Finally, we present important areas of application for AMP in emerging networking architectures and conclude the paper with an outlook on future research.	algorithm;internet traffic engineering	Ivan Gojmerac;Peter Reichl;Lasse Jansen	2008	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2008.06.004	wireless mesh network;traffic engineering;signalling;routing;active traffic management;the internet;simulation;internet traffic;information exchange;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;implementation;computer security;computer network	Metrics	0.41367907645284696	102.97286620380508	56389

This control is typically based only on the characteristics of the particular (tagged) traffic stream and would fail to optimally adjust to nonnominal network conditions such as overload. In this paper, a dynamic regulation and scheduling (dynamic-R&S) scheme is proposed whose regulation function is modulated by both the tagged stream’s characteristics and information capturing the state of the coexisting applications as provided by the scheduler. The performance of the proposed scheme—versus an equivalent static one—is investigated under both underload and overload traffic conditions. The substantially better throughput/jitter characteristics of the dynamic-R&S scheme are established.	modulation;network packet;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);throughput	Steve Iatrou;Ioannis Stavrakakis	2000	IEEE/ACM Trans.

We first estimate the number of packets dropped due to collisions, at each node by counting the number of packets that are not successfully retrieved by physical capture. Next, using a simple algorithm, we assign this collision loss to neighboring sources of packets that might have generated the colliding packets. Using extensive ns2 simulations, we show that our multirate adaptation scheme consistently outperforms the existing schemes.	algorithm;scheme;simulation;throughput	Jun Cheol Park;Sneha Kumar Kasera;Neal Patwari	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425916	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;spread spectrum;physical layer;wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.463768219102796	89.76458755384081	56722

The wireless network consists of a set of honest and reliable nodes that are within the transmission range of each other. In addition to these nodes there is an adversary. The adversary may know the protocol and its entire history and use this knowledge to jam the wireless channel at will at any time. It is allowed to jam a (1-epsilon)-fraction of the time steps, for an arbitrary constant epsilon>0, but it has to make a jamming decision before it knows the actions of the nodes at the current step. The nodes cannot distinguish between the adversarial jamming or a collision of two or more messages that are sent at the same time. We demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a local-control MAC protocol requiring only very limited knowledge about the adversary and the network that achieves a constant throughput for the non-jammed time steps under any adversarial strategy above. We also show that our protocol is very energy efficient and that it can be extended to obtain a robust and efficient protocol for leader election and the fair use of the wireless channel.	access control;adversary (cryptography);competitive analysis (online algorithm);jam;leader election;radio jamming;throughput;transmission (bittorrent client)	Baruch Awerbuch;Andréa W.

The correct operation of such a network requires its users to cooperate on the level of packet forwarding. However, a distributed nature of MANET, lack of a single authority, and limited battery resources of participating devices may lead to a noncooperative behavior of network users, resulting in a degradation of the network throughput. Thus, a cooperation enforcement system specifying certain packet forwarding strategies is a necessity is such networks. In this work we investigate general properties of such a system. We introduce a Prisoner's Dilemma-based model of packet forwarding and next using an evolutionary game-theoretical approach we demonstrate that cooperation very likely to be developed on the basis of conditionally cooperative strategies similar to the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy.	elegant degradation;game theory;hoc (programming language);mobile phone;network packet;prisoner's dilemma;programming paradigm;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;throughput	Marcin Seredynski;Pascal Bouvry	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing	10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161129	wireless ad hoc network;game theory;routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;packet forwarding;packet switch;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.211068377134197	96.05677873288214	56787

This paper considers such a system model and presents a cross-layer approach to jointly design adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) at the physical layer and the truncated cooperative automatic repeat request (C-ARQ) protocol at the data-link layer for quality-of-service (QoS)-constrained applications. The average spectral efficiency and packet loss rate of the joint C-ARQ and AMC scheme are first derived in closed form. Aiming to maximize the system spectral efficiency, AMC schemes for the S-D and R-D links are optimized, whereas a prescribed packet-loss-rate constraint is satisfied. As an interesting application, joint link adaptation and blockage mitigation in land mobile satellite communications (LMSC) with temporally correlated channels is then investigated. In LMSC, the S node data can be delivered to the D node when the S-D is in the outage, therefore provisioning the QoS requirements. For applications without instantaneous feedback, an optimized rate selection scheme based on the channel statistics is also devised. Detailed and insightful numerical results are presented, which indicate the superior performance of the proposed joint AMC and C-ARQ schemes over their optimized joint AMC and traditional ARQ counterparts.	advanced mezzanine card;automatic repeat request;communications satellite;downtime;msat;modulation;network packet;numerical analysis;provisioning;quality of service;relay;requirement;spectral efficiency	Morteza Mardani;Jalil S.

We further show, that unlike existing nonlinear models, the proposed solution can be extended to communication systems in which several successful transmissions can take place in parallel, such as multibus communication networks and multichannel satellite systems.	approximation algorithm;linear equation;linear function;multibus;nonlinear system;telecommunications network	Aura Ganz;Imrich Chlamtac	1990	IEEE Trans.

bbc6814703749f1e0b85eb108022f8ec1e9ce52f	adaptive access class barring method for machine generated communications		Cellular network is provisioned to serve traffic demands generated by human being. The random access channel used for nodes to compete for a connection with an eNB is limited. Even though machines generate very small amount of data traffic, the signaling channel of a network becomes overloaded and collisions occur to fail the access if toomanyMTC (Machine Type Communication) devices attempt to access network. To tackle the issue, 3GPP specifies an access class barring but leaves a specific algorithm as an implementation issue. In this paper, we propose an adaptive access barring method. Generally, an eNB does not know the number of MTC devices in its coverage area. Thus, it is difficult to control the barring factor by predicting the number of MTC devices in a service area of a cell. On the contrary, we control the barring factor based on the prediction of access intensity which can be measured at an eNB. Simulation results show that since the proposed method can manipulate the barring factor autonomously according to the access intensity, it is superior to the original method in terms of the access success probability and the collision probability.

Since TCP still represents the by far most important transport protocol in the current Internet traffic mix, new applications like media streaming need to take into account the social rules implied by TCP's congestion control algorithms, i.e., they need to behaveTCP- friendly. One problem of this insight is that these new applications are not always well served by inheriting TCP's transmission scheme. In particular, TCP's initial start-up behaviour is a prob- lem for streaming applications. In this paper, we try to address this problem by proposing a reflective server design which allows to do inter-session congestion control, i.e., to share net- work performance experiences between sessions to make informed congestion control decisions. Since our focus is media streaming, we show the design in the framework of a media server, which means in particular not employing TCP itself but a TCP-friendly transmissions scheme.	media server;speedup	Jens B.

6e554e735e1adf57248b708f75b0ed760bca75da	ieee 802.21 buffer predicting seamless handoff (bpsh) scheme for wave-wimax heterogenous handoff		Since Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) is a draft amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard, the integration of WAVE (IEEE 802.11p) and Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (IEEE 802.16) becomes a concerned issue to mobile network users. During the roaming between the two heterogeneous wireless networks, the quality of multimedia services for users depends heavily on seamless handover, which should be provided by the middleware between IP and MAC protocol stack. For this reason, we design the heterogeneous handoff of WAVE-WiMAX by seamless handoff scheme from buffer prediction of IEEE 802.21. IEEE 802.21 is designed to provide the basic platform for seamless heterogeneous handoff. Due to the integration function provided by IEEE 802.21, users are able to use the original services between heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, a dynamically adjusted buffer component with an algorithm to predict the buffer size is proposed to enhance the functionality of IEEE 802.21. The services and communication flows among service specific layer, buffer and IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) function are described and analyzed. According to the analysis of the connection process and simulation, buffer prediction and pre-allocation indeed can reduce the influence of handover between heterogeneous wireless networks.	algorithm;interference (communication);interrupt;middleware;protocol stack;seamless3d;simulation;yet another	Tin Yu Wu;Ya-Chun Li;Wei-Tsong Lee;Jen-Wen Ding;Yu-Chin Wang	2010	J.

They have mainly focused on modifying congestion control. However, even ideal congestion control for wireless networks cannot achieve remarkable throughput increase. In this paper, we verify that the reason for this exists in a vulnerable point where existing loss recovery algorithms do not consistently work as packet loss rate increases due to ack starvation during loss recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel loss recovery algorithm using packet transmission order, which shows a steady loss recovery ability even though packet loss rate increases. This leads to significant throughput increase of wireless TCP.	acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;clock rate;network congestion;network packet;self-clocking signal;throughput	Moonsoo Kang;Jeonghoon Mo	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	10.1109/WOWMOM.2007.4351775	radio link protocol;real-time computing;data structure;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;packet loss;computer network	Mobile	-2.5061229242335563	92.03954268964611	57100

The cause of the TCP outcast problem is the bursty packet losses by a drop-tail queue that triggers TCP timeouts and leads to decreasing the congestion window. This paper proposes TCPRand, a transport layer solution to TCP outcast. The main idea of TCPRand is the randomization of TCP payload size, which breaks synchronized packet arrivals between flows from different input ports. We investigate how TCPRand reduces consecutive packet drops and demonstrate various benefits of TCPRand with extensive experiments and ns-3 simulation. Our evaluation results show that TCPRand guarantees the superior enhancement of TCP fairness with negligible overheads in all of our test cases.	central processing unit;control system;data center;experiment;fairness measure;goodput;network congestion;network packet;one-to-many (data model);outcast;overhead (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;test case;time sharing option;trustworthy computing	Soojeon Lee;Myungjin Lee;Dongman Lee;Hyungsoo Jung;Byoung-Sun Lee	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218550	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-4.159141865331696	92.74943853659593	57114

The adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) mechanisms can be applied in order to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless multihop networks. However, most of these mechanisms concentrate on the physical layer without taking the queuing effects at the data link layer into account, whose performances are overestimated. Therefore the cross-layer analytical framework is presented in analysing the quality-of-service (QoS) performances of the decode-and-forward (DF) relaying wireless networks, where the AMC is employed at the physical layer under the conditions of unsaturated traffic and finite-length queue at the data link layer. Considering the characteristics of DF relaying protocol at the physical layer, the authors first propose modelling a two-hop DF relaying wireless channel with AMC as an equivalent Finite State Markov Chain (FSMC) in queuing analysis. Then, the performances in terms of queuing delay, packet loss rate and average throughput are derived. The numerical results show that the proposed analytical method can be efficiently applied for studying the issues including the relay deployment and the cross-layer design in the multihop relaying networks.	adaptive grammar;advanced mezzanine card;direction finding;markov chain;modulation;network packet;numerical analysis;performance;quality of service;queuing delay;relay;software deployment;spectral efficiency;throughput	Kan Zheng;Yuyu Wang;Lei Lei;Wenbo Wang	2010	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0380	data link layer;markov chain;systems modeling;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;markov process;routing protocol;queueing theory;service quality;packet switching;statistics;spectral efficiency;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	2.6481234595773295	101.32596261605737	57133

To expand the service coverage, a hybrid network that combines an ad hoc network with a cellular (or wireless LAN) network, appears to have great potential. In such systems, some mobile users outside the service area can access the network with the aid of other intermediate mobiles. However, this method incurs energy consumption in routing users, which could be a serious obstacle for wide-spread deployment of multihop wireless networks. Therefore we consider a revenue-cost model and propose a profit-based routing strategy that encourages routing users to actively participate in the relaying service because they are compensated for their energy consumption cost. Our strategy enables each mobile node to find an appropriate multihop path to a base station (or access point) that satisfies the interests of the service provider and the users. Numerical results show that our model successfully expands the network coverage area while ensuring the profit of each system involved.	analysis of algorithms;data recovery;frequency band;hoc (programming language);routing;software deployment;wireless access point	Young-June Choi;Jung Hyon Jun;Saewoong Bahk	2007	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-006-9203-x	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;municipal wireless network;routing protocol;wi-fi array;computer security;computer network	Mobile	18.189272538228924	89.72876874495485	57139

3fe468125be08ebbc16246df24598c58f96dec43	redundant packet scheduling by uncorrelated paths in heterogeneous wireless networks		Heterogeneous wireless networks operate under un-certainties as traffic load variation and failures. Redundant packet scheduling algorithms seek to timely cope with these uncertainties to meet the latency and throughput requirements for delay-sensitive applications, such as online gaming, voice and video streaming. The Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) can rely on a redundant scheduler to fulfill this demand, replicating data packets on multiple paths to mitigate negative effects of heterogeneity, such as fluctuations in delay, loss rate, and bandwidth. However, shared bottlenecks among paths can compromise the benefits of the redundant scheduler and restrain the MPTCP performance. Thus, this paper introduces a new scheduler, called RED (REdundant Diversity scheduling), to prioritize packet replication by uncorrelated paths. RED selects paths and replicates packets based on the Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results show that RED achieves low delay and enhances the usage of low correlated paths, improving transmission performance.	algorithm;coefficient;linux;multipath propagation;network packet;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);streaming media;throughput	Benevid Felix;Igor Steuck;Aldri Luiz dos Santos;Stefano Secci;Michele Nogueira Lima	2018	2018 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2018.8538641	wireless network;throughput;latency (engineering);multipath propagation;computer network;scheduling (computing);transmission control protocol;network packet;computer science;compromise	Networks	-4.12795775842404	91.60707386951451	57381

Although it is well known that TCP combined with intermediate systems with active queue management (AQM) schemes can not guarantee asymptotical stability when the feedback delay or the link capacity is large, the asymptotical stability may not be necessary for network achieving good performance in terms of resource utilization, flow throughput and queueing delay. Practical bounds are important performance index for congestion control protocols and AQM schemes. How to derive practical bounds for realistic systems with heterogeneous flows, various delays and multiple bottlenecks is an important and challenging open issue. In this paper, we study the boundedness of generalized TCP and AQM systems considering the heterogeneity of flows and the impact of multiple bottlenecks. We derive the uniform bounds and uniform ultimate bounds of flow window size, which reveal how the system and flow parameters affect the system performance. Extensive simulation results have been given to verify the correctness of the bounds.	active queue management;asymptote;correctness (computer science);internet;network congestion;queuing delay;simulation;throughput	Hongtao Zhang;Lin Cai;Xinzhi Liu;Xuemin Shen	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506357	communications protocol;propagation delay;throughput;in situ resource utilization;process performance index;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;the internet;tcp global synchronization;computer science;resource management;mathematical model;feedback;distributed computing;queueing theory;network congestion;tcp friendly rate control;active queue management;transport layer;bandwidth;computer network	Metrics	-1.5193387663546472	97.14253024322619	57811

In FiWi access networks, energy efficiency issues must be addressed in a comprehensive fashion that takes into account not only wireless front-end but also optical backhaul segments to extend the battery life of wireless devices and allow operators to reduce their OPEX, while not compromising quality of service (QoS). This paper proposes an energy conservation scheme for FiWi networks (ECO-FiWi) that jointly schedules power-saving modes of wireless stations and access points and optical network units to reduce their energy consumption. ECO-FiWi maximizes the overall network performance by leveraging TDMA to synchronize the power-saving modes and incorporate them into the dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) process. A comprehensive energy saving model and an M/G/1 queuing-based analysis of downstream and upstream end-to-end frame delays are presented accounting for both backhaul and front-end network segments. Analytical results show that ECO-FiWi achieves significant amounts of energy saving, while preserving upstream delay and incurring a low delay for downstream traffic.	access network;backhaul (telecommunications);downstream (software development);end-to-end principle;enterprise core objects;ethernet in the first mile;network performance;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);sleep mode;wireless access point	Dung Pham Van;Bhaskar Prasad Rimal;Martin Maier;Luca Valcarenghi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2531694	passive optical network;real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless site survey;telecommunications;10g-pon;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;10g-epon;wireless;computer network	Mobile	22.07700687081024	90.05474822816578	58017

We resort to the multi-commodity flow (MCF) formulation, augmented with the conflict-graph constraints, to jointly compute the maximum throughput and the associated optimal network dimensioning; while use a novel approach to take into account the collision overhead in the distributed CSMA/CA MAC. Such overhead has been ignored by the existing MCF-based capacity studies, which assume impractical centralized scheduling and result in aggressive network dimensioning, unachievable over the CSMA/CA MAC. We develop a generic method to integrate the CSMA/CA MAC analysis with the MCF formulation for optimal network capacity analysis, and derive both an upper bound and a lower bound of the network throughput over a practical CSMA/CA protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first rigorous theoretical study of the achievable capacity over a multi-hop CSMA/CA based wireless network.	access control;algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);centralized computing;maximum throughput scheduling;meta content framework;multi-commodity flow problem;overhead (computing);polynomial;randomness;scheduling (computing);serializability;wireless mesh network	Yu Cheng;Hongkun Li;Peng-Jun Wan;Xinbing Wang	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462273	network allocation vector;throughput;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;operating system;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;computer network	Mobile	15.212259873408128	93.02360447102151	58090

An IEEE 802.11s standard draft has been lately designed to define the WMNs framework and architecture. Multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks (MCMR WMNs) have been introduced to improve system performance. However, interfaces and channels management in MCMR WMNs becomes essential to achieve the network performances rise. In this paper, we propose a solution that defines a MAC layer module named Interface Management Module (IMM) under a hybrid channel assignment. The IMM manage the multi-channel radio interface based on scheduling algorithms. A dynamic scheduling algorithm has been proposed. The algorithm is based on traffic profiling and dynamic weights computing for channels scheduling.	algorithm;mesh networking;performance;quality of service;scheduling (computing);wireless mesh network	Ghayet El Mouna Zhioua;Nabil Tabbane	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214126	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;computer performance;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	5.021798052792295	96.25919822571947	58190

Despite of the rapid changes of MAC protocols, a comprehensive performance analysis of any MAC protocol remains an open issue for over several decades. Most of existing analysis of MAC protocols focused on the network throughput and packet access delay under the assumption that the network is saturated which is not realistic. We know very little about the stability of MAC protocol under the normal network operation for lack of a systematic model that can be adaptively applied to various MAC protocols with different service requirements and backoff scheduling algorithms. In the light of the concern, we propose a queueing model of the general CSMA protocol with probability-based backoff scheduling algorithm. The input buffer of each node is modeled as a Geo/G/1 queue, in which the service time distribution of each individual head-of-line (HOL) packet can be described by a Markov chain. By means of this queueing model, we can obtain the characteristic equation of throughput, the packet queueing delay as well as the stable conditions with admissible input traffic. We also specify stable throughput and bounded delay regions with respect to the retransmission factor and input rate. Furthermore, we show that geometric retransmission algorithm is intrinsically unstable for large population sizes. On the other hand, exponential backoff algorithm is more robust and scalable. Even for infinity population sizes, the stable throughput and bounded delay region still exists under certain conditions. Other than the probability-based backoff algorithm, this thesis also includes the study of window-based backoff algorithm. It is shown that the probability-based and window-based backoff algorithms are equivalent to each other. Moreover, we find that the characteristic equation of network throughput is invariant to backoff scheduling algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed queueing model can be systematically generalized to investigate various types of MAC protocols, such as ALOHA, CSMA protocols, IEEE 802.11 protocols. Specifically, we illustrate the methodology by full analyses of the non-persistent CSMA and 1-persistent CSMA protocols in this thesis.	algorithm;backoff;markov chain;modulation;scheduling (computing)	Pui King Wong	2011				ML	5.477718774062584	94.34595533591767	58193

In this architecture, a primary and secondary MPLS LSP are established from an ingress LSR to every other egress LSR. We propose to split the aggregate TCP traffic between the primary and secondary paths using a distributed mechanism based on ECN marking and AIMD-based rate control. Inspired by the random early discard mechanisms for active queue management, we propose a random early reroute scheme to adaptively control the delay difference between the primary and secondary LSPs. Considering the adverse effect of packet reordering on TCP performance for packet-based load balancing schemes, we propose that the TCP splitting mechanism operates on a per-flow basis. Using flow-based models developed for Internet traffic and simulations, we show that flow-based distributed multi-path traffic engineering outperforms on a consistent basis the case of a single path in terms of per-flow goodputs. Due to the elimination of out-of-order packet arrivals, flow-based splitting also enhances TCP performance with respect to packet-based splitting especially for long TCP flows that are hit hard by packet reordering. We also compare and contrast two queuing architectures for differential treatment of data packets routed over primary and secondary LSPs in the MPLS data plane, namely first-in-first-out and strict priority queuing. We show through simulations that strict priority queuing is more effective and relatively more robust with respect to the changes in the traffic demand matrix than first-in-first-out queuing in the context of distributed multi-path routing.	active queue management;aggregate data;egress filtering;explicit congestion notification;forwarding plane;ingress filtering;item unique identification;load balancing (computing);multipath routing;multiprotocol label switching;network packet;priority queue;random early detection;simulation	Onur Alparslan;Nail Akar;Ezhan Karasan	2004	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03179725	shared resource;routing;real-time computing;the internet;internet traffic;adaptive control;fifo and lifo accounting;adverse effect;computer science;out-of-order execution;load balancing;multipath routing;fair queuing;distributed computing;internet protocol suite;queue;active queue management;internet traffic engineering;computer network	Metrics	-2.793367485490783	94.55396971159261	58362

Simulation results indicate that while TCP Vegas obtains a better throughput and stability in homogeneous cases than TCP Reno, the former performs poorly in heterogeneous cases, accounting for the reluctance among users to adopt it. Thus we propose a simple approach, parameter adjustment for Vegas, to solve this problem. This approach enables Vegas to achieve its fair share of bandwidth, even gaining an advantage over Reno, encouraging users to switch their TCP from Reno to Vegas. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It indicates that in the near future TCP protocol will be frequently used over the wireless links. The wireless links characteristics are significantly different from characteristics of wired links. TCP (Transport Control Protocol) is basically designed for wired network. One of the main reasons for TCP's degraded performance in wireless networks is TCP's interpretation that packet loss is caused by congestion. However, in wireless cellular networks packet loss occurs mostly due to high bit error rate, packet corruption, or link failure. As TCP is designed to use over wired network it needs to change when it is used over wireless network. Hence, various mechanisms were proposed to improve TCP performance over wireless links. TCP performance in wired/wireless networks may be substantially improved by modifying some of the algorithms used in TCP. This paper proposes a new TCP protocol named Modified-TCP (MTCP) that uses modified congestion algorithm, fast and local retransmission and SACK (selective acknowledgment). This makes the proposed protocol better suited in a wide range of applications in mixed wired and wireless links. This paper shows the results after comparing performance of MTCP with TCP over wired cum wireless network using network simulator ns-2.	acknowledgment index;algorithm;bit error rate;internet;network congestion;network packet;retransmission (data networks);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Sonali Sankpal;P.

76f82ca1b62170052deb79eeda487568a5705fc4	polarized mimo slotted aloha random access scheme in satellite network		The massive number of the machine type communication terminals accessing the satellite network brings a new challenge for the random access (RA) system. To meet the challenge, by using the polarization transmission structure in the satellite uplink, we propose a new RA scheme dubbed polarized multiple input multiple output slotted ALOHA (PMSA). In PMSA, in one slot, one packet and two overlapped packets can be decoded successfully with the polarized MIMO detection algorithms, and some of three overlapped packets may be decoded successfully in consideration of the capture effect at the satellite node. For the new features of the proposed scheme in physical layer, the protocol of medium access control (MAC) is modified based on the slotted ALOHA (SA). Simulation results show that the normalized throughput of the PMSA can reach 0.84 and is consistent with the theoretical throughput. Moreover, it is also shown that the throughput of PMSA is about 2.3 times as large as that of the SA and 1.5 times as large as that of the contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA), without the need for additional transmitted power and time slots to transmit the replicas of the packets. The received packets in the proposed PMSA are processed slot by slot, not as that processed frame by frame in the CRDSA with a large additional frame delay.	access control;algorithm;capture effect;mimo;mimo-ofdm;network packet;polarization (waves);random access;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Jialing Bai;Guangliang Ren	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2774247	computer network;mimo;throughput;access control;telecommunications link;physical layer;capture effect;computer science;random access;network packet	Networks	9.096498389403589	91.93740777655549	58688

In this paper we incorporate this type of scheduling into ON/OFF roadside unit sleep activity, to further reduce infrastructure power consumption. To achieve significant power savings however, the OFF-to-ON sleep transitions may be very lengthy, and this overhead must be taken into account when performing the ON state scheduling. We first incorporate the OFF/ON sleep transitions into a lower bound on energy usage that can be computed for given input sample functions. An online scheduling algorithm referred to as the Flow Graph Sleep Scheduler (FGS) is then introduced, which makes locally optimum decisions about when to initiate new ON/OFF cycles. This is done by computing an estimate of the energy needed to fulfill known vehicle communication requirements with and without the OFF period. This calculation is efficiently done using a novel minimum flow graph formulation. Results from a variety of experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm performs well when compared to the energy lower bound. It is especially attractive in situations where vehicle demands and arrival rates are such that the energy costs permit frequent ON/OFF cycling.	computation;experiment;greedy algorithm;integer programming;overhead (computing);requirement;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;whole genome sequencing	Shokouh Mostofi;Abdulla A.

Defined from software defined radio, the cognitive users use the unused spectrum (spectrum holes) using various techniques to detect and efficiently allocate the unused spectrum. The process requires complex computations and many times software packages to be downloaded. This drains the battery power and panics the mobile users and other users with limited battery power. To meet the consequences, a new model called cognitive radio networks with cloud (CRNC) is introduced in this research. The proposed model eliminates the current problems in transmission of information and helps in the real-time process. Simulations were conducted with the proposed CRNC model and discussed the possible packet transfer.	cloud computing;cloud database;cognitive radio;computation;eclipse;linux;list of apache–mysql–php packages;network packet;node (computer science);numpy;operating system;pydev;pygame;python;real-time computing;real-time transcription;simulation;ubuntu;xampp	Yenumula B.

For the wireless network, a link-level truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme is deployed to reduce the packet losses visible to the transport layer protocol. Two discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) are introduced to analyze the network performance and the QoS of the TFRC protocol, in terms of wireless link utilization, flow throughput, packet loss rate, and probability of end-to-end delay exceeding a prescribed threshold. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the accuracy of the analytical results. It is concluded that the analytical results are useful for optimizing the system parameters, such as the interface buffer size and the maximum number of retransmissions of the truncated ARQ scheme. With the optimal parameters, wireless link utilization can be maximized, and the QoS requirements of multimedia applications can be statistically guaranteed	automatic repeat request;computation;computational complexity theory;data buffer;downtime;end-to-end principle;markov chain;markov model;network packet;network performance;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;requirement;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;truncated newton method	Hong Shen;Lin Cai;Xuemin Shen	2006	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2006.1638668	sliding window protocol;real-time computing;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;automatic control;transport layer;computer network	Mobile	2.0888570721632354	99.51918893963716	58879

9794a14e3808ea179f0d09291e8876144e909fee	measuring instability of mobility management in cellular networks		Communication in cellular networks is based on serving cells that provide the basic network service. In the real world, serving cells overlap which means the number of serving cells covering one position is usually more than one. Recently, the instability of mobility management in cellular networks has been studied to monitor and analyze the handoff process in mobile devices. However, the handoff process is actually produced by base stations instead of mobile devices. Hence, it is of great importance to measure the handoff process of mobility management from the base station side. In this article, we present a series of experiments performed using the data obtained by mobile network operators. The contributions of this study are three-fold. We reproduce a handoff process and handoff loop from both the mobile device level and the base station level, and confirm the existence of a handoff loop by measurements from the base station side. Through large-range measurements, we discover that only a small part of serving cells is involved in the handoff process, and in most cases, the number of candidate serving cells is much smaller than the number of cells that cover some position; namely, when a handoff loop occurs, the number of candidate serving cells is quite small, which is in contrast to our assumption. We confirm that the handoff loop often occurs in indoor conditions or when the mobile device has frequent communication with the base station. Finally, we present several comprehensive facts about the handoff process and handoff loop and provide suggestions that can be used to increase the quality of service of cellular networks.	experiment;instability;mobile device;mobile phone;quality of service	Xiaohui Zhao;Hanyang Ma;Yuan Jin;Jianguo Yao	2018	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2018.1700204	network service;handover;computer network;quality of service;mobile device;instability;computer science;base station;cellular network;mobility management	Mobile	11.351048004358658	99.49963032344932	58899

We examine a method of explicitly labelling blocks of data with sufficient information to allow processing of misordered data. Our labelling syntax for data blocks, which we call chunks, is cleaner and more general than that of other protocols. We show how chunks can be used for efficient fragmentation/reassembly and compare chunks with other fragmentation systems. End-to-end error detection is complex for chunks or other systems that allow both fragmentation and processing of misordered data. We show that it is possible to design an end-to-end error detection system that does not compromise chunk processing performance. Chunks can take advantage of processing techniques such as Integrated Layer Processing and can be used to implement concepts such as Application Layer Framing [CLAR 90].	application-layer framing;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;fragmentation (computing);framing (social sciences);segmentation and reassembly	David C.

d027921143cf08e280d7db7c36d2373802751d73	using lightly synchronized multipacket reception in machine-type communication networks		This paper proposes a new random access Medium Access Control protocol for Machine-Type Communication (MTC) systems, which applies MultiPacket Reception techniques to provide energy efficient interaction and extreme low latency (ELL) to MTC terminals (MTs). The protocol adapts the Hybrid-Network Diversity Multiple Access (H-NDMA) to run with MTs, increasing the energy saving opportunities by using a receiver tone to synchronize accesses. The MTs use power, space and the adaptive coding multiplexing capabilities of H-NDMA to improve the throughput and reduce delay. The paper analyses the scalability of the proposed system with large number of MTs per BS. It shows that ELL can be achieved by more MTs, as long as the total load is controlled. The performance was evaluated using simulations, focusing mainly in the system's delay and the probability to exceed a specified packet service time.	adaptive coding;computer terminal;minkowski portal refinement;multiplexing;network packet;overhead (computing);random access;scalability;simulation;synchronization (computer science);telecommunications link;throughput	Bruna V.

At the other are protocols that use local repair to overcome transient packet loss in the network, offering “best effort” reliability. Yet none of this prior work has treated stability of multicast delivery as a basic reliability property, such as might be needed in an internet radio, television, or conferencing application. This article looks at reliability with a new goal: development of a multicast protocol which is reliable in a sense that can be rigorously quantified and includes throughput stability guarantees. We characterize this new protocol as a “bimodal multicast” in reference to its reliability model, which corresponds to a family of bimodal probability distributions. Here, we introduce the protocol, provide a theoretical analysis of its behavior, review experimental results, and discuss some candidate applications. These confirm that bimodal multicast is reliable, scalable, and that the protocol provides remarkably stable delivery throughput.	best-effort delivery;multicast;network packet;scalability;throughput;virtual synchrony	Kenneth P.

The FACK algorithm is based on first principles of congestion control and is designed to be used with the proposed TCP SACK option. By decoupling congestion control from other algorithms such as data recovery, it attains more precise control over the data flow in the network. We introduce two additional algorithms to improve the behavior in specific situations. Through simulations we compare FACK to both Reno and Reno with SACK. Finally, we consider the potential performance and impact of FACK in the Internet.	acknowledgment index;algorithm;coupling (computer programming);data recovery;dataflow;internet;network congestion;simulation;tcp congestion control	Matthew Mathis;Jamshid Mahdavi	1996		10.1145/248156.248181	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;data flow diagram;tcp westwood plus;first principle;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;h-tcp;cubic tcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-3.1276816998526105	93.57564709487127	58976

However, most of the existing works overlook this fact by simplifying the spectrum whitespace assumption. In this paper, we study the joint routing and time-domain scheduling problem for Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) by considering the social behaviors of PUs. Our main contributions consist of four aspects. First, we analyze the social pattern of PUs based on two practical data traces. According to the obtained social pattern, the available spectrum whitespace is derived for SUs. Subsequently, in terms of previous analysis, we propose a centralized joint routing and time-domain scheduling framework with global provable ε-optimality (ε ϵ [0,1]) by employing the branch-and-bound technique, where ε indicates the expected closeness of our solution to the optimum solution. The solution of this centralized algorithm can serve as a theoretical benchmark for developing future routing and scheduling algorithms for CRNs. Third, we design a distributed primary behavior-aware routing and scheduling algorithm with local performance guarantee, where the routing and scheduling fairness, the available bandwidth, the potential interference, etc. are taken into account. Finally, simulation results confirm our assertion that primary behaviors have significant impacts on the spectrum whitespace, and demonstrate that primary-behavior-aware joint routing and scheduling design can utilize spectrum whitespace efficiently.	benchmark (computing);branch and bound;centrality;centralized computing;cognitive radio;distributed algorithm;fairness measure;interference (communication);provable prime;provable security;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;tracing (software)	Shouling Ji;Zhipeng Cai;Jing He;Raheem A.

These applications have specific end-to-end performance requirements from the network in order to have an acceptable performance. Currently the Internet is a best effort network which doesn't provide levels of service. There are many elements of an end-to-end network which are currently suitable to provide quality-of- service guaranties such as ATM links. Nevertheless, only with recent deployments of broadband access technologies and the introduction of Internet protocols such as RSVP, providing levels of service becomes feasible without the use expensive links to the customer site. This paper examines several network implementation options for introducing levels of service using cable modem access. Limitations imposed by the applications on the network as well as the contribution of the different network elements to level of service parameters such as end-to-end delay, throughput and jitter are examined. Concentration network architectures as well as proposed backbone configuration options for end-to-end level of service provisioning are presented. At the access network, provisioning of level of service using bandwidth control through packet throttling and through access network design providing excess bandwidth to customers are presented. HFC protocol dependent means to provide level of services including reservation and ATM based protocols are examined as well.© (1997) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

To minimize deviation from call blocking/dropping targets due to nonstationary call arrival condition, dynamic guard-based schemes with predictive adaptation control adjust differentiated capacity limits according to predicted future arrival rates based on specified estimation algorithms. Existing dynamic guard admission schemes are developed under the assumption of perfect estimation, which may not be possible in a highly nonstationary environment and, thus resulting in failures to maintain targeted blocking/dropping probabilities. This paper presents the fairly adjusted multimode-dynamic guard bandwidth scheme, which is a dynamic-guard-based scheme over code-division multiple-access systems with predictive adaptation control to adapt interference-based guard loading-limits under nonstationary call arrival condition; and reactive adaptation control to counteract arrival rate estimation errors. When the predictive adaptation control policy mode is not able to maintain long-term call blocking or dropping targets due to estimation error, this will trigger reactive adaptation control policy modes that include temporary blocking (preemption) of one or more lower priority classes subject to fairness constraints to ensure lower priority classes are not preempted at all costs during estimation error recovery. Analytical and simulation results show that proposed scheme is able to provide performance guarantees in terms of dropping probabilities under nonstationary traffic arrival and imperfect arrival rate estimation.	algorithm;blocking (computing);ftc fair information practice;fairness measure;fuzzy associative matrix;hash table;interference (communication);johnson–nyquist noise;local variable;noise power;noise reduction;numerical analysis;preemption (computing);probability current;process gain;queueing theory;right-to-left;simulation;state diagram;state transition table;x.690	Oliver Yu;Emir Saric;Anfei Li	2006	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2005.862403	shared resource;code division multiple access;markov chain;real-time computing;adaptive control;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;estimation theory;model predictive control;statistics;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Metrics	10.969851094103367	101.29697970376577	59468

In other words, the network needs to convert some of its capacity into mobility. We develop an analytical model to evaluate the efficiency of the mobility/capacity conversion processes of several wireless networks. One practical implication of our results is that a network, if designed correctly, should have a free convertibility between the two.	network architecture;network packet;quality of service	Chin-Tau A.

In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff of PPPMux between multiplexing efficiency and delay. In various operating environ- ments considering maximum PPPMux frame size and input traffic rate, the performance of PPPMux is evaluated. It is shown that link utilization can be increased by using large PPPMux frame size, while multiplexing delay is tightly bounded below maximum waiting time.

This growth is expected to continue unabated as mobile data traffic is predicted to grow anywhere from 20 to 50 times over the next 5 years. Exacerbating the problem is that such unprecedented surge in smartphones usage, which is characterized by frequent short on/off connections and mobility, generates heavy signaling traffic load in the network """"signaling storms"""". This consumes a disproportion amount of network resources, compromising network throughput and efficiency, and in extreme cases can cause the cellular networks to crash. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which comprise a combination of macro-cell base stations and low-cost low-power small cell (SC) base stations operating over both licensed (e.g., femto and picocells) and unlicensed (e. g., WiFi access points) bands, have recently emerged as a viable solution to cope with such unprecedented mobile traffic growth. While deploying large number of SCs close to users will certainly help to solve the radio access network's (RAN) capacity and coverage problem, however, there is a significant price to pay - HetNets create a new challenge for the backhaul. The key challenge is how to provide cost-effective, scalable and flexible mobile backhaul solution to connect SCs to the mobile core network. The purpose of this paper is to propose and devise a cost-effective PON-based HetNet mobile backhaul RAN architecture that: 1) leverages existing fibered and powered facilities associated with a PON-based fiber-to-the-Node/ Home (FTTN/FTTH) residential access network; 2) enables, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the support of efficient ground-breaking mobile data and signaling offload techniques, which significantly enhance the performance of both the LTE-A-based HetNet RAN and mobile core network (Evolved Packet Core (EPC) per 3GPP standard), ensure that core network equipment is used more productively, and moderate the evolving signaling growth and optimize its impact."""	backhaul (telecommunications);cell (microprocessor);cell signaling;compaq lte;control plane;distributed control system;electronic product code;fiber to the x;low-power broadcasting;network architecture;overhead (computing);passive optical network;radio access network;scalability;smart device;smartphone;software deployment;tablet computer;throughput;wireless access point	Shahab Hussain;Syed Rashid Zaidi;Ajaz Sana;Mohamed A.

This very promising access technology has been designed to support numerous kinds of applications having different traffic characteristics. One of the QoS parameters considered by the standard for traffic classes is the maximum sustained traffic rate (MSTR), which is an upper bound for user throughput. Taking into account MSTR implies the implementation of a throttling scheduling policy that regulates the user peak rate. Our models take into account this policy and provides closed-form expressions giving all the required performance parameters for each traffic profile at a click speed. The model is compared with extensive simulations that show its accuracy and robustness.	assistive technology;performance evaluation;robustness (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Sébastien Doirieux;Bruno Baynat;Masood Maqbool;Marceau Coupechoux	2009	2009 7th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks	10.1109/WIOPT.2009.5291626	wimax;throughput;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;markov process;upper and lower bounds;steady state;computer network	Mobile	3.6046067804692816	97.54061001089119	59706

Existing queueing analys is works in underlay CR networks failed to discuss packets hete rogeneity. Therefore high priority packets with impatient waiting time that have preemptive transmission opportunities overlow class are investigated. We model the system behavior as a M/M/1+GI queue which is represented by a two dimensional state transition graph. The reneging probability of high priority packets and the average waiting time in two-class priority queues is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the avera ge waiting time of high priority packets decreases with the growing interference power threshold and the average waiting time o f the low priority packet is proportional to the arrival rate o f the high priority packet. This work may lay the foundation to design efficient MAC protocols and optimize long term system performance by carefully choosing system parameters. I. I NTRODUCTION Spectrum resources have rapidly become scarcity in recent years with the explosive growing number of wireless communication devices. However, some spectrums have not been fully utilized due to the exclusive spectrum usage in dedicated application scenarios [1]. Cognitive Radio (CR) [2] is a promising technology to solve the spectrum underutilization problem and to mitigate the spectrum scarcity. It has been paid much attention ever since the year 2000. With the capability to sense, detect and access the frequency ban ds that are not being occupied currently, CR technology allows secondary users (SUs) (or unlicensed users) to exploit thos e spectrum bands which are unused by primary users (PUs) (or licensed users) in an opportunistic manner [3]. SUs grouped together can form both infrastructure based networks [4] an d ad-hoc networks such as cognitive vehicular networks [5]. CR networks (CRNs) can be classified into three main categories by the differentiation of spectrum utilization met hodology. Namely, they are overlay approach, interweave approac h and underlay approach [6]. For the overlay approach, SUs utilize the same spectrum of PUs but only use a portion of power for secondary transmissions and the remainder power to assist PUs’ transmissions. This is usually difficult to be implemented due to the sophisticated coding and power split ting methods. For the interweave approach, SUs can only utilize the bandwidth which is not currently being occupied by PUs and when PUs come back, SUs should vacate the channel immediately. This approach is used by users in an opportunistically manner and is not suitable for time criti al communications. Finally, for the underlay approach, SUs ar e authorized to use the same spectrum occupied by PUs provided the interference power to PUs are within a threshold that PUs could tolerate. Underlay approach is used in numerous situations. For example, by deploying femto-cells underly ing macro-cells, it is beneficial for enhancing the coverage of indoor communications as well as increasing system capacit y [7]. In cognitive vehicular networks, vehicles act as SUs [8 ] can concurrently communicate with PUs along the roadside such that the interference powers to PUs are controlled. The refore, in this paper we mainly focus on the underlay approach. In CR networks, queueing based model can be used for cognitive system engineering [9] such as spectrum scheduli ng, admission controller design and so on. Only a few papers have addressed the queueing behavior in underlay CRNs, for instance, transmission delay, packet blocked probability and so on [10] [11] [12] [13]. The authors in [10] analyzed the performance of the CRN such as average packet transmission time, system throughput, average waiting time, average que ue length etc. However, they assumed that all packets are homogeneous. In [11], M/G/1 queueing model was used to analyze the system performance which was similar as [10]. Both [10] and [11] assumed the time-out waiting time was fixed, which couldn’t reflect the randomness of impatience time. A M/D/1 queueing model was employed by [12] to analyze the performance of both PUs’ and SUs’ packets in an overlay CRN model, not in underlay CRNs. Meanwhile, the failure to explo it the packets’ heterogeneity limits its applicability. Simu lation results of [12] showed that the average waiting time of PUs grew with the number of PUs. Cooperative communication was adopted by [13] and the queueing characteristics were illustrated in the overlay CRNs. In most recent work, [14] studied the stability of transmission throughput in cooper ative CRNs with multicast. What makes this paper distinct from [15] is that in [15] PUs possessed preemptive priority over SUs while in this paper, preemptive priority is owned by high priority packets over low priority packets in the SU network . Almost all the preceding literatures fail to take into accou nt the heterogeneity priority of packets in underlay CRNs, whi ch are not suitable for scenarios when there are heterogeneous packets in the SU network. In reality, considering a cognitive vehicular network wher e both time critical and periodic messages coexist, safety re lated messages are much more urgent than non-safety related messages. Hence safety related messages should be granted with higher priority and be transmitted first while recreati onal or conventional messages should be processed afterwards. On the battle field [16], when soldiers act as SUs moving among surveillance sensors, the messages sent by soldiers should be immediately handled prior to messages sent from static sensors. Since existing methods are not applicable t o the above scenarios, we attempt to fill the gap between queueing analysis and heterogeneous priority packets’ transmissio n in the underlay CR network. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. We model the network as a M/M/1+GI queueing system with two-class priority queues and generally indepe ndently distributed impatient waiting time. Packets in the h igh priority queue have preemptive priority to be transmitted b y the cognitive transmitting node. While low priority packet s are permitted to transmit when the high priority queue is empty. Then we employ a two dimensional state transition graph to imitate the system queueing behavior. By solving th e balanced equations of state transition graph for the two-cl ass priority queues, we analyze the queueing performances such as average queueing delay, reneging probability, and system i dle probability on the two queues through simulations. This wor k may lay the foundation of future cognitive communication system designs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is t he first time to study the queueing characteristics of an underl ay CRN with heterogenous priority transmission packets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, system model is presented including queueing, chan nel and impatience sub models . To model the system behavior, Section III illustrates a two dimensional state transition graph to imitate the stable state of the system. In Section IV, the queueing characteristics of the two class high priority and low priority queues are presented. Simulation results are show n in Section V and we conclude this paper in Section VI. II. SYSTEM MODEL In this section, we present the system model as shown in Fig. 1. There is one SU transmission node SUTX and one SU receive nodeSURX . PUTX is primary transmission node which is omitted in the figure andPURX is the primary receive node. Two-class priority queues are deployed in the system. One is a high priority (or class-1) queue the other is low priority (or class-2) queue. Without loss of generali ty, we assume the capacity of the two queues are infinite. Also, we will give numerical analysis when the queues are finite due to storage limitations. In this model, the high priority queue has preemptive priority over the low priority queue. That is, whenever there are class-1 packets in the system, class-2 packets cannot be served. When one class-1 packet arrives and meanwhile one class-2 packet is being transmitt ed by SUTX , the class-2 packet will immediately cease its transmission and come back to the head of class-2 queue. Then the transmission node SUTX will serve the coming class-1 packet. The previous assumption is meaningful. For example , in a cognitive vehicular network [8] when collision warning information [17] are concurrently transmitted with period ic location related messages [18] [19], the warning messages should have preemptive priority to be spread out over the location based messages. In this way, roadway safety could be improved. A. Queueing Model In the system, the arrival process of class-1 packets follows Poisson distribution with mean value λ 1 and the arrival process of class-2 packets follows Poisson distrib ution with parameterλ2. Both of the two kinds packets’ arrival processes are independent identically distributed ( i.i.d.). The high priority packets have impatient time tout which follows general distribution [20] such as Poisson distribution, Be rnoulli Fig. 1: System model for two-class queue underlay CRN distribution with parameterγ. If the class-1 packet fails to be transmitted bySUTX node within waiting timetout, then it will renege from the current queue and search for other available channels to transmit. Since there have been numer ous literatures concerning on spectrum handoffs in CRNs, how to perform spectrum handoff is out of the scope of this paper. The system presented in this paper can be viewed as one part of a very large cognitive radio network. Let μi, i ∈ {1, 2} denote the service rate of SUTX , which follows exponential distribution. Among each of the two cla ss queues, FCFS queueing rule is adopted. The SUTX in the system is the only transmission node. Therefore the system shown in Fig. 1 is a two-class M/M/1+GI queueing model, where GI is the tim	artificial intelligence;authorization;coexist (image);cognitive radio;finite-state machine;hoc (programming language);ibm system i;interference (communication);message queue;multicast;network packet;network scheduler;numerical analysis;performance;preemption (computing);priority queue;queueing theory;queuing delay;randomness;semantic network;sensor;simulation;spectrum analyzer;state diagram;state transition table;superuser;systems engineering;throughput;time complexity;transmitter;xfig	Long Chen;Liusheng Huang;Hongli Xu;Yang Du	2016	Int.

In this paper, we studied the capacity of a wireless network for broadcast. Previous studies on broadcast capacity either assume that all links in the wireless network has the same channel capacity, or assume that the transmission ranges of a wireless node can be arbitrarily large. In this paper we derive analytical upper bounds and lower bounds on broadcast capacity of a wireless network when all nodes in the network has the same bounded transmission power P and all nodes are placed in a square of side-length a. When the fixed data rate channel is used (each node can send W bits/second to nodes within its transmission range if no interference happened), we prove that the broadcast capacity is Theta(W) under the physical interference model. When the Gaussian channel capacity is used, we show that the total broadcast capacity is only Theta((alpharadic(log n/n))-beta) when alpharadic(log n/n) rarr infin. When a alpharadic(log n/n) rarr O(1), we show that the broadcast capacity is Theta(1). We also generalize our results to multicast capacity for physical interference model.	additive white gaussian noise;channel capacity;data rate units;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);multicast;quantum capacity;randomness;uncompressed video;unicast	Xiang-Yang Li;Jizhong Zhao;Yanwei Wu;Shaojie Tang;XiaoHua Xu;XuFei Mao	2008	2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660015	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;computer network	Mobile	14.990168056077152	88.76681155094988	59850

Available works in this area mainly focused on exploring the order sense scaling laws of throughput capacity in MANETs with omnidirectional antennas or that of static ad hoc networks with directional antennas. Although the order sense results can help us to understand the general scaling behaviors, it tells us little about the exact throughput capacity. Another limitation of available works is that the impact of transmission power constraint on the throughput capacity is largely neglected. In most MANET applications, however, the mobile nodes are usually powered by batteries and have limited transmission power. In this paper, we study the exact throughput capacity of MANETs with directional antenna and transmission power constraint, where a generalized twohop relay algorithm with limited packet redundancy is adopted for packet routing. For given transmission power constraint, we first develop a model to map the omnidirectional transmission range to that of the directional one. We then explore the exact throughput capacity under directional transmission and group-based scheduling. Finally, numerical studies are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of these models and validate our theoretical results.	algorithm;fractal antenna;hoc (programming language);image scaling;network packet;numerical analysis;relay;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Yin Chen;Jiajia Liu;Xiaohong Jiang;Osamu Takahashi;Norio Shiratori	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388179	vehicular ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;engineering;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	13.54864943581221	88.95759840171011	59931
09721f28e6bcaa131e24ee8c0d2625d42dbd639b	measurement-based scheduler for multi-class qoe optimization in wireless networks		Traditional wireless schedulers have been driven by rate-based criteria, e.g., utility maximizing/proportionally fair, and/or queue-based packet schedulers which do not directly reflect the Quality of Experience (QoE) associated with flow-based transactions and services. This paper proposes, a Measurement-Based Delay Optimal (MBDO) scheduler, which optimizes a cost function of the mean flow delays in a multi-class system, e.g,. web interactive, file downloads, etc. In this context the cost function expresses desired trade-offs amongst traffic classes reflecting heterogeneous QoE sensitivities which are nonlinear in the flow delays and/or system loads. To achieve optimality, MBDO scheduling uses measured system variables and knowledge (or measurement) of class flow-size distributions to adapt a weighted Gittins index scheduler. We show that under mild assumptions, and in a stationary regime, that MBDO scheduling is indeed asymptotically optimal. Perhaps more importantly, MBDO schedulers can self-optimize by adapting to slowly varying traffic loads, mixes and flow size distributions. Our extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness at realizing trade-offs and performance of the proposed approach.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;cycle (graph theory);expanded memory;job stream;linear inequality;loss function;mathematical optimization;network packet;nonlinear system;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);simulation;social inequality;stationary process;web traffic	Arjun Anand;Gustavo de Veciana	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057014	computer network;proportionally fair;gittins index;asymptotically optimal algorithm;wireless network;scheduling (computing);real-time computing;distributed computing;computer science;quality of experience;network packet;queue	Networks	-1.6005384506968496	94.30504298148266	59935

Recently, the packet scheduling has become again a challenging topic due to the massive use of wireless technologies (e.g. WiFi, LTE, 4G/5G) with which to provide high QoS guarantees is still an open problem. Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare different solutions and actually test them in order to select the most proper packet scheduler for each particular environment. In this paper we present TEMPEST, a new Test EnvironMent for Performance Evaluation of the Scheduling of packeTs, which is a novel tool able to help the research in the packet scheduling field. TEMPEST is able to measure the actual performance of a packet scheduler in several environments, both wired or wireless, like the execution time, QoS metrics and throughput, giving prompt feedback about the quality of the solution studied. The goal of this paper is to present in detail the current features of TEMPEST, showing how it is easy to add, configure, test and evaluate several scheduling solutions in multiple scenarios.	performance evaluation;scheduling (computing);tempest	Maurizio Casoni;Carlo Augusto Grazia;Paolo Valente	2014	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2014.10.005	fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;real-time computing;simulation;quality of service;performance;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;computer network	Metrics	3.6596978098835966	94.71645167472887	60194

Several works have tried to solve this problem by introducing mechanisms such as packet fragmentation, backoff adaptation, or packet aggregation during a fixed time interval. In this paper, we propose a novel approach solving the performance anomaly problem by packet aggregation using a dynamic time interval, which depends on the busy time of the wireless medium. Our solution differs from other proposition in the literature because of this dynamic time interval, which allows increasing fairness, reactivity, and in some cases efficiency. In this article, we emphasize the performance evaluation of our proposal.	anomaly detection;backoff;fairness measure;fragmentation (computing);network packet;performance evaluation;reactive programming;retransmission (data networks)	Tahiry Razafindralambo;Isabelle Guérin Lassous;Luigi Iannone;Serge Fdida	2006		10.1145/1164717.1164761	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	3.581046796687309	95.74547217501623	60226

As a consequence, short-lived TCP-incast traffic suffers repeated losses that often lead to loss recovery via timeout. Because the minimum retransmission timeout (minRTO) in most TCP implementations is fixed to around 200ms, interactive applications that often generate short-lived incast traffic tend to suffer unnecessarily long delays waiting for the timeout to elapse. The best and most direct solution to such problem would be to customize the minRTO to match DCNs delays, however, this is not always possible; in particular in public data centers where multiple tenants, with various versions of TCP, co-exist. In this paper, we propose to achieve the same result by using techniques and technologies that are already available in most commodity switches and data centers and that do not interfere with the tenant’s virtual machines or TCP protocol. In this approach, we rely on the programmable nature of SDN switches and design an SDN-based Incast Congestion Control (SICC) framework that uses an SDN network application in the controller and a shim-layer in the host hypervisor to mitigate incast congestion. We demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed scheme via real deployment in a small-scale testbed as well as ns2 simulation experiments in networks of various sizes and settings. Ahmed M.

The SINR model more accurately describes link connectivity than the traditionally used disk model in the real-world. We first assess the network connectivity by measuring the conductance of the network and find the bottleneck location of the network, and then deploy a relay node to improve the connectivity at the bottleneck. A partition algorithm is proposed to address the first problem, and an optimization problem is proposed to address the relay node deployment problem. The relay node deployment problem is solved by using approximate convex optimization models, and the approximation performance is analyzed. Simulation results show that the partition algorithm based on the SINR model identifies the network bottleneck more accurately than the previous methods based on the binary model. It also verifies that the relay node can significantly relieve the bottleneck and make the network more tightly knit.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;conductance (graph);convex optimization;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;relay;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment	Maggie Xiaoyan Cheng;Yi Ling;Brian M.

The Limited and Weighted Round Robin (LWRR) algorithm dynamically adjusts the resource allocation to each master-slave pair according to the queue status. In this paper we propose an improved LWRR (ILWRR) scheduling algorithm which effectively combines the LWRR and bin packing algorithm. Computer simulation reveals that slot utilization is increased up to about 50% compared to the round robin algorithm. The proposed ILWRR scheduling is effective for not only basic data transmission but also real-time multimedia data transmission.	bin packing problem;bluetooth;scheduling (computing);set packing;weighted round robin	Eung Ju Lee;Hee Yong Youn	2006		10.1007/11751632_20	computer simulation;fair-share scheduling;embedded system;bin packing problem;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;deficit round robin;operating system;scheduling;weighted round robin	Theory	2.6563336602756387	103.29181351829853	60276

Specifically, we use the fractionally integrated autoregressive-moving average (FARIMA) process with non-Gaussian white driving sequence to describe packet arrival rate in a unit time. We introduce a procedure to estimate the fractional differencing parameter and ARMA coefficients: this procedure use a cepstrum approach and does not require any prior knowledge about the driving noise distribution and the type of ARMA system. Since the main purpose of workload modeling is to aid in network performance evaluations, we are particularly interested in using the FARIMA model to predict bandwidth requirements for network traffic. We propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation strategy by employing linear predictors designed based on the estimated FARIMA parameters.	autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;cepstrum;coefficient;network packet;network performance;network traffic control;queueing theory;requirement	Jacek Ilow	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.860234	local area network;econometrics;simulation;telecommunications;heavy-tailed distribution;computer science;yttrium;cepstrum;predictive modelling;moving average;estimation theory;network performance;packet switching;statistics;dynamic bandwidth allocation;bandwidth allocation	Networks	-1.9709732203840487	99.41394162095405	60382

For the case that the conditions do not hold, we obtain suboptimal solutions which perform strictly better than the optimal constant one. We then investigate optimality restricted to classes of policies with specific constraints. We adopt the parametric optimization approach which entails cost minimization for a given parameterized policy and selection of the best policy among a class.

To reduce the overhead of control frames, only the schedule information of STAs that wake up at current Beacon interval (BI) is embedded in TIM. The mobile stations (STAs) learn their service time from TIM and choose an energy efficient way to retrieve the downlink data. The protocol is designed to meet different delay requirements of different applications, not just focused on minimizing the average delay of the network. And the Early Deadline First (EDF) strategy is applied on AP to guarantee the delay bound of data frames. We also find the maximal traffic load which the network can bear to guarantee that all the data flow can be scheduled within one schedule cycle. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that our protocol presents a better performance than IEEE 802.11 and other protocols not only in energy efficiency but also in delay performance of data packets.	telecommunications link	Changxiao Zhao;Zhijun Li;Ying Xiong	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.7.1747-1755	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	2.8125475063733156	94.65802101064521	60506

However, they require executing label rewriting and dropping decision on a per-packet basis, thus preventing them from being widely deployed. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on CSFQ without per-packet labelling. Similarly, we distinguish between edge routers and core routers. Edge routers maintain the per-flow state by employing a fair queuing mechanism to allocate each flow a fair bandwidth share locally and a token bucket mechanism to regulate those flows with feedback packets sent from egress edge routers. Core routers do not maintain per-flow state; they use FIFO packet scheduling extended by a fare rate alarm mechanism by estimating the arrival rate and the number of flows using a matching–mismatching algorithm. The novel scheme is called core-stateless fair rate estimation fair queuing (CSFREFQ). CSFREFQ is proven to be capable of achieving max–min fairness. Furthermore, we present and discuss simulations and experiments on the performance under different traffic scenarios.

The proposed traffic controller consists of two main parts: fuzzy connection admission controller (FCAC) and intelligent usage parameter controller (IUPC). The FCAC, for all incoming connections, estimates the required bandwidth and then decides whether to accept or reject them. Simulation results show that the proposed FCAC increases the accuracy of required capacity estimation in comparison with other fuzzy and non-fuzzy bandwidth estimation methods. The IUPC is responsible for monitoring and regulating the input traffic stream after the FCAC accepts the connection. This is achieved by employing a fuzzy controller with the main goal of dynamically tuning the leaky rate based on the state of the traffic source. The necessary control actions are taken based on accurate estimation of the mean cell rate in real time. To exploit the benefits of statistical multiplexing gain, the IUPC in our FLC approach uses a network congestion internal feedback to make a decision as to whether to discard or tag the violating cells. To highlight the merit of the proposed method, different experimental simulations are performed. It is observed that the proposed FLC traffic controller not only has a high statistical multiplexing gain but also can protect quality of services (QoS) of well behaving connections much better than traditional traffic controllers.

Standard protocols have been shown to fail in addressing this issue and some possible solutions are being proposed, but despite the difficulty of correctly modeling the channel dynamics, most work on Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for real-time vehicular communications has been performed under simulated environments. This poster presents an overview of MAC mechanisms capable of providing deterministic vehicular communications and assesses the requirements a communications device must include in order to allow the implementation of these mechanisms. It also proposes a flexible hardware architecture providing enhanced support to MAC real-time mechanisms, thus promoting the development of novel deterministic MAC protocols.	access control;communications protocol;design rationale;real-time clock;requirement;technical standard	Cristóvão Cruz;Arnaldo S.

However, in wireless networks, the consideration of properties at the physical layer is important to improve system performance. Hence, in this paper, we study an opportunistic scheduling and adaptive modulation problem for wireless networks with network coding, which is a joint problem for MAC and physical layers. A similar problem was studied in [1] considering an idealized system in which the data rate of each link is modeled with the Shannon capacity. They showed that to maximize the throughput of a transmission, the optimal subset of native packets that are encoded within a coded packet should be selected based on the channel condition at the destination for each native packet. Moreover, they also showed that it may not be the optimal selection to encode all possible native packets within a coded packet. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model than that of [1] with practical modulation schemes such as M-PSK and MQAM. We show that the optimal policy that maximizes the throughput of a transmission is to encode all available native packets within a coded packet regardless of the channel condition at the destination for each native packet, which is a different conclusion from that of [1]. However, we show that adaptive modulation, in which its constellation size in a coded packet is adjusted based on the channel condition of each destination node, provides a higher throughput than the scheme with fixed modulation, in which its constellation size is always fixed regardless of the channel condition at each destination node.	adaptive grammar;channel capacity;data rate units;encode;linear network coding;modulation;network packet;pre-shared key;routing;scheduling (computing);tls-psk;throughput	Seong-Lyong Gong;Byung-Gook Kim;Jang-Won Lee	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073742	ring network;linear network coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;network scheduler;maximum throughput scheduling;computer performance;packet loss;packet switch;computer network	Mobile	14.040460223006095	93.1615155153573	60776

For fixed size packets it is known that a basic void-avoiding schedule (VAS) can vastly outperform a more classical pre-reservation algorithm as FCFS. In this contribution we propose two novel forward-looking algorithms, WAS and XAS, that outperform VAS in the setting of a uniform distributed packet size and a restricted buffer size. This paper presents results obtained by Monte Carlo simulation, showing that improvements of more than (20%) in packet loss in specific settings are obtainable. In other settings and for other performance measures similar improvements are within reach.

In this paper; we evaluate multimedia communications capability of one of the PCS standards, Personal Access Communications System’s (PACS) packet channel (PPC) using simulation modeling. The performance of PPC’s slot aggregation and data-sense multiple access techniques are studied by considering the downlii and uplink in a single cell and combined uplink/ downhnk in two cells and changing various parameters such as the number of users and certain protocol parameters. Interconnection of PPC with the Internet is discussed next. Frame rates of MPEG-1 coded images transmitted in a PACS cell as IP datagrams are determined. Handover characteristics of PPC downlink are studied by changing different parameters such as the cell size, the speed of the mobile host and time between handovers. The results clearly establish that multimedia communication on PPC is only feasible at lower bandwidths and frame rates and only a few users per cell can be supported. Careful tuning of PPC protocol parameters are required. There is one parameter whose variation gives opposite results on the downlink and uplink.	datagram;interconnection;internet;mpeg-1;network packet;picture archiving and communication system;simulation;telecommunications link	Yukio Hashimoto;Behçet Sarikaya;Mehmet Ulema	1997		10.1145/262116.262138	feature-driven development;embedded system;test-driven development;real-time computing;computer science;handover;operating system;simulation modeling;picture archiving and communication system;mobile computing;time division multiple access;computer network	Networks	3.690173853476494	98.95675798682146	61369

We propose model for jitter on one node, as well as for end-to-end jitter with IPP traffic on network nodes. Our model describes jitter behavior with respect to phase probabilities, traffic load, and tagged traffic share in aggregate traffic flow. We conclude that jitter for IPP is heavily dependent on phase probabilities, and larger than jitter for Poisson process, as one limit case of IPP. End-to-end jitter always takes values between first node jitter value and sum of individual jitter values on each node. We offer more precise evaluation of these values, which also leads to some fast-to-compute approximations for limit cases of phase probabilities and traffic load. We propose our results as guidelines for jitter evaluation for real IP traffic.	aggregate data;approximation algorithm;concave function;end-to-end principle;interrupt;network congestion;numerical method	Adnan Huremovic;Mesud Hadzialic;Fatima Skaka	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906379	traffic generation model;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Metrics	-1.3490567053589668	97.611899204	61437

By modeling primary user activities and secondary user block fading channels as finite state Markov chains, the transmission rate adaptation problem of each secondary user is formulated as a general-sum dynamic Markovian game with a delay constraint. Assumptions are given so that the Nash equilibrium transmission policy of each user is a randomized mixture of pure threshold policies. We also present a stochastic approximation algorithm which can adaptively estimate the Nash equilibrium policies and track such policies for non-stationary problems where the statistics of the channel and user parameters evolve with time.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;interrupt latency;markov chain;nash equilibrium;numerical method;randomized algorithm;stationary process;stochastic approximation;monotone	Jane W.

Given a multi-hop network topology, connection demands and routes, we model the working of 802.11 MAC in DCF mode to find good approximations to average MAC layer losses, service times and carried load. The model is defined as an implicit function amongst the variables in the model and solved using a fixed point approach. Further, using Automatic Differentiation (AD) on the implicit function, we perform sensitivity analysis and use it in an optimization framework.

We compare Tahoe and Reno TCP, the two most common reference implementations for TCP, with two modified versions of Reno TCP. The first version is New-Reno TCP, a modified version of TCP without SACK that avoids some of Reno TCP's performance problems when multiple packets are dropped from a window of data. The second version is SACK TCP, a conservative extension of Reno TCP modified to use the SACK option being proposed in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). We describe the congestion control algorithms in our simulated implementation of SACK TCP and show that while selective acknowledgments are not required to solve Reno TCP's performance problems when multiple packets are dropped, the absence of selective acknowledgments does impose limits to TCP's ultimate performance. In particular, we show that without selective acknowledgments, TCP implementations are constrained to either retransmit at most one dropped packet per round-trip time, or to retransmit packets that might have already been successfully delivered.	algorithm;network congestion;network packet;selective repeat arq;simulation	Kevin R.

abcfd2ec828347c32bbb0e611ea2bd73bf6d81bb	frameless aloha with reliability-latency guarantees		One of the novelties brought by 5G is that wireless system design has increasingly turned its focus on guaranteeing reliability and latency. This shifts the design objective of random access protocols from throughput optimization towards constraints based on reliability and latency. For this purpose, we use frameless ALOHA, which relies on successive interference cancellation (SIC), and derive its exact finite-length analysis of the statistics of the unresolved users (reliability) as a function of the contention period length (latency). The presented analysis can be used to derive the reliability-latency guarantees. We also optimize the scheme parameters in order to maximize the reliability within a given latency. Our approach represents an important step towards the general area of design and analysis of access protocols with reliability-latency guarantees.	approximation;bell laboratories layered space-time;channel (communications);computer performance;explicit modeling;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;random access;simplified instructional computer;systems design;throughput	Cedomir Stefanovic;Francisco Lázaro Blasco;Petar Popovski	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254242	design objective;latency (engineering);computer network;throughput;single antenna interference cancellation;aloha;systems design;wireless;computer science;random access	Embedded	17.15705526231579	95.1777050985343	61635
e1a2ea09a334f010757982c29bbc70272ddae675	traffic offloading in unlicensed spectrum for 5g cellular network: a two-layer game approach		Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) is considered one of the latest groundbreaking innovations to provide high performance in future 5G. Coexistence schemes such as Listen Before Talk (LBT) and Carrier Sensing and Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) have been proven to be good methods to share spectrums, and they are WiFi friendly. In this paper, a modified LBT-based CSAT scheme is proposed which can effectively reduce the collision at the moment when Long Term Evolution (LTE) starts to transmit data in CSAT mode. To make full use of the valuable spectrum resources, the throughput of both LAA and WiFi systems should be improved. Thus, a two-layer Coalition-Auction Game-based Transaction (CAGT) mechanism is proposed in this paper to optimize the performance of the two systems. In the first layer, a coalition among Access Points (APs) is built to balance the WiFi stations and maximize the WiFi throughput. The main idea of the devised coalition forming is to merge the light-loaded APs with heavy-loaded APs into a coalition; consequently, the data of the overloaded APs can be offloaded to the light-loaded APs. Next, an auction game between the LAA and WiFi systems is used to gain a win–win strategy, in which, LAA Base Station (BS) is the auctioneer and AP coalitions are bidders. Thus, the throughput of both systems are improved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme in this paper can improve the performance of both two systems effectively.	coexist (image);compaq lte;simulation;throughput	Yan Li;Shaoyi Xu	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20020088	throughput;mathematical optimization;collision;spectrum management;merge (version control);mathematics;computer network;base station;cellular network;database transaction	HPC	23.71489367533199	92.02409239632321	61637

Understanding chain behavior is critical in order to build effective higher layer protocols. This paper examines the problem of how MAC level interactions influence chain behavior in a general multi-hop wireless network where multiple chains coexist. We first classify chains based on the MAC interactions observed between its hops when there is no external traffic. Then we identify the interactions across two interfering chains for the most common categories of chains. We study the probability of occurrence, and estimate the effect of MAC interactions on the performance of the chains. We also show that different chains exhibit different transmission patterns; this is an effect that is necessary for accurately estimating chain performance. We observe that destructive interactions arise more frequently among two interfering chains than they do within a single chain. Moreover, chains that have hidden terminals due to self-interference are more prone to have cross-chain hidden terminals. Thus, both intra-chain as well as cross-chain interactions, ultimately provide significant insight into how chains interact.	capture effect;coexist (image);emergence;hop;interaction;interference (communication);pipeline (computing);routing;throughput;transmission (bittorrent client);two-port network	Vinay Kolar;Saquib Razak;Nael B.

However, even though the broadcast traffic has the nature of dynamic changes, most previous research efforts were elaborated upon the premise of static workloads and access patterns without having proper traffic awareness. In this paper, we address the existence of client impatience and accordingly devise an on-line traffic awareness mechanism based on a novel selective deferment and reflection techniqu e (SDR) to estimate the dynamic workloads and access patterns in a granularity of a broadcast cycle. In comparison with prior probing and feedback approaches, our design is of practical usefulness in that it has low complexity and is light-weight without performance degradation. With vario us dynamic traffic scenarios, the experimental results show th at with an increasing/decreasing workload, the real access fr equency distribution is bounded by two specific estimated dis tributions. This fact in turn suggests us to employ a trigono metric tuning method to further enhance the estimation. In addition, we examine that the mean difference between the estimated access frequency distribution and the real one is very small, consequently indicating the feasibility and re liability of our proposed data broadcast mechanism with traffic awareness.	broadcasting (networking);datacasting;dynamic data;etsi satellite digital radio;elegant degradation;limbo;online and offline;performance tuning;profiling (computer programming);scalability;variometer	Chih-Lin Hu;Ming-Syan Chen	2002		10.1109/ICDCS.2002.1022248	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-4.441694095323773	92.23315367502033	61731

However, it is difficult to measure short-interval-traffic volumes because there are complications in collecting short-interval-traffic data from routers. An example is a heavy load on routers or inaccurate measurement by the short-polling interval; it even demands expensive measurement tools. To resolve these disadvantages, an estimating method of short-interval-traffic distribution (EMSIT) has been proposed. This method estimates short-interval-traffic distributions using MIB (Management Information Base) data, which collects traffic volumes in cycles of several minutes. In this paper, we propose a new estimation method (EMSIT-LD) based on EMSIT, which applies to the case of long-term-traffic dynamics.

b8d72b9542196a4971b45917a9279406fdb6cc0f	handover in a micro-cell packet switched mobile network	packet switched;transport layer;mobile network	"""This paper proposes a distributed handover protocol for a micro-cell packet switched mobile network. In such a network, users move from one cell to another very often, and each change of location may result in misrouted and lost packets. The purpose of the new protocol is to minimize these consequences of location changes: as long as a mobile moves from one cell to another but stays in the same region, the protocol avoids loss of packets and preserves order of transmission. Thus it increases the performance of the transport layer protocol by minimizing the need to retransmit packets. 1. I n t r o d u c t i o n The personal communication systems (PCS) [1] and digital networks are redefining the communication paradigm for mobile users. The radio in the PCS (also referred to as mobile) communicates with a network of base stations. The base stations are connected using local, metropolitan, or wide area networks. All the communication to / f rom a mobile takes place via a base station based on the geographic vicinity. The mobile user may move from geographic vicinity of its current base station to a different base station while communication is in progress. This change in location requires: 1) termination of the communication with the current base station, 2) establishment of communication with the new base station and 3) a change in the L A N / W A N routing to reflect the new base station. This process is known as handover. Since the handover requires termination and re-establishment of communications and change in network routing, it may result in loss, duplication, and misordering of packets. The performance of end-to-end transport protocols degrades significantly in presence of handover when the handover results in the loss of packets. This fact has been well documented in the literature [2-4]. For example, the TCP protocol cannot discriminate between packets dropped due to hand-offs and those dropped due to congestion in one or more network resources. As a result, TCP invokes congestion recovery process when packets are lost during handoffs. The work in [2] details results based on the measurement of performance of TCP in presence of handover. They show that if the data and acknowledgment packets are lost during the handover, a full transmission window worth of packets may be lost during each handover leading to reduction in the conges*Previous version of the paper appreared in Infocom '95, April 1995, Boston, MA. tion window. The slow recovery based on TCP slow start protocol leads to reduction in the throughput of the TCP protocol. In many cases, the retransmissions may also be lost due to handover which further reduces the throughput. If the time required to complete handover is of the order of 0.2 s and the TCP time resolution is 0.5 s (which is typical of TCP implementation), they show that transport level communication freezes for 0.8 s or more with each handover. They also observe that if no packets are lost during handover, the handover do not cause freeze in transport level communications. However, there is a slight throughput loss due to the delays during handover. They suggest a """"smooth handover"""" scheme that is realizable in a real network only if overlap regions between cells are large enough, and hosts move slowly enough, for handover operations to complete while a moving host is still in an overlapping region. They also propose modification to the transport protocol to overcome the performance degradation problem in presence of loss of packets during handover. Specifically, they use a fast retransmission procedure when hosts become aware of the loss of packets due to handover. The work in [4] has shown similar results to [2] based on a simulation model using realistic parameters. They also address the reduction in throughput due to packet loss during handover by proposing modification to the transport protocol. In their scheme, the transport layer explicitly receives information from the network layer of any ongoing mobility, based on which TCP extends the slow start phase in recovery process and achieves higher throughput. As PCS gains popularity, the load on the digital cellular networks increases. Therefore, the use of small cells (micro-cells), as small as a few hundred meters in diameter, is being considered [51 to meet the growing bandwidth requirements. In a micro-cell based environment, the user is likely to cross cell boundares more frequently. 9 J.C. Baltzer AG, Science Publishers 14 R. Cohen et al. / Hando ver in a micr o-cell packet switched mobile network Therefore, a robust handover protocol that requires very small time for handover and results in minimum or no loss of data, is critical in order to overcome performance degradation of the transport protocols due to handover. Specifically, if the handover protocol completes before the TCP retransmission times expire and results in no loss of packets, the freeze of TCP transmission as detailed in [2,4] can be avoided. Some previous works [1,6-8] have addressed the problem of design of handover protocols in mobile networks. Those protocols do not attempt to prevent packet loss or to preserve the order of transmission during handover. The protocol presented in [7] does not lose any packets transmitted by the mobile to the base station during the handover process, but it may lose packets destined to a mobile from the terrestrial network. The protocols presented in [6] may also lose packets during handover. In addition, this protocol performs the switching between base stations via a centralized switching office. This high load at the central switching office can lead to potential performance problems as we move to microcell based environments. Some of the protocols suggested in the catalogue of handover protocols [8] are similar to the ones of that paper, but this work does not describe the protocols in detail. The work presented in [9,10] propose and implement hint based handover protocols that have no loss of data, and all the data is delivered in order of transmission. When a mobile receives the beacons from the new base stations, after a certain threshhold level, the mobile sends a handover hint message to the old base station. Based on the hint message new paths are established to / f rom the new base station before mobile disconnects from the old base station. Therefore, the hint based protocols require that cells are overlapping and the connection to the old base station is not lost before receiving a beacon from the new base station, which is not always realistic. The present paper proposes a distributed handover protocol, which avoids loss of packets, preserves order of transmission, and requires small time to complete. It does not require any hits or overlaps between cells. Thus, the protocol minimizes the retransmission overhead encountered by the transport layer protocol. In a micro-cell based environment it is possible that a mobile leaves a cell while the handover is still in progress. Our protocol handles this situation robustly and retains the same properties as in the case of non-overlapping handovers. The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we define the problem addressed in this paper. Section 3 introduces several preliminaries regarding the interaction between protocol layers. In sections 4 and 5, we describe the handover protocol for the traffic from gateway to mobile and from mobile to gateway respectively, and prove that the protocol indeed has the losslessness and order preserving properties. The final conclusions are presented in section 6. 2. The p rob lem The network topology considered in the present paper is as shown in Fig. 1. The cellular network is divided into regions. The regions are based on the user concentration and many geographical considerations. Each region is divided into cells, where every cell is controlled by a base station. Base stations belonging to the same region are connected to each other by a regional network such as FDDI , DQDB or ATM. If the regional network connecting base station is an ATM network, the two neighboring base station may be connected by a virtual connection and there is no need for a direct physical link between them. The stationary users are connected to a wide area network (WAN), which also connects each of the regional network of base stations. The connection between WAN and regional network is through a single gateway. The hierarchical topology based on base-stations, regional networks (or MANs) and backbone networks has been proposed in [7,11-13]. It is assumed that regions are defined based on the population centers such that most of the mobile user activities are confined within a region. For example, a regional network may cover an interstate highway, a suburb, or a town center. Most of the handovers are assumed to take place within a region. Therefore, as the first step we will address the mobile users within a regional network, which will carry a significant fraction of the mobile traffic. Consider a connection between a static station s and a mobile station m. This connection consists of three segments: between s and the gateway g; between g and a base station hi, and between bi and m. Each of the three segments has different characteristics. The connection between s and g is established over a low error link (e.g., fiber optic link) where the bit-error rate is negligible Fig. 1. The cellular network model. R. Cohen et al. / Handover in a micro-cell packet switchedmobile network 15 (less than 10-14). The connection between g and bi is also established over a regional network with very low bit-error rate. However, as the mobile changes location, from the cell controlled by base bi to that controlled by another base station bi+l, the segment between g and bi must be rerouted to bi+l. This requires handling of misrouted and of out-of order packets. Misrouted packets are those that reach base bi from the gateway after the mobile """	atm turbo;acknowledgment index;bit error rate;cell (microprocessor);centralized computing;definition;digital electronics;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;explicit congestion notification;internet backbone;magnetic ink character recognition;network congestion;network model;network packet;network topology;optical fiber;overhead (computing);packet switching;programming paradigm;re-order buffer;read-only memory;requirement;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation;stationary process;tcp congestion control;telephone exchange;terrestrial television;throughput;ver (command);virtual circuit	Reuven Cohen;Baiju V.

A solution to this problem allows to characterize the set of achievable latencies and packet loss probabilities for a given network. We develop dynamic programming-based solutions for deadline-constrained maximum reliability routing under Bernoulli and Gilbert-Elliot packet loss models.

However, the spectacular efficiency of multicast streaming algorithms can only be realized by restricting or even prohibiting interactive playback control. Experiments reveal that the performance of current state-of-the-art multicast streaming algorithms will degrade significantly even at very low levels of interactivity (e.g., one control per five users). This study tackles this challenge by investigating the fundamental limitations of multicast streaming algorithms in supporting interactive playback control and presents a general solution-static full stream scheduling (SFSS)-which can be applied to many of the existing multicast streaming algorithms to substantially improve their performance when interactive playback control is to be supported. Moreover, to solve the problem of optimizing the algorithm for the often unknown client access patterns (e.g., arrival rates and interactivity rates), we present a novel just-in-time simulation (JTS) scheme to dynamically and automatically tune operating parameters of the SFSS algorithm while the system is online. This JTS scheme not only eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the often unknown system parameters, but also can adapt to changes in the client access pattern over time. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed adaptive algorithm can reduce the admission and interactive control latencies by as much as 90%	adaptive algorithm;dyadic transformation;elegant degradation;interactivity;java topology suite (jts);just-in-time compilation;multicast;peer-to-peer;scheduling (computing);semaphore flag signaling system;simulation;streaming algorithm;streaming media	Ying Wai Wong;Jack Y.

In this study, a single buffer queuing system is considered to model single and multi-channel, homogeneous wireless network systems such as wireless local area networks (WLANs) and cellular networks. These systems are now being used to carry both voice and data traffic and hence it is important to optimise these systems in an attempt to reduce the blocking, and minimize the latency to acceptable ranges. Since voice packets are delay sensitive, they have the priority to receive service. Also they require smaller buffering capacities, since the response time to voice requests should be below specific values. In addition, in order to reduce retransmission on reliable data connections, data packets are not usurped by incoming voice packets. In this paper, a mathematical analysis of this scenario is explored. The proposed mathematical model is represented by two dimensions, one for incoming voice packets and one for data packets. The models proposed show that it is possible to store incoming voice packets in the queue in case the channel or channels are busy. Both voice and data packets have finite buffering. Incoming voice packets are blocked when the voice buffer or the common queue is full. Therefore there is an added blocking probability of voice due to the presence of data packets in the system when the common queue is full. The analytical model is validated using simulation. The system proposed attempts to provide minimum delay for voice while reducing the disruption to reliable data connections. Numerical results show that, it is possible to attain these goals with reasonable buffer sizes. This study is useful for understanding the trade-offs and thresholds of single and multi-channel systems with voice and data traffic.	algorithm;blocking (computing);denial-of-service attack;erlang (unit);internet protocol suite;mathematical model;network packet;numerical method;point of view (computer hardware company);quality of service;response time (technology);retransmission (data networks);router (computing);routing;server (computing);simulation	Eser Gemikonakli;Glenford E.

Dynamic bandwidth reservation plays a key role in ensuring that mobile calls are not disrupted after they are admitted into the network. We propose a dynamic guard bandwidth scheme that adapts the amount of guard bandwidth in both wired and wireless links according to real-time handoff predictions made by individual mobile terminals, leveraged by the expected widespread availability of GPS-capable wireless devices in the near future. We describe procedures for approximating irregular handoff-request boundary, and for estimating a mobile's remaining time to handoff and target handoff cell. Guard bandwidth is adjusted on the fly only when a handoff is anticipated to occur shortly. The scheme is robust against modifications in handoff parameters, as well as changes in terrain and manmade features that could affect radio propagation. It also caters for heterogeneous bandwidth requirements. Admission control algorithms for both new calls and handoff calls are provided. Simulation results show that our scheme is able to meet specified forced termination probability under high offered load, and that resources are not reserved unnecessarily.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);data rate units;global positioning system;on the fly;proactive parallel suite;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;simulation;software propagation	Wee-Seng Soh;Hyong S.

In the case of a multiplexing scheme that shares the wavelength resource among all packets regardless the connection they belong to, the problem of defining a wavelength allocation algorithm arises. Wavelength allocation has to he merged with delay allocation in buffers realized by means of fiber delay lines (FDLs). This paper proposes several allocation algorithms and compares their performance. It shows that the buffering performance strongly depends on the choice of the delay unit of the FDL’s and that the algorithm aiming at reducing the artificial increase in the load due to the discrete time scale of the buffer gives best performance.	algorithm;gnu free documentation license;mathematical optimization;memory management;wavelength-division multiplexing	Franco Callegati;Walter Cerroni	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936990	optical transport network;passive optical network;discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;optical burst switching;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;optical performance monitoring;packet switching;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Metrics	-0.23641473738335247	96.03988703880121	62605

It is well-known that the high control overhead of IEEE 802.11 MAC is the limiting factor on the throughput and delay performance of wireless networks. In our prior work, three polling service-based MAC protocols (PSMACs) are developed to amortize the high control overhead over multiple frame transmissions, thus achieving higher efficiency. Both analysis and simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed protocols. In this paper, we extend this work by implementing the distributed version of PSMAC, i.e., PSMAC 2, on the GNU Radio and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) platform. We discuss various design considerations and challenges of prototyping PSMAC 2, and carry out extensive experimental studies with the GNU Radio/USRP PSMAC testbed. Our experimental results are found to be consistent with the theoretical study reported in our prior work, and validate the advantages of PSMAC under a realistic wireless channels.	access control;amortized analysis;gnu radio;overhead (computing);simulation;testbed;throughput;universal software radio peripheral	Yingsong Huang;Phillip A.

In this paper we examine the buffer requirements of servers for reliable multicast. We show how the server buffer requirements depend upon the packet arrival process at the server and the duration of time during which a packet needs to be held in its buffer. This latter quantity depends upon the required number of retransmissions and the length of time between retransmissions of the packet. We find that buffer requirements are very sensitive to small values of the number of retransmissions of a packet within the packet inter-arrival time but increase very slowly with the number of receivers a server is responsible for supplying repairs. We also determine the effect of the number of servers and buffer size at a server on the end—system throughput and network bandwidth usage. We examine three buffer replacement policies; FIFO, FIFO with minimum buffer holding time or FIFO—MH (that we propose) and LRU. Based on our performance study and noting that it could also be easily implemented, we recommend the use of the simple FIFO buffer replacement policy.	fifo (computing and electronics);modified huffman coding;multicast;network packet;programmable logic device;queueing theory;requirement;retransmission (data networks);server (computing);throughput;time of arrival;upstream (software development);web cache	Sneha Kumar Kasera;James F.

Despite this, IEEE 802.16e-2005 does not have a bandwidth allocation algorithm or mechanism to support (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) WiMAX network presently. This includes both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) directions. Thus, most of researches are focusing in this area. In order to improve the QoS of WiMAX demand, the total capacity of WiMAX system must be optimized. Thereby, in this research, a new bandwidth allocation mechanism for WiMAX network is proposed, called On Demand Bandwidth Allocation (ODBA). The proposed mechanism design has the management module in the Subscribe Station (SS), which is for management UL bandwidth, and one new module in the Base Station (BS). This includes UL/DL bandwidth allocation and service flow schedule. We tested the new mechanism by running in the simulation of OMNET++. As the results show that the ODBA mechanism has improve the scheduled probability (SP) and increase the throughput of WiMAX network.	algorithm;fairness measure;interference (communication);interoperability;microwave;network performance;quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	ZhenTao Sun;Abdullah Gani;XiuYing Sun;Ning Liu	2011	JCP	10.4304/jcp.6.10.2187-2195	wimax;throughput;real-time computing;mechanism;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	22.448977456187045	89.40272946787015	62873

So far, most investigations of such broadcast networks focus on multi-hop connectivity taking all one-hop links for granted. In this paper, the reliability and performance of real-time one-hop broadcast services in IEEE 802.11 based MANETs are investigated analytically and by simulation. Having specified possible applications and the features of IEEE 802.11 broadcast communication in dynamically self-organized networks under harsh communication environment, analyses are conducted to derive closed form expressions of the reliability and performance indices for both one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) broadcast MANETs: packet reception rate (PRR) and packet transmission delay. The proposed analytical models account for the impact of broadcast hidden terminal problem, message arrival interval, backoff counter process, space distributions of nodes, and fading transmission channel on the reliability and performance of the broadcast MANETs. As an example, the proposed models are applied to the evaluation of safety-related inter-vehicle communication on a highway. From the obtained numerical results under various offered traffic and network parameters, new observations and effective enhancement suggestions are given.	real-time clock	Xiaomin Ma	2011	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-011-0351-x	broadcast domain;broadcast radiation;ieee 802.11;atomic broadcast;self-organization;mobile ad hoc network;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;computer science;access control;performance indicator;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.418193725909122	89.84493569302073	62887

These radios access the spectrum in an opportunistic manner in order to take advantage of frequency bands, i.e. channels, left unused by primary users while not interfering with them. This opportunistic access model requires CRs to switch among channels searching for new opportunities and making contact with their neighbors to exchange the information needed for spectrum management. This search process, known as rendezvous (RV), is termed blind RV when it does not use a common control channel (CCC) or a centralized solution. Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the blind RV problem. However, most of them do not deal with broadcast transmissions, that is, when a CR wants to exchange information with all its neighboring nodes. This paper proposes a broadcast mechanism that operates on top of different one-to-one RV algorithms but being agnostic to the one in use, i.e., any such mechanism can be combined with it. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism achieves a favorable performance while inheriting the good properties of the underlying one-to-one RV algorithm.	algorithm;broadcast domain;centralized computing;cognitive radio;frequency band;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;one-to-one (data model);simulation	Raphael M.

We apply stochastic comparisons in order to derive bounding histograms with a reduced size and complexity. We prove some stochastic monotonicity properties for the network elements, in order to derive bounds on the performance measures such as delays and losses. We show clearly that this approach provides an attractive solution as a trade-off between accuracy of the results and computation times. Moreover, we compare our results with an approximative method previously published, in order to show the accuracy of the bounds, and to highlight the benefits of our approach for network dimensioning.	bounding volume hierarchy;computation;network performance;newton's method;profiling (computer programming);tracing (software)	Farah Aït-Salaht;Hind Castel-Taleb;Jean-Michel Fourneau;Nihal Pekergin	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.72	mathematical optimization;computer science;finite element method;histogram;markov process;steady state;computational model;statistics	Robotics	-1.3277719414010145	98.94147509243227	63016
b9af02e1a7a6803cfbd14fe0f487c397166ac072	a novel cross-layer design using comb-shaped quadratic packet mapping for video delivery over 802.11e wireless ad hoc networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Cross-layer design is a promising direction and challenging issue for quality delivery of multimedia over wireless networks. This article proposes a cross-layer design which can substantially enhance the transmission quality of video streaming over 802.11e ad hoc networks. The proposed design consists of two parts: a dispersive video frame importance (DVFI) scheme in the application layer that can correctly label the priorities of video packets, and a comb-shaped quadratic mapping (CQM) algorithm in the medium access control (MAC) layer that can provide a better congestion control mechanism among the multiple access category (AC) queues than 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) for wireless video delivery. The DVFI value of a video frame is measured from its own transmission loss and the accompanied impact to other coding-dependent video frames, and is accordingly adopted to prioritize the video frame associated packets. When these prioritized video packets arrive at the reserved AC queue in the MAC layer, the CQM algorithm can accordingly provide multi-branched service differentiation among them by dynamically downward mapping less significant video packets to lower-priority ACs based on the instant congestion level of the reserved AC queue, which can thus offer a better channel access resource to those video packets of higher priorities. In addition, the minimum-delay-time rule embedded in the CQM will select a better destiny for those downward mapped video packets among the lower-priority AC queues. Under various video-input-rate and cross-traffic tests, the simulation results show that this study outperforms the existing works, including EDCA, Adaptive Mapping, and Enhanced Adaptive Mapping.	access control;algorithm;dispersive partial differential equation;embedded system;hoc (programming language);network congestion;network packet;quantum mechanics;simulation;streaming media	Wen-Ping Lai;En-Cheng Liou	2012	EURASIP J.

43ae7bd5df54a30f0b895edea3d3b3c63c3f9370	modeling and analysis of lte connectivity in a high mobility vehicular environment		Abstract Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology has several features that make it an attractive alternative to be used in vehicle-to-infrastructure communications for intelligent transportation systems. However, before LTE can be widely used in this context, a number of analyses must provide convincing evidence that critical network functions (e.g. resource allocation strategies) yield adequate performance. To this end, in this work, we introduce a Markov-chain based model for LTE downlink channel quality, a prime factor affecting performance. Our model comes from the analysis of a large number of measurements of LTE Cell-Specific Reference Signals that were collected through a crowdsourcing application on a motorway in the UK. The model is intended to be used in performance evaluation studies and we exemplify its use with a case study, where we estimate the downlink transmission capacity of an LTE network. We also discuss other potential applications.	compaq lte	A. Burbano-Abril;R. M. Edwards;Victor Rangel;Raúl Aquino-Santos;Miguel López-Guerrero;R. S.

This paper proposes a rate-based AQM scheme based on adaptive token buckets per aggregated traffic flows. The approach is different from queue-occupancy-based AQM schemes because drop probabilities are not directly linked to the average queue size. In the proposed system, probabilistic dropping at routers is controlled by token buckets with committed information rates (CIR) adapted to the current router congestion status. The paper shows that this approach is better suited to the multi-modal traffic mix of short-lived responsive and long-lived non-responsive flows prevalent in the Internet.	active queue management;aggregate data;committed information rate;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;internet;modal logic;network congestion;offset binary;router (computing);routing;simulation	Andreas Kind;Bernard Metzler	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45076-4_18	internet protocol;routing;active traffic management;real-time computing;security token;telecommunications;computer science;traffic flow;end-to-end delay;queue;active queue management;computer network	Metrics	0.34392126620618363	102.28693862784881	63317

Heterogeneous networks will be dominant in the next generation wireless networks. In such networks, providing a seamless handoff and quality of service (QoS) guarantees is one of the key issues for real-time services. In this paper, we propose a horizontal handoff scheme that reduces the horizontal handoff latency based on the location and movement pattern of a mobile node (MN). We also present a vertical handoff scheme for providing seamless services between Wi-Fi and WiMAX networks. Finally, by performance evaluation using computer simulations, we show that the proposed scheme can reduce the handoff latency significantly.

Our approach is to model a stochastic behavior of one device as a discrete time Markov chain. We propose an analytical model describing the download behavior of a device using piggyback method. We obtain the performance measures such as throughput, packet delay, energy consumption and packet loss probability of a device. Numerical results and simulation results show that the piggyback method which removes a backoff procedure in the backoff method can reduce the delay, loss probability and energy consumption compared with backoff method. Our results can be used to find the optimal number of devices with some constraints on packet delay and packet loss probability.	backoff;download;markov chain;network packet;simulation;throughput	Tae Ok Kim;Jin Soo Park;Kyung Jae Kim;Bong Dae Choi	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74784-0_44	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;packet loss;computer network	Metrics	6.04051368937366	94.6985968181016	63553

Our analysis can be extended to IEEE 802.11 DCF in PMP mode of operation and contention based IEEE 802.16 based networks. Using a slotted-time model, we derive expressions for the service time distribution of the packets, and approximate expressions for the queuing delay under Poisson traffic, when the contention window is of fixed size. We extend this analysis to incorporate exponential backoff of the contention window size. We conduct simulations for the multichannel MAC protocol in NS-2, and note that our analytical results match well with simulation results for moderate to high values of traffic intensity.

We consider fractional multicast streaming, where the multicast stream from the source (origin-server) to any particular receiver (end-user) can be split over multiple paths. The receivers are selfish and noncooperative, but must collaboratively purchase capacities of links in the network, as necessary for delivery of the multicast stream from the source to the individual receivers, assuming that the multicast stream is network-coded. For this multicast capacity allocation (network formation) game, we show that the Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in general. For a 2-tier network model where the receivers must obtain the multicast data from the source through a set of relay nodes, we show that the price of stability is at most 2, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium whose social cost is within a factor of 2 of the socially optimum solution. For more general network models, we show that there exists a 2-approximate Nash equilibrium, whose cost is at most two times the social optimum. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a (2+∈)-approximate Nash equilibrium for any ∈ > 0, whose cost is at most two times the social optimum. Simulation studies show that our algorithms generate efficient Nash equilibrium allocation solutions for a vast majority of randomly generated network topologies.	multicast;peer-to-peer	Elliot Anshelevich;Bugra Caskurlu;Koushik Kar;Hang Zhang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-30373-9_45	multicast;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	ECom	15.936819508692913	99.01168707645267	63579

This can potentially lead to a very large increase in authentication requests hitting the centralized authentication infrastructure unless access is mediated at a lower protocol level. A study was carried out to examine the effectiveness of using Support Vector Machines to accurately identify if a mobile phone should be allowed access to a local cellular base station using differences imbued upon the signal as it passes through the analogue stages of its radio transmitter. Whilst allowing prohibited transmitters to gain access at the local level is undesirable and costly, denying service to a permitted transmitter is simply unacceptable. Two different learning approaches were employed, the first using One Class Classifiers (OCCs) and the second using customized ensemble classifiers. OCCs were found to perform poorly, with a true positive (TP) rate of only 50% (where TP refers to correctly identifying a permitted transmitter) and a true negative (TN) rate of 98% (where TN refers to correctly identifying a prohibited transmitter). The customized ensemble classifier approach was found to considerably outperform the OCCs with a 97% TP rate and an 80% TN rate.	radio fingerprinting;radio frequency;steady state	Barnard Kroon;Susan Bergin;Irwin O.

There are two basic premises: (1) users are assumed to be independent and selfish, and (2) central administrative control is exercised only at the network switches. The operating points resulting from selfish user behavior depend crucially on the service disciplines implemented in network switches. This effect is investigated in a simple model consisting of a single exponential server shared by many Poisson sources. We discuss the extent to which one can guarantee, through the choice of switch service disciplines, that these selfish operating points will be efficient and fair. We also discuss to what extent the choice of switch service disciplines can ensure that these selfish operating points are unique and are easily and rapidly accessible by simple self-optimization techniques. We show that no service discipline can guarantee optimal efficiency. As for the other properties, we show that the traditional FIFO service discipline guarantees none of these properties, but that a service discipline called Fair Share guarantees all of them. While the treatment utilizes game-theoretic concepts, no previous knowledge of game theory is assumed.	fifo (computing and electronics);game theory;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network switch;server (computing);time complexity	Scott Shenker	1994		10.1145/190314.190319	game theory;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;network congestion;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-1.9646261965587497	96.00845290426523	64321

Likewise previous wireless standards, where the modeling helped in a better understanding of the concepts and played an important role in extending the outreach of the technology and subsequent innovations, the modeling of IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRANs) is a necessity. In this work, we accomplish this task using the theory of queues. To that end, we model the dynamics of each cognitive user, termed customer premises equipments (CPE) according to the standard terminology, with a 2-D Markov chain. Given this model, we show that a WRAN cell can be modeled as a Jackson network. We also find the probability mass function (PMF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the CPE queue length, from which any higher moment can be derived. Notable is the fact that said PMF is expressed in an exact closed-form. In addition to the nodal analysis, a WRAN cell-level discussion is conducted by finding the stability condition and peer-to-peer delay. Moreover, we provide preliminary results on the resource allocation in WRANs, which is a very important area of focus and discovery for an efficient deployment and operation of future WRANs.

We consider the heavy traffic approach in working towards queue models under these properties, extending the model in R.T. Buche and H.J. Kushner (2002). Our focus is on the scalings used in the heavy traffic approach which are determined by combinations of the source rate of an infinite source Poisson model of the arrival process, the tail distribution of data transmitted by these sources, and the rate of variation of the random process (channel process) modeling the wireless medium. A fundamental inequality between the exponent in the power tail distribution of the data from the source and the parameter specifying the rate of channel variations is obtain.

PolyMAX is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) module and our specific contributions consist on the design and implementation of the Quality of Service (QoS) classes and QoS management messages, the uplink access grant-request mechanisms, Adaptive Modulation and Coding, and a scheduler handling all five WiMAX QoS classes. We also present validation results for the different components of our module and typical WiMAX simulation scenarios illustrating its flexibility and some of its features.

These informations, however, are not always available, especially in the case of real-time VBR video traffic. Predictive bandwidth management scheme solves this problem by using the on-line traffic measurement—it predicts the future traffic rate from the measurement and allocates the bandwidth accordingly. In this article, we firstly introduce an adaptive wavelet predictor for dynamic bandwidth allocation. Our simulation results show that, compared with the time-domain least-mean-square (LMS) predictor, our wavelet predictor improves the prediction accuracy and significantly reduces the cell-loss-rate when used in the dynamic bandwidth allocation. We secondly present a prediction-based bandwidth allocation scheme and the corresponding network architecture. In particular, a Bandwidth Allocation Unit (BAU) at the network access node is suggested.	bandwidth management;network architecture;real-time clock;volume boot record	Xinyu Wang;James S.

788d59a350c639a0d2fb5041c8f4a3ba942235a6	fuzzy logic-based quality of service evaluation for multimedia transmission over wireless ad hoc networks		This paper proposes a fuzzy logic (FL) model for evaluation of quality of service (QoS) in multimedia transmission over ad hoc networks as an e®ective mechanism for QoS management. It aims at minimizing the negative e®ects of major QoS parameters, (jitter, delay, packet loss) sustaining e±ciency and reliability of data deliveries and improving overall system performance. Both triangular membership function (TMF) and Gaussian membership function (GMF) are adopted to demonstrate their e®ects in FL-QoS evaluation. The proposed approaches are implemented in Matlab/Simulink. Results indicate that input conditions have varying level of in°uences on the output based on the MFs used. It is generally observed that QoS fuzzy control with TMF gives a better performance than GMF. Typically, it is also noted that when the input conditions are selected at 50ms delay, 5ms jitter and 50% packet loss, we obtain 79% and 71% output responses with TMF and GMF, respectively. This shows that TMF method can control QoS in a multimedia transmission over ad hoc wireless network more e®ectively with good service output response than GMF. Generally, the paper shows that FL is capable of measuring network performance and predicting any QoS deterioration without complex mathematical calculation, to provide an improved QoS for customers' satisfaction.	access network;artificial neural network;bit error rate;emoticon;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;graphical modeling framework;hoc (programming language);internet access;matlab;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nl (complexity);nl-complete;network congestion;network packet;network performance;numerical aperture;packet delay variation;parameter (computer programming);peripheral;quality of service;requirement;sensor;simulink;x.690	Uduak Umoh;Daniel Asuquo	2017	International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications	10.1142/S1469026817500237	quality of service;optimized link state routing protocol;computer science;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless multimedia extensions;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;multimedia;computer network;wireless ad hoc network;jitter	Mobile	1.7862179232157722	95.37078229510446	64656

Spurred by this observation, it is necessary to select a limited number of independent paths as much as possible, so we fall back on end-to-end probes to estimate path correlation. This paper focuses on a new topic of correlation-aware multipath selection, with formal and systematic problem definition, modeling and solution. Based on well-designed multipath delay probing, a Grouping-based Multipath Selection (GMS) mechanism is developed to avoid shared bottleneck between topologically joint paths.	bottleneck (software);bulldozer (microarchitecture);computer simulation;end-to-end principle;globalization management system;linux;multipath propagation;overlay network;software transactional memory;throughput;ubiquitous computing	Jingyu Wang;Jianxin Liao;Tonghong Li;Ping Zhang	2012	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2012.050438	real-time computing;human–computer interaction;computer science;multipath routing;delay spread;distributed computing;ubiquitous computing	Metrics	-3.9666910620566234	89.43326987108728	64698

The buffering delays and lateness rates are compared against the existing algorithm with the fixed β. We show that the β-adaptive system improves the lateness loss performance, especially for low jitter conditions, while maintaining almost identical buffering delay/lateness loss performance when jitter is high.	playout	Younchan Jung;J.

Data communication on the roads is becoming further interesting, as the number of vehicles equipped with computing technologies and wireless communication devices increase. In this paper we study the vehicle - RSU communication. It is noticeable that vehicles request various data from RSU but however urgent requests should have higher priority to be served. Some vehicles may ask for the same data, if we can postpone some requested data and multicast it before the deadlines, several requests may be served through a single multicast. We propose a scheduling algorithm to download data from RSU using multicast technique in order to serve multiple requests, regarding the priority of data. Simulation result indicates that method the proposed method can provide desirable performance and higher quality of service.	algorithm;download;hoc (programming language);multicast;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Sana Sahebgharani;Mohammad Shahverdy	2012	2012 Ninth International Conference on Information Technology - New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2012.59	vehicular ad hoc network;multicast;quality of service;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;programming language;scheduling;computer security;queue;computer network	EDA	6.337344874109424	90.84501888257145	64730

First, it predicts content request probabilities using community-aware non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) with implicit feedback. The CNMF-based proactive caching algorithm then makes a caching decision by considering estimated content request probabilities of both the associated and neighbor users to closely cooperate with CoMP. Simulation results show that the proposed caching strategy improves the performance in terms of the content hit ratio and the average content delivery completion time according to the cache size. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed caching with and without CoMP is evaluated by varying the cache size and the small-cell base station density.	algorithm;cache (computing);digital distribution;hit (internet);non-negative matrix factorization;simulation;smart battery system	Junseop Ahn;Seung Hyun Jeon;Hong-Shik Park	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2856761	computer science;computer network;cpu cache;matrix decomposition;small cell;base station;server	Web+IR	24.096740310351013	96.35704015445874	64761
05984cd019ab5f6704baf9486003fad7a61c8633	802.11 link quality and its prediction - an experimental study	packet loss;ad hoc wireless network	Reliable link quality prediction is an imperative for the efficient operation of mobile ad-hoc wireless networks (MANETs). In this paper it is shown that popular link quality prediction algorithms for 802.11 MANETs perform much more poorly when applied in real urban environments than they do in corresponding simulations. Our measurements show that the best performing prediction algorithm failed to predict between 18 and 54 percent of the total observed packet loss in the real urban environments examined. Moreover, with this algorithm between 12 and 43 percent of transmitted packets were lost due to the erroneous prediction of link failure. This contrasts sharply with near-perfect accuracy in corresponding simulations. To account for this discrepancy we perform an in-depth examination of the factors that influence link quality. We conclude that shadowing is an especially significant and hitherto underestimated factor in link quality prediction in MANETs.	algorithm;discrepancy function;hoc (programming language);imperative programming;mobile phone;network packet;operating environment;simulation	Gregor Gärtner;Eamonn O.

56589317b2a87631c6dc310fd023acd934653678	delivering fairness and qos guarantees for lte/wi-fi coexistence under laa operation		Licensed assisted access (LAA) enables the coexistence of long-term evolution (LTE) and Wi-Fi in unlicensed bands, while potentially offering improved coverage and data rates. However, cooperation with the conventional random-access protocols that employ listen-before-talk (LBT) considerations makes meeting the LTE performance requirements difficult, since delay and throughput guarantees should be delivered. In this paper, we propose a novel channel sharing mechanism for the LAA system that is capable of simultaneously providing the fairness of resource allocation across the competing LTE and Wi-Fi sessions as well as satisfying the quality-of-service guarantees of the LTE sessions in terms of their upper delay bound and throughput. Our proposal is based on two key mechanisms: 1) LAA connection admission control for the LTE sessions and 2) adaptive duty cycle resource division. The only external information necessary for the intended operation is the current number of active Wi-Fi sessions inferred by monitoring the shared channel. In the proposed scheme, LAA-enabled LTE base station fully controls the shared environment by dynamically adjusting the time allocations for both Wi-Fi and LTE technologies, while only admitting those LTE connections that should not interfere with Wi-Fi more than another Wi-Fi access point operating on the same channel would. To characterize the key performance trade-offs pertaining to the proposed operation, we develop a new analytical model. We then comprehensively investigate the performance of the developed channel sharing mechanism by confirming that it allows to achieve a high degree of fairness between the LTE and Wi-Fi connections as well as provides guarantees in terms of upper delay bound and throughput for the admitted LTE sessions. We also demonstrate that our scheme outperforms a typical LBT-based LAA implementation.	coexist (image);compaq lte;duty cycle;fairness measure;quality of service;random access;requirement;throughput;wireless access point	Massimiliano Maule;Dmitri Moltchanov;Pavel Kustarev;Mikhail Komarov;Sergey Andreev;Yevgeni Koucheryavy	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2793941	throughput;admission control;computer network;duty cycle;quality of service;computer science;base station;communication channel;resource allocation	Mobile	22.26894950163544	90.216799580374	64888

Using a mobile cluster network we could realize cooperation and resource sharing among mobile users. We propose a QoS-ensured transmission scheme with content-based priority for mobile cluster users. In our scheme some mobile hosts form a mobile cluster network, which is a kind of LAN. All mobile hosts will share the total capacities of the cluster network and the outside interface. We divide all mobile hosts into different priority degrees based on the content type of them. As a result we could realize making good use of the bandwidth resources of the total system under the condition that the arrival traffic is asymmetric. We could also realize optimizing the performance of high priority traffic under the condition that the total system lies in overload status.	quality of service	Wang Xin;Li Fei;Susumu Ishihara;Tadanori Mizuno	2000		10.1109/ICPPW.2000.869163	mobile broadband;radio access network;embedded system;mobile identification number;mobile search;3g;mobile web;imt advanced;public land mobile network;wireless application protocol;gsm services;mobile database;computer science;mobile technology;distributed computing;mobile station;mobile computing;mobile communications over ip;computer network	Mobile	7.6456068179157	97.60987475317033	64905

A major difficulty in using broadcast communication is the issue of access to the channel. The authors deal with the following prioritized conflict resolution problem: a collection of c messages is initially distributed among nodes on an MABN; each message is associated with a value representing its priority or deadline; and it is required that the messages be broadcast in ascending order of this value. This problem is solved by a distributed prioritized conflict resolution algorithm. It is proved that the expected waiting time of the ith network node to transmit is Theta (i+log c), which is optimal. It is also shown that the algorithm runs in the expected linear time, which is optimal in both the number of slots used and the total elapsed time including local processing. >		Charles U.

The cooperation of source and relay nodes in wireless networks towards improved performance and robustness requires the application of an efficient bandwidth sharing policy. Moreover, user requirements for multimedia content over wireless links necessitate the support of advanced Quality of Service (QoS) features. In this paper, a novel bandwidth allocation technique for cooperative wireless networks is proposed, which is able to satisfy the increased QoS requirements of network users taking into account both traffic priority and packet buffer load. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined by analyzing the impact of buffer load on bandwidth allocation. Moreover, fairness performance in resource sharing is also studied. The results obtained for the cooperative network scenario employed, are validated by simulations. Evidently, the improved performance achieved by the proposed technique indicates that it can be employed for efficient traffic differentiation. The flexible design architecture of the proposed technique indicates its capability to be integrated into Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for cooperative wireless networks.	access control;data buffer;fairness measure;network packet;quality of service;relay;requirement;simulation;user requirements document	Thomas D.

In fact, the protocol stability in infinite population and the guaranteed low-contention delay appear very attractive for a random-access system proposal. In addition, from the third-generation network standpoint, defining and offering priorities in wireless communication systems appears to be the more important point for operators and system users. Indeed, after second-generation networks supporting voice service only, the third-generation systems (UMTS) should offer more services with quality and priority. However, all priorities in the UMTS system are based on the dedicated channel, which is offered after the random-access mechanism that uses the weak access protocol: slotted Aloha. In this paper, we analyze theoretically the possibility of applying the tree random-access protocol for the W-CDMA part in the UTRA radio interface proposition. We also study a priority system applied for the random access directly. This seems to be very useful to propose priority for some applications, especially the emergency application. The analytical model uses generating functions and an algebraic method in order to show the stack protocol performance. Also, numerical and simulation results are presented and show the predominance of this protocol compared with the slotted-Aloha mechanism.	communications protocol;linear algebra;numerical analysis;random access;simulation	Khaldoun Al Agha;Philippe Jacquet;Nikita D.

If a target cell cannot provide adequate bandwidth for a service request, instead of directly dropping the request, the MH is put into the handoff queue and hopefully the requested bandwidth can be satisfied by later released bandwidth. Obviously, it is important to properly assign priorities for queued handoff of MHs based on their inborn dynamics to avoid unnecessary dropping. In this paper, we present a dynamic handoff priority adjustment scheme which applied a handoff queuing scheme to dynamically adjust handoff priority based on receiving signal strength, service class, and mobility of Mobile Hosts. In addition, idle bandwidth reserved by inactive MHs is reallocated to urgent handoff MHs to reduce the call dropping probability. The goal of the proposed dynamic handoff priority adjustment scheme is to further reduce call dropping probability while still maintaining high bandwidth utilization and acceptable call blocking probability on multimedia cellular networks.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);modified huffman coding	Chow-Sing Lin;Ping-Jing Huang	2011	IJCNS	10.4236/ijcns.2011.48061	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	6.374611065198451	97.99985171656687	65030

In CR networks, CR users (CUs) are secondary users to the licensed spectrum and they are required to vacate the spectrum when a primary user (PU) reclaims it. We consider a general setting in which multiple PU interruptions may occur during the transmission period of CU traffic. Therefore, spectrum handoffs are provided to protect both the PU's and CU's transmission. In order to characterize the channel usage behaviors of primary traffic and CR real-time traffic with spectrum handoffs, we develop a queuing model which consists of preemptive resume priority M/G/1 and M/G/1/1 queues. Based on this queuing model, channel utilization factor can be derived. Besides, the blocking and forced termination probabilities for real-time traffic are also derived. Simulation results are given to validate the proposed analytical model.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;erlang (unit);ibm systems network architecture;one-class classification;queueing theory;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;simulation;throughput;tip (unix utility)	Ling Hou;Alan Kai-Hau Yeung;Kin Yeung Wong	2013	2013 First International Symposium on Computing and Networking	10.1109/CANDAR.2013.74	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	3.880045200645393	98.22546698625402	65214

Further, there is an increasing need to synthetically generate long traces of web requests for studying the performance of algorithms and systems related to the web. These reasons motivate us to obtain a simple and accurate model of web request traces. Our Markovian model precisely captures the degrees to which temporal correlations and document popularity influence web trace requests. We describe a mathematical procedure to extract the model parameters from real traces and generate synthetic traces using these parameters. This procedure is verified by standard statistical analysis. We also validate the model by comparing the hit ratios for real traces and their synthetic counterparts under various caching algorithms. As an important by-product, the model provides guidelines for designing efficient replacement algorithms. We obtain optimal algorithms given the parameters of the model. We also introduce a spectrum of practicable, highperformance algorithms that adapt to the degree of temporal correlation present in the request sequence, and discuss related implementation concerns. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Quality of service (QoS) and throughput are the most significant questions in the 802.11 WLANS especially when the bandwidth is scare. In the Overlapping Basic Service Set (OBSS), we need to face many problems such as the high collision rate, long time delay, low throughput and so forth. So we propose the admission control scheme to work out these questions. This admission control scheme is aimed at improving the throughput simultaneously guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS).

This advancement in mobile networks has forced researchers to explore various methods of energy saving, although with little emphasis on motorway vehicular networks where mobility is also an important aspect. Energy saving in these networks is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature of the environment in which they operate. To analyze such a network, we first develop a performance model for a medium access control (MAC) protocol, namely, the modified version of packet reservation multiple access (M-PRMA) with wireless channel impairments in a motorway vehicular environment. The M-PRMA protocol provides communication links (time slots) between an AP and the vehicles in range. The time slots of the M-PRMA protocol are modeled as servers where each outage of the channel is represented as a server on queue-length-independent vacation. Then, each AP, in a hierarchical micro-macro topology, is modeled as a single-server queue where the AP takes queue-length-dependent vacations (switches to sleep mode) to save energy during its inactivity period, although at the expense of degraded quality of service (QoS). To address this, a number of sleep strategies for the AP are studied. Finally, both of these proposed models (M-PRMA with channel impairments and AP with sleep cycles) are analyzed and verified through simulations. The performance results reveal that the introduction of sleep strategies at an AP can save up to 80% transmission energy during off-peak hours and 66% on average during the day in a motorway vehicular environment while supporting end-to-end QoS for video and audio conferencing applications.	access control;downtime;end-to-end encryption;network packet;network switch;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;server (computing);simulation;sleep mode;wireless access point	Wanod Kumar;Samya Bhattacharya;Bilal R.

The proposed mechanism can be used for unicast or multicast transmission of multimedia data over heterogeneous networks, like the Internet, and has the capability to adapt the transmission of the multimedia data to network changes. In addition, the implemented mechanism uses an inter-receiver fairness function in order to treat the group of clients with fairness during the multicast transmission in a heterogeneous environment. The proposed mechanism uses a ‘friendly’ to the network users congestion control policy to control the transmission of the multimedia data. We implement a prototype application based on the proposed mechanism and we evaluate the proposed mechanism both in unicast and multicast transmission through a number of experiment and a number of simulations in order to examine its fairness to a group of clients and its behaviour against transport protocols (TCP) and UDP data streams.

a8e5c34c29c0953b4dd0fd31e261f46beee81321	adaptive heading prediction of moving path for user-centric optimal cell selection toward 5g cooperative cellular communication		Abstract Toward 5G, 3GPP specifies the cooperative communications in Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A Pro) to form a cooperative set of eNBs or cell sections for each UE. Clearly, for a UE near cell edge still anchoring at the original serving eNB before performing handover, the cooperative communication certainly reduces transmission delay and increases reliability. However, 5G cooperative communications suffers from some critical issues, including (1) how to dynamically form the set for a moving UE, (2) yielding high computing complexity for RAN (Radio Access Network) to compute the cooperative set for each UE, (3) when to initiate the cooperative communication, (4) increasing RB allocation cost significantly, etc. Thus, this paper proposes the UE heading Prediction Optimal Cooperative set selection approach (POC) that consists of three phases: (1) the phase of QoS-based Priority Function (QPF), (2) the phase of Adaptive UE Heading Prediction of moving path (HP), (3) the phase of Adaptive Optimal Cooperative mode determination and RB allocation (AOC). Numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms the compared approaches in system capacity, access delay, average dropping probability, reward and net-profit. Furthermore, the computation complexity of the proposed approach is analyzed, i.e., T ( n ) 150 = O 0 . 07233 ⋅ n 3 , which is less than that of the compared approaches without any predictive heading of a moving UE, i.e., T ( n ) 150 T ( n ) 360 = O n 3 .	course (navigation);mobile phone	Ben-Jye Chang;Tamerlan Rajabov	2018	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2018.08.013	computer network;handover;real-time computing;quality of service;anchoring;computer science;transmission delay;radio access network;cellular communication;user-centered design	ML	21.7441493931897	92.48607322863712	65456

However, as the bandwidth of the wireless channels is limited an efficient media access control (MAC) scheme is required to enhance the utilization of the available bandwidth. In this paper we show that with multiple simultaneous access of the shared wireless medium using a traffic-adaptive Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme the peak performance can be improved significantly while lowering energy dissipation in data transfer compared to the conventional wireline counterparts.	access control;electrical connection;network on a chip	Anuroop Vidapalapati;Vineeth Vijayakumaran;Amlan Ganguly;Andres Kwasinski	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6272112	cellular network;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;channel access method;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;multi-frequency time division multiple access;wireless distribution system;network on a chip;wi-fi array;computer network	Arch	9.556366677130741	89.68668591720117	65585

In this paper, a three layer model is used to describe the service composition in a streaming media system. In order to improve the real-time request response performance, path selection is divided into two steps, the initial paths planning and dynamic path selection. The dynamic path selection behavior is described by using Markov decision processes model. When QoS is guarded, the policy iteration algorithm is adopted to improve the system of the total receipts and to reduce the refuse rate.

The new protocol, pointer-controlled slot allocation and resynchronisation protocol (PCSARe), is based on the hybrid coordination function-controlled channel access mode of the IEEE 802, 11e standard, PCSARe reduces energy consumption by removing the need for power-saving stations to remain awake for channel listening. Discrete event network simulations were performed to compare the performance of PCSARe with the non-automatic power save delivery (APSD) and scheduled-APSD power-saving modes of IEEE 802.11e. The simulation results show a demonstrable improvement in energy efficiency without significant reduction in performance when using PCSARe. For a wireless network consisting of an access point and eight stations in power-saving mode, the energy saving was up to 39% when using PCSARe instead of IEEE 802.1 1e non-APSD. The results also show that PCSARe offers significantly reduced uplink access delay over IEEE 802.11e non-APSD, while modestly improving the uplink throughput. Furthermore, although both had the same energy consumption, PCSARe gave a 25% reduction in downlink access delay compared with IEEE 802.11e S-APSD.	quality of service	Ghazanfar Ali Safdar;William G.

The differences in terms of QoS and GoS caused by link adaptation (LA) and multi-slot allocation experienced by data users in EGPRS networks is smoothed by these strategies through the use of multiple resource reservation and/or dynamic resource allocation strategies, which, at the same time, compensate users with poor radio channel conditions.

97089c1ad32d5ac08cda405ab9fc7a61c32711cd	a decentralized minislot scheduling protocol (dmsp) in tdma-based wireless mesh networks	worldwide interoperability for microwave access wimax;ieee 802 16;time division multiple access tdma;minislot scheduling problem;mesh networks	Wireless mesh network is a promising network topology that can provide high data rate backhaul network access. For achieving high data rate backhaul network access, a well-designed bandwidth scheduling protocol is necessary for wireless mesh networks. This paper takes minislot scheduling problem for IEEE 802.16 mesh networks as an example and formulates the problem as an integer linear programming model in this paper, where minislot is an atomic bandwidth allocation unit for data transmissions among subscriber stations and base station. Due to the high computational complexity for solving integer linear programming model at subscriber stations and the degradation of bandwidth utilization resulted from data collision problems and minislot insufficient problems, this paper proposes a decentralized minislot scheduling protocol to make subscriber stations, rather than base station, schedule minislot usage for throughput gains in the IEEE 802.16 mesh networks. The decentralized minislot scheduling protocol includes minislot usage constraints and minislot decision strategies to alleviate data collisions and minislot insufficient problems as well as to increase bandwidth utilization. The proposed protocol can not only accommodate to the IEEE 802.16 standard, but also makes subscriber stations schedule minislots with the latest minislot usage information. Besides IEEE 802.16 mesh networks, the proposed protocol also can apply to any wireless mesh networks with less or no modifications. From the simulation results, the performance of the proposed protocol outperforms the other related contributions in terms of the transmission delay, control overhead, minislot utilization and the network throughput. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

94c1ce188b89cc5dc624d1d681c4bcb694baf41d	energy signal assisted access method for licensed assisted access		Licensed-Assisted Access Long-Term Evolution (LAA- LTE) framework can offload excessive data stream to the unlicensed spectrum. Devices from different operators will compete for the same band and have to endure a more complex and congested channel conditions. Therefore a rapid and efficient access mechanism should be introduced in the LAA framework. Based on the Type B LBT channel access scheme, this work proposes an Energy-Based Signal Assisted Access (EBSA) mechanism. The EBSA mechanism can realize the rapid information transfer between devices belonging to different operators. Then a Markov chain model is set up and used to analyze this mechanism theoretically. Simulation results verify the validity of the theoretical analysis, and in the ultra-dense employed LAA network, the proposed method is efficient compared with the existing access mechanisms.	carpal tunnel syndrome;coexist (image);compaq lte;markov chain;rs-232;simulation;software deployment	Wei Wang;Pingping Xu;Yuan Zhang;Hongyun Chu	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108490	data stream;spectrum management;operator (computer programming);computer network;throughput;access method;computer science;information transfer;decoding methods;communication channel	EDA	23.106851245733406	90.84763644751763	66219

The investigation includes service mapping and modelling techniques for both Geostationary (GEO) and non-GEO systems. The queuing performance and the buffer dimensioning of an S-ATM network model assuming that the network arrivals at the edges of this network are self-similar processes is also investigated. A new methodology for creating service classes according to the user-defined performance criteria is developed. Our approach can be used to dynamically regulate the system's call blocking and handoff failure probabilities for different services classes. A new radio resource management scheme, the Adaptive Bandwidth Reservation Scheme (ABRS) is proposed by incorporating two different threshold values for handling the new calls and the handoff requests. Due to the dynamic bandwidth reservation, each service class maintains a Grade of Service (GoS) profile that has been accepted or negotiated during the call set-up phase and is guaranteed for a predefined service period.	provisioning;quality of service	Ioannis Mertzanis;Georgios Sfikas;Rahim Tafazolli;Barry G.

In this paper we present a two-part solution for the fairness problem in AF. The first part is a new packet marking algorithm called equation-based marking (EBM) and is based on the TCP model given by Padhye et al. [Modeling TCP throughput: A simple model and its empirical validation, in: Proceedings of ACM SIGCOMM '98, October 1998]. EBM is to handle the problems found in other marking schemes regarding fairness among heterogeneous TCP flows through a tight feedback-loop operation and adaptation of the packet marking probability to network conditions. The second part is called packet separation used at routers to handle the fairness between responsive and nonresponsive traffic. We evaluate the performance of a packet marker that uses EBM as the marking algorithm using in-depth simulation. We prove, analytically and using simulation, the correctness of the marking algorithm and compare it with other marking schemes for different network scenarios. We also use simulation to show the effectiveness of the packet separation mechanism in solving the fairness problem between responsive and non-responsive traffic. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of EBM along with packet separation in providing the required fairness among heterogeneous flows and ensuring protection against non-assured traffic.	fairness measure;ip traceback;item unique identification;network packet	Mohamed A.

The former constraint requires that the total time allocated to all nodes for transmitting synchronous messages should not exceed the target token rotation time. The latter constraint requires that the minimum time available for a node to transmit its synchronous messages before their deadlines should be no less than the maximum message transmission time. Several nonoptimal local SBA schemes and an optimal global SBA scheme have been proposed [1], [2], [3], [8], [17], [29]. Local SBA schemes use only information available locally to each node and are thus preferred to global schemes because of their lower network-management overhead. If optimal local SBA schemes, if any, can be devised, they will be superior to their global counterparts both in performance and in ease of network management. In this paper, we formally prove that there does not exist any optimal local SBA scheme. We also propose an optimal global SBA scheme which has an OnM polynomial-time worst-case complexity, where n is the number of synchronous message streams in the system and M is the time complexity for solving a linear programming problem with 3n constraints and n variables.

WSFQ scheduler, like SFQ uses a start time eligibility criterion to select packets and when the start-time of two packets in two flows are the same, it acts like Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) which selects the smallest virtual finish time first.  Afterward, we compared the performance of our model with that of the applied scheduling algorithms such as First-In-First-Out (FIFO), SFQ as well as WFQ on the end-to-end delay and the throughput in small and large-scale networks. Our analysis demonstrates that our proposed model is suitable for elastic services networks since it achieves low end-to-end delay for elastic applications as well as providing fairness which is desirable for elastic traffic regardless of variation in one misbehaving flow.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);fair queuing;fairness measure;network scheduler;scheduling (computing);throughput;weighted fair queueing	Ehsan Allahyar;Ali Movaghar-Rahimabadi	2009			weighted fair queueing;generalized processor sharing;real-time computing;fifo and lifo accounting;computer science;deficit round robin;maximum throughput scheduling;end-to-end delay;fair queuing;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Networks	0.003128833077747354	95.33712512784983	66555

This paper deals with the class of Radio Resource Control (RRC) based on power regulation, where typical PHY layers parameters (powers, interference, etc.) are combined with upper layers ones to i) increase radio channel utilization; ii) perform admission control of heterogeneous wireless links; iii) maintain negotiated QoS levels expressed as a function of the Signal-toInterference-Ratio (SIR). In the recent literature power control is mainly employed to dynamically adapt the transmission of concurrent links to the varying system conditions (due to channel quality, mobility) still guaranteeing the perceived QoS. In this framework, we investigate how the design of a suitable power control can be used in the support of traffic requiring some QoS guarantees. The paper presents a paradigm where all the RRC operations are performed in a distributed way, i.e., independently for each link involved in a communication. The distributed approach assures that the strategies are quite flexible to be used both in cellular-like systems and in ad-hoc networks.	access control;distributed computing;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);phy (chip);programming paradigm;quality of service;throughput	Francesca Cuomo;Cristina Martello	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39867-7_10	local area network;wireless ad hoc network;regulation;signal-to-interference ratio;quality of service;concurrency;adaptive control;telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio resource management;access control;integrated circuit;interconnection;interference;computer security;service quality;computer network	Mobile	2.8266269015355716	103.22710352280895	66660

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology plays a critical role for the construction of this paradigm. Reliable communication between WSN nodes and outside Internet entities will be needed for remote management of Internet Objects. On the other hand, low bandwith, high delay and packet error rates of the underlying wireless medium can make the realization of such TCP connections highly inefficient. In this study, we investigate the performance of asynchronous TCP connections from multiple WiFi clients to a sensor node on WSN. We model the traffic over WSN gateway as M/M/1 queue and present the results of comprehensive simulation tests for performance of TCP connections in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. The results reveal that the gateway can achieve reasonable Round Trip Times up to 80 simultaneous connections to WSN when WiFi Packet Error Rate is less than 0.2.	bit error rate;cache (computing);end-to-end principle;entity;experiment;futures studies;interconnection;internet of things;memory footprint;network packet;programming paradigm;request–response;response time (technology);sensor node;simulation;throughput	Kemal Cagri Serdaroglu;Sebnem Baydere	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6953007	embedded system;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	-2.7189182124669955	90.63088561343802	66729

However, distributed scheduling under delay constraints is not well understood and remains an under-explored area. A main goal of this study is to take some steps in this direction and explore the distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) with delay constraints. Consider a network with $M$ links which contend for the channel using random access. Distributed scheduling in such a network requires joint channel probing and distributed scheduling. Using optimal stopping theory, we explore DOS for throughput maximization, under two different types of average delay constraints: 1) a network-wide constraint where the average delay should be no greater than $\alpha$; or 2) individual user constraints where the average delay per user should be no greater than $\alpha_m$, $m=1,\ldots,M$. Since the standard techniques for constrained optimal stopping problems are based on sample-path arguments and are not applicable here, we take a stochastic Lagrangian approach instead. We characterize the corresponding optimal scheduling policies accordingly, and show that they have a pure threshold structure, i.e. data transmission is scheduled if and only if the rate is above a threshold. Specifically, in the case with a network-wide delay constraint, somewhat surprisingly, there exists a sharp transition associated with a critical time constant, denoted by $\alpha^{*}$. If $\alpha$ is less than $\alpha^{*}$, the optimal rate threshold depends on $\alpha$; otherwise it does not depends on $\alpha$ at all, and the optimal policy is the same as that in the unconstrained case. In the case with individual user delay constraints, we cast the threshold selection problem across links as a non-cooperative game, and establish the existence of Nash equilibria. Again we observe a sharp transition associated with critical time constants $\{\alpha^*_m\}$, in the sense that when $\alpha_m \ge \alpha^*_m$ for all users, the Nash equilibrium becomes the same one as if there were no delay constraints.	dos;expectation–maximization algorithm;nash equilibrium;optimal stopping;random access;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;throughput	Sheu-Sheu Tan;Dong Zheng;Junshan Zhang;James R.

The existing DCF node simply blocks its transmission if the medium is sensed to be busy. Thus, it is inefficient in terms of the network throughput due to overcautious estimation of the interference. The proposed spatial reuse DCF (SRDCF) employs the information of locations and the required signal to interference ratio (SIR) to predict the interference more accurately. Then, it determines whether the node blocks its data transmission or not. Based on the interference estimation (i.e., feasibility analysis), we extract the appropriate transmission power for successful concurrent transmissions. By doing this, the node of the SRDCF can adjust its transmission power. Consequently, the SRDCF increases the network throughput by allowing concurrent transmissions. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed SRDCF works better than original IEEE 802.11 DCF.	backoff;blocking (computing);byte;capture effect;counterfactual conditional;design rule for camera file system;interference (communication);mathematical model;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);simulation;spatial multiplexing;throughput	Sunghun Kim;Jongsub Cha;Joongsoo Ma	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.309	feasibility study;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	9.019260441981801	91.77700449205842	67017

Differently from classic CRDSA that operates grouping slots in frames, this technique operates in an unframed manner yielding to better throughput results and smaller average packet delay with respect to frame-based CRDSA. However as classic CRDSA also SW-CRDSA relies on multiple transmission of the same packet. While this can be acceptable in systems where the only limit resides in the peak transmission power, it could represent a problem when constraints on the average power (e.g. at the transponder of a satellite system) are present. In this paper, a comparison in terms of normalized efficiency is carried out between Slotted Aloha and the two CRDSA techniques.	communications satellite;decibel;degree distribution;fairness measure;frame language;interference (communication);network packet;random access;relay;retransmission (data networks);shattered world;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;transponder	Alessio Meloni;Maurizio Murroni	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583526	telecommunications;computer science;communications satellite;computer network	Mobile	7.87004201076384	92.90320210862706	67153
a1c2009d633e9ad0995e4f6f94ae071e3084c21a	an apropos signal report and adaptive period (asap) scheme for fast handover in the fourth-generation wireless networks	velocity;wireless;mobility;signal to noise ratio snr;handover	In this paper, a medium access control (MAC) layer handover scheme is proposed to reduce the handover processing time. Two critical points of investigation are examined to improve the performance of the handover process. The first point is the exact point of time when the handover process should be triggered. This factor is highly related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) the mobile station (MS) receives at that moment. The second point is the moving direction and current moving velocity of the MS. Based on these two factors, an apropos signal report and adaptive period (ASAP) handover scheme is proposed to reduce the handover processing time. ASAP is based on the concept that the received SNR is highly related to the point of time the MS reports and the circumstance the MS stays. If the variation between two reported SNR values is large, the time interval of receiving the next SNR report must be reduced, or increased when the variation is small, to accurately reflect the SNR change. ASAP adjusts the periodic ranging period dynamically according to the MS moving velocity and no additional control messages are introduced into ASAP. ASAP is a base station (BS) initiated handover scheme. Detailed comparisons reveal that ASAP can achieve a handover delay reaching 15 ms low at most, which is substantially smaller than the fastest legacy network-assisted handover mechanism (50 ms). & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose TCP-Real, a high-throughput transport protocol that minimizes transmission-rate gaps, thereby enabling better performance and reasonable playback timers. In TCP-Real, the receiver decides with better accuracy about the appropriate size of the congestion window. Slow Start and timeout adjustments are used whenever congestion avoidance fails; however, rate and timeout adjustments are cancelled whenever the receiving rate indicates sufficient availability of bandwidth. We detail the protocol design and we report significant improvement on the performance of the protocol with time-constrained traffic, wireless link errors and asymmetric paths.	communications protocol;high-throughput computing;network congestion;real-time clock;real-time computing;reflow soldering;tcp congestion control;throughput;timer	Chi Zhang;Vassilis Tsaoussidis	2001		10.1145/378344.378371	high-throughput screening;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;heterogeneous network;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;orienting response;computer science;operating system;transmission control protocol;session initiation protocol;computer security;slow-start;transport layer;fading;computer network	Mobile	-3.0542838544553788	91.61954856669841	67250
84d95361e635fc1b48df97d2d5ec1c29711d555c	analysis of a cellular network with user redials and automatic handover retrials	cellular network	In cellular networks, repeated attempts occur as result of user behavior but also as automatic retries of blocked requests. Both phenomena play an important role in the system performance and therefore should not be ignored in its analysis. On the other hand, an exact Markovian model analysis of such systems has proven to be infeasible and resorting to approximate techniques is mandatory. We propose an approximate methodology which substantially improves the accuracy of existing methods while keeping computation time in a reasonable value. A numerical evaluation of the model is carried out to investigate the impact on performance of the parameters related to the retry phenomena. As a result, some useful guidelines for setting up the automatic retries are provided. Finally, we also show how our model can be used to obtain a tight performance approximation in the case where reattempts have a deterministic nature.	approximation algorithm;complex system;computation;numerical analysis;parser grammar engine;retry;simulation;time complexity	José Manuel Giménez-Guzmán;Maria José Doménech-Benlloch;Vicent Pla;Vicente Casares Giner;Jorge Martínez-Bauset	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74833-5_18	cellular network;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	Metrics	8.666318856022476	100.30158564910388	67273

Thus, it is of upmost importance to model mobility patterns as realistically as possible. Several publications w. r. t. individual (realistic) user movements have been made. However, especially in urban scenarios, user mobility is often correlated. In public transportation systems (metro, bus, etc.) the motion of many users is bound to the same vehicle, leading to a far different system performance (e.g. cell load, number of handovers, etc.). Therefore, a new correlated group mobility model is presented in this paper. Results show that the system performance compared to individual user movements is significantly different.	metro (design language);simulation	Sören Hahn;Dennis M.

In this paper, our fundamental motivation is to use less wireless resource at the cost of larger but acceptable transmission latency for massive clustering MTC devices. From the two observations of clustering MTC devices, we proposed Aggregation Postpone Transmission Scheme(APTS), which makes more terminals share one timeslot resource by adjusting the transmission order. We proposed a TDMA frame structure for practical implementation analyzed the performance of APTS and Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service(MBMS) over our model and the results demonstrate that APTS outperformed MBMS in improving the spectrum efficiency.

Traditional Vertical Handover Management (VHM) schemes are not enough good, to support seamless connectivity in heterogeneous networks. Therefore, to deal with the challenges such as inappropriate handover triggering and network selection, we propose a multi-criteria based VHM scheme. The handover triggering is based on the data rate required by the number of applications running on a mobile node's device. A threshold is defined on the lowest possible data rate requirement for each application. Similarly, the network selection is carried using the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) decision scheme based on delay, jitter, bandwidth, communication cost, and network load. The proposed scheme is tested on a number of mobility scenarios with three different networks WIFI, WiMAX, and LTE (cellular). Similarly, the proposed scheme is simulated against the periodic, adaptive scanning, and IEEE 802.21; Media Independent Hanover (MIH) standard. The proposed scheme shows superior performance and it outperforms existing schemes used for a similar purpose.	compaq lte;data rate units;grey relational analysis;packet delay variation;port triggering;seamless3d	Murad Khan;Changsu Jung;Paul Chiedozie Uzoh;Zhenbo Cao;Jinbae Kim;Yongtak Yoon;Aamir Nadeem;Ki Jun Han	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289211	real-time computing;telecommunications;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	7.952484074786027	98.295750647541	67641

The tactical scenarios of concern have a diverse range of reliability and/or delay requirements. We first employ cross-layer protocol architecture with integrated time-division-multiple-access-based fast packet forwarding and automatic-repeat-request-based multihop error control to support tactical applications with a diverse range of reliability and/or delay requirements. Then, we develop analytical models to study the link-level and network-wide behaviors of the tactical radio networks. The developed models capture the effects of end-to-end channel memory due to multihop relays, interference due to spatial reuse, uneven interslot delays due to fast packet forwarding, and jamming attack in hostile network environment. It is shown that the protocol architecture with proposed fast packet forwarding and multihop error control mechanisms can significantly improve communication performance and support delay-sensitive applications. In addition, it is demonstrated that cross-layer adaptivity, where different network environments require different logical topologies and radio modes, is needed to achieve best performance tradeoffs among throughput, efficiency, delivery ratio, and transport capacity.	automatic repeat request;channel memory;control system;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;gnu radio;interference (communication);network packet;profiling (computer programming);radio jamming;relay;requirement;throughput	Humphrey Rutagemwa;Li Li;Phil J.

Nowadays, more and more kinds of services are being transmitted on wireless communication network with different requirements. So, to satisfy the quality of service (QoS) of multi-service requirements is one of the key challenges that need to be dealt in the LTE system. In this paper, we propose a cross layer solution called token bucket scheduler (TBS) for real time service that allocates resource block (RB) for different services in order to meet their QoS requirements. TBS utilizes instantaneous downlink channel signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and service QoS information when determining whether a RB allocates to a real time service. Through extensive simulations, the results show that TBS algorithm greatly improves throughput, delay and packet loss ratio compared with the maximum-largest weighted delay first (M-LWDF) scheduling algorithm and exponential/proportional fair (EXP/PF) scheduling algorithm in real time service.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;compaq lte;exptime;inter-process communication;interference (communication);network packet;next-generation network;proportionally fair;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;system call;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput;time complexity;token bucket	Liqun Zhao;Yang Qin;Maode Ma;Xiaoxiong Zhong;Li Li	2012	7th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China	10.1109/ChinaCom.2012.6417520	real-time computing;next-generation network;quality of service;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Embedded	4.448364430211662	96.37583690539653	68147

The objective is to minimize the total broadcast cost, where the cost can be of any form that is summable over all the transmissions (e.g., the transmission and reception energy, the price for accessing a specific channel). Our technical approach is based on a simplicial complex model that allows us to capture the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and the heterogeneity across radios and channels. Specifically, we show that broadcasting in multi-radio multi-channel ad hoc networks can be formulated as a minimum spanning problem in simplicial complexes. We establish the NP-completeness of the minimum spanning problem and propose two approximation algorithms with order-optimal performance guarantee. These two algorithms offer tradeoffs between performance and time complexity. In a broader context, this work appears to be the first that studies the minimum spanning problem in simplicial complexes and weighted minimum connected set cover problem.	simplicial complex	Wei Ren;Qing Zhao;Ram Ramanathan;Jianhang Gao;Ananthram Swami;Amotz Bar-Noy;Matthew P.

The aim is to understand what is the best reliability degree of the wireless link in order to guarantee TCP performance. For this purpose, we first develop a Markov model for a selective repeat ARQ protocol, widely used in the current wireless environments. Secondly, we design a crosslayer algorithm that, by exploiting the proposed model, can adapt the number of link layer transmission attempts to the end-to-end packet loss rate perceived by TCP. The interaction between TCP and link layer is evaluated in a specific case study (TCP over 3G radio access) by means of simulations carried out by using a very detailed UMTS-TDD simulator based onns. The deployment of the link layer Markov model and of the proposed algorithm allows us to derive some interesting conclusions about the design of retransmission protocols in TCP/IP network environments.	algorithm;automatic repeat request;end-to-end encryption;internet protocol suite;markov chain;markov model;network packet;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;simulation;software deployment;test-driven development	Francesco Vacirca;Andrea De Vendictis;Alfredo Todini;Andrea Baiocchi	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258323	radio link protocol;link layer;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;selective repeat arq;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;markov process;markov model;hstcp;tcp tuning;automatic repeat request;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;time-division multiplexing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.069708753432595	98.64970540801872	68181

Control systems have strict requirements on delay, throughput, and reliability, that vary with time during operation. Addressing these requirements requires predictable and robust protocols to be employed, and they must be adaptive to the varying states of the controlled process. In this article, we propose a dual-mode adaptive medium access control protocol that caters for two main operation modes in control systems: the steady mode operation, and the transient mode operation. We present initial performance analysis results focusing on energy consumption, including a comparison with a related single-mode industrial monitoring and control protocol. c © 2014 The Authors.

It proposes two wireless network access mechanisms to support QoS: HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) and Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). EDCA is a contention-based scheme. When the network size is increased, there will be more collisions and idle slots. Therefore, the performance will degrade a lot. To cope with this problem, this study proposed a High Performance Distributed Coordination Function with QoS support (QHDCF) protocol to enhance the performance. In QHDCF, the transmitting station determines the next transmitter according a selection rule from a probability formulation perspective based on the priorities and numbers of stations in different traffic classes. Since, in the proposed QHDCF, stations do not contend for channel access, transmission collisions are reduced a lot, and hence the network throughput is enhanced. Moreover, in EDCA, the high-priority traffic will always get the transmission opportunity and therefore low-priority traffic will suffer starvation. In contrast, in QHDCF, the high-priority traffic has better transmission opportunity on a probability base and hence does not starve the low-priority traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed QHDCF protocol outperform EDCA protocol in different packet sizes and number of stations.	access network;halt and catch fire;network packet;priority queue;quality of service;real-time locating system;selection rule;simulation;streaming media;throughput;transmitter	Yeong-Sheng Chen;Min-Yen Chuang;Fan-Chun Tseng;Chih-Heng Ke	2011	2011 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2011.6096656	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Mobile	2.575203352772593	95.8210670774575	68470

Garcia-Luna-Aceves ‡ , and Hamid R. Sadjadpour Computer Engineering Department, † Electrical Engineering Department University of California, Santa Cruz Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA {xuhui,jj,hamid}@soe.ucsc.edu Abstract. To increase network capacity, advanced physical layer (PHY) techniques have been developed to support new transmission paradigm where one node could send different packets concurrently to multiple receivers (multi-packet transmission: MPT) or receive packets concur- rently from multiple senders (multi-packet reception: MPR). To exploit and support them for high performance, new type of medium access con- trol (MAC) protocol is needed. Especially, MPT or MPR requirements are dynamic according to traffic conditions. In this paper, an adaptive MAC approach (AMPTR) is proposed to enable dynamic MPT or MPR requirements for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The proposal in- cludes two main parts: access coordination and data transmission. The access coordination process comprises channel access contention and co- ordination to make handshakes for multiple concurrent transmissions. Once channel access coordination is completed, multiple transmissions can then be carried out concurrently, where frame aggregation is used for network capacity and throughput improvement and accordingly block acknowledgement is employed for efficiently reporting multiple packet reception status. We evaluate the performance of AMPTR through sim- ulations, and show that the AMPTR scheme has much higher network throughput and smaller packet delivery delay than currently widely used multiple access preventing schemes.

In this paper, we propose the compressed block ack mechanism as a selective repeat mechanism to be adapted to the frame aggregation scheme.

By calculating the average arriving rate of each flow or a set of merged flows based on EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average), and discarding packets from the most aggressive flow or flow set randomly according to a dropping probability, FRIDAY is able to (1) provide better fairness than LQD (Longest Queue Drop), RED (Random Early Detection), and TD (Tail Drop), (2) maintain a shorter average waiting time in the queue than LQD and TD, and (3) control the time limit for a bursty traffic to send data continuously without packet dropping. The performances of FRIDAY are validated by ns simulator.

However, the amount of traffic measurements available over which to perform such analysis, processing and storage is overwhelming. For this reason, the research community has understood the importance of finding an effective mechanism to reduce (or subsample) such huge amount of data, with minimum loss of information. More specifically, this work considers the traffic volume traversing a given router per unit of time, which can be obtained by periodically polling the counters of the interfaces table via SNMP. We further propose a mechanism to downsample such traffic time-series using multi-resolution analysis with wavelets, and evaluate the optimal subsampling level based on comparing the queueing behavior of the subsampled and original signals at the output of a router. This mechanism is more related to network performance than conventional comparison levels, since queueing delay is a very representative QoS metric. The method presented in this paper has been applied to an extensive set of real measurements collected from RedlRIS, the Spanish National Research Network. The results show that it is possible to reduce the data to one fourth of its original size for the traffic generated by most analyzed universities, and even to one eighth for data collected from routers with more aggregated traffic, both with a high level of confidence.	approximation algorithm;chroma subsampling;decimation (signal processing);high-level programming language;multiresolution analysis;national research and education network;network performance;queuing delay;rediris;router (computing);server (computing);simple network management protocol;thinning;thresholding (image processing);time series;traffic exchange;wavelet	José Luis García-Dorado;Javier Aracil;José Alberto Hernández;Jorge E.

In this paper, a proxy agent-based scheme is proposed to minimize the SIP session setup delay over a wireless link in 3G inter-subnet handover scenarios. This scheme is based on the two characteristics. One is that the major factor of SIP session re-setup delay is generally caused by the retransmissions in the unreliable wireless links, and the other is that most of the fields in request messages as well as response messages are duplicated when a set of SIP messages are exchanged during session re-setup procedure. In this scheme, no change is required in the SIP message processing except for the proxy agents in both BS and MH.		Bongkyo Moon	2010	EURASIP J.

In order to provide hard QoS, earlier we have proposed an extension called EDCA with resource reservation (EDCA/RR), which enhances EDCA by offering also hard QoS through resource reservation. In this paper, we extend EDCA/RR to cope with the hidden terminal problem, outline a solution for multi-hop scenarios, and compare the proposed scheme	hoc (programming language);quality of service;rapid refresh;requirement;round-robin scheduling;routing	Ali Hamidian;Ulf Körner	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72990-7_30	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	3.7247207690009	95.89552106393275	68614

STUMP uses propagation delay information to overlap node communication and increase channel utilization. Our work yields several important conclusions. First, leveraging node position diversity through scheduling yields large improvements in channel utilization. Second, STUMP does not require tight node synchronization to achieve high channel utilization, allowing nodes to use simple or more energy efficient synchronization protocols. Finally, we briefly present and evaluate algorithms that derive STUMP schedules.	algorithm;centralized computing;pin grid array;propagation delay;scheduling (computing);software propagation;throughput	Kurtis B.

The MF architecture requires effective congestion and flow control to efficiently support data delivery at scale. Traditional end-to-end, window-based congestion control like that used by TCP is unsuitable as it is unable to take advantage of such in-network functionality. We design network-layer assisted congestion control schemes tailored to MF. One approach that works well for hop-by-hop reliable networks is using per-flow queueing and backpressure to alleviate congestion. However, it could become impractical in the presence of a large number of flows, which leads to substantial memory consumption and computational complexity. Building on a more scalable per-interface queueing model, we design congestion control mechanism that embodies traffic source rate control and explicit congestion notification from routers. Sample results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve similar link utilization and better fairness compared with a per-flow queueing scheme.	end-to-end principle;explicit congestion notification;fairness measure;future internet;hop-by-hop transport;network architecture;network congestion;queueing theory;scalability	Kai Su;K.

Although many theoretical results of this theory have been developed, there still lack applicable examples to demonstrate how it may be used. This paper exemplifies applying stochastic network calculus to delay analysis of the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF). Analyzing and obtaining the stochastic characteristics of the single packet service time is the primary task. Then the stochastic behavior of the DCF is characterized by a timedomain server model, which describes the cumulative service time provided to an arrival flow using a probabilistic bound. Based on this server model, we obtain delay bounds for different arrival processes. In addition, the delay bounds also take buffer size into account. The analytical bounds are further discussed using numerical results. Through these, we present a stochastic network calculus approach to delay evaluation of the DCF.	design rule for camera file system;network calculus;network packet;network performance;norm (social);numerical analysis;queueing theory;server (computing);software performance testing	Jing Xie;Yuming Jiang	2010	IEEE Local Computer Network Conference	10.1109/LCN.2010.5735773	stochastic process;ieee 802.11;real-time computing;distributed coordination function;time domain;computer science;distributed computing;network performance;calculus of communicating systems;server;computer network;cumulant	Metrics	1.302976019846939	98.35033814910098	69037

But the details of transmission period and Maximum Transmit Unit (MTU) size of the scheduled traffic have not been defined yet.

In this paper, we study the delay-performance for the M2M uplink from the sensors to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in a industrial automation scenario. The uplink traffic can be broadly classified as either Periodic Update (PU) and Event Driven (ED). The PU arrivals from different sensors are periodic, synchronized by the PLC and need to be processed by a prespecified firm latency deadline. On the other hand, the ED arrivals are random, have low-arrival rate, but may need to be processed quickly depending upon the criticality of the application. To accommodate these contrasting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, we model the utility of PU and ED packets using step function and sigmoidal functions of latency respectively. Our goal is to maximize the overall system utility while being proportionally fair to both PU and ED data. To this end, we propose a novel online QoS-aware packet scheduler that gives priority to ED data as long as that results the latency deadline is met for PU data. However as the size of networks increases, we drop the PU packets that fail to meet latency deadline which reduces congestion and improves overall system utility. Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of our scheme with various scheduling policies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Earliest-Due-Date (EDD) and (preemptive) priority. We show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes for various simulation scenarios.	automation;event-driven programming;fairness measure;ibm systems network architecture;machine to machine;network congestion;network packet;network scheduler;preemption (computing);proportionally fair;qualitative comparative analysis;quality of service;queueing theory;requirement;scheduling (computing);self-organized criticality;sensor;sigmoid function;simulation;single-machine scheduling;telecommunications link	Akshay Kumar;Ahmed Abdel-Hadi;T.

96fcb90518a28d7f7c8594dfab58ddcd4dbfae54	the effect of femtocells and the mobile users on the throughput of the lte-a network using an open source simulator		Recently, femtocells are likely to be deployed at homes and small enterprises in an urban area to improve the coverage and capacity of the systems. Thus, in order to improve QoS in wireless and mobile networks overlay an existing macrocell network with indoor femtocell is an alternative solution for service operators. Mobility is also one of the main issues in performance evaluation of wireless systems. There is a lack of analysis that provides the deployment of femtocells in an existing macrocell network considering the mobile users. Hence, the impact of mobile users and the deployment of femtocells in a macrocell presented using an open source simulator. An open source simulator is adapted and different scenarios are considered for a typical urban area as case study where a set of femtocells are deployed within the coverage area of a macrocell.

Transmission scheduling is a good interference avoidance scheme which helps prevent throughput degradation at high offered load in an optical code division multiple access local area network. Interference avoidance consists of state estimation and transmission scheduling. This work examines different scheduling algorithms and parameter variations. This work investigated the performance of three scheduling algorithms (Pure Selfish Scheduling, Threshold Scheduling and Overlap Section Scheduling) against the ALOHA CDMA and our novel Hybrid--Hybridized Overlap and Threshold Scheduling--HOT algorithms using the modified padded prime codeset. The performance of the scheduling algorithms are measured in terms of its normalized network throughput, packet error rate and the average number of codewords allow into the line against the normalized offered load. The analysis shows that under this condition, the Hybridized Overlap--Threshold scheduling perform best and has throughputs as high as the 52 % with nearly zero packet error rate while the non-scheduled algorithm produce a throughput as low as 10 % and very high error rate at maximum offered load. Overall, the Threshold Scheduling and HOT algorithm are head to head and performed best in terms of normalized network throughput, however the HOT scheduling is best in terms of the packet error rate. Analysis also shows that the throughput is not affected by changes in codeset length and the mean packet size but it is affected by changes in the codeset weight. The study also analyzes the performance of the network under a bimodal packet distribution and with the Prime code codeset family. Optical Orthogonal Codeset and the Prime codeset family are used in the study under the assumption of perfect state estimation; that all nodes have the same view of the network and the transmission lines and the distance between the nodes and the central star coupler is assumed to be zero. A novel hybrid Scheduling Algorithm, the HOT Scheduling which proved better than traditional Scheduling Algorithms is peddled here.	algorithm;scheduling (computing)	Ladi Ogunwolu;Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe;John Dare Oyebamiji	2016	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-015-0082-x	code word;fair-share scheduling;code division multiple access;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;interference;node;round-robin scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Theory	0.6121011424216923	93.50424790975593	69159

Although there are several existing works about MEC, for example, utilizing WNV and SDN, virtualized D2D communication together with learning-based D2D communication systems, such as social and smart D2D networking systems, have not been investigated by researchers, while knowledge of the edge is lacking. In this article, we introduce an innovative framework, called KCE, to dynamically detect network structure and manage communication resources, leveraging the insightful knowledge obtained from D2D communications among mobile users. Further, to support trustworthy network access and to meet different QoS requirements in the proposed architecture, specific SPs are selected from InPs by a KCE server. As such, the chosen SPs' resources can be dynamically allocated to meet various service requirements by virtualized D2D communication techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under different scenarios and parameter settings.	access network;computation;edge computing;quality of service;requirement;serial digital video out;server (computing);simulation;software-defined networking	Ruyan Wang;Junjie Yan;Dapeng Wu;Honggang Wang;Qing Yang	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700876	communications system;computer network;architecture;quality of service;physical layer;computer science;knowledge engineering;distributed computing;server;edge computing;access network	Mobile	22.58302303441893	91.7132217876743	69271

The SA algorithm is a powerful way to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems, which is used to adjust the parameters of the controller. The RL algorithm shows the particular superiority in ATM networks, which is independent of the mathematic model and just needs simple fuzzy information obtained through trial-and-error and interaction with the environment. With the advantages of the two algorithms, the proposed controller forces the queue size in the multiplexer buffer to the desired value by adjusting the source transmission rate of the available bit rate (ABR) service.

The thorough treatment makes the framework practically applicable, as well as retains its appealing properties. Moreover, the paper summarizes the applications of sliding mode approach in communication networks and highlights its great potential ahead.	algorithm;fairness measure;heterogeneous computing;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;network congestion;quality of service;requirement;telecommunications network	Jiong Jin;Dong Yuan;Jinchuan Zheng;Yu-ning Dong	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249248	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;max-min fairness;sliding mode control;computer science;control theory;network congestion;slow-start;computer network	Robotics	-3.373006174223966	96.814322799871	69546

In order to keep the handoffdropping probability as low as possible, we have designed a new predictive scheme for radio resource allocation. This scheme consists in dimensioning the amount of resources to reserve for handoffs in each cell. The solution proposed is based on a reservation mechanism with a threshold estimated according to the usage history of the resources in the cell. This estimation is done using the Kalman filter, a powerful mathematical tool. Evaluation of the proposed scheme demonstrates a real improvement in the handoff-dropping probability compared to the static reservation scheme.

In this paper, we propose a mobility-based paging mechanism which utilizes the MS's mobility information to reduce the number of unnecessary broadcast paging messages. To further reduce the paging message overhead, instead of using MAC address, a shorter identifier called paging identifier is used in the paging message. Our simulation results show that by applying both methods, a great amount of paging message overhead can be reduced.	identifier;mac address;memory management unit;overhead (computing);paging;simulation	Ming-Hung Tao;Ying-Chuan Hsiao	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594233	wimax;embedded system;real-time computing;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;mobile station;mobile computing;computer network	EDA	9.426660770386356	96.28566097402211	69977

We derive the outage probability of multi-hop communication and study it in detail for a simple linear topology. The results indicate that an appropriate choice of route can lead to large performance gains over alternate routes. In the second part of the paper, we consider the problem of estimating outage-minimizing routes using channel measurements. We show that finding the optimal routes reliably requires many independent channel measurements, which is equivalent to sending multiple route discovery requests. The large overhead in route discovery can prove to be counter-productive in networks which transmit information at the same time-scale as the mobility of nodes.	downtime;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);relay	Ashutosh Sabharwal	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188396	wireless network;wireless sensor network;computer network;linear topology;channel capacity;mobile radio;network topology;distributed computing;communication channel;computer science;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	14.03451493157566	89.44165091231122	69987

The process of an asynchronous greedy algorithm is equivalent to the iteration of the Jacobi method in solving a linear system. However, it has been proved that the algorithm converges only for some particular range of queueing parameters. Here we propose the asynchronous greedy algorithm with relaxation, which is in principle equivalent to solving a linear system by the Jacobi method with relaxation. We propose also some relaxation parameters such that our algorithm converges very fast.	greedy algorithm;iteration;jacobi method;linear programming relaxation;linear system;nash equilibrium;successive over-relaxation	Wai-Ki Ching	1999	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/4234.749354	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;greedy algorithm;discrete mathematics;index term;jacobi method;relaxation;mathematics;iterative method;linear system;queueing theory;nash equilibrium	ML	15.446399091344563	96.16858344823517	70037

An admission control scheme is needed to maximize the utilization of wireless channel. Most of papers study throughput improvement by solving the complicated multidimensional Markov-chain model. In this paper, we introduce a back-off model to study the transmission probability of the different arbitration interframe space number (AIFSN) and the minimum contention window size (CWmin). We propose an adaptive control scheme (ACS) to dynamically update AIFSN and CWmin based on the periodical monitoring of current channel status and QoS requirements to achieve the specific service differentiation at access points (AP). This paper provides an effective tuning mechanism for improving QoS in WLAN. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the basic EDCAF in terms of throughput and service differentiation especially at high collision rate.	wireless router	Bih-Hwang Lee;Hui-Cheng Lai	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.3.862	markov chain;simulation;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;statistics	Visualization	1.5674591607761517	102.19971297757893	70053

For a multihomed transmission protocol designed for network failure tolerance, such as SCTP, path selection algorithms for data transmission drastically affect performance. This article studies the effect of path bandwidth differential on the performance of retransmission strategies in multi-homing environments. It identifies that fast retransmission on an alternate path may cause receive buffer blocking when path bandwidth differential is significant and the receive buffer is limited. A theoretical model is proposed for selecting retransmission path during the fast retransmission phase, based on receive buffer and path conditions. From these observations and analysis results, this article proposes that path selection strategies for transmitting new data and retransmitted data should be decoupled. A new path selection scheme is proposed and evaluated through SCTP simulations.	algorithm;blocking (computing);fault tolerance;maximum throughput scheduling;multihoming;multiple homing;network packet;retransmission (data networks);scanline rendering;scheduling (computing);simulation;theory;transmitter	Yuansong Qiao;Enda Fallon;John Murphy;Liam Murphy;Zhiqiang Shi;Austin Hanley	2010	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-009-9195-4	stream control transmission protocol;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;multihoming;transport layer;computer network;data transmission	Networks	-2.7885508319123518	90.12419753136786	70062

Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) is well known formalisms used to represent and analyse communication and computer systems. However, it does not have enough expressive power to model timing behaviours of multimedia applications in a mobile network. To address this limitation, we develop quality of services based GSPN, which is capable of doing so. The extension offers the promise of providing real-time system predictability for systems characterised by substantial stochastic behaviour. With this model we model and analyse the handover and admission control schemes in the different multimedia traffic environments. Our result, thereby, provide the optimal performance achievable for these schemes under the real-time constraints in the given setting of design parameters.	quality of service	Tony Tsang	2002		10.1007/3-540-45801-8_1	cellular network;real-time computing;simulation;quality of service;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;expressive power;computer network	Robotics	2.43627927553956	97.23971699092097	70187

Since access networks are designed to support peak time traffic, the utilization of base stations can be very inefficient during off-peak time because the traffic profile is time varying. We study the dynamic switching of base stations (BS) to reduce the energy consumption considering the time varying characteristic of the traffic profile. We show via analysis that the mean and variance of traffic profile and the BS density are the dominant factors that determine the amount of energy saving that can be achieved. Simulations using ideal and real traffic profiles are used to quantify the potential savings from dynamic BS switching in a realistic setting.	access network;bs 7799;computer simulation;global variable	Eunsung Oh;Bhaskar Krishnamachari	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683654	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;computer network	Mobile	24.41039409528574	92.43264607666717	70215

Rapid technological development has widened the scope of network and Internet applications and, in turn, increased traffic volume. The exponential growth of the number of servers, as well as the number of users, causes Internet performance to be problematic as a result of the significant impact that long-range dependent traffic has on buffer requirements. Consequently, accurate and reliable measurement, analysis and control of Internet traffic are vital. The most significant techniques for performance evaluation include theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical study based on measurement.

In current PCS networks, a two-tier system of home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (VLR) databases is commonly used for location management. To improve the performance of PCS networks, several dynamic location management schemes have been proposed. Among the existing dynamic schemes, the movement-based location management may be the most practical due to its effectiveness and easy implementation under the framework of current PCS networks. To implement location management in PCS networks, cost analysis is a crucial aspect. However, most of the existing cost analyses for the movement-based scheme are too simple and not available for PCS networks with the HLR/VLR architecture. One reason for this is the complexity and the difficulty associated with the problem. Li et al. and Rodriguez-Dagnino et al. challenged this task by considering the HLR/VLR architecture. However, the cost analysis developed by Li et al. was carried out under the assumption that the cell and location area (LA) residence times are exponentially distributed. Rodriguez-Dagnino et al. furthered Li et al.'s work by assuming that the LA residence time follows a hyperexponential distribution and that the cell residence time is generally distributed. However, Li et al. and Rodriguez-Dagnino et al. failed to consider VLR location updates that are caused by terminal movements between LAs. In this paper, we relax the restrictions imposed on the distributions of the cell and LA residence times and propose an analytical model to study the movement-based scheme with HLR/VLR architecture. The issue of VLR location updates that are caused by movements between LAs is addressed carefully and successfully. Analytical formulas for the costs of HLR and VLR location updates are derived using a unified approach. Numerical study suggests that the total cost is a convex function of the movement threshold and is sensitive to the variances of the cell and LA residence times. The result presented in this paper can serve as a guideline for the system design and the implementation of the movement-based scheme for PCS networks.	convex function;database;hidden line removal;multitier architecture;personal computer;systems design	Xian Wang;Pingzhi Fan;Jie Li;Yi Pan	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.919613	convex function;exponential distribution;random variable;simulation;systems modeling;internationalization and localization;mobile telephony;network analysis;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;cost–benefit analysis;mathematical model;residence time distribution;implementation;residence time;statistics;systems design	Mobile	6.518331134224264	101.16998922586235	70412

In ad hoc networks, battery power is an important resource, since most terminals are battery powered. Terminals consume extra energy when their network interfaces are in the idle state or when they overhear packets not destined for them. They should, therefore, switch off their radio when they do not have to send or receive packets. IEEE802.11 features a power saving mechanism (PSM) in Distributed Coordination Function(DCF). In PSM for DCF, nodes must stay awake for a fixed time, called ATIM window (Ad-Hoc Traffic Indication Map window). If nodes do not have data to send or receive, they enter the doze state except for during ATIM window. However, ad hoc networks with PSM have longer end-to-end delays to deliver packets and suffer lower throughput than the standard IBEE802.11. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a protocol that reduces delay and achieves high throughput and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that our proposal outperforms other PSMs in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay and energy efficiency.	hoc (programming language)	Shojiro Takeuchi;Kaoru Sezaki;Yasuhiko Yasuda	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e88-b.7.2985	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.6905475471398748	102.28509704875448	70477
d42d090ba2aaad3a8eb6f7bfa6653cfd4bff1136	study of mobility in cache-enabled wireless heterogeneous networks		Caching popular multimedia content has the potential to take wireless networking to an unprecedented height in terms of user experience. Primary motif behind content caching is to give frequent access to popular content cached at local caches, such as femto access point with finite storage. Although content-caching was Initially limited to wired backbone networks, it now being developed for wireless networks. The main difference between these two cases is the potential mobility of the user. We thus investigate the impact of user mobility on the performance of content-caching wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We describe the user mobility by the random waypoint model and characterize the spatial randomness of different types of nodes by using independent Poisson point processes. Using their stochastic properties, we analyze the handover probabilities and evaluate expected download delay as a function of handover probabilities.	cache (computing);download;internet access;internet backbone;motif;numerical analysis;randomness;user experience;waypoint;wireless access point	Bitan Banerjee;Chintha Tellambura	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925705	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	13.910919635389218	90.71471208441503	70566
0ccbd45fd0bdb065bd80ed635eb938d202b6aaaa	optimal rat selection and wifi offloading in multi rat hetnet with user-centric deployments		This paper presents the problem of optimizing Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection and traffic offloading in a Multi RAT Heterogeneous Network composed by cellular and WiFi networks. The main idea is to distribute the traffic load of the system over the available access networks, while making an efficient use of the radio resources in the long-term. In this sense, a higher and fair WiFi resource utilization is pursued in comparison to cellular network usage. The goal is to avoid an overloaded cellular network scenario and to obtain a decrease in the energy consumption. The problem is modeled as a sequential decision-making process using Semi Markovian Decision Process, where the optimization problem aims at maximizing the total long-term discounted-reward of the network. Value Iteration algorithm is then used to solve the maximization problem and to obtain the optimal policy. From the resulting policy, several performance metrics are derived to evaluate its performance. Numerical results indicate that the proposed RAT selection strategy performs well for distributing the traffic load in a fair manner among WiFi networks while a lower cellular utilization is achieved.	access network;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);expectation–maximization algorithm;greedy algorithm;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;software performance testing;theory	Juan Montoya;Natalia Gaviria Gomez	2017	2017 IEEE 9th Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	10.1109/LATINCOM.2017.8240181	resource management;telecommunications link;heterogeneous network;computer network;access network;radio access technology;markov decision process;cellular network;optimization problem;computer science	Mobile	22.05708413013649	94.96344217578805	70570

This work aims at fusing the statistically predictable demand and channel patterns in devising proactive caching strategies that alleviate network congestion. Specifically, we establish a fundamental bound on the minimum possible cost achievable by any proactive scheduler under time-invariant demand and channel statistics as a function of their prediction uncertainties, and develop an asymptotically optimal proactive service policy that attains this bound as the prediction window grows. In addition, the established bound yields insights on how the demand and channel statistics affect proactive caching decisions. We reveal some of these insights through numerical investigations.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;cache (computing);load (computing);mobile phone;network congestion;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing);time-invariant system	L.

Real-time services are affected by the probabilistic behavior of such a network. In particular, when the network becomes congested, the end-to-end packet delay may exceed the maximum allowed. Fortunately, many real-time services are willing to trade service quality for information timeliness. The imprecise-computation technique, in combination with layered coding schemes, makes this tradeoff possible.	computation;network congestion;real-time transcription	V. Millan-Lopez;W. Feng;J. W.-S.

To encourage users to adopt delay-tolerant scheduling for capacity-improvement, it is critical to provide guarantees in terms of completion time. In this paper, we study application-level scheduling with deadline constraints, where the deadline is pre-specified by users/applications and is associated with a deadline violation probability. To address the exponentially-high complexity due to temporally-varying channel conditions and deadline constraints, we develop a novel asymptotic approach that exploits the largeness of the network to our advantage. Specifically, we identify a lower bound on the deadline violation probability, and propose simple policies that achieve the lower bound in the large-system regime. The results in this paper thus provide a rigorous analytical framework to develop and analyze policies for application-level scheduling under very general settings of channel models and deadline requirements. Further, based on the asymptotic approach, we propose the notion of Application-Level Effective Capacity region, i.e., the throughput region that can be supported subject to deadline constraints, which allows us to quantify the potential gain of application-level scheduling. Simulation results show that application-level scheduling can improve the system capacity significantly while guaranteeing the deadline constraints.	channel capacity;crew scheduling;delay-tolerant networking;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput	Huasen Wu;Xiaojun Lin;Xin Liu;Youguang Zhang	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2015.2416256	priority inversion;fair-share scheduling;database index;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;throughput;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;operating system;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;least slack time scheduling;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	16.97726227595595	95.3402506911975	70714

In contrast, in the transmission with the network coding, an intermediate node is able to code the input information from multiple links and outputs the coded information. The multicast using the network coding can achieve higher information rate than the traditional multicast [1]. Hence the network coding is attracting much attention as a method for multicast. Furthermore, it is known that linear coding in each node is sufficient to multicast in such a rate [2]. Accordingly in this paper, we only deal with the linear network coding. In the following, the network coding refers to the linear network coding, and the single source multicast is considered. For practical realization of the network coding, we should consider delay in the information transmission and delay is not always constant in time. Because of timevarying delay, a sink may sometimes fail to decode transmitted information depending on the structure of the network and coding. However, in most of past research of the network coding, it was assumed that there is constant delay that does not change in time or that there is no delay of information transmission [1]–[4]. The drawback in these researches is that each node have to wait for coding until all the information reaches to the node when there is time-varying delay. This means that the buffer for coding by nodes is necessary and that transmission delay unnecessary accumulates in every node. As a research considering time-varying delay, Chou et al. proposed a scheme by employing generation [5].

The packet delay includes the queue waiting time and the service time. In this work, we study the effect of both the scheduling and the power allocation algorithms on the delay performance of the SUs. rnTo study the delay due to the service time we study a multichannel system where the channels are sensed sequentially, we study the tradeoff between throughput and delay. The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping rule problem where there is a tradeoff between the service time and the throughput. This tradeoff results from skipping low-quality channels to seek the possibility of finding high-quality ones in the future at the expense of a higher probability of being blocked from transmission since these future channels might be busy. rnOn the other hand, the queue waiting time is studied by considering a multi-user single channel system. Specifically, we study the effect of scheduling and power allocation on the delay performance of all SUs in the system. We propose a delay optimal algorithm that protects the PUs from harmful interference and provides the required delay guarantees to users. Conventional scheduling algorithms do not provide such guarantees if the interference channels are heterogeneous. This is because they are developed for conventional non-CR wireless systems that neglect interference since channels are orthogonal. rnFinally, we present two potential extensions to these studied problems.	cognitive radio;scheduling (computing)	Ahmed Emad Ewaisha	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;computer network	HCI	12.596012642371932	94.72734291132124	70746

The proposed Variable Packet Length Adaptive Protocol (VPLAP) belongs to the family of learning-automata-based protocols, which resolves most drawbacks that fixed-assignment protocols like time-division multiple access (TDMA) and RTDMA have. LTDMA, although belonging to this same family, suffers from reduced channel usage, wasted timeslots as well as network equipment overloading due to its fixed-sized timeslots. VPLAP, on the other hand, is tested using real LAN traffic traces and is proved not only to be successfully resolving the above issues but also being able to achieve a high throughput-delay performance when operating under realistic traffic conditions.	access control;automata theory;function overloading;learning automata;network packet;throughput;tracing (software);transmitter	Georgios I.

To fully exploit and reuse the frequencies, directional antennas are installed on base stations BSs to divide the coverage into a number of equal-sized sectors. When traffic is unevenly distributed across the sectors in a BS, channel utilization in every sector may become very different; low-traffic sectors may be underutilized while high-traffic sectors may be overutilized. A CRP scheme is thus proposed to more efficiently utilize free channels among sectors. CRP aims at reducing the dropping probabilities of handoff calls. Specifically, when free channels in a sector are not available, a handoff call, instead of being dropped, is allowed to preempt an ongoing call residing in the overlapping region of two adjacent sectors or two neighbor cells. Under CRP, the preempted ongoing call will not be disconnected, because it can switch over its service to the BS of a neighbor cell or to another directional antenna of an adjacent sector. For the purpose of evaluation, we build an analytical model for the proposed CRP using six-tuple Markov chains. Analytical results show that the proposed CRP can significantly reduce the dropping probabilities of inter-sector handoff calls, particularly when traffic between two sectors is not evenly distributed.

The multiple paths method has been studied as a means to achieve dependable communication with tolerable failures. It recovers from failures on a network using the same packet on another path. Since the speed of a long-distance network becomes faster, dependable communication that tolerates network latency becomes more important. We built a prototype system of a multiple paths method supporting Gigabit Ethernet speed using GtrcNET1, a gigabit network testbed. We evaluated it and confirmed that it can continuously communicate even if a path fails, and it achieved a packet loss rate as low as the product of packet loss rates on both paths. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Because of ubiquitous coverage and global connectivity, cellular networks are playing a major role in the deployment of M2M communications. Due to some unique characteristics of M2M communication, supporting M2M applications in cellular networks is very challenging. One of such challenge is congestion in radio access network (RAN) during RACH procedure. This is because of the fact that there are large numbers of M2M devices which access the radio network at the same time. As a solution, we propose an adaptive RACH congestion management function (ARC) which specifies congestion handling method to be used by all M2M devices based on the current congestion condition of the network.	algorithm;compaq lte;gödel numbering;m2m (eclipse);machine to machine;network congestion;radio access network;simulation;software deployment;truncation error (numerical integration)	Mukesh Kumar Giluka;Aiswarya Prasannakumar;Nitish Rajoria;Tamma Bheemarjuna Reddy	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2013.6802879	radio access network;global network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;slow-start;computer network	Mobile	21.06899975997457	90.84659660719643	71398

Since a satellite component has been identified within UMTS, there is a need also to support SIP-based session establishment over satellite-UMTS (S-UMTS) to achieve an end-to-end seamless IP-based terrestrial/satellite network integration. To improve the session setup performance, a link layer retransmission based on the radio link control acknowledgement mode (RLC-AM) mechanisms is utilised. However the current RLC-AM procedure is found to be inefficient when applied to transactional-based applications such as session establishment. As such this paper proposes a scheme to alleviate this inefficiency and simulation results reveal that this scheme achieves a good compromise between delay and radio resource utilization under various channel conditions.	am broadcasting;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;rlc circuit;retransmission (data networks);seamless3d;signaling protocol;simulation;synchronous data link control;terrestrial television	Victor Yong Hwa Kueh;Rahim Tafazolli;Barry G.

This paper proposes a mobile quality-of-service (QoS) framework for heterogeneous IMS interworking. To reduce the handoff disruption time, this framework supports the IMS mobility based on the concept of session initiation protocol (SIP) multicast. In our approach, the mobility of a user equipment (UE) is modeled as a transition in the multicast group membership. With the concept of dynamic shifting of the multicast group's members, the flow of actual data packets can be switched to the new route as quickly as possible. To overcome mobility impact on service guarantees, UEs need to make QoS resource reservations in advance at neighboring IMS networks, where they may visit during the lifetime of the ongoing sessions. These locations become the leaves of the multicast tree in our approach. To obtain more efficient use of the scarce wireless bandwidth, our approach allows UEs to temporarily exploit the inactive bandwidths reserved by other UEs in the current IMS/access network. Analytic and simulation models are developed to investigate our resource reservation scheme. The results indicate that our scheme yields comparable performance to that of the previously proposed channel assignment schemes.	access network;algorithm;data rate units;denial-of-service attack;experiment;fifo (computing and electronics);glossary of computer graphics;ip multimedia subsystem;multicast;network packet;quality of service;queueing theory;routing;simulation;z/vm	Shun-Ren Yang;Wen-Tsuen Chen	2008	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2008.53	multicast;telecommunications;computer science;handover;resource management;operating system;system;distributed computing;session initiation protocol;mobile computing;ip multimedia subsystem;xcast;computer network	Mobile	1.7349736778418412	102.52260176768678	71615

In this paper, we address the problems in providing interactive functions for VBR encoded videos in a broadcast VoD system. A traffic smoothing scheme is proposed to support the VCR functions in delivering VBR videos over CBR channels by the staggered broadcasting protocol. By introducing a small buffering delay, the customers are able to join back to the broadcasting groups after the interactive functions. A system model is then developed to determine the optimal parameters such that the system can meet the delay requirement as well as provide the expected quality of service to the customers. The results show that the proposed system framework is very efficient in terms of bandwidth requirement and buttering delay to provide interactive VoD services.	case-based reasoning;data buffer;megabit;pin grid array;quality of service;scalability;smoothing;videocassette recorder;volume boot record	Wing-Fai Poon;Kwok-Tung Lo;Jian Feng	2007	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2007.894951	telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;variable bitrate;computer network	Visualization	-3.355769419630685	101.45507719878762	71628

Markers, one of the building blocks of a traffic conditioner play a major role for resource allocation in a Differentiated Services (DiffServ) network. The TCP dynamics make the design of a marker difficult in many respects. In this paper, we list out the issues related to designing a TCP-friendly marker and propose an intelligent two-colour marker, namely, memory-based marker (MBM) to address those issues. We then extend this concept for a three-colour marker, memorybased three-colour marker (MBTCM), to be deployed for the assured forwarding per-hop behaviour in a DiffServ network. We illustrate the benefits of the MBTCM over time sliding window three-colour marker. The markers were implemented in NS simulator and extensive simulations were done to study their behaviours. Our results show significant improvement in TCP performance, especially in achieving fairness among priority flows with distinct round trip times, windows, and target rates. The markers are capable of protecting TCP flows in cases of congestion caused by the unruly UDP flows. We also investigate the impact of coexisting assured service UDP flows on the assurance to the TCP flows. The major benefits of our markers are its simplicity, least sensitivity to parameters and transparency to the end hosts. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Especially, in capillary machine-to-machine (M2M) where wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a key technology for its wireless connectivity, a contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial to enable numerous M2M devices to concurrently access the channel. This paper presents an analytical model for the slotted directional-CSMA-CA mechanism of 802.15.3c networks under saturated environment. By presenting a multi-class approach of directional-CSMA-CA mechanism to reduce collision occurrences, we support an adaptive back-off exponent of M2M device on the required frame payload size. For the mathematical analysis, the discrete-time Markov chain model is applied with the features of PHY/MAC of millimeter Wave (mm-Wave) network and the effects of directional antennas. In addition, extensive simulations are performed to verify the analytical model. The obtained results of the analytic and simulation show that the collision probability of M2M device is reduced by differentially adapting the contention rate to each M2M device, and the fairness property can be improved because there are remarkable increases of opportunities to transmit short-frame payloads.	access control;differentiated service;fairness measure;machine to machine;markov chain;phy (chip);profiling (computer programming);simulation;steady state;throughput	Hyunhee Park;Changhoon Lee;Yang Sun Lee;Eui-Jik Kim	2015	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-015-1450-8	markov chain;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.84430516360437	94.49045002216576	71690

We also propose a saturation compensator which can improve the performance of AQM schemes when routers have small buffer. At last, using PI as an example we propose PI with saturation compensator whose performance is evaluated through NS2 simulations.	active queue management;router (computing)	Wen-hua Dou;He-ying Zhang	2005		10.1007/11590354_142	input/output;active traffic management;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;bicarbonate buffering system;operating system;distributed computing;grid;saturation;computer network	Metrics	-0.5774996121065894	102.22768583651806	71907

Typical optimal algorithms require solving an NP-hard subproblem. To meet the challenge, one stream of research focuses on finding simpler suboptimal algorithms that have low complexity but high efficiency in practice. In this paper, we study the performance guarantee of one such scheduling algorithm, the longest-queue-first (LQF) algorithm. It is known that the LQF algorithm achieves the full capacity region, <formula formulatype=""""inline""""><tex Notation=""""TeX"""">$\Lambda $</tex></formula>, when the interference graph satisfies the so-called local pooling condition.

The contribution of this paper is to describe three new achievable rate regions, which are larger than the previously known regions. In particular, the new regions include all the extreme points of the capacity region and are not convex in general. We also discover a counterintuitive phenomenon in which increasing the arrival rate may sometime help to stabilize the network. This phenomenon can be well explained using the theory developed in this paper."""	algorithm;approximation algorithm;catastrophic interference;dvd region code;degeneracy (graph theory);fractional coloring;graph coloring;graph theory;interference (communication);linear programming;low-rank approximation;matching (graph theory);np-hardness;nonlinear system;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);software bug	Bo Li;Cem Boyaci;Ye Xia	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2201691	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;information theory;wireless network;mathematics;statistics	Theory	17.30510278809789	95.17727847604202	72019
74388f68d1581530328ce4df282432902a207ffa	a distributed cooperative mac protocol with relay collision avoidance for wireless ad hoc networks		In wireless ad hoc networks, cooperative transmission is an efficient way to increase information reliability and improve network throughput. However, the packet collisions caused by the contention of multiple cooperative nodes limit this advantage. In this paper, a distributed cooperative MAC (CMAC) protocol with relay collision avoidance is proposed. Based on the statistical probability of the channel gains between any two nodes, a new method for calculating the contention waiting time of multiple cooperative nodes is proposed. Each cooperative node relays the packet of the sender according to its cooperation capability. The method can guarantee that the node with higher cooperation capability accesses the channel earlier, and greatly decrease the collision probability of the cooperative nodes with the similar cooperation capability (i.e., similar access waiting times). Simulation results show that compared with the energy aware CMAC and random CMAC protocols, the proposed protocol can reduce the collision probability, and achieve the optimal normalized throughput and energy utilization.	cooperative mimo;high-throughput satellite;hoc (programming language);network packet;one-key mac;relay;simulation;throughput	Shan Wu;Kai Liu;Wenzhu Zhang;Zhen Xu;Feng Liu;Xiling Luo	2018	2018 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2018.8343134	computer network;frequentist probability;throughput;collision;distributed computing;computer science;relay;network packet;communication source;wireless ad hoc network;communication channel	Mobile	7.59143288036619	90.52342970953845	72111

Then the proposed method can keep the throughput of the primary user and the channel utilization rate can be improved by sharing the primary user and secondary user traffic.

For MANETs that use a single channel, the communication performance decreases due to interferences between nodes when frames are being relayed. In this paper, we propose a priority control scheme based on neighbor node behavior for MANETs. A node continuously monitors neighbor nodes and determines a transmission priority on its own using monitoring results; the priority decreases when the node transmits a frame successfully, and increases when the node detects a transmitted frame from neighbor nodes. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed scheme using simulations, and results show that the throughput of our proposed scheme is at least approximately 700 kb/s higher than that of a MANET that uses IEEE 802.11a.	data rate units;hoc (programming language);network topology;random graph;simulation;throughput	Daiki Nobayashi;Yutaka Fukuda;Takeshi Ikenaga	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115178	wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;exposed node problem;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	7.359167396197856	89.16714500213759	72233

MHWMP adaptively selects between spatial multiplexing and beamforming for data transmission according to the wireless channel conditions. We also modified the traditional RTS/CTS mechanism to take into account the different behaviors of both transmission modes at MAC layer: the advantages of diversity are harvested by sending RTS/CTS frames with space time block coding in case of beamforming while standard RTS/CTS frames are used in case of spatial multiplexing. Simulation results illustrate that MHWMP leads to significant better throughput and delay performance in certain situations. Moreover, it enables a high degree of robustness wrt. wireless link failures for stationary mesh networks.	beamforming;carpal tunnel syndrome;mesh networking;overhead (computing);phy (chip);quality of service;rs-232;routing;simulation;smart antenna;spatial multiplexing;stationary process;throughput;wireless mesh network	Muhammad Irfan Rafique;Marco Porsch;Thomas Bauschert	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134098	telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.56118128661908	91.00982698409794	72379

However, previous strict SFF approaches invested the short flows with excessive preference leading to the starvation of other long flows. Moreover, these SFFs are hard to be deployed due to either extreme complexity or the modification of TCP protocol. Inspired by the fairness and practicality of deficit round robin (DRR), we proposed a novel scheduling mechanism, namely deficit round robin with short flow first (DRR-SFF), which improves the performance of short flows with limited penalizing long flows. DRR-SFF uses weighed DRR to schedule short and long flows respectively and treats long flows more fairly. Through trace-driven simulation, we show that the mean transmission time and loss rate of short flows under DRR-SFF are significantly reduced compared with FIFO scheduling using DropTail. Meanwhile, the performance of long flows under DRR-SFF does not degrade much, retaining to that of FIFO scheduling. Our results demonstrate DRR-SFF is superior to strict SFF approaches, as the latter drives long flows into starvation in our simulations. Moreover, DRR-SFF inherits the O(1) computation complexity of DRR, which makes it easy to be deployed in edge routers.	algorithm;computation;deficit round robin;fifo (computing and electronics);fairness measure;router (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation	Changhua Sun;Lei Shi;Chengchen Hu;Bin Liu	2007	International Conference on Networking and Services (ICNS '07)	10.1109/ICNS.2007.54	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Networks	-2.2307223314962146	93.91718546085194	72425

Receptivity is basically defined as the probability that a rejection of a communication request does not occur, i.e., it is the probability that the network will be receptive to all expected concurrent communication requests. A graph-theoretic result is derived which places upper bounds on the maximum number of concurrently communicating origin-destination pairs which a given computer network can accommodate. The bound is dependent on several important network parameters including the number of network links, the maximum link capacity, and a measure of the network's average minimum hop distance. The upper bound result is used as a basis for estimating receptivity. The estimate for receptivity compares favorably with simulated values of receptivity for several example networks. >		John K.

4ea9bb2a55e1cf445eba1bbb9e943ad5f9b06a49	context-aware retransmission scheme for increased reliability in platooning applications	telekommunikation;telecommunications	Recent advances in cooperative driving hold the potential to significantly improve safety, comfort and efficiency on our roads. An application of particular interest is platooning of vehicles, where reduced inter-vehicle gaps lead to considerable reductions in fuel consumption. This, however, puts high requirements on timeliness and reliability of the underlying exchange of control data. Considering the difficult radio environment and potentially long distances between communicating platoon members, as well as the random channel access method used by the IEEE 802.11p standard for short-range inter-vehicle communication, those requirements are very difficult to meet. The relatively static topology of a platoon, however, enables us to preschedule communication within the platoon over a dedicated service channel. Furthermore, we are able to set aside parts of the available bandwidth for retransmission of packets in order to fulfil the reliability requirements stated by the platoon control application. In this paper, we describe the platooning framework along with the scheduling algorithm used to assign retransmission slots to control packets that are most likely to need them. This retransmission scheduling scheme offers a valuable tool for system designers when answering questions about the number of safely supported vehicles in a platoon, achievable reductions in inter-vehicle gaps and periodicity of control packets.	algorithm;bibo stability;digraphs and trigraphs;network packet;overhead (computing);parallel redundancy protocol;quasiperiodicity;reliability engineering;requirement;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);unicast;xfig	Annette Böhm;Magnus Jonsson;Kristina Kunert;Alexey V.

A solution to enable signaling transport over IP is defined by the IETF SIGTRAN framework that allows for interworking with the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7). SIGTRAN is based on the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) that also has a built-in redundancy mechanism, which allows switching to an alternative destination address (failover). Existing work showed that a failover performance comparable to SS7 can be achieved by aggressively setting the SCTP protocol parameters. However, this brings about possible stability issues because these parameter settings seriously impair the protocol mechanisms responsible for reacting to delay variations and congestion situations. We propose a set of network redundancy mechanisms that resolve most network failures transparently to SCTP. In order to eliminate possible stability issues, we use the default SCTP protocol parameters. Simulation results confirm that the proposed architecture can noticeably improve the robustness to concurrent network failures and achieve a similar delay behavior without jeopardizing the protocol stability	circuit switching;delay-gradient congestion control;failover;high availability;most bus;network congestion;signalling system no. 7;simulation	René Rembarz;Stephan Baucke;Petri Mähönen	2005	2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2005.1651854	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;circuit switching;computer network	Networks	-4.073464776258548	93.17791923104791	72754

A critical challenge in high data rate UWB system design is that a receiver usually needs tens of micro-seconds or even tens of milliseconds to synchronize with the transmitted signals, known as the timing acquisition problem. Such a long synchronization time will cause significant overhead, since the data rate of UWB systems is expected to be very high. To address the overhead problem, we previously proposed a general framework for MAC protocols in high data rate UWB networks. In this framework, a node can aggregate multiple upper-layer packets into a larger burst frame at the MAC layer. In this paper, we analyze the unsaturated throughput performance of a burst-frame-based MAC protocol within the framework. Numerical results from the analytical method give excellent agreement with the simulation results, indicating the accuracy of our analytical method.	aggregate data;computer simulation;data rate units;hoc (programming language);numerical method;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);systems design;throughput;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Kejie Lu;Dapeng Wu;Yuguang Fang;Robert Caiming Qiu	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

Most admission control schemes proposed to date do not ensure differentiation among the users at different priority levels. Also, they do not provide fairness among the users with the same priority. This paper proposes a novel RAC scheme for Long Term Evolution (LTE-Advanced) networks based on the combined idea of complete sharing and virtual partitioning. It introduces a step wise degradation scheme, to prioritize the high priority traffic in state of resource limitations. A detailed and comprehensive simulation is performed in Opnet to show the efficiency of the proposed RAC scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RAC scheme minimizes the call blocking probability and adheres extremely well to the bandwidth constraints of different traffic types.	blocking (computing);compaq lte;elegant degradation;erlang (unit);fairness measure;internet access;oracle rac;priority queue;radio resource management;simulation	Fatima Furqan;Doan B.

In this paper, we introduced a new partially preemptive scheduling technique with QoS support. The technique is capable of handling data bursts in parts and may use preemption due to the priorities of data bursts in a multi-service OBS network environment. Simulation studies suggest that more than 50% reduction in dropping probability and approximately 40% improvement in channel utilization is reachable at 0.8 load. The studies also reveal that the new scheduling technique has the ability to predict and control service performance differentiation among defined service classes.

The synchronized RACH-less handover solution offers significant reductions in the data connectivity interruption time at each handover, no need for random access in the target cell, and reduced overall handover execution time. Laboratory handover measurement results, using commercial LTE equipment, are presented and analyzed to justify the latency benefits of the proposed handover solution. Secondly, extensive system level simulation results are presented to further quantify the network level benefits. The results of these performance investigations reveal reduction of the interruption time at every handover from 55 ms (mean) to 5 ms and improvements in the radio link failure probability as a result of faster handover execution.	compaq lte;interrupt;random access;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation	Simone Barbera;Klaus I.

Although optimal spectrum assignment for secondary transmissions in CRNs is generally believed to be NP complete, the impact of fairness and link quality constraints on the hardness of the problem is not well studied. In this paper we show that when a minimum quality constraint is imposed on secondary transmissions, the spectrum assignment problem can be solved in polynomial time. However, such assignments may not guarantee fairness. We also show that when fairness is desired, even in the presence of quality constraints spectrum assignment problems remain NP complete. We then propose a tree pruning based algorithm to solve distance constrained spectrum assignment problem. We also discuss some heuristic techniques to solve fair distance constrained spectrum assignment problems in polynomial time.	algorithm;assignment problem;cognitive radio;fairness measure;heuristic;np-completeness;time complexity	Chetan Nanjunda Mathur;Mohamed A.

In the system centric view, we model the WLAN medium as a server that allocates its resources to users in a round Robin manner. This resource sharing model not only provides a simple model for the system, it also enables us to derive the channel service rate and the total delay incurred in transmitting a packet. For Poisson arrivals, the resource sharing model takes the form of an M/G/1/PS system with the mean delay being the same as that in an equivalent M/M/1 system. We then take a user centric view and model each user's queue as a separate G/G/1 queue. We derive the probability distributions for the different delay sources, i.e., random back-off time, random number of collisions and random number of successful transmissions from other users. This user centric model can provide insights into understanding access and queuing delays in 802.11 DCF. Finally, we discuss the utility of these models for functions such as capacity analysis, admission control and QoS enforcement.	design rule for camera file system;network packet;quality of service;queueing theory;random number generation;round-robin dns;server (computing);transmitter	Kamesh Medepalli;Fouad A.

Through tracing the status of the network buffer space we found that the payload of the on-chip network cannot get beyond an upper bound to avoid vicious congestion. Specifically, quarter of the total network buffer space is such a threshold, which is termed Quarter Load Threshold (QLT). Based on this fact we present the Quarter Load Threshold (QLT) flow control strategy. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated by the open source simulator Noxim [Noxim: Network-on-Chip Simulator, http://sourceforge.net/projects/noxim, 2008]. Simulation results show that the on-chip network runs smoothly and no serious congestion is encountered any more.	flow control (data);network on a chip;wormhole switching	Minghua Tang;Xiaola Lin	2010	Journal of Systems Architecture - Embedded Systems Design	10.1016/j.sysarc.2010.05.012	chip;embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;distributed computing;network operations center;network on a chip;upper and lower bounds;computer network	Embedded	-3.3384724026359494	92.7433542364008	73259

The multi-path uploading capability of the cooperative network provides new opportunities by optimally allocating the packets into multiple paths to reduce end-to-end file uploading delay, thus improve the end user experience. In this paper, we formulate the delay minimization problem as an optimization task which is then studied using evolutionary algorithm (EA). Particularly, we perform a comprehensive investigation on two EA methods, namely, a simple mutation-based method and then the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) for minimizing the uploading delay. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate their near-optimal performance, where the CMA-ES is shown to generate more efficient and robust results. The insights from this paper serves to provide some guidelines in future platform and application development.	brute-force search;cma-es;computation;end-to-end encryption;evolution strategy;evolutionary algorithm;internet protocol suite;mathematical optimization;mobile app;mobile device;network packet;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;optimization problem;simulation;upload;user experience;user-generated content	Ge Zhang;Yonggang Wen;Yew-Soon Ong	2013	2013 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504184	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	19.05711756618766	98.23505891575331	73361

Motivated by the problem computational complexity, we demonstrate here how a one-size-fits-all optimal algorithm cannot be expected and introduce a framework that decomposes the problem in two core sub-problems: Selecting which subset of wireless links to activate and for how long. This modular approach enables the construction of algorithms that can yield solutions ranging from simple and intuitive to exact optimal. We provide a comprehensive set of design strategies and results to elucidate how different combinations within the framework modules can be used to approach optimality.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;fits;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;multicast;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter	Qing He;Vangelis Angelakis;Anthony Ephremides;Di Yuan	2012	2012 International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications		mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;scheduling	Embedded	16.520052502125168	94.39279369515192	73463

Focus is placed on networks where interference is strong and nodes transmit orthogonally over a set of parallel channels. Convergence of the developed stochastic schemes is characterized, and the average queue delays are obtained in closed form.	algorithm;channel state information;convex optimization;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;stochastic approximation	Antonio Garcia Marques;Georgios B.

Efficiency of vertical handovers depends on the appropriate QoS of the users using mobile devices. One of the most important QoS parameters is the throughput between the base stations and the mobiles. The focus of this paper is to show how IEEE 802.21 standard for media – independent handover services supports mobility and traffic type (voice, video) between UMTS, WiMAX and WLAN networks. In particular, duration of the vertical handover process between UMTS, WiMAX and WLAN is examined (using different mobile terminal speed and traffic type). In order to test the efficiency of vertical handovers, throughput performance during the vertical handovers between heterogeneous networks is also researched in this paper. A novel method for analyzing the vertical handover performance is invented and new conclusions are presented from the simulation results.	access network;mobile device;mobile phone;performance;quality of service;simulation;throughput	Kire Jakimoski;Toni Janevski	2009		10.1145/1653543.1653557	telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	7.4605926995449305	98.58935626285522	73557

In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a vertical handover scheme, which is for users that move between different types of networks. In this article a seamless mobility handover scheme is presented. The novelty of the proposed scheme is that handover is fully controlled by the terminal. To improve the performance of the proposed handover scheme, a network discovery algorithm with fuzzy logic and a handover decision algorithm using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) based on vague sets are derived, which are both user-centric. With these algorithms, the handover scheme is power-saving, cost-aware, and performance-aware. Simulation results show that the novel handover scheme can perform network discovery in time to reduce handover dropping rate and present unnecessary activation of its interface to save the battery power, while effectively choose the optimum network through making trade-off among the user preference, network condition, and system performance. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

1e0c1887dda8c61bae98fa112a06230b94bfb267	offloading performance evaluation for network coding-based cooperative mobile video streaming		Nowadays, video streaming has became one of the most popular multimedia applications and will be the dominant data traffic in cellular networks. This is a real challenge for mobile network operators because the cellular base stations will be overloaded. One promising solution to offload mobile traffic from the base stations is the use of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. Each mobile phone can use both cellular and Wi-Fi network interfaces to download video segments either from the Internet or from a neighboring device. However, it is crucial to improve the reliability of D2D communications to maximize the offloading benefits. In this paper, we use network coding to address the reliability in cooperative D2D-based transmission of video streaming. We have implemented Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) on the CoopStreaming system and evaluate the offloading gain. The experimental results show that the use of network coding has significantly improved the reliability of D2D communications among neighboring devices and therefore increased the cellular offloading gain.	download;internet;linear network coding;mobile phone;network packet;performance evaluation;real-time transcription;streaming media;testbed;throughput	Lamara Aymen;Baoliu Ye;Thi Mai Trang Nguyen	2016	2016 7th International Conference on the Network of the Future (NOF)	10.1109/NOF.2016.7810117	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	3.350363046828908	91.73628550530205	73657

Specifically, we design a software module that performs realistic analysis of the network performance, by utilizing real physical layer traces of a 4G satellite service. Based on these traces, our software module produces equivalent link layer traces, as a function of the chosen link layer reliability mechanism. We further utilize the link layer traces within the ns-2 network simulator to evaluate the impact of link layer schemes on the performance of selected TCP variants. We consider erasure coding, ARQ and Hybrid-ARQ link layer mechanisms, and TCP Cubic, Compound, Hybla, New Reno and Westwood. We show that, for all target TCP variants, when the throughput of the transport protocol is close to the channel capacity, using the ARQ mechanism is most beneficial for TCP performance improvement. In conditions where the physical channel error rate is high, Hybrid-ARQ results in the best performance for all TCP variants considered, with up to 22% improvements compared to other schemes.	channel capacity;erasure code;hybrid automatic repeat request;network performance;retransmission (data networks);throughput;tracing (software)	Nicolas Kuhn;Emmanuel Lochin;Jérôme Lacan;Roksana Boreli;Laurence Clarac	2015	Int.

In the initial protocol specification, the required overhead could be rather large and this had an impact over the observed performance. We therefore include an improvement to reduce such overhead, by decreasing the header length. We describe an analytical model that can be used to assess the performance of the proposed scheme. We also use an implementation within the ns-3 framework to assess the correctness of this model and to broaden the analysis, considering different performance indicators and more complex network topologies. In all cases, the proposed solution clearly outperforms a more traditional approach, in which the TCP protocol is used as a means to offer a reliable communication service.	block size (cryptography);complex network;control system;correctness (computer science);fairness measure;flow network;linear code;linear network coding;mesh networking;network congestion;network topology;open research;overhead (computing);rlc circuit;routing;simulation;upwind scheme;wireless mesh network	Pablo Garrido;David Gómez;Jorge Lanza;Joan Serrat;Ramón Agüero	2017	MONET	10.1007/s11036-016-0731-7	linear network coding;computer network;ieee 802.11;computer science;performance indicator;protocol overhead;wireless network;distributed computing;real-time computing;correctness;transmission control protocol;network topology	HPC	0.042740640644490464	90.6051080023391	73844

In this paper, we address the problem of gateways placement, that consists of minimizing the number of gateways while satisfying performance requirements of the APs. Along with the placement problem, the formulation includes the jointly routing and scheduling to account for the problem of interference and to enable spacial reuse. The problem, that we coined GPSRP, allows a much more efficient use of the available resources and reduces overall gateway costs.

After briefly presenting previous efforts to ameliorate TCP performance in the considered environments, we propose a new mechanism for tackling the slowdown problems caused by handovers. Our mechanism is based on stochastic datagram relocation. Traffic destined to the mobile terminal is tunneled to and cached into adjacent cells according to the output of a path prediction algorithm. To reduce the associated overhead, only percentages of inbound traffic are copied to the cell’s neighborhood on the basis of estimated probabilities. The time scheduling for datagram relocation is also taken into account. Simulations of the proposed architecture show substantial performance improvements for TCP traffic.	access network;algorithm;cpu cache;computer simulation;datagram;inbound marketing;low-pass filter;mobile phone;offset binary;overhead (computing);ppa (complexity);relocation (computing);scheduling (computing)	Stamatis Papayiannis;Stathes Hadjiefthymiades;Lazaros F.

One of the possible approaches consists in having the secondary users locating and accessing vacant frequencies dynamically. However, in scenarios with hidden primary users (i.e., a secondary user cannot sense a primary user on its respective channel, but the two coverage areas overlap each other), it is unfeasible to address the protection of primary users with solutions which are exclusively based on local and non-cooperative sensing schemes. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach which enables an effective protection of primary users in fully distributed CR scenarios, even when the hidden node problem is a concern. Our proposal is based on a key concept we designate as “filtering based on suspect channels” and takes full advantage of any underlying learning scheme based on observation and past experience. It was also successfully integrated with an existing CR medium access control (MAC) protocol. Simulation results show the proposal is effectively capable of delivering high levels of protection concerning the primary users, while preserving the secondary users' communication performance.	access control;algorithm;cognitive radio;filter (signal processing);frequency band;interference (communication);quality of service;quorum sensing;real-time transcription;simulation	José Marinho;Edmundo Monteiro	2012	2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379107	filter;wireless ad hoc network;cognitive radio;prediction;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;software-defined radio;computer security;computer network	Mobile	19.939806609493157	93.02668021765187	73966

We consider several schemes for enhancing throughput and coverage for streaming multicast sessions by allowing intermediate nodes to relay information from the source. The schemes exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, and techniques such as received signal combining and network coding to enhance performance while guaranteeing that a constant streaming delay is experienced by every user. The performance metric used for comparison is the throughput achieved at a given area coverage probability. Specifically, we study techniques such as decode-and-forward, amplify-and-forward, and pipelining and compare their performances through simulations in the context of a cellular network with relays and show that significant performance benefits are obtained through such schemes	duplex (telecommunications);linear network coding;multicast;performance;pipeline (computing);pipelining (dsp implementation);relay;simulation;theory;throughput	Jay Kumar Sundararajan;Harish Viswanathan	2006	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

Admission control and traffic smoothing are among the most promising control techniques for an ATM network. This paper analyzes the performance of an ATM network when it is subject to admission control and traffic smoothing. Basically, an ATM switch is modeled as a discrete-time single server queueing system where a new call joins existing calls. Cell arrivals from a new call are assumed to follow a general distribution. It is also assumed that the aggregated arrivals of cells from the existing calls form batch arrivals with a general distribution for the batch size and a geometric distribution for the interarrival times between batches. Both finite and infinite buffer cases are considered. An exact analysis is developed to obtain the waiting time distribution and cell loss probability for a new call and for existing calls. Numerical examples are also shown to investigate how the network performance depends on the statistics of a new call (burstiness, time that a call stays in active or inactive state, etc.) and to demonstrate the effectiveness of admission control and traffic smoothing.	atm turbo;cell signaling;network performance;network traffic control;queueing theory;server (computing);smoothing	Masayuki Murata;Yuji Oie;Tatsuya Suda;Hideo Miyahara	1990	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.53020	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;integrated services digital network;statistics;computer network	Networks	-0.4465138651837149	99.77677091486166	74002

In iHOPE, neighbor base stations receive media data packets from a server and transcode it for a mobile host in advance. When the mobile host enters a new cell, the base station of the cell immediately forwards the transcoded media data packet to the mobile host. This paper describes the intelligent handoff protocol and the media data transcoding mechanism. We evaluate our approach with simulation results.

A set of tasks with random origins and destinations characterized by a multi-tier computational structure is distributed on a network modeled as a graph. The distribution of execution times (or latencies) of all tasks is statically computed for several initial workloads and its sum is used as the target function to be optimized by Simulated Annealing. A canonical Monte Carlo simulation allows to analyze the network behavior at different levels of sub-optimality of resource management (achieved by changing the temperature). We first study the static transition to congestion of the whole network by varying temperature and workload. Then, we propose a method to approximately recover the evolution of the system in time, by interpolating the static latency probability distributions. This allows to study the dynamic transition to the congested phase by introducing a variable task-production rate, as usually studied in the literature, without the need of explicit time-consuming simulations. We are able to reproduce the main published results on network congestion and to gain a deeper insight over the maximum theoretical performance of a system and its sensitivity to sub-optimality of routing and load balancing.	computation;monte carlo method;network congestion;simulation	Marco Cogoni;Giovanni Busonera;Paolo Anedda;Gianluigi Zanetti	2017	J.

The main target of the multiple interfaces is to increase the communication reliability between the soldiers in the battlefield and the command center, so that if one of the interfaces fails, the other interfaces can still provide a communication path. In this case each application data stream is limited to use only one communication channel. Due to the limited and variable bandwidth of the wireless channels, as well as their lossy and break-prone nature, the performance of mobile applications can be greatly hurt. In this paper, we present a transport layer solution for aggregating the bandwidth of the available interfaces. Our solution is based on extending Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). Our choice to extend SCTP for bandwidth aggregation was motivated by its inherent support for multi-homing. The extended SCTP, which we refer to as Load Sharing-SCTP (LS-SCTP), is able to aggregate the bandwidth of all the active transmission paths between the communicating endpoints. In addition, LS-SCTP dynamically adds/drops communication paths to the aggregated paths bundle. To ensure that the aggregate connection will not stall due to the high loss rate or continuous failure of individual paths, LS-SCTP includes path monitoring and packet assignment mechanisms that distribute the packets on the paths according to their current condition. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in providing throughput and reliability to mobile applications under battle-	aggregate data;bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);flow control (data);least squares;link-state routing protocol;linux;lossy compression;mobile app;mobile phone;multihoming;multiple homing;network congestion;network packet;robustness (computer science);scalability;simulation;throughput	Ahmed Abd El Al;Tarek N.

8b3da4b1c0869fe54107027388f54e8fa9fc14d0	fuzzy multi-attribute utility based network selection approach for high-speed railway scenario		Due to the complexity and fluctuation of the wireless network state in high-speed mobility scenarios, the existing works related to network selection face a great challenge for selecting the accurate network in terms of the imprecise information and mobility. Therefore, we design a novel dynamic imprecise-aware network selection approach, named FSNS by taking advantage of fuzzy logic and utility function of multiple attributes. Our proposed approach not only copes with imprecise network information but also dynamically adapts to the high-speed mobility scenarios, which are not presented for the existing proposals. In this paper, we compare FSNS approach with an enhanced TOPSIS method through simulation experiments of two types of services. The results demonstrate that FSNS outperforms TOPSIS for a preferable decision to keep relatively stable and reduce abnormal selection. The conclusions of experimental results have some extent pragmatic value because the simulation imitates network state in the high-speed mobile environment by real world data from high-speed railways.	experiment;fuzzy logic;quality of service;requirement;simulation;software deployment;universal conductance fluctuations;utility	Xiaoyun Yan;Ping Dong;Tao Zheng;Hongke Zhang;Shui Yu	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254739	type of service;fuzzy logic;wireless network;real-time computing;quality of service;topsis;computer science;mobile telephony;heterogeneous wireless network;multi-attribute utility	Mobile	8.770072134443483	98.564208642294	74829
0ddc230535b3726b1246c203d9d0714ac225874f	practical recovery solution for information loss in real-time network environment		— Feedback mechanism based algorithms are frequently used to solve network optimization problems. These schemes involve users and network exchanging information (e.g. requests for bandwidth allocation and pricing) to achieve convergence towards an optimal solution. However, in the implementation, these algorithms do not guarantee that messages will be delivered to the destination when network congestion occurs. This in turn often results in packet drops, which may cause information loss, and this condition may lead to algorithm failing to converge. To prevent this failure, we propose least square (LS) estimation algorithm to recover the missing information when packets are dropped from the network. The simulation results involving several scenarios demonstrate that LS estimation can provide the convergence for feedback mechanism based algorithm.	computation;converge;dspace;failure;feedback;flow network;genetic algorithm;least squares;linear equation;link-state routing protocol;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;net neutrality;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;real-time transcription;simulation	Hengky Susanto;Byung-Guk Kim	2016	CoRR		network traffic control;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-3.18146735032249	89.03397908907445	74861

This paper focuses on the design of a channel-adaptive QoS-supporting framework for radio resource management in WiMAX networks with fixed subscriber stations. The base station generates resource grants on the basis of (i) flow-based bandwidth requests, (ii) monitored link conditions to each subscriber station, and (iii) minimum resource requirements by high-demanding flows. A compensation technique that mitigates the negative effects caused by impairments on the radio channel is also presented.

We introduce the requirements for macro Mobile QoS as mobility features and predict required resources in each routing paths thorough the combined analysis of average movement pattern and pre-defined handoff dropping probability. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can guarantee the pre-defined handoff dropping probability and maintain lower call blocking probability and higher resource utilization than other schemes.

In extensive numerical experiments, we study the impact of heterogeneity in the round-trip times on user-level characteristics such as throughputs and flow transmission times, thus quantifying the resulting bias.

The downlink user traffic performance impacts by the proposed MLB operation has been evaluated and compared through computer simulations in the paper. According to the results, we found that the proposed MLB algorithm achieve MLB gain of as much as 4.1% in average throughput and 12.9% in average delay, and MLB cost of as much as 1.3% in average standard deviation on mobile user equipments (UEs). On the other hand, with regard to fixed UEs, we obtained no MLB gain in average throughput, and MLB cost of as much as 5.5% in average delay and 2.7% in average standard deviation. These results inform that the proposed MLB algorithm is more efficient to mobile UEs than fixed UEs in association with user traffic impact aspect.	algorithm;compaq lte;computer simulation;load balancing (computing);organizing (structure);self-organization;telecommunications link;throughput	Sangchul Oh;Hongsoog Kim;Jeehyeon Na;Yeongjin Kim;Sungoh Kwon	2016	2017 XVII Workshop on Information Processing and Control (RPIC)	10.1007/978-3-319-46301-8_17	throughput;handover;standard deviation;self-organizing network;telecommunications link;mobile telephony;computer network;load balancing (computing);computer science	HPC	21.539209858814253	92.48932754741759	75545

9eb3d2d85a5f0a789b450cca81bbbc59fc406e36	a survey on nb-iot downlink scheduling: issues and potential solutions		The NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is one of the most promising technologies that fits the requirements of the low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). NB-IoT targets on supporting communications for small amount of data during a relatively long period of time (i.e., delay tolerant), which is one of the key features of IoT applications. Several studies have been conducted by some standard working groups to define the standards for NB-IoT. For example, the working group 3GPP aims to provide communication protocols with low energy consumption, good coverage penetration, and so on. Compared with the existing wireless communication protocols, less spectrum is allocated for NB-IoT. Thus, how to more efficiently use the resource/spectrum (i.e., resource allocation and scheduling) is one of the key issues. In this paper, we first describe the design of the physical layer for the downlink communication, especially the scheduling process. Secondly, we discuss the issues for resource allocation in NB-IoT while the delay requirement in the physical layer is satisfied.

It is connection oriented and it can provide very high data rates, large service coverage, and flexible quality of services (QoS). Due to the large number of connections and flexible QoS supported by WiMAX, the uplink access in WiMAX networks is very challenging since the medium access control (MAC) protocol must efficiently manage the bandwidth and related channel allocations. In this paper, we propose and investigate a cost-effective WiMAX bandwidth management scheme, named the WiMAX partial sharing scheme (WPSS), in order to provide good QoS while achieving better bandwidth utilization and network throughput. The proposed bandwidth management scheme is compared with a simple but inefficient scheme, named the WiMAX complete sharing scheme (WCPS). A maximum entropy (ME) based analytical model (MEAM) is proposed for the performance evaluation of the two bandwidth management schemes. The reason for using MEAM for the performance evaluation is that MEAM can efficiently model a large-scale system in which the number of stations or connections is generally very high, while the traditional simulation and analytical (e.g., Markov models) approaches cannot perform well due to the high computation complexity. We model the bandwidth management scheme as a queuing network model (QNM) that consists of interacting multiclass queues for different service classes. Closed form expressions for the state and blocking probability distributions are derived for those schemes. Simulation results verify the MEAM numerical results and show that WPSS can significantly improve the network’s performance compared to WCPS.	access control;bandwidth management;blocking (computing);computation;connection-oriented communication;erlang (unit);interaction;markov chain;markov model;network model;network packet;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;principle of maximum entropy;provisioning;quality of service;simulation;telecommunications link;theory;throughput	Yue Li;Jianhua He;Weixi Xing	2008	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2008.02.001	wimax;bandwidth management;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	HPC	4.240872728845904	97.93503409619227	75825

In the FA field, the communication mechanism which is intended to the short frame transmissions under real-time, safety and fair distribution between the industrial robots (iRBs) is now being investigated. We offer two proposals to achieve such goals. The first proposal is an advanced round-robin iWLAN transmission protocol whose operation is strictly controlled by a precise synchronous scheduling mechanism. The second offer is a novel multiple downlink (DL) access, called Packet Division Multiple Access (PDMA) that removes significant overheads caused by traditional multiple access techniques. For protocol scheme, the analysis results show that, under safety period constraint our proposal incredibly improves the throughput as compared with that of the conventional industrial Point Coordination Function (iPCF). For multiple DL access scheme, the simulation results prove that the offered PDMA technique provides much better than conventional Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) technique on both Packet Error Rate (PER) and throughput. Further, with the accomplishment of being better than 100 microseconds (μs) for the control duration per iRB, the proposed techniques completely satisfy the real time requirement for our FA control system.	automation;bit error rate;control system;industrial robot;mobile data offloading;multi-user;real-time clock;real-time transcription;robot control;round-robin dns;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;standard database management analysis;telecommunications link;throughput	Duc Khai Lam;Hisaya Urabe;Yasuhiro Shinozaki;Keishi Yamaguchi;Satoshi Morita;Yuhei Nagao;Masayuki Kurosaki;Hiroshi Ochi	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090504	communications protocol;synchronization;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;wireless lan controller;wi-fi array;computer network	Robotics	4.649194522709442	94.96535849358641	75863

These repair nodes keep in their buffers all packets that are likely to be requested by any of its receiver nodes. We address the issue of deciding how long these packets should be retained and present a buffer management scheme taking into account the fact that most packet losses happen during short error bursts. Under our scheme, receiver nodes do not normally acknowledge correctly received packets and repair nodes routinely discard packets after a reasonable time interval. Whenever a receiver node detects a transmission error, its send a negative acknowledgement to its repair node and start acknowledging up to k correctly received packets. Whenever a repair node receives a retransmission request, it stops discarding packets that have not been properly acknowledged until it has received k consecutive acknowledgements from each node that had requested a packet retransmission.	locality of reference;multicast;network packet;retransmission (data networks);scalability	Jinsuk Baek;Jehan-François Pâris	2005	PCCC 2005. 24th IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference, 2005.	10.1109/PCCC.2005.1460568	locality of reference;real-time computing;scalability;error detection and correction;reliable multicast;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;packet loss;transport layer;computer network;retransmission	Embedded	-0.8673165680472457	92.30034779396851	75919

The RPM algorithm uses packet marking on edge routers and selective dropping on core routers to provide perow speci cation of probabilistic QoS with guarantees ranging from best-e ort to hard reservation. RPM also supports multiple metrics for probabilistic level of service speci cation. All ow tables are managed only by the edge routers enhancing scalability of the approach. Unlike existing statistical multiplexing approaches, RPM uses a time-multiplexed priority tagging algorithm which provides higher control over ows guarantee levels.

The simulation tool combines the advantages of software and hardware modules. Recorded channel data are included. They allow the reproduction of realistic situations in the laboratory. Also, synchronization problems and noise are considered. As an example, stabilized slotted ALOHA access protocols were implemented and investigated in land-mobile Satellite environments. A slotted ALOHA-based modified channel access strategy for highly unreliable channels is proposed requiring all mobile stations to estimate the link quality before starting a transmission. The different strategies are analyzed by simulation as well as by analytical methods. Transmission parameters can be determined and optimized using a combination of analysis and simulation. The results show the power of our simulation tool and the better performance of stabilized slotted ALOHA with link-quality estimation in city channels.	performance evaluation;propagation constant;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;transmission line	Axel Böttcher;Axel Jahn;Marcella Lazzari	1993	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.219557	synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	7.38841541592957	94.74966127654248	76315

WirelessHART, as the first international standard for wireless process supervision and control has received notable academic attention. This paper models WirelessHART networks with link failures using Discrete-time Markov chains and evaluates the network performance in a typical WirelessHART environment with respect to delay and reachability. The evaluation shows that although the performance of WirelessHART is influenced by several factors, it is capable to deliver reliable service in typical industrial environments.

OCS is suitable for large amounts of data transmission; however, the channel utilization is inefficient when the traffic flows are intermittent. OPS can be easily adapted to any higher layer and is suitable for bursty traffic, but it requires a highly complex technology and optical buffer. The new switching paradigm, OBS, can provide higher bandwidth utilization and meanwhile avoid the complexity in OPS technology. In this paper, we investigate how the quality of service (QoS) can be guaranteed and reliable transmission can be supported in the OBS-based Internet backbone. We propose the adjustable-time-counter-based (ATCB) burst assembly and the non-real time packet retransmission mechanisms and apply them in the ingress router of the OBS Internet backbone to guarantee the quality of real time applications and lossless requirement of non-real time services. Moreover, traffic shaped is performed for real time packets in the egress router so that the real time property is preserved with a low jitter. Simulation results show that the burst blocking probability using the ATCB burst assembly is improved, compared with the time-counter-based (TCB) and burst-lengththreshold-based (BLTB) mechanisms. The delay, loss and jitter of real time service conform to the QoS requirement. Meanwhile, the delay of non-real time service also falls in the acceptable range. c © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, irregularity in radio range leads to asymmetric links that cause the loss of packets in different directions. In order to investigate its effect, the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM) is proposed that takes into account the irregularity of a radio range and estimates path losses in an anisotropic environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide details of the RIM model developed in the INET Framework of the OMNeT++ simulator that can be used to investigate the impact of radio irregularity on protocol performance.

8c8efa460b28ebefed7a6d1db8276a393a0e87e6	new bounds on the feedforward design of optical output buffer multiplexers and switches	lower bound;multiplexer;upper bound	We focus on non-conflicting construction of an optical multistage feedforward network to emulate the N-to-1 output buffer multiplexer by using switched fiber delay line (SDL). In [1], Y.T. Chen et al. presented a sufficient condition (an upper bound) for the number of delay lines required for such a multiplexer with variable length bursts. In this paper, we first give an improved upper bound. Then we develop a framework to construct an arrival case of bursts which can be used to achieve a necessary condition (a lower bound). These results are further extended to the feedforward construction of N-to-N output buffer switch. Through simulation and performance comparison, we find that the new bounds can significantly decrease the hardware cost for constructing both the feedforward SDL-based multiplexer and output buffer switch while still provide the same performance as that of the old ones. key words: optical buffer, switched delay line (SDL), fiber delay line (FDL), multiplexer, output buffer switch	analog delay line;burst error;entity–relationship model;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;gnu free documentation license;multiplexer;multistage amplifier;network switch;optical buffer;simulation	Xiaoliang Wang;Xiaohong Jiang;Susumu Horiguchi	2009	IEICE Transactions		telecommunications;computer science;upper and lower bounds;computer network	Theory	0.36635242116427785	96.62345765520344	76562

Specifically, we analyze the flow-level performance of two inter-carrier load balancing schemes and the gain engendered by Carrier Aggregation (CA). CA is one of the most important features of HSPA+ networks; it allows devices to be served simultaneously by several carriers. We propose Volume Balancing (VB) and Join the Fastest Queue (JFQ), a load-balancing mechanism that allows the traffic of non-CA users to be distributed over the aggregated carriers. We then evaluate the performance of both CA and non-CA users by means of analytical modeling. We show that the proposed schemes achieve efficient load balancing. We also investigate the impact of mixing traffic of CA and non-CA users in the same cell and show that performance is practically insensitive to the traffic mix.	fastest;load balancing (computing);mathematical model;ps (unix);scheduling (computing);throughput;vii	Florence Bénézit;Salah-Eddine Elayoubi;Raluca-Maria Indre;Alain Simonian	2014	2014 12th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2014.6850282	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	4.612123888972747	97.91938671050085	76700

Both link scheduling and broadcast scheduling are considered. In each instance scheduling algorithms are given that improve upon existing algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, it is shown that tree networks can be scheduled optimally, and that arbitrary networks can be scheduled so that the schedule is bounded by a length that is proportional to a function of the network thickness times the optimum. Previous algorithms could guarantee only that the schedules were bounded by a length no worse than the maximum node degree, the algorithms presented here represent a considerable theoretical improvement. Experimentally, a realistic model of a radio network is given and the performance of the new algorithms is studied. These results show that, for both types of scheduling, the new algorithms (experimentally) perform consistently better than earlier methods.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;experiment;hop;radio broadcasting;scheduling (computing);thickness (graph theory)	Subramanian Ramanathan;Errol L.

We use this model to characterize the cell residence time and obtain analytical results for the channel holding time, the distribution of which is of primary importance in teletraffic analysis of PCS networks. These results can be used to facilitate the computation together with the use of the partial fractional expansion technique. It is expected that the mobility model and the analytical results for channel holding time presented in this paper will play an significant role for field data processing in PCS network design and performance evaluation.

d1d4df1d41bf6b7a5a2503c398252c6fa0e4e2db	exemplified study of wred algorithm parameters influence on ip-based networks		Within the TCP/IP model, if the transport layer of multiple machines send too many packets at high speed, the network will be quickly overloaded and productivity of the system will sharply fall causing delay and packet loss. Congestion control, aimed at combating such situations requires collaboration between the network and transport layers. Since overload occurs on routers, their discovery has been on the side of network layer of TCP/IP protocol stack. However the reason for congestion is the traffic transmitted by the transport layer. Therefore, the only effective way to control congestion is slower packet transmission by transport protocols and algorithms. Weighted random early detection (WRED) is a queuing discipline for a network scheduler suited for congestion avoidance. It has an advantage in comparison with other congestion control techniques, but at the same time requires very correct settings. This paper examines the algorithm of the selecting the correct setting for the WRED algorithm on the example of the widespread corporate networks.	algorithm;internet protocol suite;weighted random early detection	Kuat Abdrau	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-25043-4_4	network layer;network scheduler;transport layer;packet loss;random early detection;weighted random early detection;network congestion;algorithm;network packet;computer science	ML	-2.8889092451028686	92.33196168254449	77171

In particular, the internally buffered switching architecture was shown, through distributed scheduling algorithms, to be able to sustain the current and expected increases in Internet throughput rates. In this paper, we propose a class of distributed scheduling algorithms for the internally buffered crossbar switching architecture. As will be shown, the distributed nature of these algorithms makes them of high practical value. That is, they can be implemented in real-time for high-speed input traffic. In addition, we will demonstrate, through simulation, that these scheduling algorithms outperform state-of-the-art related algorithms in this area.	algorithm;crossbar switch;network packet;network switch;packet switching;real-time computing;real-time transcription;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Lotfi Mhamdi;Mounir Hamdi	2003		10.1109/ICC.2003.1203883	fair-share scheduling;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;operating system;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;computer network	HPC	0.2583376038070693	93.62885131362349	77357

It aims to minimize access failure and handover signalling, while prioritizing UEs with high QoS level for differentiated cell selection. We formulate the problem of dynamic cell selection over a period of time into an optimization problem consisting of step-wise binary integer programs according to UE's moving speed. Simulation results show that our dynamic scheme achieves low access failure ratio in a highly overloaded network. More importantly, the proposed algorithm remarkably diminishes cell handover rate by 20% compared to a counterpart algorithm based on static optimization. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully controls cell acceptance and connected cell types by prioritizing with UE's QoS and moving speed.	access network;algorithm;linear programming;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quality of service;semantic network;simulation;unreal development kit	So-Yeon Park;Ji-Hyeon Kim;HyungJune Lee	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1007/s11277-015-3115-6	real-time computing;telecommunications;soft handover;computer network	EDA	22.171808143936328	94.13087388379783	77422

In particular, most current mobility models assume a free flow of nodes and do not consider how mobility is affected by interactions with other persons and with the physical environment. They also assume a closed system, not considering the effect of node arrival and departure. The structure of space in which the mobility occurs is either not considered at all, or only in a limited way. In this work, we address human pedestrian mobility for evaluation of wireless communication to determine which of the aforementioned aspects need to be captured and to what level of detail. We focus on opportunistic communication in the form of ad-hoc and delay-tolerant networks. For the evaluation, we use mobility models from the field of transportation and urban planning that are used for designing and dimensioning public spaces for comfort and safety of pedestrians in rush hour and emergency evacuation. The models capture micro-mobility of pedestrians better than most mobility models used in mobile networking since the application domain requires realistic representation of node interactions with the physical environment and with other nodes. Our results show that the free flow assumption used in most models does not have a significant performance impact. We also conclude that performance is not very sensitive to accurate estimation of the probability distributions of mobility parameters such as speed and arrival process. Our results, however, suggest that it is important to capture the scenario and space in which mobility occurs since these may affect performance significantly.	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;application domain;benchmark (computing);closed system;fits;hoc (programming language);interaction;legion (software);level of detail;open road tolling;population;stationary process;tracing (software);wireless access point	Ólafur Ragnar Helgason;Sylvia T.

We also develop an analytic model to predict the amount of energy saved and the packet delay. The algorithms are compared to the best known opportunistic method, and it is shown that they provide significantly greater power savings without inflicting noticeable delays to Internet traffic. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A closed-form solution for the maxhnm throughput of the switch under saturated conditions is derived. It is found that the maxlmmn throughput of the switch exceeds 99% with just four iterations of the PlM algorithm. Using the tugged input queue approach, an analytical model for evahtathtg the switch performance under an independent identically distributed Bernoulli trafllc with the cell destinations uniformly distributed over all output ports is developed. The switch throughput, mean cell delay, and cell loss probability are computed from the analytical model. The accuracy of the analytical model is verilled using simulation.	atm turbo;algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;input/output;interconnection;iteration;network switch;queue (abstract data type);simulation;throughput	Ge Nong;Jogesh K.

473be553cb0769129516ddf63f4de2f5399d945c	a macro-assisted cooperative edge caching in heterogeneous mobile networks		Caching at mobile edge network is considered as a promising solution, which can not only reduce the network traffic, but also alleviate the backhaul load and improve the quality of service. But most existing caching schemes do not well solve the problem of small cache size and the difficulty to predict content popularity in mobile edge network. In this paper, we propose a macro-assisted cooperative edge caching (MACEC) scheme, which contains a macro base station (MBS) and multiple small base stations (SBSs) within the coverage of the MBS. In addition, we also propose an URL Prefix Weight (URL-PW) Based caching strategy. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the distributed edge caching (DEC) scheme using the LRU strategy, the MACEC scheme using the URL-PW strategy can effectively improve the cache hit rate at least by 30%.	edge computing	Bingqian Li;Wenan Zhou;Xuhui Yang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61542-4_36	quality of service;computer network;computer science;macro;cpu cache;cache;backhaul (telecommunications);enhanced data rates for gsm evolution;base station	Robotics	22.98036678910569	94.88182356312207	77788

This paper compares the effect of traffic shaping and traffic policing on aggregate traffic dynamics especially stochastic properties on traffic time series. We propose a series of tests and compare the result obtained from OPNET Modeler simulation program to simulation with synthetic traffic generated by chaotic dynamic systems. We are interested in parameters such as Hurst parameter, autocorrelation function and variance for different shaping and policing techniques applied to input traffic in order to obtain smooth aggregate traffic trace.	aggregate data;aggregate function;autocorrelation;chaos theory;dynamical system;elegant degradation;gigabyte;hurst exponent;network traffic control;next-generation network;noise shaping;quality of service;self-similarity;simulation;synthetic intelligence;time of arrival;time series;traffic shaping	Daniel-Simion Daian;Dan-Horia Giura	2011	2011 6th IEEE International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)	10.1109/SACI.2011.5873048	traffic generation model;local area network;stochastic process;simulation;quality of service;autocorrelation;telecommunications;heavy-tailed distribution;network switch;shape;computer science;engineering;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;traffic flow;time series;mathematical model;hurst exponent;queueing theory;computational model;traffic shaping;network topology;statistics;computer network;network traffic simulation	Metrics	-2.2043444272912125	99.34811262289115	78086

We propose to expand this cognition-based process by exploiting the parallel processing power of the infrastructure, so as to go beyond cognition as is meant by these approaches. We leverage novel approaches, taken from cognitive science and artificial intelligence, involving not only supervised but also unsupervised learning, and we envision their application to systems for video over wireless. The transmission of multimedia content, and its adaptation to the condition of the communication infrastructure, i.e., the wireless channel or the content delivery network, are envisioned as particularly critical steps for the development of latest generation mobile networks. For this scenario, we propose and evaluate a video classifier based on a Restricted Boltzmann Machine that tries to extract abstract features of videos from the analysis of the sizes of a few coded frames. These features can then be exploited by the communication network itself to optimize video transmission based on its content.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;cognition;cognitive science;content delivery network;deep learning;generative model;linear classifier;machine learning;mathematical optimization;parallel computing;restricted boltzmann machine;supervised learning;telecommunications network;testbed;unsupervised learning	Leonardo Badia;Daniele Munaretto;Alberto Testolin;Andrea Zanella;Marco Zorzi;Michele Zorzi	2014	Proceeding of IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks 2014	10.1109/WoWMoM.2014.6918997	unsupervised learning;wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;cognition;feature extraction;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;structural similarity;multimedia;restricted boltzmann machine;computational model;wireless;telecommunications network;encoding;computer network	Mobile	19.489344414416077	94.36161618964572	78097

TCP detects loss events using either retransmission timeout or receipt of duplicate acknowledgements. Since, TCP does not have any explicit knowledge about the cause of packet loss, it always treats it as a congestion indication and then adjusts sending rate conservatively to maintain fairness. This often compromises achievable throughput under wireless loss conditions. This problem can be solved by making the TCP source intelligent so that on detecting a packet loss, it will be able to distinguish what type of loss it is (a Congestion loss or a Wireless loss) and react accordingly. This paper presents an online-learning solution to discriminate wireless loss from congestion loss solely using the information available at the TCP layer and at the source only. Initial results obtained from a simulation based study show that the proposed algorithm which combines K-Means clustering approach together with heuristics is capable of classifying loss types to a higher degree of accuracy under various loss scenarios and provides significant performance improvements under high wireless loss conditions.	algorithm;cluster analysis;fairness measure;heuristic (computer science);k-means clustering;linear discriminant analysis;network congestion;network packet;offline learning;online and offline;online machine learning;performance evaluation;retransmission (data networks);sensor;simulation;software propagation;testbed;throughput	Mahesh Sooriyabandara;Parag Kulkarni;Lu Li;Tim Lewis;Tim Farnham;Russell J.

We construct PaN and SaN by placing nodes according to Poisson point processes of density n and m respectively over a unit square region. We directly study the multicast throughput of cognitive network to unify that of unicast and broadcast sessions. In order to ensure the priority of primary users in meanings of throughput, we design a metric called throughput decrement ratio (TDR) to measure the ratio of the throughput of PaN in presence of SaN to that of PaN in absence of SaN. Endowing PaN with the right to determine the threshold of the TDR, we propose multicast schemes based on TDMA and multihop routing for the two networks respectively and derive their achievable multicast throughput depending on the given threshold. Specially, we show when PaN has sparser density than SaN, to be specific, $$n=o\left({\frac{m} {(\log m)^2}}\right),$$ and if PaN only cares about the order of its throughput, SaN can simultaneously achieve the same order of the aggregated multicast throughput as it were a stand-alone network in absence of PaN.	cognitive network;multicast;throughput	Cheng Wang;Changjun Jiang;Xiang-Yang Li;Yunhao Liu	2010	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-010-0237-3	wireless ad hoc network;poisson point process;cognitive network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	14.683153275397727	89.0839158173597	78313
04298d320c66fdd0cfae7b5c41ed244bc7c8f1de	moving window network coding in cooperative multicast (v1)		Cooperative multicast is an effective solution to address the bottleneck problem of single-hop broadcast in wireless networks. By incorporating with the random linear network coding technique, the existing schemes can reduce the retransmission overhead significantly. However, the receivers may incur large decoding delay and complexity due to the batch decoding scheme. In addition, the dependency on the explicit feedback leads to scalability problem in larger networks. In this paper, a cooperative multicast protocol named MWNCast is proposed based on a novel moving window network coding technique. We prove three properties of the proposed scheme. Firstly, without explicit feedback, MWNCast can approach the cooperative capacity with the packet loss probability dropping almost exponentially with the increase of window size. Secondly, the average decoding delay of a receiver is on the order of O( 1 (1−ρ)2 ) with respect to its traffic intensity ρ. Thirdly, MWNCast can achieve the linear decoding complexity of O(W ) with respect to the window size W . Simulation results show that MWNCast outperforms the existing schemes by achieving better tradeoff between the throughput and decoding delay, meanwhile keeping the packet loss probability and decoding complexity at a very low level without explicit feedback.	bottleneck (engineering);cooperative mimo;linear network coding;multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);relay;retransmission (data networks);scalability;simulation;throughput	Fei Wu;Cunqing Hua;Hangguan Shan;Aiping Huang	2012	CoRR		real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	2.1177450179412505	91.13714019206068	78343

We consider a single point in the access network which multiplexes several bursty users. The users adapt their sending rates based on feedback from the access multiplexer. Important parameters are the user's peak transmission rate p, which is the access line speed, the user's guaranteed minimum rate r, and the bound e on the fraction of lost data.Two feedback schemes are proposed. In both schemes the users are allowed to send at rate p if the system is relatively lightly loaded, at rate r during periods of congestion, and at a rate between r and p, in an intermediate region. For both feedback schemes we present an exact analysis, under the assumption that the users' job sizes and think times have exponential distributions. We use our techniques to design the schemes jointly with admission control, i.e., the selection of the number of admissible users, to maximize throughput for given p, r, and e. Next we consider the case in which the number of users is large. Under a specific scaling, we derive explicit large deviations asymptotics for both models. We discuss the extension to general distributions of user data and think times.		Michel Mandjes;Debasis Mitra;Werner R. W.

Based on these measurements, we model the SPS as an M/G/1 queue.

In this way, MCNs enhance the performance of both the existing cellular networks and ad hoc networks. Consequently, MCN-type system is considered as a promising candidate of fourth generation (4G) wireless network for future mobile communications. This paper surveys a number of MCN-type architectures in literature through a comprehensive comparison and discussion among the proposed architectures. The discussion is divided into two phases. In the first phase, we review the concept of MCN and compare the selected MCN-type architectures from a technology perspective.

Nonetheless, very few testbed or field trial measurement accounts have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. We fill this gap by exploring scenarios where fixed WiMAX is employed for VoIP traffic. VoIP packets typically exhibit large header overheads and small total packet sizes. The actual codec payload per packet is very small compared to the total length of headers appended to each voice frame. Robust header compression (ROHC) can significantly decrease header size by capitalizing on static or rarely changing header fields. Aggregating multiple voice frames into one packet is another attractive and effective way to increase application goodput and overall bandwidth utilization. We study the effect of ROHC and application layer aggregation on VoIP performance in a fixed WiMAX testbed consisting of one base station and two subscriber stations. We find that ROHC increases the number of simultaneous bidirectional emulated VoIP flows by 6% when compared to plain VoIP. When aggregation and ROHC are employed in unison, they allow for 86% more flows than standard VoIP to be sustained in our testbed.	algorithm;codec;emulator;experiment;goodput;jumbo frame;network packet;robust header compression;simulation;synthetic data;testbed;unison	Esa Piri;Jarno Pinola;Frerk Fitzek;Kostas Pentikousis	2008	2008 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications	10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625650	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;robust header compression;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-4.486661976550655	91.96129936533808	78566

Specifically, benefiting from the fixed location of wireless routers, the power allocation is based on the length of the transmission path, so as to ensure a certain level of fairness among the routers. For a new call arrival, based on the maximum sustainable interference concept, each existing receiver (rather than the potential sender) estimates its experienced interference level under the hypothesis that the new call is admitted. If the interference is not tolerable, the existing receiver rejects the new call by sending a blocking-signal. The main advantages of our proposed scheme are the low control message overhead for easy implementation, and the accurate interference estimation. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of our scheme.	blocking (computing);fairness measure;interference (communication);internet backbone;job scheduler;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;wireless mesh network;wireless router	Hai Jiang;Ping Wang;Weihua Zhuang;Xuemin Shen	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.060449	code division multiple access;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer network	Mobile	4.151475798038319	103.44544426229426	78727

The industry is seeking Higher Data Rates (HDR's) over 100Mbps for IEEE 802.11a extension. However, the medium access control (MAC), which they are based upon, is the same. In this paper, we explore the overhead of HDR's to find out whether the MAC is good enough for the increasing data rates and what to expect as the industry seeks higher data rates. We prove that a theoretical throughput upper limit and a theoretical delay lower limit exist for IEEE 802.11 protocols. The existence of such limits indicates that the overhead must be reduced to get good performance for HDR's. Otherwise, the enhanced performance of HDR's is limited and bounded even when the data rate becomes infinitely high. Both reducing overhead and pursuing HDR's are therefore necessary and important. In order to reduce overhead, we propose a burst transmission and acknowledgement (BTA) mechanism, in which, instead of acknowledging each frame, a burst of frames is received first, and then the whole burst is acknowledged one time. Our study shows that with the BTA mechanism, overhead has been greatly reduced and performance has been greatly improved.	access control;burst transmission;data rate units;megabit;overhead (computing);principle of good enough;profiling (computer programming);throughput;uncompressed video	Yang Xiao;Jon Rosdahl	2003	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/950391.950396	network allocation vector;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Visualization	12.279898860326274	94.62905813188807	78767

If a user station is attached to the base station (BS) through several relays stations (RS), a multi-hop communication occurs. To enable multi-hop communication, the IEEE 802.16j standard proposes two approaches how RSs can be implemented into the network. The first approach groups BSs and several RSs into a multi-frame with repetition of relay zones. In the second approach, the BS schedules several relay zones in one frame. While the first approach causes long packet delays, the second approach has high requirements on RS’s processing capabilities. This paper proposes an optimized frame structure that allows using second approach whilst the requirements on RS’s processing time are still kept in reasonable range. The obtained simulation results indicate that packet delays in downlink and uplink direction can be significantly reduced.	broadcast relay station;frame language;mathematical optimization;network packet;rss;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;while	Pavel Mach;Robert Bestak	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03841-9_10	electronic engineering;telecommunications;processing delay;base station identity code;end-to-end delay;computer network	Visualization	8.341348851907622	90.9119993047609	78841

It is designed for the slotted, dual bus configuration. A simple way to improve the performance of DQDB is to perform slot reuse and many methods have been suggested in the past to efficiently incorporate slot reuse with DQDB. However, some of them can lead to starvation. In this paper we improve one of these previous suggestions and the main contribution of the paper is that for the first time we also provide a proof that the improved scheme ensures lack of starvation. We also specify this proof for the important case of DQDB without slot reuse.	starvation (computer science)	Oran Sharon	1995	IEEE/ACM Trans.

However, when sharing the same bottleneck link with single-path flows, the multipath flows will occupy more network bandwidth and it will lead to the unfairness of resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Congestion Control method with Fairness (CCMF) for multipath transport. CCMF transfers the traffic among different paths and considers the bandwidth fairness when multipath flows share the same bottleneck with single-path flows. We introduce a parameter of F-factor to reflect the degree and variation trend of fairness. Thus, CCMF can regulate the sending rate according to the fairness factor F-factor and achieve end-to-end fairness transmission. The simulation results show that CCMF can improve the fairness degree compared with Coupled Algorithm.	algorithm;bottleneck (network);end-to-end principle;fairness measure;multipath propagation;network congestion;simulation;throughput	Bo Hu;Yang Yang;Zeng Wang;Lin Xing	2017	2017 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2017.7899584	market research;fairness measure;algorithm design;throughput;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;packet loss;bandwidth;computer network	Robotics	-0.23014344748692675	94.37624491873562	78949
2b7faf856fa63712b701eaa6ed5bb5f74efe2b7d	delay and delay-constrained throughput analysis of a wireless powered communication system		In this paper, we investigate the delay and delay-constrained throughput performance of a point-to-point wireless-powered communication system, where one node, e.g. a user equipment (UE), is powered by the wireless energy transferred from the other node, e.g. an access point (AP), and uses the harvested wireless energy to send data to the other node. Our focus is on the delay performance of sending data over the uplink from the UE node to the AP node, and on its throughput performance when a delay constraint is enforced. Two representative time allocation schemes in using the link for the AP node to transfer energy (maybe together with data) and for the UE node to send data are considered. In particular, a lower bound on the cumulative capacity of the uplink is derived. In addition, an upper bound on the delay distribution is obtained for stochastic traffic arrivals, based on which, the delay-constrained throughput performance is further analyzed. Moreover, the accuracy of the analysis is validated by comparison with extensive simulation results. The analysis and results shed new light on the performance of such a wireless-powered communication system.

A new access policy based on myopic sensing and adaptive transmission (MS-AT) is proposed. Under the framework of risk sensitive constrained Markov decision process with effective bandwidth as a measure of queueing delay, it is shown that MS-AT achieves simultaneously throughput and delay optimality. It is shown further that both the effective bandwidth and the throughput of MS-AT are two-segment piece-wise linear functions of the collision constraint (maximum allowable conditional collision probability) with the effective bandwidth and throughput coinciding in the regime of tight collision constraints. Analytical and simulation comparisons are conducted with the myopic sensing and memoryless transmission (MS-MT) policy which is throughput optimal but delay suboptimal in the regime of tight collision constraints.	access control;cognitive radio;interference (communication);linear function;markov chain;markov decision process;multi-user;queuing delay;scenario (computing);simulation;throughput	Shiyao Chen;Lang Tong;Qing Zhao	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195552	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;computer science;mathematics;markov process;statistics;computer network	Metrics	18.231037036872152	96.32860604242681	79619

The head station on the bus learns the number of ready-to-transmit voice stations by reading a 'request' bit in the header of the received packets and allocates the exact number of voice slots needed in each frame. The protocol guarantees that the maximum delay to transmit a voice packet will be less than the round-trip propagation delay at the head station plus twice the time needed to form the packet. The average data packet delay is evaluated via approximate analysis and simulation, for the case in which the voice-reserved slots in a frame are contiguous and for the case in which they are evenly distributed. >	network packet	Kiriakos Apostolidis;Lazaros F.

DSRC based vehicular networks are already standardized by IEEE 802.11 which supports communication among vehicles and road-side infrastructures. Different safety applications need to be tested and validated for numerous road scenarios to show the benefit of DSRC based networks. Simulation tools come in handy where a sizable number of tests are required to substantiate the performance of safety applications. ns-3 is a network simulator that offers a rich set of libraries for modeling mobility, communication channel, and many other network components. Although ns-3 is designed for simulating Wi-Fi networks, some enhancements are still required to make the simulations more realistic for vehicular networks. Large-scale field tests reveal that some of the substantial details are missing in existing ns-3 implementation of physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers that play a major role in defining the network behavior. This paper is a step toward an exhaustive and higher fidelity simulation of IEEE 802.11. We validate our proposed receiver model by comparing its simulation results with large-scale field data.	access control;channel (communications);handy board;library (computing);phy (chip);simulation;vehicle-to-vehicle	S.

However, instead of power consumption, throughput is a more important performance concern for some emerging multihop wireless networks, such as wireless mesh networks. This paper examines joint link scheduling and power control with the objective of throughput improvement. The MAximum THroughput link Scheduling with Power Control (MATH-SPC) problem is first formulated and then a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is presented to provide optimal solutions. However, simply maximizing the throughput may lead to a severe bias on bandwidth allocation among links. To achieve a good tradeoff between throughput and fairness, a new parameter called the demand satisfaction factor (DSF) to characterize the fairness of bandwidth allocation and formulate the MAximum Throughput fAir link Scheduling with Power Control (MATA-SPC) problem is defined. An MILP formulation and an effective polynomial-time heuristic algorithm, namely, the serial linear programming rounding (SLPR) heuristic, to solve the MATA-SPC problem are also presented. Numerical results show that bandwidth can be fairly allocated among all links/flows by solving the MILP formulation or by using the heuristic algorithm at the cost of a minor reduction of network throughput. In addition, extensions to end-to-end throughput and fairness and multiradio wireless multihop networks are discussed	scheduling (computing);throughput	Jian Tang;Guoliang Xue;Christopher Chandler;Weiyi Zhang	2006	IEEE Trans.

This greatly complicates the problem of server performance modeling and optimization. Existing tools like queuing models in most cases only hold in mean value analysis under the assumption of simplified traffic structures. In this paper, we present a filter model to characterize the relationship among the factors of server capacity, request scheduling, and service quality for general input traffic. By the model, a server scheduler operates as an finite-duration impulse response (FIR) filter that transforms request processes into workload processes with the objective of minimizing load variation or overload probability, and meanwhile, without violating request response deadlines as defined in service-level agreements. We present a design and analysis of the filter for traffic with strong LRD in the frequency domain. Most Internet traffic has monotonically decreasing strength of variation functions over frequency. For this type of input traffic, we prove that optimal schedulers must have a convex structure. Uniform resource allocation is an extreme case of the convexity and is proved to be optimal for Poisson traffic. We integrate the convex structural principle with the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) discipline and show that the enhanced GPS policy improves the service quality significantly. Furthermore, we show that the presence of LRD in the input traffic results in shift of variation strength from high frequency to lower frequency bands and consequently leads to a degradation of the service quality.	convex function;elegant degradation;enhanced gps;filter design;finite impulse response;frequency band;generalized processor sharing;global positioning system;mathematical optimization;profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing);self-similarity;server (computing);service-level agreement	Cheng-Zhong Xu;Minghua Xu;Le Yi Wang;Gang George Yin	2010	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2010.22	real-time computing;computer science;resource management;operating system;finite impulse response;distributed computing;frequency domain;statistics;computer network	Metrics	4.250374818024491	100.06557665800516	79858

It thus has been advocated by numerous on-demand data access protocols. In a wireless cellular network, broadcasting can be implemented within a single cell. However, the data owned by different cells could be different. If a client requests a data item available only in a remote cell, an inter-cell data transmission over some wired link is needed, which introduces additional access delay. In this paper, we demonstrate that such delay can be minimized through the use of remote caching. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative caching scheme, in which each cell dynamically allocates the cache spaces for data from different remote cells. It makes replacement decisions according to several important factors: data item access frequency, cell traffic, and retrieval delay. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the response time over the non-cooperative caching scheme under various system configurations.	algorithm;cpu cache;cache (computing);cache prefetching;cooperative mimo;cooperative multitasking;data access;data item;datacasting;mobile computing;mobile device;network traffic control;response time (technology);simulation;tracing (software)	Ji Xu;Yanmin Zhu;Jianliang Xu;Bo Li;Lionel M.

Given the capability provided by the disk layout and scheduling algorithms to serve multiple streams simultaneously, improved request scheduling algorithms can reduce customer waiting times. This results in better service and/or lower customer loss. In this paper we define a new class of request scheduling algorithms, called Group-Guaranteed Server Capacity (GGSC), that preassign server channel capacity to groups of objects. We also define a particular formal method for computing the assigned capacities to achieve a given performance objective. We observe that the FCFS policy can provide the precise time of service to incoming customer requests. Under this assumption, we compare the performance of one of the new GGSC algorithms, GGSCW-FCFS, against FCFS and against two other recently proposed scheduling algorithms: Maximum Factored Queue length (MFQ), and the FCFS-n algorithm that preassigns capacity only to each of the n most popular objects. The algorithms are compared for both competitive market and captured audience environments.Key findings of the algorithm comparisons are that: (1) FCFS-n has no advantage over FCFS if FCFS gives time of service guarantees to arriving customers, (2) FCFS and GGSCW-FCFS are superior to MFQ for both competitive and captive audience environments, (3) for competitive servers that are configured for customer loss less than 10%, FCFS is superior to all other algorithms examined in this paper, and (4) for captive audience environments that have objects with variable playback length, GGSCW-FCFS is the most promising of the policies considered in this paper. The conclusions for FCFS-n and MFQ differ from previous work because we focus on competitive environments with customer loss under 10%, we assume FCFS can provide time of service guarantees to all arriving customers, and we consider the distribution of customer waiting time as well as the average waiting time.	algorithm;captive audience;captive portal;channel capacity;fifo (computing and electronics);formal methods;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Athanassios Tsiolis;Mary K.

The protocol employs the  traffic  viewpoint hierarchical design approach and is implemented by a two-layer scheme at the  call  and  cell  layers. The call layer handles call admission (denial) and provides shortest path connection routing when a call is admitted, while the cell layer allocates switch input buffer space for each traffic type according to each type's cell loss probability grade-of-service requirement. There is a direct interaction between the two layers in processing a connection request. A discrete-time queueing system with geometrically distributed service time and state-dependent Markov modulated Bernoulli process (MMBP) arrivals is established to model heterogeneous networking environments for this protocol and an analytical solution is developed for this queueing system. Numerical results obtained by both analysis and simulation show that the protocol can reduce network congestion as input traffic rates approach switch capacity and, thereby, increase network utilization relative to that possible in the absence of congestion control.	integrated services digital network;network congestion	Zhixing Ren;James S.

It is however, well known that TCP is not suitable for wireless networks and several solutions have been proposed to rectify this shortcoming. In this work, we explore cross-layer optimization of the rate adaptation feature of cellular networks to optimize throughput of a single long-lived TCP session. Modern cellular networks rate RF technology that allows them to dynamically vary the wireless channel rate in response to user demand and channel conditions. However, the set of data rates as well as the scheduler's rate adaptation policy are typically chosen to optimize throughput for inelastic applications. In order to optimize such a system for TCP, we propose a two state TCP-aware scheduler that switches between two chanrates as a function of the TCP sending rate. We develop a fluid model of the steady-state behavior of a TCP session in such a system and derive analytical expressions for TCP throughput that explicitly account for rate variability as well as the dependency between the scheduler and TCP. Using the model we choose RF layer parameters that, in conjunction with the TCP-aware scheduler, improve term throughput of a single TCP flow by 15.25%. We also compare our analytical results against those obtained from ns-2 simulations and confirm that our model indeed closely approximates TCP behavior in such an environment.	mathematical optimization;network switch;radio frequency;rectifier;scheduling (computing);simulation;spatial variability;steady state;throughput	Majid Ghaderi;Ashwin Sridharan;Hui Zang;Donald F.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) has serious drawbacks in what concerns to the timeliness of the communications, since it allows collisions to happen in the channel and it may cause unbounded delays before channel access. This paper proposes an enhanced version of the Vehicular Flexible Time-Triggered (V-FTT) protocol, a deterministic MAC protocol for vehicular communications. Proposed enhancements include novel schemes to protect V-FTT compliant nodes from the interference of non-compliant nodes, which can only transmit during specific slots, the Free Period.

We show that the algorithm guarantees the delay bound for each chunk of the stream and maintains the maximum streaming rate at the same time.	algorithm;clock rate;digital distribution;fan-out;peer-to-peer;scenario (computing);transmitter	Wenjie Jiang;Shaoquan Zhang;Minghua Chen;Mung Chiang	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513291	propagation delay;real-time computing;computer science;bismuth;peer-to-peer;mathematical model;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Arch	1.2093321763433158	92.50773190183848	80323

In this paper, we propose a new approach to control congestion. In this context, we present an algorithm for active queue management, to notify simultaneously all competing flows about incipient congestion. Typically, AQM schemes notify only a small portion of participating flows about congestion events. Our notification scheme, called global notifier (GN), allows for an immediate and less aggressive adjustment of transmission windows with three consequent properties: (i) fairness is improved, (ii) smoothness of responsive flows is improved and (iii) system utilization is better regulated between the knee and the cliff. We detail our algorithm and the corresponding responsive behavior of participating flows, and we highlight significant performance results gathered by simulations.	active queue management;algorithm;control theory;fairness measure;global illumination;grid north;microsoft windows;network congestion;simulation	Ageliki Tsioliaridou;Vassilis Tsaoussidis	2008	Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)	10.1109/ITNG.2008.181	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;queueing theory;network congestion;active queue management;computer network	HPC	-3.254644354459115	94.70928713326232	80391

Heterogeneous means that optical connection requests for different services requiring different data rates would coexist in the network. In this context, Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) algorithms face the challenge of making a fair allocation of resources, providing a similar blocking performance to all the services. In this paper, we review existing RSA proposals applicable to heterogeneous flex-grid networks, evaluating (i) their blocking performance averaged among services, and (ii) the fairness in the blocking observed by each individual service. In addition, we propose the Partial-Sharing-Partitioning (PSP), a scheme to balance both aforementioned metrics. We concentrate on a distance-adaptive scenario, where the same connection request can be carried with different modulations, associated to different spectral efficiencies and optical reaches. Our simulation results in the Net2Plan tool explore the interplay between average blocking and fairness. We observe that many classical RSA algorithms produce unfair allocations, while PSP permits tuning the balance between both metrics. The algorithms developed are publicly available in the open-source Net2Plan repository.	algorithm;blocking (computing);coexist (image);erlang (unit);fairness measure;open-source software;routing;simulation;spectral efficiency	José Luis Izquierdo-Zaragoza;Pablo Pavón-Mariño;M.

Conventionally, this metric was derived from the exponential distribution. Although it might be appropriate to the scenarios directed mainly by the light-tailed traffic, the exponential model is inadequate to characterize the paradigms dominated by heavy-tailed traffic. In this paper, we propose a unified model to take both traffic types into account. Our model is based on the compound Weibull distribution, of which the exponential distribution and the Rayleigh distribution are special cases.	hoc (programming language);quality of service;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;source routing;time complexity;unified model	Xian Liu	2005	GLOBECOM '05.

The introduced protocol enhancements are capable of concurrent deployment of existing frequency opportunities in order to coordinate simultaneous data transmissions. The root concept is mainly based on the deployment of well-known ISM frequency bands, where the legacy 802.11based wireless equipments operate, as the common control channel in order to establish contemporaneous transmissions. We apply the aforementioned key concept to the IEEE 802.11s common channel framework to attain two important goals: To improve the channel utilization using the concept of cognitive radio, and to lower the access delay. Through extensive event-driven simulations, taking into account primary user appearance in non-ISM frequency bands, performance of the proposed MAC enhancement is evaluated showing its higher efficiency compared to the existing solutions, in addition to its better wireless medium management.	access control;agile software development;cognitive radio;event-driven programming;frequency band;implicit shape model;mesh networking;microsoft customer care framework;next-generation network;simulation;software deployment;throughput;wireless mesh network	Kaveh Ghaboosi;Matti Latva-aho;Ryuji Kohno	2011	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-010-0122-5	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;service set;wi-fi;network allocation vector;cognitive radio;ieee 802.11;media access control;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;computer science;mesh networking;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;wireless distribution system;computer network	Mobile	23.125618060825943	89.66480459892973	80462

However, the throughput gains obtained from these techniques are limited by the energy of the base station and the buffer size of the receivers. To make full use of this energy and these buffers, this paper presents a Joint Pushing and Caching (JPC) method for physical layer multicasting systems, where the request delay information (RDI) is exploited in noncausal, statistical, and causal form. In JPC, the content items pushed by the base station and removed from the buffers of receivers in each timeslot are jointly determined. With noncausal or statistical RDI, an offline policy is presented by formulating and solving an optimization problem in order to maximize the effective throughput. With causal RDI, an online policy is presented to further enhance the effective throughput with little signalling overhead. Causal feedback of RDI is found to bring a substantial throughput gain.	cache (computing);causal filter;jpc;mathematical optimization;measuring network throughput;multi-user;multicast;online and offline;optimization problem;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput	Yawei Lu;Wei Chen;H.

Since TCP is the standard network protocol stack for communication on the Internet, its use over the networks is a certainty because it allows seamless integration with the fixed infrastructure. Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) assumes a relatively reliable underlying where most packet losses are due to congestion. In a wireless network, however, packet losses will occurs more often due to unreliable wireless links than due to congestion. When using TCP over wireless links, each packet loss on the wireless link results in congestion control measures being invoked at the source. This cause severe performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a new TCP scheme for the various wireless-integrated network topology. The scheme distinguishes wireless losses from packet losses regardless of the location of wireless link on the networks. This solves the severe performance degradation because of the miss notification of transmission loss. Experiments are performed using the Network Simulator(NS-II) from Lawrence Berkeley Labs. The simulator has been extended to incorporate wireless link characteristics.	bit error rate;communications protocol;complex network;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;institute for operations research and the management sciences;internet;network congestion;network packet;network topology;protocol stack;seamless3d;simulation;vaxeln	Hyun-Chul Kim;Myong-Soon Park	2002		10.1109/ICPADS.2002.1183412	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;communications protocol;radio link protocol;wireless wan;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;zeta-tcp;wi-fi array;tcp tuning;packet loss;fixed wireless;network congestion;mobile computing;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-2.2336883949246853	90.84851151751877	80742

To address this issue, a new analytical framework is proposed in this paper to optimize the random access performance of M2M communications in LTE networks. Both the maximum network throughput and the corresponding optimal backoff parameters including the Access Class Barring (ACB) factor and the backoff window size are obtained as explicit functions of key system parameters such as the number of preambles, the number of Machine Type Devices (MTDs) and the aggregate input rate.

These types of SLAs are suggested for all types of traffic from best effort to QoS constrained applications. In access networks, where these SLAs are prevalent, shared memory switches are a common feature of architecture. Thus, dimensioning and management of shared memory queues for multiple priorities, each with two levels of guarantees, becomes an interesting challenge. We present a simple analysis of a multipriority multi-discard-level system controlled by a buffer occupancy threshold policy aimed at assuring SLA compliance for conforming (i.e., committed) traffic, and performance maximization for nonconforming (i.e., excess) traffic. Our analysis shows how to calculate the different system parameters: total buffer size, threshold position, and offered load control performance for the committed and excess traffic. Our suggested design enables assuring high SLA compliance for conforming traffic and performance maximization for nonconforming traffic.	access network;best-effort delivery;expectation–maximization algorithm;internet;load management;network switch;offset binary;quality of service;service-level agreement;shared memory	Shlomi Bergida;Yuval Shavitt	2007	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2007.386469	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;computer security;computer network;access network	Metrics	-2.3682495915319812	96.06857846051969	80768

While existing physical layer power optimization mostly focuses on improving the transmission efficiency, our recent work has showed that wireless interfaces can spend most of its time and energy in very short idle periods between transmitting two packets [9]. In this work, we present a physical layer optimization method, drowsy transmission, which explicitly considers the power cost of such idle periods in physical layer power optimization through joint power control/rate selection and power management. We provide a control theoretical formulation of the optimization problem and present a dynamic programming based solution and its approximation that is close form and practical. We further offer an on-line learning technique to cope with unknown channel and traffic. Using a power model from a commercial wireless network interface card, we demonstrate that drowsy transmission can reduce the energy per bit by 70% and 40% in comparison to power control/rate selection-based optimization and optimization with disjoint power control/rate selection and power management, respectively . Moreover, the achieved energy per bit is very close to the theoretical lower bound. Our evaluation shows that the proposed on-line learning technique can assess the channel and approach the performance under pre-known channel in as short as 200ms. We also show that our optimization introduces negligible packet delays.	adaptive algorithm;approximation algorithm;cns;duplex (telecommunications);dynamic programming;eb/n0;ibm notes;mathematical optimization;network interface controller;network packet;online and offline;online machine learning;optimization problem;power management;power optimization (eda);retransmission (data networks);transmitter;unreachable memory;web traffic;wordnet	Husheng Li;Lin Zhong;Kun Zheng	2009	IEEE INFOCOM 2009	10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062163	stochastic process;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;wireless network interface controller;computer network	Mobile	17.85387994163538	95.52530546633163	80776
df85f7b9b25517018e189ced21c7e01a70ffaa0e	energy-efficient joint caching and transcoding for http adaptive streaming in 5g networks with mobile edge computing		With the HTTP adaptive video streaming (HAS) transmission over mobile networks being widely concerned and the new promising technique of mobile edge computing (MEC) emerging, the problem of HAS transmission in MEC-based 5G networks has been widely studied. However, most of them focus on the issues of network resource utilization and the quality of experience (QoE) promotion, while the problem of energy efficiency is largely ignored. In this paper, different from previous works, by taking the caching and transcoding into consideration, we propose a joint caching and transcoding schedule strategy for HAS delivery in MEC-enhanced 5G network to realize the energy efficiency. We formulate the problem of energy efficient joint caching and transcoding as an integer linear programming problem to minimize the system energy consumption. Then to make the NP-hard problem tractable, we introduce a heuristic scheme based on simulated annealing algorithm to iteratively provide the global optimum solution. Finally, simulation results are illustrated to show that our proposed strategy presents an excellent performance and provides practical significance to choose proper ways of responding users' content requests according to different hit modes.	algorithm;cache (computing);cobham's thesis;edge computing;global optimization;heuristic;hypertext transfer protocol;integer programming;linear programming;np-hardness;schedule (computer science);serial digital video out;simulated annealing;simulation;streaming media	Zishu Li;Renchao Xie;Qingmin Jia;Tao Huang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC Workshops)	10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403715	mobile edge computing;computer science;real-time computing;efficient energy use;schedule;energy consumption;integer programming;simulated annealing;server;transcoding	Robotics	22.553187186051588	97.37498959627553	80806

High data rate (HDR) wireless personal area networks (WPANs) can operate in a mesh configuration to extend from the legacy single-hop communication to multiple hops. Although the range of WPANs is increased in a mesh configuration, there are capacity constraints because the superframe time is shared by multiple piconet clusters instead of being dedicated for a single piconet cluster just like in the legacy single-hop case. Furthermore, the distributed superframe sharing can cause fairness issues because there is no mechanism to determine the requirement of each mesh piconet coordinator (MPNC) and monitor a fair allocation to each MPNC. Here, the authors propose a centralised resource allocation approach and define three resource allocation policies for meshed HDR WPANs. The proposed approach is augmented by a traffic estimation strategy to predict a suitable fraction of superframe time for each cluster. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation policies and the fairness index is shown to increase upto 42% with the proposed approach in some cases.	centralisation;data rate units	Sahibzada Ali Mahmud;Shahbaz Khan;Hamed S.

To achieve this, the IEEE 802.16.e amendment introduces the service differentiation by five service classes (UGS, ertPS, rtPS, nrtPS and BE). To maintain the QoS of active connections and to avoid any congestion in the network, an Admission Control (AC) is defined. AC aims to accept or reject a new connection according to the negotiated parameters and the availability of resources in the network. This mechanism is not standardized and let to the operators. We tackle this point, by proposing in this study a new Admission Control (AC) that improves the QoS of BE traffic by avoiding a strict bandwidth assignment of other traffics (rtPS and nrtPS) as is defined in major previous studies. The proposed mechanism is based on token bucket for rtPS, nrtPS and BE traffics in order to reduce lightly the number of accepted connections and to improve considerably the number of accepted BE connections. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we use PEPS (Performance Evaluation of Parallel Systems) which is a powerful tool based on models which can be described with Stochastic Automata Networks (SAN). PEPS can solve complex models with a large state space and with many synchronized events. Therefore, we show that this tool is suitable for wireless network, and specifically for the proposed scheme, toward numerical results we show as we expected that our proposed AC outperform the classical one by reducing lightly the performance of other service classes.	automata theory;automaton;profiling (computer programming);semantics (computer science)	Lynda Mokdad;Jalel Ben-Othman	2011	J.

However, it is possible for an inelastic flow to adopt different level of aggressiveness in implementing the admission control. How these different levels of aggressiveness affect the system performance remains an open issue. In this paper, we evaluate a full spectrum of (abstract) admission control algorithms in terms of their aggressiveness towards elastic flows. A totally aggressive version would admit an inelastic flow even if this means elastic flows' fair bandwidth share is reduced to close to zero. In the other extreme, a TCP-friendly version would only admit an inelastic flow if its desired rate is no higher than what the elastic flows will receive after its arrival. We show that the performance of inelastic flows is asymptotically insensitive to their aggressiveness without strong assumptions about flow file size or holding time distributions. This makes a strong case for adopting a less aggressive, yet TCP-friendly admission control in a heterogeneous network. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the performance, stability and asymptotic behavior the the proposed TCP-friendly admission control policy	algorithm;amazon elastic block store;elastic net regularization;emoticon;markov chain;network congestion;simulation;skeleton (computer programming);terminate (software)	Adrian Sai-Wah Tam;Dah-Ming Chiu;John C.

b36ae9184c7b811b32fb9620acf5d755e5ec55e4	interference-fault free transmission schedule in tree-structured wsn	aggregation tree;wsn;interference faults;link scheduling	Interference due to concurrent link transmissions has for long been recognized as a major cause for issues like packet retransmissions, distorted signal strength and communication link failures in WSN. The two best known approaches to model interference, namely the Protocol Interference (PrI) and Physical Interference models, fail to identify all Potential Interferers (PIs) to a given link. Therefore, the two models have limited utility in determining an Interference-Fault Free Transmission (IFFT) schedule for all active links in the network. This leads to serious repercussions, especially in tree-structured WSNs, where data aggregation is hierarchical. In a pioneering work done earlier, we have developed Composite Interference Mapping (CIM) model, which succeeds in identifying the PIs of all active links in a network. In this paper, we implement the CIM model to map PIs of all transmission links in a tree-structured WSN. We develop an IFFT-Tree algorithm to obtain an IFFT schedule for all links in an aggregation tree, and analytically prove that the algorithm is both optimal and complete. To support our analytical studies, we implement the IFFT-Tree algorithm and carry out extensive simulations to show that the algorithm minimizes the number of time slots required to schedule all active links. We introduce three new performance metrics to study the performance of IFFT-Tree algorithm, and to compare the efficacy of the CIM model with PrI model. The results of the simulations prove that the PrI model identifies only a small subset of total PIs identified by the CIM model. This finding highlights the threat to the credibility of data being aggregated along the tree, if interference-faults arising due to PIs which are not identified by the PrI model, proliferate into the tree-structured WSN.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);catastrophic interference;computer simulation;computer-integrated manufacturing;data aggregation;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);ising model;network packet;precomputed radiance transfer;python imaging library;statistical interference;tree (data structure);tree structure;viz: the computer game	Beneyaz A.

Working in conjunction with anomaly and/or intrusion detection, the proposed framework allows the network to develop a set of measured responses to possible anomalies and external threats by minimizing the average maximum network losses, i.e., regrets or risks, due to uncertainty. Loss maximization guards against uncertainty within each scenario. Averaging of the maximum losses reflects any available information on the likelihood of different scenarios. The proposed framework includes Bayesian and minimax approaches as particular cases. The paper demonstrates how the proposed framework can alleviate high sensitivity of a cost-based admission and routing scheme to u ncertain resource costs and possible presence of excessive and/or adversarial traffic. Specific examples include competitive and minimum interference admission and routing schemes.	anomaly detection;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);intrusion detection system;minimax;network performance;regret (decision theory);robustness (computer science);routing	Vladimir Marbukh	2001		10.1007/3-540-47734-9_31	network management;econometrics;mathematical optimization;routing;connection;computer science;mathematics;steady state;computer network	ML	-1.2767992125239485	102.72378201190476	81225

CSMA/CA protocol with pulse signal transmission enables a user having a packet ready to transmit initially some pulse signals with random intervals within a collision avoidance period before transmitting the packet to verify a clear channel. Priority can be given to voice calls by using larger pulse transmission probability. We develop an efficient analytical procedure to calculate channel utilization and packet delay performance of CSMA/CA DFT protocol in terms of the various packet generation rates, the lengths of collision avoidance period and packet transmission period, and pulse transmission probability. In the numerical results, we compare the average performance measures of CSMA/CA system with IFT (Immediate-First-Transmission) protocol [1], where excellent network performance improvement by adequate choice of ratios between collision avoidance periods and transmission periods, and pulse transmission probability has been shown.	best, worst and average case;network packet;network performance;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming);throughput;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation;transmitter	Wuyi Yue;Yutaka Matsumoto	2002		10.1109/HICSS.2002.994523	carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;transmission delay;network performance;communications system;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	10.641362560014286	96.27510962177918	81231

The method distributes packets according to the congestion between paths and IP packet length. Since it is performed over SDN, no changes of existing protocols and devices are required. The authors implement the method by actual IoT devices and evaluate QoS by experiment. The results of the experiment show that the TCP throughput of the proposed method is higher than that of normal TCP when the difference in delay between multi-paths is low; but they also indicate that the TCP throughput of the proposal goes lower than that of normal TCP. To solve the problem, the authors proposes two modified methods. One is to switch the forwarding scheme according to the difference in delay between the paths. The other is to give delay to the path which has small delay. The paper shows the effectiveness of the modified proposed method by supplementary experiments.	experiment;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;software-defined networking;throughput	Kaori Iwata;Yoshihiro Ito	2017	2017 27th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2017.8215375	throughput;quality of service;computer network;internet protocol;internet of things;network packet;computer science;server	Mobile	-3.9318996975130216	93.0371036858607	81312

In this work, we study the stationary distribution of users by modeling the system as a multi-route queueing network with Poisson inputs. We consider arbitrary routing and arbitrary joint probability distributions for the channel holding times in each route. Through a decomposition-composition approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the joint stationary distribution for the number of users in all cells. The stationary user distribution (1) is insensitive to the user movement patterns, (2) is insensitive to general and dependently distributed channel holding times, (3) depends only on the average arrival rate and average channel holding time at each cell, and (4) is completely characterized by an open network with M/M/∞ queues. We use the Dartmouth trace to validate our analysis, which shows that the analytical model is accurate when new session arrivals are Poisson and remains useful when non-Poisson session arrivals are also included in the data set. Our results suggest that accurate calculation of the user distribution, and other associated metrics such as the system workload, can be achieved with much lower complexity than previously expected.	complexity;queueing theory;routing;stationary process	Wei Bao;Ben Liang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566788	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;poisson's equation;mobility model;queueing theory;computer network	Metrics	13.820380386855186	90.74994829987774	81348

In this paper, we propose a dynamic bandwidth provisioning framework for such a situation. In order to have a good sense of nonstationary periodically measured traffic data, measurements were first collected over a period of three weeks excluding the weekends in three different months from an Internet access link. To characterize the traffic data rate dynamics of these data sets, we develop a seasonal AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) based model with the innovation process (disturbances) generalized to the class of heavy-tailed distributions. We observed a strong empirical evidence for the proposed model. Based on the ARCH-model, we present a probability-hop forecasting algorithm, an augmented forecast mechanism using the confidence-bounds of the mean forecast value from the conditional forecast distribution. For bandwidth estimation, we present different bandwidth provisioning schemes that allocate or deallocate the bandwidth based on the traffic forecast generated by our forecasting algorithm. These provisioning schemes are developed to allow trade off between the underprovisioning and the utilization, while addressing the overhead cost of updating bandwidth. Based on extensive studies with three different data sets, we have found that our approach provides a robust dynamic bandwidth provisioning framework for real-world periodically measured nonstationary traffic.	provisioning	Balaji Krithikaivasan;Yong Zeng;Kaushik Deka;Deep Medhi	2007	IEEE/ACM Trans.

The service is characterized by (i) the loss r ate of application data units(ADUs) bounded below a specified value, and (ii) ADU losses distributed evenly among flows subscribing to the service and uniformly over the duration o f each flow. Specifically, a flow is modeled as a sequence of bursts, each of which is a sequence of packets that carry the bits of an ADU. The first packet of each burst carries information on the ADU(e.g., its bandwidth requirement). This traffic model enables admission control at the burst level as well as at the flow level. Such a two level admission control approach is very effective in bounding end-to-end ADU loss rates of flows while maintaining high channel utilization in the network. The traffic model also enables simple techniques that can be used at a network channel to distribute ADU losses evenly among flows subscribing to the same statistical service, and to protect high priority ADUs (e.g ., I frames of MPEG applications).	end-to-end principle;moving picture experts group;network packet;throughput	Geoffrey G.

We summarize various approaches to transceiver channel assignment. Most approaches in the literature seek to assign a channel to each available transceiver. In contrast, we seek to achieve a baseline connected topology that conserves resources, keeping some fraction of the transceivers inactive so as to dynamically react to changing traffic stimuli. We call our scheme resource-minimized channel assignment (RMCA). We show that RMCA achieves basic network connectivity and low interference, while using fewer resources compared to other protocols, and performs well under varied node density and number of transceivers per node. Finally, we evaluate several channel assignment schemes through simulation using a set of widely-accepted networking and graph- theoretic metrics.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);interference (communication);memory management;serializability;simulation;theory;transceiver	Ryan E.

To extend the usage time of MDs and improve customer satisfaction levels, this research study, for the first time, studies the influence of different deployment strategies of a few low-power base stations (BSs) to reduce the power consumption of a large number of MDs. For both microcell and picocell scenarios, the authors’ analyse the power reductions at the MD side with the deployment of a low-power BS. The optimum low-power cell radius is derived for achieving the maximum MDs power reduction. The tradeoff relationships between MD power reduction and the key parameters of low-power BSs are investigated and discussed. It is shown that authors’ proposed method can achieve about 18% power reduction for microcell MDs.	customer relationship management;low-power broadcasting;mobile device;molecular dynamics;software deployment	Yang Yang;Wuxiong Zhang;Kun Wei;Xiumei Yang	2014	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2013.1117	telecommunications;computer science;mobile device	Mobile	24.441442626146422	90.96687587261418	81567

Four different system admission and preemption policies are investigated. Under either a wait-time constraint or a delay-time limit, either newly arriving messages are always admitted (and then properly dismissed if their required residence limits are not met) or a determination is made upon arrival on whether the new message can be served to completion within its required time limit, and only then is this message admitted. The delay-throughput performance of these admission and service-preemption policies is investigated and compared for synchronous discrete-time communications and processing systems modeled as a single-server Geom/G/1 discrete-time queuing system. Such models are used to describe various multiplexing and demand-assigned (reservation-based) multiple-access communication network systems operating under message delay limits. >	profiling (computer programming)	Izhak Rubin;Montasser Ouaily	1989		10.1109/INFCOM.1989.101433	discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous communication;distributed computing;queue management system;manufacturing;queueing theory;packet switching;multiplexing;statistics;computer network;channel	Arch	3.9852998545341545	93.38764550884565	81583

Such an active scan of WLAN injects probe frames in the network. Network conditions like packet losses, roaming, etc. result in increased active scanning and hence, an excessive increase of the probe traffic. Of the several causes inherent to WLANs like interference, we find an excessive probe traffic also has a potential of hampering goodput of a WiFi network. We confirm this behavior in a controlled home environment as well as in an uncontrolled enterprise environment. Our analysis of 36 hours of wireless traffic collected over a period of 5 months with approximately 45 million wireless frames reveals that goodput of a WLAN drops exponentially with increase in the probe traffic. Therefore, realtime detection of increase in probe traffic and knowledge of a threshold for acceptable probing is crucial for WLAN's performance. In this paper, we formulate a metric to measure the increase in probe traffic in realtime and evaluate its functioning empirically. The metric not only reflects increase in probe traffic correctly, it is even simple enough to allow its realtime measurement.	elegant degradation;goodput;interference (communication);network packet;real-time computing;uncontrolled format string	Dheryta Jaisinghani;Vinayak S.

In this switch, each input maintains a separate queue for each of the outputs, thus there are n/sup 2/ input queues in a (n*n) switch. Using synchronous operation, at most one packet per input and output will be transferred in any slot. The choice of the packets is done in a manner to maximize the throughput of the switch. Comparison of simulations with analytically derived upper and lower bounds show close to optimal throughput. The mean packet delay is also derived and its variance is bounded.

In this paper, we study the block delivery delay of DTN with the epidemic routing scheme based on random linear network coding (RLNC). First, simulations show that the influence of relay buffer size on the delivery delay is not as strong in RLNC-based routing as it is in replica-based routing. With this observation,we can simplify the performance analysis by constraining the buffer of the relay node to just one size. Then we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of block delivery delay with difference equations. Finally, we validate the correctness of our analytical results by simulations. key words: delay tolerant network, delay, network coding, epidemic routing, difference equations	correctness (computer science);delay-tolerant networking;linear network coding;network packet;profiling (computer programming);recurrence relation;relay;routing;simulation	Juhua Pu;Xingwu Liu;Nima Torabkhani;Faramarz Fekri;Zhang Xiong	2013	IEICE Transactions		routing;linear network coding;real-time computing;recurrence relation;computer science;processing delay;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;transmission delay;network delay;statistics;computer network	Networks	2.524240164987993	91.05719041824022	81814

59754fd5ad4e51d9499aea35514b9966f7edfc47	scheduling algorithms for throughput maximization in time-varying networks with reconfiguration delays	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	We consider the control of possibly time-varying wireless networks under reconfiguration delays. Reconfiguration delay is the time it takes to switch network resources from one subset of nodes to another and it is a widespread phenomenon observed in many practical systems. Optimal control of networks has been studied to a great extent in the literature, however, the significant effects of reconfiguration delays received limited attention. Moreover, simultaneous presence of time-varying channels and reconfiguration delays has never been considered and we show that it impacts the system fundamentally. #R##N#We first consider a Delay Tolerant Network model where data messages arriving randomly in time and space are collected by mobile collectors. In this setting reconfiguration delays correspond to travel times of collectors. We utilize a combination of wireless transmission and controlled mobility to improve the system delay scaling with load ρ from Θ( 1p1-rp2 ) to Θ( 11-r ), where the former is the delay for the corresponding system without wireless transmission. We propose control algorithms that stabilize the system whenever possible and have optimal delay scaling. #R##N#Next, we consider a general queuing network model under reconfiguration delays and interference constraints which includes wireless, satellite and optical networks as special cases. We characterize the impacts of reconfiguration delays on system stability and delay, and propose scheduling algorithms that persist with service schedules for durations of time based on queue lengths to minimize negative impacts of reconfiguration delays. These algorithms provide throughput-optimality without requiring knowledge of arrival rates since they dynamically adapt inter-switching durations to stochastic arrivals. #R##N#Finally, we present optimal scheduling under time-varying channels and reconfiguration delays, which is the main contribution of this thesis. We show that under the simultaneous presence of these two phenomenon network stability region shrinks, previously suggested policies are unstable, and new algorithmic approaches are necessary. We propose techniques based on state-action frequencies of Markov Decision Process theory to characterize the network stability region and propose throughput-optimal algorithms. The state-action frequency technique is applicable to a broad class of systems with or without reconfiguration delays, and provides a new framework for characterizing network stability region and developing throughput-optimal scheduling policies.

In this paper, we develop a simple but accurate enough analytical model for predicting queueing delay in non-homogeneous random access based WLANs. This leads to tractable solutions for meeting queueing delay specifications of a number of flows. Using this model, we address the feasibility problem of whether the mean delays required by a set of inelastic flows can be guaranteed in WLANs. Based on the model and feasibility analysis, we further develop an optimization technique to minimize the delays for inelastic flows. We present extensive simulation results to demonstrate the accuracy of our model and the performance of the algorithms.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;ergodic theory;loss function;mathematical optimization;quality of service;queuing delay;random access;real-time clock;simulation	Yan Gao;Chee Wei Tan;Ying Huang;Zheng Zeng;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935094	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	3.990211703638174	97.17091369682836	82111

Effectiveness of the scheme, however, is limited when the number of vehicle stations becomes large. This paper studies airtime occupancy ratio (AOR) of the relaying schemes and its relationship with packet delivery rate, assuming large number of vehicle stations locating around an intersection. A modified PCRL scheme is proposed to reduce the AOR and obtain better packet delivery rate by introducing adaptive modulation and coding at relay station. Simulated results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the AOR that is increased by relaying, and improves performance of the V2V communication at intersection.	airtime;broadcast relay station;broadcasting (networking);data rate units;modulation;network packet;software deployment;vehicle-to-vehicle	Le Tien Trien;Yasushi Yamao	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6966010	electronic engineering;fast packet switching;telecommunications;engineering;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	7.00487357501908	89.66237673789247	82135
bcb9749d82ed1a3ee3b7a308a1d52fb214e11d9d	proactive retention-aware caching with multi-path routing for wireless edge networks		We consider the problem of proactive retention aware caching in a heterogeneous wireless edge network consisting of mobile users accessing content from a server and associated to one or more edge caches. Our goal is to design a caching policy that minimizes the sum of content storage costs and server access costs over two design variables: the retention time of each cached content and the probability that a user routes content requests to each of its associated caches. We develop a model that captures multiple aspects such as cache storage costs and several capabilities of modern wireless technologies, such as server multicast/unicast transmissions, device multi-path routing, and cache access constraints. We formulate the problem of Proactive Retention Routing Optimization as a non-convex, non-linear mixed-integer program. We prove that it is NP-hard under both multicast/unicast modes—even when the caches have a large capacity and storage costs are linear—and develop greedy algorithms that have provable performance bounds for the case of uncapacitated caches. Finally, we propose heuristics with low computational complexity for the capacitated cache case as well as for the case of convex storage costs. Systematic evaluations based on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, compared to the existing caching schemes.	cpu cache;cache (computing);cobham's thesis;computation;computational complexity theory;greedy algorithm;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;multicast;multipath routing;np-hardness;network topology;nonlinear system;proactive parallel suite;provable prime;server (computing);sparse matrix;unicast	Samta Shukla;Onkar Bhardwaj;Alhussein A.

In this study, we investigated a signalling load control mechanism for SIP server networks and developed a corresponding queuing model. The so-called hop-by-hop overload control, known from recent IETF drafts and RFCs, was considered and a similar buffer overload control scheme which was developed for the SS7 signalling link in ITU-T Recommendation Q.704, was proposed. The mechanism is based on hysteretic load control with thresholds for reducing potential oscillations between the control-on and control-off states under certain loading conditions. Adjustment of three types of thresholds – the overload onset threshold, the overload abatement threshold, and the overload discard threshold – makes possible the regulation of signalling traffic to meet blocking requirements. In this study, we built and analyzed the M |M |1 queue with bi-level hysteretic input load control. A numerical example illustrating the control mechanism that minimizes the return time from overloading states satisfying the throttling and mean control cycle time constraints is also presented.	black and burst;blocking (computing);function overloading;hop-by-hop transport;hysteresis;load management;numerical analysis;onset (audio);queueing theory;requirement;server (computing);signalling system no. 7;simulation	Pavel O.

It has attracted a lot of attention, due to the limitations of traditional fortress-style defense modes. Even though a number of pioneer studies have been conducted in this area, few of them concern about the universality issue. This work focuses on two aspects of it. First, a unified collaborative detection framework is developed based on network virtualization technology. Its purpose is to provide a generic approach that can be applied to designing specific schemes for various application scenarios and objectives. Second, a general behavior perception model is proposed for the unified framework based on hidden Markov random field. Spatial Markovianity is introduced to model the spatial context of distributed network behavior and stochastic interaction among interconnected nodes. Algorithms are derived for parameter estimation, forward prediction, backward smooth, and the normality evaluation of both global network situation and local behavior. Numerical experiments using extensive simulations and several real datasets are presented to validate the proposed solution.

This requires the implementation of mechanisms that can discriminate service classes in terms of QoS. The IETF has recently proposed a differentiated services (Diffserv) framework for provision of QoS. In this paper we analyse the performance of two Diffserv mechanisms: threshold dropping and priority scheduling in terms of packet loss and mean packet delay. A comparison of the two mechanisms is carried out with the requirement that both mechanisms provide the same level of packet loss for the preferred flow. This comparison extends the results reported in the literature for these two mechanisms. In particular, in this paper we determine the impact of buffer threshold and buffer size on packet loss and mean packet delay in these mechanisms.

However, our experience is that so far the autonomic network research community does not have a common perception of what an autonomic network is. This paper attempts to propose a generic model for autonomic systems, along with a minimum set of required properties that would render a system compliant to this model. The paper emphasises the importance of such a common model for the credibility of the research community as well as to eliminate attempts to unnecessarily overload or blur the scope of the field.	autonomic networking;essence;quality of service	Stefan Schmid;Manolis Sifalakis;David Hutchison	2006		10.1007/11880905_1	self-organization;simulation;systems modeling;network architecture;telecommunications;computer science;autonomous system;artificial intelligence;programming language;service quality;robustness;systems architecture;autonomic computing	Security	-0.6524037980893148	103.63954183047449	82366

The buffer-map exchange contains redundant information which causes non-negligible overhead. In this paper we present a theoretical framework to study how the overhead can be lowered. Differentiating from the traditional data compression approach, we do not treat each buffer-map as an isolated data block, but consider the correlations between the sequentially exchanged buffer-maps. Under this framework, two buffer-map compression schemes are proposed and the correctness of the schemes is proved mathematically. Moreover, we derive the theoretical limit of compression gain based on probability theory and information theory. Based on the system parameters of UUSee (a popular P2P streaming platform), our simulations show that the buffer-map sizes are reduced by 86% and 90% (from 456 bits down to only 66 bits and 46 bits) respectively after applying our schemes. Furthermore, by combining with the traditional compression methods (on individual blocks), the sizes are decreased by 91% and 95% (to 42 bits and 24 bits) respectively. Our study provides a guideline for developing practical compression algorithms.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);data compression;information theory;map;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;simulation;streaming media	Chunxi Li;Changjia Chen;Dah-Ming Chiu	2011	CoRR		data compression;real-time computing;telecommunications;information theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;statistics;computer network	HPC	1.430445515258495	91.13819615131045	82382
ccf2cad318f23088b61893f0e00aaea640384a20	vehicle-to-vehicle distributed storage in vehicular networks		In recent years, wireless communication demands from high-speed vehicles rapidly increase, due to the enrichment of various emerging vehicular applications including road safety, intelligent transportation, in-vehicle entertainments, self- driving, etc. Such high communication demands result in significant burdens on the supporting infrastructure in vehicular networks, which in turn deteriorate the quality of experience (QoE) of vehicular users. In the literature, local popular content caching is an effective approach to alleviate the burden on core networks as well as reducing the content downloading delay. However, the burden is simply shifted to RSUs if popular contents are cached at RSUs. In addition, the frequency reuse in space is also inadequate. Caching popular contents at vehicles may be an effective approach to solve the aforementioned problems. However, the critical issue of vehicle- based storage schemes is the high mobility nature of vehicles, which could lead to loss of stored data due to the storage vehicles' leaving the region of interests. To cope with the vehicle mobility issue, we propose a vehicle-based distributed storage scheme via local V2V communications in this paper. The key of the proposed data storage scheme is to maintain the survival of the stored data in a designated region by transferring the stored data from leaving vehicles to incoming vehicles at the entrance/exit of the region, in order to prevent data loss due to the high mobility of vehicles. Structured redundancy via erasure coding is also introduced in order to combat the volatile V2V links. Theoretical analysis and numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed vehicle-based distributed storage scheme and suggest that the stored data could survive for up to tens of hours under a typical road condition.	cache (computing);clustered file system;computer data storage;download;erasure code;gene ontology term enrichment;numerical analysis;vehicle-to-vehicle	Binbin Hu;Luoyang Fang;Xiang Cheng;Liuqing Yang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422220	computer network;cache;vehicular ad hoc network;vehicle-to-vehicle;data loss;intelligent transportation system;computer science;distributed database;computer data storage;distributed data store	Mobile	11.318955155406956	89.04148301992477	82433

Generally, the natural way to cope with traffic acceleration is to reduce cell size, and this can be done in many ways. The most obvious method is via picocells, but this requires additional CAPEX and OPEX investment to install and manage these new base stations. Another approach, which avoids this additional CAPEX/OPEX, involves offloading cellular traffic onto direct D2D connections whenever the users involved are in proximity. Given that most client devices are capable of establishing concurrent cellular and WiFi connections today, we expect the majority of immediate gains from this approach to come from the use of the unlicensed bands.

By emulating network characteristics, such as restricted bandwidth, delay and losses, knowledge about the behavior and performance of actual protocol implementations can be obtained. This paper focuses on the generation of losses in network emulators and shows the beneficial effects of being able to control the generation of losses in a precise way. Both the possibility to get additional knowledge about a protocol implementations behavior, as well as statistical benefits such as paired experiments are discussed. By extending the loss generation to also include bit-error generation, in addition to packet losses, a finer level of abstraction is provided. Deterministic biterror generation allows detailed and repeatable studies of bit-error sensitive protocol behavior. TCP and a loss differentiating variant of TCP is used to illustrate the utility of improved loss generation.	bandwidth (signal processing);bit error rate;emulator;experiment;hoc (programming language);network emulation;network packet	Johan Garcia;Stefan Alfredsson;Anna Brunstrom	2006			emulation;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;transmission control protocol;distributed computing;packet loss;determinism;computer network	Networks	-1.135529124557555	90.43278965458394	82447

It is well known that the slowly varying nature of the average queue size computed using an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) used in the RED scheme causes this chaotic behavior. This paper presents a new mathematical function to model the weighting parameter used in the EWMA. The proposed weighting function incorporates the knowledge of the dynamic changes in the congestion characteristics, traffic characteristics and queue normalization. Using this pragmatic information eliminates the slowly varying nature of the average queue size. It is evident from our simulations that the proposed approach not only reduces the chaotic queue oscillation significantly but also provides predictable low delay and low delay jitter with high throughput gain and reduced packet loss rate even under heavy load of traffic conditions.	active queue management;algorithm;chaos theory;internet;network congestion;network packet;packet delay variation;pragmatic theory of information;random early detection;router (computing);simulation;throughput;weight function	Shan Suthaharan	2007	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2007.10.002	high-throughput screening;active traffic management;real-time computing;the internet;simulation;weight function;random early detection;systems modeling;jitter;telecommunications;weighted arithmetic mean;computer science;moving average;weighted random early detection;network congestion;oscillation;queue;active queue management;function;statistical process control;statistics;computer network;pragmatics	Metrics	-0.5268615816658943	102.0292889380507	82483

We derive the voice call capacity, the TCP throughput, and the bandwidth utilization using the proposed five-dimensional Markov model. We show that there exists a correlation among the queue size of client nodes and the capacity and throughput of the network. We also demonstrate how bandwidth utilization is affected by variable packet arrival rates. The analytical results match well with the simulation results generated by Qualnet simulator. Moreover, we conduct an experimental study of the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism of the IEEE 802.11e standard with a real-environment testbed consisting of 1 access point and 11 laptops to further validate the analytical and simulation results.	experiment;laptop;markov chain;markov model;mathematical model;network packet;simulation;testbed;throughput;wireless access point	Sajib Datta;Sajal K.

The scheduling objective is to minimize the expected energy expenditure while satisfying the deadline constraint based on information about the unserved bits, channel state/statistics, and the remaining time slots to the deadline. At each time slot, the scheduling decision is made without knowledge of future channel state, and thus there is a tension between serving many bits when the current channel is good versus leaving too many bits for the deadline. Under the assumption that no other packet is scheduled concurrently and no outage is allowed, we derive the optimal scheduling policy. Furthermore, we also investigate the dual problem of maximizing the number of transmitted bits over T time slots when subject to an energy constraint.	downtime;duality (optimization);loss function;monomial;network packet;point-to-point protocol;scheduling (computing);transmitter	Juyul Lee;Nihar Jindal	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5198889	job shop scheduling;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;fading;statistics	Embedded	17.760162129387798	95.8602216184142	82603

We propose the noncooperative random access game, where the link's utility function captures its demand for successful transmission and the pricing of persistence probability is used to improve efficiency for medium access. First, we consider a pricing function that is a linear function of the persistence probability. This pricing function leads to a simple iterative scheme by which each link can arrive at the Nash equilibrium (NE) using only its local measurements. The existence, uniqueness and stability of the NE for the game are proved. Since the persistence probability at equilibrium point, the system throughput and the packet collision probability all depend on the fixed price coefficient, we propose the adaptive price setting scheme based on the measurement for network conditions. The adaptive pricing scheme admits a Pareto dominant NE and enables higher link rates with lower persistence probabilities. Simulation results illustrate that the fast convergence, fair and efficient resource allocation of these schemes can be achieved with less collision compared with the standard binary exponential backoff protocols.	access control;algorithm;coefficient;collision domain;exponential backoff;fairness measure;game theory;hoc (programming language);iterative method;linear function;local convergence;nash equilibrium;network packet;overhead (computing);pareto efficiency;persistence (computer science);random access;simulation;throughput;time complexity;utility	Bo Yang;Gang Feng;Xin-Ping Guan	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434057	wireless ad hoc network;game theory;mathematics;mathematical economics;computer network	Mobile	16.119909064301705	97.29931660604613	82636

Recently, Hou and Kumar provided a novel framework for analyzing and designing delay-guaranteed wireless networking solutions. While inspiring, their idle-time-based analysis applies only to flows with a special traffic pattern called the frame-synchronized setting. The problem remains largely open for general traffic patterns. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a general framework that characterizes and achieves the complete delay-constrained capacity region with general traffic patterns in single-hop downlink access-point wireless networks. We first show that the timely wireless flow problem is fundamentally an infinite-horizon Markov decision process MDP. Then, we judiciously combine different simplification methods to prove that the timely capacity region can be characterized by a finite-size convex polygon. This for the first time allows us to characterize the timely capacity region of wireless flows with general traffic patterns. We then design three scheduling policies to optimize network utility and/or support feasible timely throughput vectors for general traffic patterns. The first policy achieves the optimal network utility and supports any feasible timely throughput vector but suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second and third policies are inspired by our MDP framework and are of much lower complexity. Simulation results show that both achieve near-optimal performance and outperform other existing alternatives.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);best-effort delivery;convex set;curse of dimensionality;cyber-physical system;entropy maximization;flow network;heuristic;level of detail;markov chain;markov decision process;network utility;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;text simplification;throughput	Lei Lei Deng;Chih-Chun Wang;Minghua Chen;Shizhen Zhao	2017	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2017.2749513	throughput;computer network;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);curse of dimensionality;network utility;airfield traffic pattern;telecommunications link;markov decision process	Mobile	16.444806673478592	96.18620160222706	82662

Our simulations showed that EFXCP achieves excellent performance. However, the stability analysis in our previous paper neglected the feedback delay for simplification analysis, which is not consistent with that of present-day networks and make the analysis inaccuracy. To make the analysis more realistic and accurate, to portray the real network, we consider the stability analysis with the feedback delay and present a fluid flow of traffic model of EFXCP. Based on the model, we utilize classical control theory method to further analyze the stability of EFXCP. We also quantitatively define the efficiency and fairness index, and based on these definitions, we qualitatively analyze the efficiency and fairness convergence timings of EFXCP. These conclusions are validated by extensive NS2 simulations. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

b244542ea92f087658f5bb0417c9267d766f292a	on the scalability of reliable data transfer in high speed networks		This paper considers reliable data transfer in a high-speed network (HSN) in which the perconnection capacity is very large. We focus on sliding windo w protocols employingselective repeat for reliable data transfer and study two reliability mechanism s based on ARQ and FEC. The question we ask is which mechanism is more suitable for an HSN in which the scalability of reliable data transfer in terms of receiver’s buffer requirement and achievable dela y and throughput is a concern. To efficiently utilize the large bandwidth available to a connection in an H SN, sliding window protocols require a large transmission window. In this regime of large transmis ion windows, we show that while both mechanisms achieve the same asymptotic throughput in the pr esence of packet losses, their delay and buffer requirements are different. Specifically, an FEC-ba sed mechanism has delay and receiver’s buffer requirement that are asymptotically smaller than that of an ARQ-based selective repeat mechanism by a factor oflogW , whereW is the window size of the selective repeat mechanism. This re sult is then used to investigate the implications of each reliability me chanism on protocol design in an HSN in terms of throughput, delay, buffer requirement, and contro l overhead.	automatic repeat request;bandwidth (signal processing);block size (cryptography);communications protocol;forward error correction;microsoft windows;network packet;overhead (computing);requirement;scalability;scanline rendering;sed;selective repeat arq;throughput;window function	Majid Ghaderi;Donald F.

In this paper, we propose a new distributed channel access scheme through minor modifications to EDCA. Guaranteed priority is provided to real time voice traffic over data traffic, while a certain service time and short-term fairness enhancement are provided to data traffic. We also present analytical models to calculate the percentage of time to serve voice traffic and the achieved data throughput.

The key properties of multi-media traffic are characterized by the great diversity of correlation and burstiness. As in [1,2], we construct the multi-media traffic based on various two-state Markov chains. Moreover, we here allow each two-state Markov chain to be defined on different transition intervals, representing the diversity of peak access rate from individual sources. Upon a time index normalization, the queue is modeled by a multi-dimensional discrete Markov process. Extending the technique developed in [2,3], the entire solution of queue length distributions is constructed. It uses a generating function approach. By matrix spectral decomposition and diagonalization, one can decompose the evaluation of each individual vanishing/non-vanishing root. Each vanishing root is used to obtain the queue boundary values; each non-vanishing root constructs a geometric term in the expression of the queue length distribution. It is found that all the vanishing roots must be real and all the complex non-vanishing roots can be ignored. In numerical studies, we first verify the time index normalization in source modeling, and then examine the effect of multi-media traffic properties on ATM queues.	atm turbo;markov chain;numerical analysis;singular value decomposition	San-qi Li;Hong-Dah Sheng	1991		10.1109/INFCOM.1991.147527	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-0.7112134689966682	99.75412280957053	82788

Among these, the most common are jamming-based denial of service (DoS) attacks, which result in packet loss. The concept of a honeypot node or honeynode has been explored for wireless networks and has shown to be effective in attracting attacks, thus deterring the jammers from productive nodes. Yet a single dedicated honeynode, on account of its permanent idleness, is wasteful of an entire node as resource. In this paper, we seek to resolve this dilemma by dynamically selecting the honeynode for each transmission period, and we explore various methods of doing so. To begin with, we develop the first comprehensive queuing model for CRNs, which pose unique modeling challenges due to their periodic sensing and transmission cycles. We then build a simulation of CRNs under attack from jammers, introduce a series of strategies for honeynode assignment to combat these attacks, and assess the performance of each strategy. We find that the predictions of our mathematical model track closely with the results of our simulation experiments.	cognitive radio;computer simulation;denial-of-service attack;elegant degradation;experiment;honeypot (computing);interference (communication);mathematical model;network packet;quality of service;queueing theory;queuing delay;radio jamming	Suman Bhunia;Xing Su;Shamik Sengupta;Felisa J.

In mobile ATM networks, user mobility and handoff path rerouting may produce extra traffic load over network links, requiring larger network capacity to support the same QoS. We propose a flow model for mobile ATM networks. The model represents the mobile-generated traffic as a set of stochastic flows over a set of OD (origin-destination) pairs. The user mobility is defined by transfer probabilities of the flows and the handoff path rerouting algorithm is modeled by a transformation between the routing functions for traffic flows. The analysis shows that user mobility may cause temporal variations as well as smoothing effects on the network traffic. Using the flow network model, typical handoff path rerouting algorithms are evaluated through both analytical and experimental approaches. The evaluation methodology can be used for either redesigning the network topology for a given path rerouting algorithm or selecting a path rerouting algorithm for a given network topology under a specific mobile service scenario.

86fd9fca8b7be9c8dd99935b258b06a2497b17ef	cross-layer multipath transmission of elastic and streaming traffic over heterogeneous wireless networks and its performance analysis		Next-generation wireless networks are expected to be heterogeneous by integrating multiple broadband access technologies. Popular wireless devices become equipped with various network interfaces. Multihoming support can be enabled to allow for multiple simultaneous associations with heterogeneous networks. Taking advantage of multihoming capability, we investigate multipath transmission of elastic and streaming traffic over heterogeneous wireless networks. A new flow splitting and multipath transmission scheme is proposed by exploiting crosslayer information of bulk data and video streams. The heavy-tailedness of elastic flow size is mitigated by balancing the traffic load, while the large bandwidth requirement of streaming flows is satisfied by aggregating fractional bandwidth available in multiple networks. Based on the leaky bucket algorithm and a nearly decomposable Markov process, the flow-level performance is evaluated in terms of flow blocking probabilities and data loss probability. Also, we analyze the fine-granular packet-level performance with respect to transfer delay using a batch arrival queueing model. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain of the multipath transmission scheme.	algorithm;attachments;bandwidth (signal processing);blocking (computing);internet access;leaky bucket;multihoming;multipath propagation;network packet;numerical method;profiling (computer programming);queueing theory;real-time clock;semantic network;streaming media;transmission (bittorrent client);upwind scheme	Wei Song	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-29222-4_35	multipath propagation;computer network;multihoming;streams;wireless network;heterogeneous network;leaky bucket;broadband;computer science;network interface	Metrics	4.387581475909989	97.94941347131834	82855

The existing scheduler is used for multiple channels with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers in hybrid time division multiplexing (TDM)/wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. The proposed dual scheduler will also be used in the same optical networks. We extend the existing MCDRR scheduling algorithm for n channels to the case of considering two schedulers for the same n channels.

For the concern of providing service guarantees in such networks, it is crucial to have analytical results, e.g. bounds, on the performance of multi-class FIFO. Surprisingly, there are few such results in the literature. This paper is devoted to filling the gap. Specifically, a single hop deterministic case is studied, for which, delay and backlog bounds are derived, in addition to guaranteed rate and service curve characterizations that may be exploited to extend the analysis to network cases.	fifo (computing and electronics);network calculus;network switch;telecommunications network	Yuming Jiang	2013	CoRR		real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	0.06708236271500928	98.12167515022507	82936

Experimental results have shown that many well-designed protocols will fail simply because of fading and shadowing experienced in a realistic wireless environment. While fading and shadowing for radio propagation are well understood in wireless communication community, they are rarely studied in network level research for wireless sensor networks. This paper studies the fading and shadowing effects on the performance of different MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks. We show that fading and shadowing can have a significant influence on network performance. We study and compare network performance for three different systems: 1) a multi-channel CDMA system; 2) a pure CDMA system; 3) a contention based system. Through discrete event simulation (using ns-2), we show that the multi-channel CDMA system outperforms the pure CDMA system as well as the contention based system under fading and shadowing environments	hoc (programming language);network performance;simulation;software propagation	Bao Hua Liu;Brian P.

The broadband wireless access of IEEE 802.16 protocol, therefore, introduces an important issue for bandwidth usage of Subscriber Stations (SSs) in Wireless Metropolitan Area Network. This paper proposes a centralised Transmission Tree Scheduling (nTTS) algorithm for IEEE 802.16 mesh networks. The proposed algorithm takes the effects of channel interference into account and is designed to improve both the Channel Utilisation Ratio (CUR) and the QoS performance of the mesh network.	algorithm;centralisation;interference (communication);mesh networking;netware file system;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications network	Rung-Shiang Cheng;Whe Dar Lin	2012	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2012.047011	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;service set;real-time computing;quality of service;ieee 802;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;computer science;mesh networking;shared mesh;order one network protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.6904187906222115	92.90920443182321	83080

These tools have to be accurate, in order to closely match the statistical characteristics of network traffic, easy to implement, and efficient. VBR compressed video traffic is expected to represent most of the multimedia traffic loading networks in the immediate future, and the MPEG coding scheme will be the most widely used standard for many types of applications. Although many works in literature present models of video traffic, little effort has been devoted up to now to capturing one of the most important characteristics of MPEG video traffic: intra-GoP correlation. In this paper, after demonstrating that this correlation strongly affects the performance of a network loaded by MPEG video traffic, an accurate, fast and easy generation algorithm is proposed. The algorithm allows a sequence to be generated, imposing the Short Range Dependence (SRD), the Long Range Dependence (LRD) behavior and the probability density function of any given MPEG video sequence.

Throughput maximization problem under fairness constraint in a finite horizon is formulated as a novel multiwindow optimization problem. Through analysis users’ thresholds are shown to be time variant for throughput maximization with fairness in each time window. Simulation results clearly show that compared with non decision-based strategy, simple ratio-based scheme (SR) achieves within 1.6% of the global optimal value in terms of throughput and is scalable in terms of the number of nodes. Fairness index performance is marginally better than non decisionbased strategy. Next, we show throughput degradation of SR scheme for asymmetric channels, and introduce general ratio-based scheme (GR) that adapts to provide higher throughput than fairness in a fully distributed manner for asymmetric channel conditions.	display resolution;elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;picture-in-picture;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Murad Khalid;Yufeng Wang;Le Xuan Hung;In-ho Ra;Ravi Sankar	2012	JCM	10.4304/jcm.7.2.155-164	fairness measure;wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	17.126285729301834	97.5506198609106	83430

When unlicensed (secondary) users opportunistically share spectrum with licensed (primary or incumbent) users, a given rendezvous channel may become unavailable due to the appearance of licensed user signals, which makes rendezvous impossible. Ideally, any node pair should be able to rendezvous over every available channel to minimize the possibility of such rendezvous failures. Channel hopping (CH) protocols have been proposed previously for establishing pairwise rendezvous. Some of them enable pairwise rendezvous over all channels but require global clock synchronization, which is very difficult to achieve in decentralized networks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach, called asynchronous channel hopping (ACH), for designing CH-based rendezvous protocols for decentralized CR networks. The resulting protocols are resistant to rendezvous failures caused by the appearance of primary user signals and do not require clock synchronization. We propose an optimal ACH design that maximizes the rendezvous probability between any pair of nodes, and show its rendezvous performance via simulation results	asynchronous circuit;automated clearing house;clock synchronization;cognitive radio;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;rendezvous protocol;requirement;simulation	Kaigui Bian;Jung-Min Jerry Park	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935056	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	10.859151604864223	91.3998785783971	83704
0a70c3b0ed1249eacae383b98898f2fdd8fb5a81	deadline-aware cooperative data exchange with network coding	cooperative data exchange;network coding;期刊论文;time critical application	Recent work shows that Cooperative Data Exchange (CDE) with network coding can significantly improve wireless performance, especially in data exchange scenario. Moreover, wireless networks are now capable of supporting time critical applications, e.g., video streaming. Such time-critical applications usually impose a deadline on the packet reception, i.e., beyond which, the packet is useless or invalid to the users. In this paper, we propose a deadline-aware CDE scheme with network coding, so as to maximize the total number of packets that can be timely received/decoded at wireless clients/devices. We first formulate the problem into an integer programming, and prove that it is NP-hard. For the case when the deadline of the packets is the same, we theoretically analyze the performance of two specific schemes. We then design an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the general problem, which is based on an auxiliary graph model. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, some recent studies have shown that under certain network conditions, TCP itself can produce traffic that exhibits dependence over limited timescales, even in the absence of higher-level variability. In this paper, we use a simple Markovian model to argue that when the loss rate is relatively high, TCP’s adaptive congestion control mechanism indeed generates traffic with OFF periods exhibiting power-law shape over several timescales and thus introduces pseudo-long-range dependence into the overall traffic. Moreover, we observe that more variable initial retransmission timeout values for different packets introduces more variable packet inter-arrival times, which increases the burstiness of the overall traffic. We can thus explain why a single TCP connection can produce a time-series that can be misidentified as self-similar using standard tests.

The end-to-end delays experienced by the messages have a significant “random” component due to the complicated nature of network traffic. We propose a method based on delay-regression estimation to achieve low end-to-end delays for message transmissions in distributed computing applications. Two-paths are realized between various communicating processes in a transparent manner. Our scheme is implemented over the Internet by a network of NetLets, which communicate with one another to maintain an accurate “state” of delay-regressions in the network. NetLets handle all network traffic between the processes and also perform routing at a certain level depending on the underlying network. We present experimental results to illustrate that NetLets provide a viable and practical means for achieving low end-to-end delays for distributed computing applications over the Internet.	distributed computing;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;internet;network packet;network traffic control;routing	Nageswara S.

RTS frame collisions are drastically reduced with little additional overhead due to pulse/tone exchange in the proposed protocol. In addition, the number of exposed nodes is reduced by using smart antennas. Furthermore, since the occurrence of the deafness problem can be identified by pulse/tone exchange failure, retransmission is conducted using a fixed contention window value. Therefore, the wastage of wireless resources due to the deafness problem is reduced. As a result, the network throughput can be effectively improved compared with that for previous protocols.

In this paper, we propose the novel multi-reservation multiple access (MRMA) scheme for future wireless multimedia networks based on such an MPR channel model, which fully exploit the channel's MPR capacity while fulfilling the quality of service (QoS) requirements of different multimedia traffic. MRMA employs a centralized reservation mechanism to control the number of simultaneous packets transmitted in each time slot to satisfy a traffic class' packet loss ratio requirement. Moreover, MRMA incorporates an efficient adaptive random access method and a priority control mechanism to provide guaranteed and best-effort services for real time voice/video traffic and connectionless data traffic, respectively. Simulation and analytical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	best-effort delivery;centralized computing;channel (communications);connectionless communication;minkowski portal refinement;multi-user;network packet;quality of service;random access;requirement;signal processing;simulation	Hui Chen;Fei Richard Yu;Henry C.

We propose a neural-network-based intra-media synchronization mechanism, called neural network smoother (NNS). The NNS is composed of a neural network (NN) traffic predictor, an NN window determinator, and a window-based playout smoothing algorithm. The NN traffic predictor employs an on-line-trained backpropagation neural network (BPNN) to periodically predict future traffic characteristics. With the predicted traffic characteristics, the NN window determinator determines the corresponding optimal window by means of an off-line-trained BPNN in an effort to achieve a maximum of the playout quality (Q) value. The window-based playout smoothing algorithm then dynamically adopts various playout rates according to the window and the number of packets in the buffer. Compared to two other playout approaches, simulation results show that NNS achieves high-throughput and low-discontinuity playout under a variety of traffic arrivals.		Maria C. Yuang;Po L.

A number of ATM switch architectures have been proposed in the literature. However, industry has shown that is better to use the well-known shared-medium technique in the design of these ATM switches. In this paper, four variations of a new distributed scheme are proposed for the arbitration of a shared bus of an ATM switch. These schemes are based on learning automata. By taking advantage of the bursty nature of ATM traffic, the new arbitration scheme demonstrates superb performance compared to the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme.	atm turbo;architecture as topic;automata theory;bus mastering;learning automata;network switch;requirement;reserved for future hl7 registration schemes;simulation;speedup;switch device component;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mohammad S.

Circuit switching is inappropriate for the Internet traffic which is very bursty nature. Therefore, metro networks can become a bottleneck. In order to resolve this problem, the IEEE 802.17 working group has proposed the Resilient Packet Ring (RPR) technology. In order to provide fairness among stations in the RPR network, two types of RPR fairness mechanisms have been defined. However, the IEEE 802.17 RPR fairness mechanisms have the problem of inefficient use of the available bandwidth after the congestion at a node has been resolved. In'this paper, we propose an improved bandwidth allocation in which, after the congestion resolution at a node, the node estimates the number of effective nodes transmitting traffic, measures the remaining bandwidth and fairly allocates the available bandwidth to effective nodes. To show the performance of our proposed mechanism, we have performed simulation and show that the proposed mechanism gives higher bandwidth utilization than the existing RPR fairness mechanisms.	fairness measure;resilient packet ring	Dong-Hun Lee;Jae-Hwoon Lee	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.5.1526	fairness measure;availability;the internet;metropolitan area network;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;synchronous optical networking;resilient packet ring;computer security;equity;packet switching;circuit switching;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	0.7376717294836915	101.76135875424413	84486

EGPRS is also the evolutionary path chosen by the Universal Wireless Communications Consortium, leading toward the convergence of GSM and IS-136 standards for their next-generation wireless systems. We discuss the feasibility of supporting integrated services, such as packet voice, Web browsing, and best-effort data, using EGPRS. We first describe the relevant capabilities offered by the currently proposed standard, and then outline additional capabilities at the radio link control/medium access control layer that are necessary to support integrated services in a spectrally efficient manner. In summary, these needed capabilities are: fast uplink access during an ongoing session; fast resource assignment for both uplink and downlink; and the ability to differentiate services at the base station subsystem. To realize these capabilities, we propose enhancements to the RLC/MAC layer. These enhancements include a new set of packet control channels (namely, a fast packet access channel in the uplink, and a fast packet access grant channel and a fast packet polling channel in the downlink); uplink access protocols that utilize these control channels; and a modified fast uplink access channel structure. These changes would enable EGPRS to offer a wide range of services through a single packet-based network. Similar ideas are also applicable to other third-generation systems.	integrated services;rlc circuit	Xiaoxin Qiu;Kapil K. Chawla;Li-Fung Chang;Justin C.-I. Chuang;Nelson Sollenberger;James F.

Thus, it does not guarantee the quality of voice transmission that is highly sensitive to error and delay. The situation is even more severe in wireless networks which experience even more distortion and attenuation. Therefore, enhancing the voice traffic quality in the wireless network is essentials for users to experience the lowest erroneous voice traffic. The objective of this paper is to propose an enhanced link reliability scheme and a low level frame prioritize scheme where they are able to improve the QoS in voice traffic especially in wireless networks. Each scheme utilized the wireless environment to tackle the time sensitive traffic. The two schemes have been proven to be able to performance well in enhancing voice quality under specified circumstances via network simulations.	best-effort delivery;distortion;internet protocol suite;protocol stack;quality of service;simulation	Boon Hoi Lim;Chong Eng Tan	2009	2009 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, (ICITST)		telecommunications;engineering;computer security;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Mobile	-3.452590423923385	91.69983152102766	84704

With the aid of the broadcasting and caching techniques, it has been proved that the overall performance of the system can be enhanced. In this paper, we explore the impact on the broadcasting schemes coupled with proxy caching and develop an analytical model to evaluate the system performance in a highly heterogeneous network environment. We develop guidelines for resources allocation, transmission strategies as well as caching schemes under different system configurations. The model can assist system designers to study various design options as well as perform system dimensioning. Moreover, a systematic comparison between replication and layering is performed. From the results, it can be seen that the system performance of layering is better than that of replication when the environment is highly heterogeneous even if the layering overhead is higher than 25%. In addition, it is found that the system blocking probability can be further reduced by exploring the broadcast capability of the network if the proxy server cannot store all the popular videos.	access network;blocking (computing);cache (computing);datacasting;erlang (unit);internet access;overhead (computing);proxy server;replication (computing);requirement;server (computing);streaming media	King-Man Ho;Wing-Fai Poon;Kwok-Tung Lo	2007	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2007.908326	replication;real-time computing;the internet;heterogeneous network;cpu cache;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;probability;coupling;network performance;dimensioning;broadcasting;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;systems design	Mobile	2.6215528697985637	104.35668442194086	84756

Carrier sense is known to be imperfect, and many improved techniques have been proposed. Is the search for a replacement justified? This paper presents a theoretical model for average case two-sender carrier sense based on radio propagation theory and Shannon capacity. Analysis using the model shows that carrier sense performance is surprisingly close to optimal for radios with adaptive bitrate. The model suggests that hidden and exposed terminals usually cause modest reductions in throughput rather than dramatic decreases. Finally, it is possible to choose a fixed sense threshold which performs well across a wide range of scenarios, in large part due to the role of the noise floor. Experimental results from an indoor 802.11 testbed support these claims.	access control;best, worst and average case;channel capacity;concurrency (computer science);corner case;experiment;fairness measure;interference (communication);list of code lyoko episodes;locality of reference;multiplexing;networking hardware;noise floor;point-to-point protocol;shannon capacity of a graph;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;testbed;theory;throughput	Micah Z.

Wireless links are slower and less reliable compared to wired links and are prone to loss of signal due to noise and fading. Furthermore, host mobility can give rise to periods of disconnection from the fixed network. The use of existing network protocols, which were developed mainly for the high bandwidth and faster wired links, with mobile computers thus gives rise to unique performance problems arising from host mobility and due to the characteristics of wireless medium. Indirect protocols can isolate mobility and wireless related problems using mobility support routers (MSRs) as intermediaries, which also provide backward compatibility with fixed network protocols. We present the implementation and performance evaluation of I-TCP, which is an indirect transport layer protocol for mobile wireless environments. Throughput comparison with regular (BSD) TCP shows that I-TCP performs significantly better in a wide range of conditions related to wireless losses and host mobility. We also describe the implementation and performance of I-TCP handoffs.	performance evaluation	Ajay V. Bakre;B. R. Badrinath	1997	IEEE Trans.

We focus on banyan networks which are important in parallel computer architectures and telecommunication systems to illustrate our approach and our algorithm is tailored to this problem. The networks we consider are organised in a finite number of stages through each of which a task passes successively in its transmission. The components which forward messages in each stage are modelled independently as small sub-networks of queues; these components are crossbars in the case of banyan networks. Blocking can occur on several upstream paths preceding a full component and the inter-stage blocking effect is taken into account iteratively, blocking probabilities being computed in terms of results of a previous step. The networks we consider may be non-homogeneous in that different servers may have different rates and the arrival processes need not be identical. We derive the queue length probability distribution of each switch from which performance measures, such as blocking probability, mean buffer occupancy and mean transmission time, follow.		Peter G.

While most such algorithm design assumes a single file/layer being multicast, layered coding introduces new challenges into the paradigm due to its cumulative decoding nature. Layered coding is designed to handle heterogeneity in receiver capacities, and a node may decode layer k only if it successfully receives all layers in 1..k. We show that recently proposed optimization models for layered multicast do not correctly address this challenge. We argue that in order to achieve the absolute maximum throughput (or minimum cost), it is necessary to decouple the application-layer throughput from network-layer throughput. In particular, a node should be able to receive a nonconsecutive layer or a partial layer even if it cannot decode and utilize it (e.g., for playback in media streaming applications). The rationale is that nodes at critical network locations need to receive data just for helping other peers. We present a mathematical programming model that addresses these challenges and achieves absolute optimal performance. Simulation results show considerable throughput gain (cost reduction) compared with previous models, in a broad range of network scenarios. We then provide a formal proof that the layered multicast problem is NP-complete. We design a randomized rounding algorithm to approximate the optimal layered multicast, and show the efficacy of our technique using simulations. We then proceed to further generalize our model by studying the optimal progression of layer sizes. We show that such optimization is nonconvex, and apply a simulated annealing algorithm to solve it, with flexible trade-off between solution quality and running time. We verify the effectiveness of the new model and the simulated annealing algorithm through extensive simulations, and point out insights on the connection between optimal layer size progression and node capacity distribution.	algorithm design;approximation algorithm;color gradient;computable function;design rationale;formal proof;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;multicast;np-completeness;programming model;programming paradigm;randomized algorithm;randomized rounding;routing;simulated annealing;simulation;streaming media;time complexity	Ajay Gopinathan;Zongpeng Li	2011	TOMCCAP	10.1145/1925101.1925102	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;randomized rounding;linear network coding;simulated annealing;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;cumulant	Networks	14.461037802131013	93.597270756243	85121

Embedded intelligent terminal (EIT), an indispensable part of IoT, works not only as a sensor but also as a primary processor. Due to the limited power resource of EIT, it is important to study how to improve the efficiency of its power use. To tackle this problem, we propose an energy-saving algorithm, Bayesian idle time prediction (BIP). The basic idea of BIP is to explore historical information and obtain a better estimation of idle time. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of BIP and compare our method with three existing algorithms [weighted idle-time-prediction (IP) algorithm, IP algorithm, and running time fixed threshold in IP algorithm] with respect to energy-saving potential, as well as system delay under a random number of tasks. Both simulation and field experiment results demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm in energy saving.	algorithm;computer terminal;electromagnetically induced transparency;embedded system;internet of things;linear programming;random number generation;simulation;time complexity	Chen Hou;Qianchuan Zhao	2015	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2385791	embedded system;algorithm design;real-time computing;simulation;prediction;network switch;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;television;algorithm;statistics;computer network	EDA	17.877990630299223	91.25353140828776	85168

The basic multichannel assignment scheme in our paper can keep the connectivity as good as single channel network. Furthermore, the nodes can periodically monitor the channel usage and dynamically switch the channels to the less busy ones. In order to work in the highly mobile scenarios in VANET, the method works in a fully distributed way with low overhead. Simulations show that our method can notably improve the throughput of VANETs.

In order to provide the flexibility of scheduling, the DL of LTE system uses the asynchronous HARQ so that retransmissions occur at any time. Generally in the FDD, the HARQ round trip time (RTT) which is time interval between initial transmission and retransmission is fixed. In the TDD, UL/DL subframe is separated in time domain by UL-DL configuration, so the HARQ RTT is different according to each subframe and that would be longer than the FDD. Especially when retransmissions occur, if the HARQ RTT increases, the QoS requirement of the retransmitted packet would not be satisfied by increased end-to-end latency. In this paper, we suggest the method of implementing DL asynchronous HARQ in LTE TDD system that the eNB can apply by UL-DL configuration as minimizing the HARQ RTT, and analyze in aspect of the HARQ RTT.	compaq lte;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;hybrid automatic repeat request;network packet;queueing theory;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;terabyte;test-driven development	Minseok Kim;Sungbong Kim;Yonghoon Lim	2012	2012 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium	10.1109/RWS.2012.6175303	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	5.044018688206923	94.00265059751855	85221

In this paper, we propose to exploit pre-established label switched paths with the aim to reduce handover processing latency which is one of the most critical performance metrics in micro-mobility environment. Thus, our proposed scheme has an advantage of offering micro-mobility to Mobile IP (MIP) with lower-latency handover as compared with the several existing MPLS-based MIP approaches. A detailed analytic model of setting up LSPs for fast handover processing is presented. Further, we do not only investigate the performance of our model but also propose detailed signaling steps so that our proposed scheme could be run on MPLS-based MIP system.

Cooperative diversity mitigates fading in these networks by establishing virtual antenna arrays through clustering the nodes. A cluster in a cooperative diversity network is a collection of nodes that cooperatively transmits a single packet. There are two types of clustering schemes: static and dynamic. In static clustering all nodes start and stop transmission simultaneously, and nodes do not join or leave the cluster while the packet is being transmitted. Dynamic clustering allows a node to join an ongoing cooperative transmission of a packet as soon as the packet is received. In this paper we take a broad view of the cooperative network by examining packet flows, while still faithfully implementing the physical layer at the bit level. We evaluate both clustering schemes using simulations on large multi-flow networks. We demonstrate that dynamically-clustered cooperative networks substantially outperform both statically-clustered cooperative networks and classical point-to-point networks.	apollonian network;bit-level parallelism;cluster analysis;cooperative multitasking;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);network packet;network performance;point-to-point protocol;scalability;simulation	Boulat A.

The use of VBR transport is generally considered to offer some potentially attractive advantages over more traditional CBR transport. These potential advantages include the expectation of improved reconstructed video quality, shorter end—to—end delays and improved statistical multiplexing performance. Unfortunately, most evaluations of the relative end—to—end performance of VBR versus CBR transport of digital video fail to adequately take into account the effects of lost cells in transporting multiple VBR streams which compete for limited network resources. These effects can be avoided with CBR transport using appropriate call admission control (CAC) procedures. Furthermore, these relative performance evaluations are generally not provided under comparable levels of network resource utilizations. Indeed, no methodology presendy exists for fairly assessing the relative end—to—end performance of CBR and VBR encoded video at the same level of resource utilization. In this paper, we develop and illustrate a methodology for comparing the relative performance, in terms of the corresponding end—to—end distortion, of CBR and VBR encoded digital video transport for fixed network resources and at identical multiplexing levels. The approach is an extension of a previously developed joint source—channel coding approach for VBR digital video transport on ATM networks. Our objective in this paper is to provide a common comparison framework for CBR and VBR video streams.	atm turbo;case-based reasoning;digital video;end-to-end principle;volume boot record	Ragip Kurceren;James W.

As the cost of electronics continues to drop, the number of activated, networked devices will grow rapidly. Each device sharing a particular multiaccess channel will need a unique identifier for that channel. Present communication protocols such as Ethernet specify that the manufacturers must coordinate with one another in order to avoid assigning the same ID twice. The article explores methods by which the devices could coordinate with one another to manage ID assignment dynamically and automatically. In particular, the article is an investigation of distributed protocols that utilize physical sources of symmetry breaking to enable a network of initially identical units to acquire the unique identities required for point-to-point communication over a shared resource such as a bus or common RF band. It presents several protocols, compares their resource use (time, random bits, space, communication), and notes a trade-off among these measures of algorithm complexity.	symmetry breaking	Joshua R.

While using multiple radios improves network throughput, it undermines TCP's underlying assumptions. When deployed in wireless mesh networks, TCP faces four challenges: transmission errors, packet reordering due to multipath routing, multihop connections and congestion. If not handled properly, they can incorrectly trigger TCP congestion control mechanisms and cause poor performance. In this paper, we propose a new TCP enhancement, named Congestion Coherence, to address these challenges. Simulation results confirm that this enhancement significantly improves TCP performance in wireless mesh networks.	cache coherence;control system;emergence;end-to-end principle;explicit congestion notification;item unique identification;mesh networking;multipath routing;network congestion;network packet;retransmission (data networks);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;wireless mesh network	Chunlei Liu;Fangyang Shen;Min-Te Sun	2007	2007 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW 2007)	10.1109/ICPPW.2007.18	wireless mesh network;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;multipath routing;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Mobile	-2.3390288479539296	91.42749340980696	85780

In this letter, the burst scheduling problem with channel switching delay limit is studied and shown to be NP-complete.

In most previous works on utility based flow control, the utility function of each user, which represents its satisfaction to the allocated data rate, is assumed to be fixed. This implies that the degree of the rate requirement of each user is assumed to be fixed over the entire duration of its session. However, in communication networks, many services are variable rate services, i.e., the degree of their rate requirement varies over time, which cannot be modeled with traditional static utility functions. To resolve this issue and appropriately model services with variable rate requirements, we propose a stochastic utility function that varies stochastically according to the variation of the degree of the rate requirement of a service. We formulate a flow control problem as a stochastic optimization problem with stochastic utility functions that aims at maximizing the average network utility while satisfying the constraint on link capacity and QoS requirement. By solving the stochastic optimization problem, we develop a distributed flow control algorithm that converges to the optimal rate allocation. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The subrating of a channel is done by dividing temporarily a full-rate channel into two half rate channels. Hand-off voice calls may also be served by subrated channels if all channels of the BS are occupied. The subrating of channels can degrade the quality, but it improves the grade of service (GOS) for hand-off calls and minimizes the delay. The provision of directed retry in overlapping area among neighbouring cells is also done for handoff attempts so that the blocking of handoff traffic can be checked to some extent. By using an iterative algorithm we obtain performance indices such as blocking probabilities, degradation in quality, total carried load, dwell time, etc. Numerical results have also been facilitated to prove the validity of the proposed iterative algorithm.	mobile phone;retry	M.

Existing research results have been focusing on the single-hop model which is not suitable for wireless multi-hop networks. In addition, the conditions of related system model are too idealistic. To address these limitations, we herein investigate the performance of a wireless multi-hop network, focusing on the one-to-many flows. Firstly, a system model with multi-hop delay was constructed; secondly, the transmission schemes of system model were gradually improved in terms of practical conditions such as limited queue length and asynchronous forwarding way; thirdly, the mean delay and the mean throughput were quantified in terms of coding window size if and number of destination nodes N for the wireless multi-hop transmission. Our findings show a clear relationship between the multi-hop transmission performance and the network coding parameters. This study results will contribute significantly to the evaluation and the optimization of network coding method.	linear network coding;mathematical optimization;one-to-many (data model);throughput	Tao Shang;Yong Fan;Jianwei Liu	2013	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2013.000074	stochastic process;transmitter;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;network delay;statistics;computer network	Mobile	12.533035247284575	91.04436210806395	86083

In this paper, we propose an Aeronautical Ad-hoc network (AANET) based on a single flight path, whereby the aircrafts in the cruise stage can communicate with each other through multi-hop relays without the aid of ground stations. Due to its special structure, existing results on conventional mobile ad hoc networks are not applicable for determining the capacity scaling law of this network model. We prove an upper bound on the per-node capacity and construct a simple transmission scheduling scheme to achieve the lower bound. Our results show that the capacity of the AANET is (Θ (1/D√ ρ log(mρ D))), where ρ is the density of aircrafts, D is the length of airway, and m is the number of height levels of the airway.	aeronautical telecommunication network;hoc (programming language);network model;relay;scheduling (computing);telecommunications network	Jianshu Yan;Cunqing Hua;Cailian Chen;Xin-Ping Guan	2013	Wireless Networks	10.1145/2491260.2491261	telecommunications;analysis;computer network	Mobile	6.175755564835382	89.52582051627253	86128

82e05ee6d708ca71ec644f20ba99e402fd93de02	performance of autonomous uplink transmissions in unlicensed spectrum lte		The immediate availability of Uplink (UL) time-frequency resources for transmission of new data is a key factor in reducing latency and improving UL throughput in cellular systems. This is particularly important for unlicensed spectrum operation where access to the channel is subject to Listen-Before-Talk (LBT), and scheduling UL transmissions with a preceding Downlink (DL) transmission as in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) can be inefficient. Therefore, this work proposes and studies autonomous UL transmissions (AUL) for LTE-based systems in unlicensed spectrum, where UL transmissions are allowed without requiring a prior scheduling request or an explicit scheduling grant from the Evolved Node B (eNB). The implications of AUL transmissions for the design of hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) and link adaptation mechanisms are investigated. Detailed performance evaluations in the 5 GHz unlicensed band show that dynamic switching between scheduled and autonomous UL transmissions offers the best throughput performance, while also coexisting fairly with co-channel Wi-Fi networks.	autonomous robot;coexist (image);compaq lte;hybrid automatic repeat request;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);system-level simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Reem Karaki;Amitav Mukherjee;Jung-Fu Cheng	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254599	real-time computing;latency (engineering);spectrum management;hybrid automatic repeat request;computer network;throughput;telecommunications link;scheduling (computing);computer science;link adaptation;communication channel	Mobile	22.305681346670454	89.88342250056189	86187

This work investigates the possibility for competing network operators to partially cooperate without any operational information exchange and to exploit the instantaneous opportunities for sharing which appear within each network. Under the proposed two novel dynamic spectrum selection (DSS) protocols all handsets have a primitive cognitive ability in order to enable multi-operator functionalities for inter-operator DSS. The worst case scenario for voice traffic where two networks with the same radio access technology (RAT) having an entirely correlated average traffic distribution (same capacity demand) during the busy hour is investigated. It has been shown through a UMTS system level simulator that the suggested protocols can increase each operator’s throughput by up to 10% compared to the conventional fixed spectrum allocation (FSA) scheme, and hence better spectrum utilization can be accomplished. Also, the effects of queuing incoming and handover calls before blocking or dropping them on DSS gains have been investigated. The results suggest an increase of up to 25% in throughput against the FSA if the DSS protocol and the queuing scheme are implemented.

Furthermore, digital video broadcast (DVB) has also recommended the inclusion of these Raptor codes for IP-datacast services. In this paper, enhancements on the system and receiver design using Raptor codes are studied, namely the permeable layer receiver (PLR) and the individual post-repair mechanism. With the PLR, the partial information ignored in the conventional receiver is passed from lower layer to higher layer. We show how a practical and efficient implementation of the Raptor decoder as a PLR can be done, which can not only achieve huge performance gains, but the gains can be achieved at an affordable low decoding complexity. Whereas the PLR is employed for enhancing both download and streaming services, the post-repair aims at guaranteeing reliable download delivery when a feedback channel is available. We propose here two efficient post-repair algorithms which fully exploit the properties of the Raptor codes. One allows to find a minimum set of source symbols to be requested in the post-delivery, and another allows to find a sufficient number of consecutive repair symbols. Selected simulations verify the good performance of proposed techniques.

We describe the system setup with directional relays and determine the user partition along with transmission time scheduling that can optimize a multicast performance criterion. We demonstrate that directional relays significantly improve the multicast system performance compared to omni-directional relays.

Applications will be able to dynamically adapt to the conditions and technical constraints of the network. This vision requires a dynamic allocation of scarce network resources to different users. This paper presents simulation results from a model for admission control and dynamic resource allocation in wireless networks, in a two-provider, multiple-user scenario. The access allocation and connection procedure is implemented using an efficient (welfare maximizing) incentive mechanism for capacity allocation at both providers.	memory management;problem domain;scenario (computing);simulation	Fernando Beltrán;Matthias Roggendorf	2005		10.1007/11569510_6	real-time computing;simulation;max-min fairness;resource allocation;computer science;resource allocation;computer network	Networks	23.392078395369996	95.10748238254031	86412

Typically, a WMN is a backbone network that carries high data rate traffic and employs Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) like access mechanisms. For a WMN to provide high throughput, the design of an efficient link scheduling algorithm is of paramount importance. Towards this end, we provide an overview of link scheduling algorithms in Spatial TDMA wireless mesh networks. These algorithms can be classified into three categories: those based only on a communication graph model of the network, those based on a communication graph model and Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) threshold conditions at receivers and those based on an SINR graph model of the network. We first outline a framework for modeling STDMA networks. We review representative research works and provide the description of an algorithm from each of these classes. We describe the relative merits and demerits of each class of algorithms and compare their performance via simulations. We conclude with a discussion on practical implementation of these algorithms and open research problems.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;computer performance;data rate units;existential quantification;graph (abstract data type);interference (communication);internet backbone;line graph;mesh networking;open research;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;wireless mesh network	Ashutosh Deepak Gore;Abhay Karandikar	2011	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/SURV.2011.040510.00008	wireless mesh network;algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	16.6168415029781	91.48009348382116	86455

With the help of fountain codes, such as Raptor codes, it is possible to completely omit content reconciliation in P2P networks. Hereby, the scheduling complexity of the data dissemination is greatly reduced. The contributions of the paper are the following: First, we present our implementation of the Raptor code used in the performed experiments and elaborate the application of the Raptor code in the scenario of P2P streaming. Second, we investigate the choice of the prevalent parameters, necessary to achieve the best trade-off between performance, computational complexity and resilience of the Raptor code. We use the obtained results to evaluate the general feasibility of using Raptor codes to improve the performance of P2P streaming networks. In addition, we report some insights arising from the practical experience with Raptor codes.	computational complexity theory;experiment;fountain code;peer-to-peer;raptor code;scheduling (computing)	Philipp M.

The algorithm maintains mean arrival rate information for a small number of flows to classify malicious and non-malicious flows. Malicious flows are penalized in proportion to their excess inflow. We show that the algorithm gives good throughput with fair share between TCP and UDP sources. The algorithm shows jitter suppression properties, which can be used in per flow guaranteed services.	active queue management;algorithm;differentiated services;fairness measure;lookup table;malware;network congestion;network packet;offset binary;queueing theory;scalability;tcp global synchronization;throughput;zero suppression	Manoj K.

Since delay tolerable, the ABR applications can be allocated the remaining resources after CBR (Constant Bit Rate) and VBR (Variable Bit Rate) applications have been accommodated. To avoid excessive losses the transmission rate of the ABR applications should be modulated by the amount of remaining resources. That is, the ABR rate should be controlled through a feedback based rate control mechanism. In this paper a network link shared by remote ABR and VBR applications is considered and the impact of various system time scales on the eeectiveness of the feedback based rate control scheme is investigated, by formulating and studying a simple analytical model. These time scales are expressed in terms of the network transmission speed, the minimum tolerable ABR rate and the rate of change of the VBR rate. While the negative impact of a decreased network time scale on the eeectiveness of this control scheme is well established, the impact of the ABR and VBR time scales has not been investigated in the past. It turns out that for a given network time scale, the induced cell losses can be signiicantly reduced for increased ABR and/or VBR time scales and thus, the latter time scales should be taken into consideration when evaluating the eeectiveness of an adaptive feedback based congestion control mechanism. This study also suggests that higher eeciency can be achieved by enforcing large ABR time scales, leading to the introduction of a new class of transmission policies.	mega man network transmission;modulation;network congestion;system time;volume boot record	Tamer Dag;Ioannis Stavrakakis	1998	Computer Networks and ISBN Systems	10.1016/S0169-7552(97)00119-0	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;variable bitrate;world wide web;computer network	Networks	-1.0967024403204197	101.43028328829244	86804
07143ddb8374ae76d7a8f1aa3d42ba2b8e66bdd5	fuzzy logic-based call admission control in 5g cloud radio access networks with preemption	call admission control (cac);cloud radio access network (c-ran);preemption;fuzzy logic;5g	Fifth generation (5G) cellular networks will be comprised of millions of connected devices like wearable devices, Androids, iPhones, tablets, and the Internet of Things (IoT) with a plethora of applications generating requests to the network. The 5G cellular networks need to cope with such sky-rocketing traffic requests from these devices to avoid network congestion. As such, cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) has been considered as a paradigm shift for 5G in which requests from mobile devices are processed in the cloud with shared baseband processing. Despite call admission control (CAC) being one of radio resource management techniques to avoid the network congestion, it has recently been overlooked by the community. The CAC technique in 5G C-RAN has a direct impact on the quality of service (QoS) for individual connections and overall system efficiency. In this paper, a novel fuzzy logic-based CAC scheme with preemption in C-RAN is proposed. In this scheme, cloud bursting technique is proposed to be used during congestion, where some delay tolerant low-priority connections are preempted and outsourced to a public cloud with a penalty charge. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has low blocking probability below 5%, high throughput, low energy consumption, and up to 95% of return on revenue.	access network;android (robot);baseband;blocking (computing);c-ran;cloud computing;common access card;erlang (unit);fifth generation computer;fuzzy logic;internet of things;mobile device;network congestion;preemption (computing);programming paradigm;quality of service;radio resource management;simulation;tablet computer;throughput;wearable technology	Tshiamo Sigwele;Prashant Pillai;Atm Shafiul Alam;Yim-Fun Hu	2017	EURASIP J.

The measurement of one-way delay essentially requires a guarantee of clock synchronization between end-to-end hosts. However, the hosts in networks have a relative or absolute difference in clock time by reason of clock offsets, clock skews and clock adjustments. In this paper, we propose theory and method of estimating one-way delay and clock offset between end-to-end hosts using our proposed theorem, which is derived from a relationship between one-way delays, one-way delay variations and round-trip times.	bit error rate;clock signal;clock skew;clock synchronization;end-to-end principle;network packet;one-way function;quality of service	Dongkeun Kim;Jaiyong Lee	2007		10.1145/1577222.1577249	clock synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;delay calculation;clock angle problem;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;clock skew;computer science;processing delay;elmore delay;end-to-end delay;timing failure;clock drift;transmission delay;round-trip delay time;network delay	Embedded	-2.752106763438526	99.61253701655372	86973

Based on this analytical model, average channel access delay and delay jitter are derived for both basic access and RTS/CTS-based access scheme. The accuracy of the analytical model is validated by simulations and furthermore we discuss the impact of initial contention window, maximal backoff stage, and packet size on channel access delay and delay jitter of 802.11 DCF using the proposed model.	design rule for camera file system	Yun Li;Chonggang Wang;Keping Long;Weiliang Zhao	2008	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-008-9491-4	telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;accuracy and precision;transmission delay;statistics;computer network	Mobile	1.750891184386672	101.81105137345985	87032

Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks (VDTNs) are a breakthrough based DTN solution used to provide vehicular communications under challenging scenarios, characterized by long delays and sporadic connections. Using the store-carry-and-forward paradigm, this technology allows in-transit bundles to asynchronously reach the destination hop by hop over traveling vehicles equipped with short-range wireless devices. The VDTN architecture assumes out-of-band signaling with control and data planes separation and follows an IP over VDTN approach. This paper presents a real-world VDTN prototype evaluated through a safety application and a Traffic Jam Information Service. It also demonstrates the real deployment of this new vehicular communication approach. The real testbed is an important contribution since some complex issues presented in vehicular communication systems can be studied more accurately in real-world environments than in a laboratory approach. The results confirm that real deployment of VDTNs is doable and can be seen as a very promising technology for vehicular communications, although it requires appropriated technologies for outline interferences and quality of service support.	delay-tolerant networking;jam;out-of-band agreement;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;prototype;quality of service;software deployment;testbed	Maicke C.

TCP New Jersey, known as the best existing scheme in terms of goodput, improves wireless TCP performance using the available bandwidth estimation at the sender and the congestion warning at intermediate routers. Although TCP New Jersey achieves 17% and 85% improvements in goodput over TCP Westwood and TCP Reno, respectively, we further improve TCP New Jersey by exploring improved available bandwidth estimation, retransmission timeout, and recovery mechanisms. Hence, we propose TCP New Jersey PLUS (shortly TCP NJ+), showing that under 5% packet loss rate, a characteristic of high bit-error-rate wireless network, it outperforms other TCP variants by 19% to 104% in terms of goodput even when the network is in bi-directional congestion.	algorithm;bit error rate;fairness measure;goodput;network congestion;network packet;noscript;recovery time objective;retransmission (data networks);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;x.690	Jungrae Kim;Jahwan Koo;Hyunseung Choo	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72606-7_33	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;radio link protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;bit error rate;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;wireless network;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;packet loss;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Networks	-2.5237769010991533	92.09507124110176	87086

This protocol differs from a previously reported SDAM in that it accommodates a branching-bus topology instead of a single-bus network. It is shown that for small bus-delays, SDAM performs very close to that of M/D1- with perfect scheduling. In this paper, the performance evaluation of SDAM is more pragmatic in that the effects of various protocol overheads (e.g., decoding, turnaround time, initializing packets, etc.) are taken into account. An analysis of the tradeoffs between exhaustive and nonexhaustive transmission disciplines is also presented.	profiling (computer programming)	Liang Li;Herman D. Hughes;Lewis H.

Based on passive, flow level TCP network measurements, our previous work has focused on using the principal component method to perform factor analysis on flow class throughput correlation matrices in order to infer which classes of TCP flows are sharing bottlenecks in the network. In this paper, we present a first-order autoregressive model for congestion at a bottleneck to analyze the need for filtering out a subset of the collected flow measurements before analysis. We demonstrate the successful application of our statistical methods in inferring congestion sharing after filtering out small- and large-sized flow samples.	autoregressive model;factor analysis;first-order predicate;flow network;network congestion;principal component analysis;throughput	Dogu Arifler;Brian L.

In order to achieve this, we adopt a reverse engineering approach in which the normalized measure of dispersion is used for determining variation in service times which when applied to the traditional M/G/1 queueing system points toward developing a complete model based on this normalized measure of dispersion and offered load dependency study.

Our analysis can further be extended by deriving nonlinear equations with network parameters for accurately modeling IEEE 802.11 DCF.	database normalization	Faisal Iradat;Sayeed Ghani	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14891-0_18	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Vision	2.358664257796313	98.25629686461781	87217
30883c96455fdb27b3d34a1f6037de2e5592aaf8	improving call admission policies in wireless networks	wireless network;optimal policy;linear program;analytical model	It is well known that the call admission policy can have a big impact on the performance of a wireless network. However, the nonlinear dependence of new calls and handoff calls makes the search for a better call admission policy – in terms of effective utilization – a difficult task. Many studies on optimal policies have not taken the correct dependence into consideration. As a result, the reported gains in those studies cannot be confirmed in a real network. In this paper we develop a solution to the problem of finding better call admission policies. The technique consists of three components. First, we search for the policy in an approximate reduced-complexity model. Second, we modify the Linear Programming technique for the inherently nonlinear policy-search problem. Third, we verify the performance of the found policy in the exact, high-complexity, analytical model. The results shown in the paper clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

The main problem in the IQ switches concerns scheduling. The main focus of the research has been the fixed length packet-known as cells-case. The scheduling decision becomes relatively easier for cells compared to the variable length packet case as scheduling needs to be done at a regular interval of fixed cell time. In real traffic dividing the variable packets into cells at the input side of the switch and then re-assembling these cells into packets on the output side achieve it. The disadvantages of this cell-based approach are the following: (a) bandwidth is lost as division of a packet may generate incomplete cells, and (b) additional overhead of segmentation and reassembling cells into packets. This motivates the packet scheduling: scheduling is done in units of arriving packet sizes and in non-preemptive fashion. In [7] the problem of packet scheduling was first considered. They show that under any admissible Bernoulli i.i.d. arrival traffic a simple modification of Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) algorithm is stable, similar to cell-based MWM [14]. In this paper, we study the stability properties of packet based scheduling algorithm for general admissible arrival traffic pattern. We first show that the result of [7] extends to general re-generative traffic model instead of just admissible traffic, that is, packet based MWM is stable. Next we show that there exists an admissible traffic pattern under which any work-conserving (that is maximal type) scheduling algorithm will be unstable. This suggests that the packet based MWM will be unstable too. To overcome this difficulty we propose a new class of “waiting” algorithms. We show that “waiting”-MWM algorithm is stable for any admissible traffic using fluid limit technique [6].	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);bernoulli polynomials;cell (microprocessor);cell relay;control theory;emoticon;euler–bernoulli beam theory;matching (graph theory);maximal set;motif window manager;network packet;network switch;overhead (computing);packet switching;scheduling (computing);throughput	Yashar Ganjali;Abtin Keshavarzian;Devavrat Shah	2003		10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1209188	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;fast packet switching;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;packet segmentation;processing delay;operating system;fair queuing;distributed computing;transmission delay;packet switch;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;burst switching;computer network	Metrics	0.3905609958791341	94.12590283369704	87653
6dfdf39b1a7808044f89f61be346d87738eea859	exploring usable path mtu in the internet		To optimise their transmission, Internet endpoints need to know the largest size of packet they can send across a specific Internet path, the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU). This paper explores the PMTU size experienced across the Internet core, wired and mobile edge networks. Our results show that MSS Clamping has been widely deployed in edge networks, and some webservers artificially reduce their advertised MSS, both of which we expect help avoid PMTUD failure for TCP. The maximum packet size used by a TCP connection is also constrained by the acMSS. MSS Clamping was observed in over 20% of edge networks tested. We find a significant proportion of webservers that advertise a low MSS can still be reached with a 1500 byte packet. We also find more than half of IPv6 webservers do not attempt PMTUD and clamp the MSS to 1280 bytes. Furthermore, we see evidence of black-hole detection mechanisms implemented by over a quarter of IPv6 webservers and almost 15% of IPv4 webservers. We also consider the implications for UDP - which necessarily can not utilise MSS Clamping. The paper provides useful input to the design of a robust PMTUD method that can be appropriate for the growing volume of UDP-based applications, by determining ICMP quotations can be used as to verify sender authenticity.	byte;clamping (graphics);datagram;failure cause;internet;merkle signature scheme;need to know;network packet;serial experiments lain	Ana Custura;Gorry Fairhurst;Iain Learmonth	2018	2018 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)	10.23919/TMA.2018.8506538	path mtu discovery;maximum transmission unit;real-time computing;computer network;the internet;ipv4;internet control message protocol;ipv6;computer science;network packet;server	Metrics	-3.9060824911122443	92.84294947455838	87657

When such events occur, the GPRS support node needs to re-authorize the granted credit units with the online charging system (OCS). This paper proposes a threshold-based scheme that utilizes a threshold parameter delta to reduce the signaling traffic for the credit re-authorization procedure. By selecting an appropriate delta value, the signaling overhead in the OCS can be significantly reduced while the inaccuracy of the credit information insignificantly increases. The mobile operator can choose appropriate parameter values in the threshold-based scheme based on our study.	authorization;glossary of computer graphics;network packet;original chip set;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;quality of service;scheme	Sok-Ian Sou;Yi-Bing Lin;Jeu-Yih Jeng	2008	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2008.070403	quality of service;online charging system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.3778609597894547	101.93241563157028	87679

Experimental results have shown that many well-designed protocols will fail simply because of fading and shadowing experienced in a realistic wireless environment. While fading and shadowing for radio propagation are well understood in the wireless communication community, they are rarely studied in network level research for wireless sensor networks. This paper studies the fading and shadowing effects on the performance of different systems for wireless sensor networks. We show that fading and shadowing can have a significant influence on network performance. We study and compare network performance for three different systems: (1) a multichannel CDMA system; (2) a pure CDMA system; (3) a contention-based system. Through discrete event simulation (using ns-2), we show that the multichannel CDMA system outperforms the pure CDMA system as well as the contention-based system under fading and shadowing environments.	hoc (programming language);network performance;simulation;software propagation	Bao Hua Liu;Brian P.

89f477262e13aafdf0f8a6c824e5b2e2c3ab3236	multipath tcp path scheduling optimization based on q-learning in vehicular heterogeneous networks		Nowadays, as a variety of network interfaces are deployed in vehicles for a heterogeneous vehicular network, the diversity of interfaces leads to a noticeable difference in characteristics between transmission paths. When the vehicular heterogeneous network uses multipath TCP for transmission, the difference between the paths will cause the receiving buffer to be blocked, resulting in poor multipath TCP transmission performance. Aiming at the multipath TCP receive buffer blocking problem, this paper proposes an QL-MPS (Q-Learning Multipath Scheduling) optimization algorithm based on Q-Learning. By using Q-Learning, the multipath TCP node in the vehicular heterogeneous network can continuously learn interactively with the surrounding environment, and dynamically adjust the number of paths used for transmission according to the learning result, so that the node can always combine the data packets with the best path set to transmit. After that, we predict the buffer blocking problem by judging the number of out-of-ordered packets, and use this algorithm to stop the data transmission on the bad paths to improve the performance of multipath TCP. The simulation results show that the algorithm can improve the overall throughput of the system and improve the network utilization.

With the fast proliferation of mobile Internet, the wireless community has been looking for a framework that can address the issue of impediment on uplink. Due to asymmetric behavior of Internet applications downlink sub-frame is expected to have longer duration as compared to uplink. According to IEEE 806.16 standard for WiMAX the segmentation of TDD frame between uplink and downlink can be dynamically redefined even at runtime. Research contributions so far lack in addressing an optimal strategy for readjustment of uplink and downlink sub-frame boundaries; based on traffic statistics. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism that allows uplink sub-frame to grow, borrowing resources from the downlink sub-frame, if the uplink utilization is high and the downlink is being underutilized. We present here, a framework to dynamically demarcate the TDD frame-duration between uplink and downlink. Proposed algorithm takes into account the present utilization of downlink and reallocates a certain quantum of free resources to uplink. This occurs when uplink observes shortage of bandwidth to transmit. We simulate some test scenarios using OPNET Modeler with and without dynamic reallocation capability. The results of our simulation confirm the effectiveness of proposed algorithm which observes a remarkable decrease in end-to-end packet delay. Also, we observe an improvement in throughput at uplink such that, the performance of downlink remains unaffected.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);definition;end-to-end principle;network congestion;network packet;optimizing compiler;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput;web traffic	Abdul Qadir Ansari;Abdul Qadeer Khan Rajput;Adnan Ashraf Arain;Manzoor Hashmani	2009	IJCNS	10.4236/ijcns.2009.29103	wimax;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	2.477803707279815	94.46178538452172	87913

This problem is motivated by the delivery of video streams to all nodes in Peer-to-Peer networks in which a stream of chunks corresponding to a subscribed video stream is continuously served by an external media server. We model the heterogeneity of nodes by the variance of the upload capacity of nodes. The idea of the proposed scheme is to effectively utilize the residual upload capacity of high-capacity nodes. Experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed scheme nearly attains a theoretical lower bound on the MBT.

15144afd95b6dc5f238995e1ab436ce25b4bdfec	proof test of chaos-based hierarchical network control using packet-level network simulation		Computer networks require sophisticated control mechanisms to realize fair resource allocation among users in conjunction with efficient resource usage. To successfully realize fair resource allocation in a network, someone should control the behavior of each user by considering fairness. To provide efficient resource utilization, someone should control the behavior of all users by considering efficiency. To realize both control goals with different granularities at the same time, a hierarchical network control mechanism that combines microscopic control (i.e., fairness control) and macroscopic control (i.e., efficiency control) is required. In previous works, Aida proposed the concept of chaos-based hierarchical network control. Next, as an application of the chaos-based concept, Aida designed a fundamental framework of hierarchical transmission rate control based on the chaos of coupled relaxation oscillators. To clarify the realization of the chaos-based concept, one should specify the chaos-based hierarchical transmission rate control in enough detail to work in an actual network, and confirm that it works as intended. In this study, we implement the chaos-based hierarchical transmission rate control in a popular network simulator, ns-2, and confirm its operation through our experimentation. Results verify that the chaos-based concept can be successfully realized in TCP/IP networks. key words: chaos, hierarchical network architecture, congestion control, TCP global synchronization, TCP (transmission control protocol), RED (random early detection)	control system;fairness measure;ip (complexity);internet protocol suite;linear programming relaxation;network architecture;network congestion;network topology;random early detection;simulation;tcp global synchronization;tree network	Yusuke Sakumoto;Chisa Takano;Masaki Aida;Masayuki Murata	2016	IEICE Transactions		tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;random early detection;tcp global synchronization;hierarchical routing;tcp pacing;computer science;bic tcp;transmission control protocol;explicit congestion notification;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;scalable tcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-3.6812321963989545	95.67447948954091	88307

Mobile data traffic and utility energy consumption have a lot in common. There is a limited supply due to limited resources, and only growth (of quantities, technology) can increase this, at the cost of a higher carbon footprint. The green index is defined here for cellular wireless. On the other hand there is a demand which is user-generated, variable over time and space, and ever increasing at a fast pace. Flat rates or almost flat utility tariffs have spoiled users and established high user expectations. Instead of engineering for the growth of supply, this paper investigates how to engineer for controlling the demand side. Dealing with congestion is a consequence of the supply=demand regime and the end of overprovisioning. New tariffs are required that are tailored to the major QoS classes and help to shape demand at the user and application level. This paper investigates QoS-aware demand shaping and control by user-in-the-loop and tariff-based control.	emoticon;network congestion;noise shaping;quality of service;user-generated content	Rainer Schoenen;Gurhan Bulu;Amir Mirtaheri;Halim Yanikomeroglu	2011	2011 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications	10.1109/GreenCom.2011.6082509	demand patterns;operations management;demand management;microeconomics;business;derived demand;commerce	Mobile	24.243971304393114	94.07472836789556	88383

GARMA has been used for modeling and forecasting of the financial time series that exhibits a long-range dependency (LRD). Since the high-speed network traffic exhibits a high degree of LRD characteristic, GARMA could be used for its modeling and prediction. In this paper, we present a simplified parameter estimation procedure and an adaptive prediction scheme for the k-factor GARMA model. The adaptation gives the model the ability to capture, the non-stationary characteristic of the data. The k-factor GARMA is applied to model four different types of real traffic data: MPEG and JPEG video, Ethernet and Internet. These models are then used to predict one-step-ahead traffic value at different timescales. The results show that the estimated parameters of the k-factor GARMA model provide a detailed and accurate presentation for the traffic characteristics in both time and frequency domain. We also demonstrate that the prediction performance of the k-factor GARMA model outperforms that of the traditional autoregressive (AR) model.	autoregressive model;estimation theory;graph factorization;internet;jpeg;k-factor (cisco);moving picture experts group;network packet;network traffic control;stationary process;time series	Nayera Sadek;Alireza Khotanzad	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

The various spectrum access schemes proposed in the previous work assume that each node can access and transmit their data using a single spectrum band at any given time, with the access to the different spectrum bands being dynamic and relative to the wireless medium conditions. However, this approach may not be enough to address the networks with a large number of nodes that are exchanging high volumes of data. In this paper, we propose a transmission scheduling policy for allowing the sensor nodes to transmit its data across a multiple number of spectrum bands, and simultaneously.

However, under heavy traffic loads, network saturation is easily achieved and consequently QoS performance are inevitably degraded. In this paper an admission control algorithm for resource sharing in a wireless LAN environment is proposed, with the aim at enhancing QoS support for real-time applications (e.g., VoIP and video) that are particularly sensitive to delay and jitter. The algorithm avoids saturation and protects the admitted traffics from being degraded, through a continuous monitoring of the available resources. A further optimization of the algorithm is finally implemented through the adoption of dynamic bursty transmissions times (i.e., TXOP). Performance evaluation is carried out through computer simulations, showing the benefits gained by the 802.11e EDCA scheme in terms of goodput and delay.	algorithm;computer simulation;elegant degradation;goodput;mathematical optimization;performance evaluation;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock	Alessandro Andreadis;Giuliano Benelli;Riccardo Zambon	2008	2008 3rd International Symposium on Wireless Pervasive Computing	10.1109/ISWPC.2008.4556218	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	-1.7426831088745078	95.53735876265542	88704

b747390c188be3beb55309fdd96287c53a240fc4	a novel event-driven qos-aware connection setup management scheme for optical networks		This paper proposes a QoS-Aware Optical Connection Setup Management scheme that uses the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) queueing discipline to schedule the setup of the optical connections. The benefits of this EDF-based scheme are twofold: a) it reduces the blocking probability since blocked connection requests due to resource unavailability are queued for possible future setup opportunities and b) it realizes QoS differentiation by ranking the blocked requests in the EDF queue according to their connection setup time requirements, which are viewed as deadlines during connection provisioning. As such, pending lesser delay-tolerant requests are guaranteed to experience better QoS than the ones having longer setup time requirements. Extensive simulations are performed to gauge the merits of the proposed EDF-based scheme and study its performance in the context of two network scenarios, namely, the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) and the European Optical Network (EON).	access network;active queue management;benchmark (computing);blocking (computing);earliest deadline first scheduling;emoticon;erlang (unit);event-driven programming;flip-flop (electronics);incidence matrix;mike lesser;national science foundation network;network scheduler;provisioning;quality of service;rejection sampling;requirement;simulation;unavailability	Wissam Fawaz;Abdelghani Sinno;Raghed Bardan;Maurice Jose Khabbaz	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22027-2_13	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	HPC	0.27707965362247633	95.36903375647836	88760

The wireless channel is modeled as a two-state Markovian process. Arriving packets, which are saved in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer before being transmitted over a wireless channel, may be blocked due to buffer overflow. We obtain the closed-form expressions of queueing state probabilities and queueing delay. For large buffer capacity, we derive a new coefficient of the exponential approximation for buffer overflow probability which fits the simulation results much better than before.	approximation;buffer overflow;coefficient;fifo (computing and electronics);fits;hybrid automatic repeat request;queuing delay;simulation;time complexity	Liang Huang;Tony T.

TCP may experience RTO even in absence of congestion particularly due to loss of retransmission. In this paper, a simple technique is proposed to identify those timeouts, which are not due to congestion and should be avoided. These avoidable timeouts are typically caused by loss of retransmission due to random channel errors. This type of retransmission timeouts is common in wireless environments in general and satellite links in particular. A TCP sender refrains from transmitting packets for a considerable time i.e., the timeout period. This paper proposes a modification in the original SACK TCP to identify the avoidable timeouts and also to utilize available RTTs before such timeouts. Improved TCP performance of the proposed algorithm to combat channel noise during retransmissions is substantiated with the help of simulations using open source software (ns-2).

This framework aims at providing a diier-entiated treatment to multimedia traac ows at the link layer, which can be broadly classiied as real-time (or delay-sensitive) and non-real-time (or delay-tolerant). Various novel schemes are proposed to support the diierential treatment and guarantee QoS. These schemes include bandwidth compaction, channel reservation and degradation, with the help of which a call admission and control algorithm is developed. The performance of the proposed framework is captured through analytical modeling and simulation experiments. Analytically, the average carried traac and the worst case buuer requirements for real-time and non-real-time calls are estimated. Simulation results show upto 21% improvement in the admission probability of real-time calls and upto 17% improvement in the admission probability of non-real-time calls, when various call control techniques like bandwidth compaction are employed. Using our channel reservation technique, we observe a 12% improvement in the call admission probability compared to another scheme proposed in the literature.	access network;algorithm;best, worst and average case;data compaction;elegant degradation;experiment;next-generation network;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;requirement;simulation	Sajal K.

The design increases the capacity of SIP servers in a network by using all of the SIP servers equally. It takes advantage of the fact that equipment for voice data packets is different from equipment for signaling packets in SIP networks. Furthermore, the design achieves simple routing on the basis of telephone numbers. We evaluated the performance of our design in preventing congestion through simulation. We showed that the proposed design has roughly 20 times more capacity, which is 57 times the normal load, than the conventional design if a disaster were to occur in Niigata Prefecture struck by the Chuetsu earthquake in 2004. key words: load balancing, congestion, disaster, VoIP, SIP, network design	load balancing (computing);network congestion;network packet;network planning and design;routing;server (computing);simulation;telephone number	Daisuke Satoh;Kyoko Ashitagawa	2010	IEICE Transactions		telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;session initiation protocol;computer security;computer network	Networks	-2.4939225577571027	89.36105438314237	89039

In order to achieve a differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee for individual service plus maximal system resource utilization, the MAF-PRMA independently controls the random access parameters, frame-by-frame basis. In addition, we have adopted a mobile-assisted random access mechanism where the voice terminal readjusts a global permission probability from the central controller, to handle the 'fair access' issue resulting from distributed queuing problems inherent in the access network. Our extensive simulation results indicate that the MAF-PRMA achieves significant improvements in terms of voice capacity, delay, and fairness over most of the existing MAC schemes for the integrated services.	access network	Seung Eun Hong;Chung Gu Kang;Eung B.

0c53fb25ee3107f0ff36386bea8b1838f499999d	improving ecn marking scheme with micro-burst traffic in data center networks		In data centers, micro-burst is a common traffic pattern. The packet dropping caused by it usually leads to serious performance degradations. Therefore, much attention has been paid to avoiding buffer overflow caused by micro-burst traffic. In particular, ECN is widely used in data centers to keep persistent queue occupancy low, so that enough buffer space can be available as headroom to absorb micro-burst traffic. However, we find that instantaneous-queue-length-based ECN may cause problems in another direction — buffer underflow. Specifically, current ECN marking scheme in data centers is easy to trigger spurious congestion signals, which may result in overreaction of senders and queue length oscillations in switches. Since ECN threshold is low, the buffer may underflow and link capacity is not fully used. In this paper, we reveal this problem by experiments and simulations. Besides, we theoretically deduce the amplitude of queue length oscillations. The analysis result shows that overreaction of senders is caused by ECN mis-marking. Therefore, we propose Combined Enqueue and Dequeue Marking (CEDM), which can mark packets more accurately. Through simulations, we show that CEDM can greatly reduce throughput loss and improve flow completion time.	arithmetic underflow;buffer overflow;data center;experiment;explicit congestion notification;headroom (audio signal processing);item unique identification;network congestion;network packet;network switch;simulation;throughput	Danfeng Shan;Fengyuan Ren	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057181	throughput;arithmetic underflow;computer network;buffer overflow;double-ended queue;computer science;buffer underrun;headroom (audio signal processing);real-time computing;network packet;queue	Networks	-3.0111309117574128	93.64522573227636	89100
b6cb5df07c118a909341c26710ad0572711c8efc	on-demand power boost and cell muting for high reliability and low latency in 5g		5G downlink Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) has a twofold objective: to better exploit the benefits of ICIC in coherence with the rest of Radio Resource Management (RRM) principles in 5G; and to support new 5G service classes and their coexistence in a multi-service setting. We propose on-demand Power Boosting and Inter-cell Coordination (PB-IC) to meet high reliability and low latency requirements of critical data without compromising the spectral efficiency of the rest of traffic. PB-IC is demostrated to provide similar latency gains as the classical frequency reuse, but much lower impact to the enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) traffic. Results demonstrate that the tail of the latency distribution is reduced as much as 100% in the 10^-4 percentile, achieving comparable gains to static frequency reuse. At the same time, the degradation in eMBB throughput is minimized, reaching a 14% loss instead of the 50% observed with static ICIC. We discuss the standardization effort required for having PB-IC supported, with considerations of the measurement requirements to the UE and the infrastructure backhaul latencies.	backhaul (telecommunications);coexist (image);elegant degradation;hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);interrupt latency;phy (chip);performance evaluation;radio resource management;requirement;scheduling (computing);spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput	Beatriz Soret;Klaus I.

This captures the service provider’s fixed costs and per-transaction revenue, the user’s delay consciousness and ALOHA’s probabilistic nature. Specifically, we consider CDMA channels and successive-decoding receivers. Interestingly, judicious use of power diversity is shown to be extremely effective: with a single transmission, capacity is doubled relative to that with power equalization. With the deadline permitting as few as one or two retransmission attempts upon failure, the probability of not meeting it can be virtually diminished (10 and 10, respectively) while approaching the throughput attainable without delay constraints. This also holds for limited mean transmission power. Thus, the effect of power diversity in conjunction with CDMA depends strongly on the type of receiver and on the exact performance measure, and the proposed approach is worth considering for next-generation systems.	consciousness;online transaction processing;retransmission (data networks);throughput	Yitzhak Birk;Uri Tal	2009	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-008-0107-4	service provider;real-time computing;transaction processing;telecommunications;computer science;communications satellite;fixed cost	Mobile	12.627109255747035	94.83720342790889	89403

We demonstrate the performance improvement of the rearranging scheme in terms of accumulated throughput and fairness in the finite buffer case compared with the fixed rule by simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme in the case of finite buffer depth not only can provide much better fairness and achieve higher accumulated throughput but also is less buffer-consuming than that without rearranging, meaning that the hardware cost can be reduced by employing the proposed scheme.	access network;algorithm;fairness measure;list of sequence alignment software;multitier architecture;network congestion;reed–solomon error correction;simulation;telecommunications link;test-driven development;throughput	Chia-Chuan Liang;Jung-Shyr Wu	2012	IJIPT	10.1504/IJIPT.2012.050210	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	DB	5.233388216719816	93.82478461203682	89516

The first, denoted as simple approach, is a simple method of Admission Control performed by a weighted-fair-queuing scheduler. This approach guarantees QoS with a suitable overprovisioning of transmission resources. The second approach, denoted as basic statistical approach, is a full-featured statistical framework, based on the central limit approximation, for estimating the delay bound violation probability associated to each traffic class, given the offered traffic and the schedulers' configuration. Both approaches adopt the dual-leaky-bucket (p, r, b) regulated traffic model in order to characterize the aggregate traffic flows. At first, we analyze the characteristics of both approaches in order to point out the respective pros and cons. Then, we propose an enhanced version of the basic statistical approach, the enhanced statistical approach. Our novel approach, as opposed to the basic statistical approach, performs a joint optimization of the regulator's parameters and of the network capacity instead of a separate optimization. Our study shows that the enhanced statistical approach outperforms both the basic statistical approach and the simple approach and offers the highest potential for a better utilization of transmission resources. The basic and the enhanced statistical approaches assume that traffic is Gaussian. The simple approach has looser constraints on the statistical behavior of traffic, but it requires overprovisioning of transmission resources to guarantee the required QoS in terms of packet delay and loss.	internet backbone;quality of service	Paolo Giacomazzi;Luigi Musumeci;Gabriella Saddemi;Giacomo Verticale	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2006.06.010	the internet;simulation;systems modeling;quality of service;network packet;telecommunications;computer science;access control;traffic flow;gaussian process;scheduling;computer security;queue;service quality;differentiated services;computer network	Metrics	0.60484936210549	101.89435933322731	89776
40a60727dcf2a00efcb6e00a42b4582b7d35b56a	transparent ran sharing of 5g small cells and macrocells		To cope with the growth of mobile data traffic in 5G systems, telecom operators have to set up more small cells and macrocells in the same area. However, because of space limitations, it is difficult for each operator to do so, and RAN sharing would thus become mandatory for 5G systems. In this work, RANP is proposed, which will achieve transparent RAN sharing by setting up RANP between a base station to be shared and multiple core networks. Over and above the general one-level proxy architecture, an extended two-level architecture is proposed that will share both small cells and macrocells. According to our emulation results, additional packet processing time of a RANP is about 2 ms, 3.8 percent of the total end-to-end latency. Its impact on throughput is about 3 percent and can be regarded as irrelevant.	emulator;end-to-end principle;network packet;relevance;throughput	Ying-Dar Lin;Hsu-Tung Chien;Hsien-Wen Chang;Chia-Lin Lai;Kun-Yi Lin	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2017.1600372	latency (engineering);computer network;mobile broadband;ran;operator (computer programming);throughput;computer science;packet processing;architecture;distributed computing;base station	Mobile	21.649123288821276	90.18403836585262	89821
9665bc6f94218ef225f2e24ec3ff54d97819f5d2	the capacity of multi-channel multi-interface wireless networks with multi-packet reception and directional antenna	network capacity;multi packet reception;directional antenna;multi channel multi interface	The capacity of wireless networks can be improved by the use of multi-channel multi-interface (MCMI), multi-packet reception (MPR), and directional antenna (DA). MCMI can provide the concurrent transmission in different channels for each node with multiple interfaces; MPR offers an increased number of concurrent transmissions on the same channel; DA can be more effective than omni-DA by reducing interference and increasing spatial reuse. This paper explores the capacity of wireless networks that integrate MCMI, MPR, and DA technologies. Unlike some previous research, which only employed one or two of the aforementioned technologies to improve the capacity of networks, this research captures the capacity bound of the networks with all the aforementioned technologies in arbitrary and random wireless networks. The research shows that such three-technology networks can achieve at most 2 p k capacity gain in arbitrary networks and 2 2 k capacity gain in random networks compared with MCMI wireless networks without DA and MPR. The paper also explored and analyzed the impact on the network capacity gain with different c m , , and k-MPR ability.

The admission control scheme, based on stochastic control, aims at ensuring user discrimination, by enforcing different call blocking probabilities. The queueing behavior of reservations is analytically characterized in the absence of admission control. From this, call blocking probabilities and analytical estimates of the performance of admission control are derived, allowing proper tuning of the algorithm. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Keywords—Admission Control. Priority policies. Adaptative Schemes.

These methods share the common idea that interference can be canceled when its content is known. Existing work on KIC mainly focuses on single-hop or two-hop networks, with physical-layer network coding and full-duplex communications as typical examples. This paper extends the idea of KIC to general multihop networks and proposes an end-to-end KIC (E2E-KIC) transmission method, together with its medium access control (MAC) design. With E2E-KIC, multiple nodes in a flow passing through a few nodes in an arbitrary topology can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel. We first present a theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of E2E-KIC in an idealized case. Then, to support E2E-KIC in multihop networks with an arbitrary topology, we propose an E2E-KIC-supported MAC protocol (E2E-KIC MAC), which is based on an extension of the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 MAC. We also analytically analyze the performance of the proposed E2E-KIC MAC in the presence of hidden terminals. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed E2E-KIC MAC can improve network throughput and reduce end-to-end delay.	access control;acknowledgement (data networks);carpal tunnel syndrome;dataflow;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;hop;interference (communication);linear network coding;mathematical optimization;optimal control;overhead (computing);performance;quantum superposition;rs-232;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Fanzhao Wang;Lei Guo;Shiqiang Wang;Qingyang Song;Abbas Jamalipour	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2482124	wireless ad hoc network;throughput;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;spread spectrum;wireless;computer network	Mobile	10.166025400588543	91.33019984212935	90114

Two priority mechanisms for voice/data traffic on round-robin networks are studied: the alternating-rounds mechanism of the Expressnet, and the token rotation timer mechanism of the token bus, which restricts access rights based on the time taken for a token to make one round. It is shown that the deterministic schemes almost always perform better than the contention-based scheme. Design issues such as the choice of minimum voice packet length, priority parameters, and voice encoding rate are investigated. An important aspect that is noted is the accurate characterization of performance over a wide region of the design space of voice/data networks. >		Timothy A. Gonsalves;Fouad A.

In other words, a time-critical message from a source should be able to propagate and reach all of the vehicles on the road segment without any delay due to the unavailability of the vehicles to forward the message. Clearly, this requires the road segment to have a certain number of vehicles equipped with communication devices. It is the task of a system designer to determine the minimum number of vehicles (i.e., the minimum penetration) necessary to form a connected network as well as the critical transmission range required to provide such connectivity. In this paper, we present an analytical framework for determining the connectivity requirements in distributing the traffic information in a self-organizing vehicular network. One- and two-way street scenarios are considered. In addition to the conventional perspective on connectivity, where the characteristics of the wireless channel are often neglected, our analysis offers a new view by taking important physical-layer parameters, such as fading, propagation path loss, transmit power, and transmission data rate, into consideration.	data rate units;hoc (programming language);information system;organizing (structure);requirement;self-organization;software propagation;systems design;unavailability;window of opportunity	Sooksan Panichpapiboon;Wasan Pattara-Atikom	2008	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.929067	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.497206265261333	102.24983019445405	90201

Burst assembly algorithms utilized in optical burst switched (obs) edge routers can be used to reduce the degree of self-similarity. This work investigates the impact of time and size-based burst assembly algorithms utilized in obs edge routers, on the self-similarity level of the output traffic. Both static and adaptive algorithms are examined. Our study is based on the opnet simulation tool focusing on the characteristics of the output traffic in the presence of self-similar input traffic. To estimate the Hurst parameter of the aggregated input and output traffic streams, we have applied various Hurst parameter estimators. The performance impact of the burst assembly algorithms in terms of burst assembly delay and its jitter is also assessed. Our study has shown that the burst assembly mechanism at the obs edge router reduces the self-similarity level of the output traffic and that this reduction depends on the parameters of the algorithm. Our results reveal that the proposed adaptive burst assembly algorithm performs better comparing to its non-adaptive counterpart.	algorithm;self-similarity;simulation	Siamak Azodolmolky;Anna Tzanakaki;Ioannis Tomkos	2007	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03253278	computer simulation;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;packet switching;computer network	Theory	-0.21987700606792174	100.9514771544752	90244

In this paper, we discuss the DCC scheme for the common channel communications in the uplink channels of CDMA microcellular system with nonuniform traffic distribution. Then, we propose the DCC scheme with the system control based on the estimated channel load at each base station. The results of computer simulations show that the proposed scheme improves the system performance compared with the system without DCC scheme.	circuit switching;computer simulation;data recovery;elegant degradation;network packet;telecommunications link;throughput	Kazuo Mori;Hideo Kobayashi	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.
