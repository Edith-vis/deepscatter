Even though a lot of proposals have already shown their merits like LQSR, MR-LQSR etc., up to now, few schemes could universally achieve all of these objectives. In this paper, we present MR-OLSR, an optimized link state routing algorithm in multi-radio/multi-channel WMNs. It was improved by OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) protocol in MANET. It can distribute data traffic among diverse multiple paths to avoid congestion, and improve channel throughput substantially. It uses the novel metric named IWCETT (Improved Weighted Culminated Estimate Transfer Time) to evaluate path quality. Besides, the proposed channel allocation strategy and path scheduling algorithm offer it the ability of loading balance. MR-OLSR is experimented in OPNET simulation environment, and the results prove that our proposal not merely maintains the merits of robustness and scalability in OLSR scheme. What's more, the proposal enhances the stability and reliability in the situation of links failing, and keeps the promise of increasing network throughput apparently.	algorithm;failure;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);mesh networking;network congestion;optimized link state routing protocol;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;wireless mesh network	Guangwu Hu;Chaoqin Zhang	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388209	optimized link state routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.7674387462062087	85.42250353694507	18080

Technologies such as 802.11ac that utilize up to 160 MHz of bandwidth are on the market today, and 5G is expected to use up to 2 GHz to support bandwidth intensive applications. The test and measurement of such devices requires modern analysis equipment with stringent specifications. Furthermore, shrinking test equipment budgets necessitate newer, more creative and cost-effective approaches to testing devices. While software-defined radio (SDR) approaches to instrumentation have been on the market for many years, their price points have typically been high.	application programming interface;built-in test equipment;etsi satellite digital radio;embedded system;form factor (design);price point;programming language;requirement;small form factor;software architecture;software deployment	Tarek K.

However, selecting the cluster head is not easy in different environments which may have different characteristics. In order to deal with this problem, we have proposed an algorithm for controlling sensor speed in wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The proposed system is based on fuzzy logic. The proposed system uses 3 input linguistic parameters: Remaining Power of Sensor (RPS), Degree of Number of Neighbor Nodes (D3N) and Sensor Speed (SS) for evaluating cluster-head decision probability. Then, we use this probability as a fuzzy input to control sensor speed. By considering the moving speed of the sensor we are able to predict whether the node will leave or stay in the cluster. We evaluate the proposed system by simulations and show that it has a good behavior.	algorithm;fuzzy logic;sensor;simulation;web server	Qi Wang;Leonard Barolli;Elis Kulla;Arjan Durresi;Aleksander Biberaj;Makoto Takizawa	2012	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/NBiS.2012.33	fuzzy logic;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;soft sensor;computer science;manganese;brooks–iyengar algorithm;probability;feedback;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;pragmatics	Robotics	8.063892680043875	80.56423936696477	18087

In this paper, we propose a robust region based localization approach which is able to naturally address these factors. An iterative and distributed implementation based on clustering is also given to provide scalability and energy efficiency.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;data aggregation;distributed computing;global positioning system;iterative method;scalability;sensor node;software deployment	Zhen Feng;Wei Liu;Kanru Xu;Wenqing Cheng	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.672	wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	15.908670069951027	74.86592639166044	18262

To explore the target area efficiently, a smart sensing mechanism based on Incremental Clustering algorithm is proposed to cooperate with a small sensing network structure named Centralized SensorGroup (CSG). The operation processes and detection phases are provided and verified in the investigation. System performance is evaluated by observing the detection completeness and accuracy in different scenarios within a square experimental area of 100m∗100m. No matter when large or small scenarios are explored, simulation results demonstrate that CSG cooperated with the smart sensing mechanism has quite good detection accuracy and efficiency and can achieve the purpose of exploring target area efficiently and effectively.	algorithm;centralized computing;cluster analysis;constructive solid geometry;global positioning system;national supercomputer centre in sweden;sensor;simulation	Kuen-Liang Sue;Jing-Wei Lin	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Information Networks and Systems (WINSYS)		algorithm design;simulation;mobile telephony;exploration;computer science;operating system;machine learning;data mining;accuracy and precision;cluster analysis;mobile computing	Robotics	13.479102282511612	75.4408219458669	18297

a124b6eadb9319f22ab4b232c367e5cd7b80571b	an improved immune system-inspired routing recovery scheme for energy harvesting wireless sensor networks		To address problems of fault-tolerant routing recovery and routings’ quality maintenance in energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs), we proposed an improved immune system-inspired routing recovery algorithm (ISRRA) to provide an intelligent scheme for EH-WSNs. The ISRRA could maintain k best disjoint path from each source node to the sink. It investigates the optimal alternative strategies for the faulty routing and recovers the problems with four units (the surveillance unit, the response unit, the learn unit and the memory unit) as imitating the immune system, especially for the same fault routing happened again. Moreover, during the routing recovery process, ISRRA also check other candidate routings to decide whether to update the backup routings, which is used to maintain routings’ quality and also greatly improve the fault-tolerant ability of EH-WSNs. In order to overcome the limited diversity of antibody population and prematurity of clone selection algorithm used in the learn unit, an improved clone and mutation scheme inspired by the regulation laws of hormone in endocrine system is proposed in ISRRA. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ISRRA, a series of simulation experiments are conducted and compared with two other routing recovery schemes. The simulation results have verified that the ISRRA-based protocol can provide reliable communication with effective routing recovery scheme and highlight the better performance of the proposed approach than that of similar techniques.	routing	Xiangfei Zhang;Guangshun Yao;Yongsheng Ding;Kuangrong Hao	2017	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-016-2222-y	multipath routing;computer science;wireless routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;dynamic source routing;computer network;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;static routing;zone routing protocol;distributed computing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol	Mobile	7.9166256642797315	77.10208932923163	18381

Moreover, since the dissemination of safety messages directly influences our lives, their reliable delivery is of great importance. Most packet collisions in VANETs occur due to hidden nodes. In unicast communications a two-way handshaking is performed prior to the actual transmission in order to alleviate the hidden node problem. However, this procedure congests the network with a lot of overhead in case of broadcast, which is the dominant mode of communication in VANETs. Hence, in this paper we propose an alternative solution, based on retransmissions, to ensure the reliable delivery of safety messages. We argue that the specific characteristics inherent in VANETs, such as the limited density of vehicles, anticipated bandwidth and the tolerable delay, allow us to deploy a retransmission strategy. Furthermore, We prove that our proposed scheme establishes fair channel access for the consecutive retransmission opportunities of contending neighbors. Simulation results confirm that our heuristic method dramatically improves the probability of reception of safety messages regarding conventional methods.	hoc (programming language)	Mohammad Nekoui;Hossein Pishro-Nik	2008		10.1145/1554126.1554232	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;vehicular communication systems;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.785908863900485	87.84066093374264	18407

Most deployment methods are based on the radio range to determine the density or distance to place the nodes. Unfortunately, the surrounding obstacles such as walls and furniture make the communication pattern unpredictable. It follows that a well-planned IoT deployment plan that guarantees full connectivity on the drawing board may result in disconnected system when deployed on-site. A practical IoT deployment tool must cope with the difference in offline planning and on-site deployment. In this paper, a practical tool is introduced that deploys a network of IoT incrementally for indoor environments. The tool ensures node connectivity in the field despite environmental obstacles. The deployment process is divided into three main phases: offline deployment, online deployment and optimization. Each phase of the tool aims to place as few relay nodes as possible but always ensure full connectivity. The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated through real deployment.	graphical user interface;heuristic;mathematical optimization;online and offline;relay;scheme;sensor web;software deployment;software propagation	Nguyen Vo Quang Dong;Chung-Ta King;Cheng Chih Liu	2013	2013 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/ICPADS.2013.99	deployment diagram;computer science;radio propagation;software deployment;internet of things	Robotics	17.9033000186973	73.24270922532476	18454

When the devices are highly mobile, there will be much traffic to exchange the geographic position information of each mobile node, and this makes adverse effect on efficient battery usage and network congestion. To minimize the network traffic between mobile users, we can use dead reckoning (DR) algorithm for each mobile nodes, where each node uses the algorithm to estimates its own movement (also other node's movement), and when the estimation error is over threshold, the node sends the UPDATE (including position, velocity, etc) packet to other devices. As the estimation accuracy is increased, each node can minimize the number of UPDATE packet transmission. To improve the prediction accuracy of DR algorithm, we propose Kalman filter based DR approach, and we also propose the adaptive Kalman gain control to minimize the number of UPDATE packet to distant device. To experiment our scheme, we implement a popular network game (BZFlag) with our scheme added on each mobile node, and the results show that we can achieve better prediction accuracy and reduction of network traffic by 12 percents.	algorithm;dead reckoning;kalman filter;mobile game	Seong-Whan Kim;Ki-Hong Ko	2006		10.1007/11801603_9	dead reckoning;kalman filter;web service;shared resource;routing;automatic gain control;simulation;information exchange;telecommunications;adverse effect;computer science;wireless network;grid;network congestion;mobile computing;computer security;bandwidth;packet switching;battery;telecommunications network	Mobile	-1.5420847280491485	78.4004925452452	18503

The hardware logs received signal strength indication (RSSI) values of both bands simultaneously at a sample rate of 1.3 kS/s. Results from a measurement campaign of BSNs are shown and distilled to reveal characteristics of BSN channels that can be exploited for reducing the power of wireless communication. A new channel model is introduced to add periodicity to existing 802.15.6 WBAN path loss equations. New parameters, activity factor and location factor, are introduced to estimate the model parameters. Finally, a strategy for exploiting the periodic characteristics of the BSN channel is presented as an example, along with the power savings from using this strategy.	channel (communications);computation;quasiperiodicity;sampling (signal processing)	Nathan E.

The sink travels among discrete locations to gather information from all the sensors. Data can be relayed among sensors and then to the sink location, as long as the sensors and the sink are within a certain threshold distance of each other. However, sending information along a data link consumes energy at both the sender and the receiver nodes. A vital problem that arises is to prescribe sink stop durations and data flow patterns that maximally prolong the life of the network, defined as the amount of time until any node exhausts its energy. We describe linear programming and column generation approaches for this problem, and also for a version in which data can be delayed in its transmission to the sink. Our column generation approach exploits special structures of the linear programming formulations so that all subproblems are shortest path problems with non-negative costs. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm	Behnam Behdani;YoungSang Yun;Jonathan Cole Smith;Ye Xia	2012	Computers & OR	10.1016/j.cor.2011.06.013	column generation;mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	11.632031151676335	79.5790204892295	18531

A significant issue which determines the success of participatory sensing is the incentive for contributors. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal incentive scheme with consumer demand awareness for participatory sensing. The proposed incentive scheme incentivizes the contributors according to the consumer demand considering the spatio-temporal relevance between contributors and consumers. According to the incentive scheme, contributors and consumers determine their participation levels respectively to maximize their utilities, and a resulting market equilibrium has been achieved where the optimal contribution rate and the optimal consumption rate are employed. The performance of the proposed incentive scheme is investigated through extensive simulations, which show an improved coverage and quality of consumption.	participatory sensing	Wen Sun;Chen-Khong Tham	2015		10.1109/ICC.2015.7249338	wireless ad hoc network;database index;air quality index;computer science;sensor;computer security;measurement	Mobile	14.08479581865761	81.57456851824485	18551
64dde82803642ccd06ef8b2f94df897049193fcf	a combined hardware-software approach for acoustic sensor network synchronization	sensor network;clock skew;gossip algorithm	In this paper we present an approach for synchronizing a wireless acoustic sensor network using a two-stage procedure. First the clock frequency and phase differences between pairs of nodes are estimated employing a two-way message exchange protocol. The estimates are further improved in a Kalman filter with a dedicated observation error model. In the second stage network-wide synchronization is achieved by means of a gossiping algorithm which estimates the average clock frequency and phase of the sensor nodes. These averages are viewed as frequency and phase of a virtual master clock, to which the clocks of the sensor nodes have to be adjusted. The amount of adjustment is computed in a specific control loop. While these steps are done in software, the actual sampling rate correction is carried out in hardware by using an adjustable frequency synthesizer. Experimental results obtained from hardware devices and software simulations of large scale networks are presented. & 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the proposed approach, only access points (APs) need to collect the received signal strengthes (RSS) of mobile devices, and use these RSS samples to jointly estimate the devices' locations. To enhance the accuracy of positioning, the relationship between the RSS samples and their geometrical locations is explored, leading to a sparse Bayesian model for the radio power map of the RSS observations of each AP. With more than 20 training anchors, the accuracy of the proposed model-based positioning method can be lower than 3.4 meters in an indoor space with only 4 randomly deployed APs, which outperforms the fingerprinting method by 0.4 meter. Extensive experimental results also verify that the proposed positioning service can offer considerable accuracy with only limited efforts in training, suggesting that the prototype is realistic for randomly deployed dense WiFi networks.	bayesian network;fingerprint (computing);global positioning system;indoor positioning system;mobile device;prototype;rss;randomness;sparse matrix;wireless access point	Chun-Hsien Ko;Sau-Hsuan Wu	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841536	embedded system;telecommunications;radio propagation;hybrid positioning system;computer network	Mobile	19.04922104525979	73.42306322590663	18629

The existence of misbehaving nodes may paralyze the routing operation in MANETs. To overcome this behavior, the trustworthiness of the network nodes should be considered in the route selection process combined with the hop count. The trustworthiness is achieved by measuring the trust value for each node in the network. In this paper, a new protocol based on self monitoring (agent-based) and following the dynamic source routing (DSR) algorithm is presented. This protocol is called agent-based trusted dynamic source routing protocol for MANETs. The objective of this protocol is to manage trust information locally with minimal overhead in terms of extra messages and time delay. This objective is achieved through installing in each participated node in the network a multi-agent system (MAS). MAS consists of two types of agents: monitoring agent and routing agent. A new mathematical and more realistic objective model for measuring the trust value is introduced.

There is a wide range of data gathering applications like target and hazard detection, environmental monitoring, battlefield surveillance, etc. Consequently, efficient data collection solutions are needed to improve the performance of the network. In this article, we take into account the fact that interference can occur at the reception of a message at the receiver sensor. In order to save redundant retransmissions and energy, we assume a known distribution of sources (each node wants to transmit at most one packet) and one common destination. We provide a number of scheduling algorithms jointly minimizing both the completion time and the average packet delivery time. We define our network model using directional antennas and consider Ring, Tree, and Grid Network (and its generality) topologies. All our algorithms run in low-polynomial time.	algorithm	Yoram Revah;Michael Segal	2009	IJDSN	10.1080/15501320902876071	optimization problem;embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;scheduling;computer network;data collection	Mobile	10.401256097981637	79.90600534369824	18753

This phenomenon is known as route coupling and it restricts the possibility of occurrence of simultaneous communications along the coupled routes. In this context, the use of directional antenna, having smaller transmission beam-width compared to omnidirectional antenna, helps to easily decouple interfering routes, and improves network performance through Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). However, even if we have an efficient directional MAC protocol, it alone would not be able to guarantee good system performance, unless we have a proper routing strategy in place that exploits the advantages of directional antenna. So, in this paper, an adaptive routing strategy is proposed that exploits the advantages of directional antenna in ad hoc networks through the selection of maximally zone-disjoint shortest routes. Zone-disjoint routes would minimize the effect of route coupling and improve the overall network performance. The proposed strategy ensures effective load balancing and is applied to design and implement both single path and multipath routing protocols in ad hoc networks with directional antennas. Simulation results obtained on QualNet network simulator shows the effectiveness of the proposed routing protocols.	answer to reset;email;fax;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multipath routing;network performance;shortest path problem;simulation;standard database management analysis;uniform resource identifier	Tetsuro Ueda;Shinsuke Tanaka;Bokuji Komiyama;Siuli Roy;Dola Saha;Somprakash Bandyopadhyay	2006	Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing	10.1002/wcm.379	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer performance;administrative distance;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-1.7380381994799887	76.92862708686695	18773
acecda6d1b58975858de2f4dedca1b90c0244dec	a cluster-based mac protocol for cognitive radio ad hoc networks	mac protocol;cognitive radio;clustering;ad hoc networks	The cognitive radio (CR) technology is an efficient approach to share the spectrum. But how to access the idle channels effectively is a challenging problem. To solve this problem, we propose a MAC protocol for cluster-based CR ad hoc networks, with the aim of making cluster structure more robust to the primary users’ channel re-occupancy activities, so that the CR users can use the idle spectrum more efficiently. Under this framework, a cluster formation algorithm based on available channels, geographical position and experienced statistics is proposed to maximize the network throughput and maintain the cluster topology stability. The schemes for new CR user joining a cluster and cluster maintenance are also designed. An experience database is proposed to store the experienced statistics which are obtained from spectrum occupancy history. Such a database can be used to support the acts of nodes, such as neighbor discovery and cluster forming. Simulation results reveal that our proposed framework not only outperforms conventional CR MAC protocols in terms of throughput and packet delay, but also generates a smaller number of clusters and has more stable cluster structure with less reclustering time.	algorithm;channel (communications);cluster analysis;cognitive radio;computer cluster;hoc (programming language);network packet;network topology;simulation;throughput	Xiaoyan Li;Fei Hu;Hailin Zhang;Xiaolong Zhang	2013	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-012-0620-8	wireless ad hoc network;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;cluster analysis;computer network	Mobile	7.439119915411942	81.15126651074443	18789

However, most support systems for existing CVEs are confined to a desktop setting, thus preventing collaboration while users are mobile. In this work, we propose and evaluate a Gnutella peer-to-peer network over mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) to support Mobile Collaborative Virtual Environment (MCVE) applications. Both architectures share some common features such as decentralization, self-reorganization, and self-healing. However, peer-to-peer networks and MANETs operate on different network layers, and thus, cause poor performance. To address this problem, we explore a novel cross-layer approach to improve the overall performance of CVEs over MANETs. The network layer should be aware of the user's physical position in the virtual environment (VE) in order to minimize network traffic and cope with a moderate workload between nodes. In this paper, we present a cross-layer approach model for collaborative virtual environment over MANET. We describe its implementation and evaluate its performance using NS2 simulator.	collaborative virtual environment;desktop computer;gnutella;hoc (programming language);mobile device;network performance;network traffic control;peer-to-peer;requirement;simulation;virtual reality	Azzedine Boukerche;Anis Zarrad;Regina Borges de Araujo	2010	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2009.91	vehicular ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;virtual reality;mobile computing;world wide web;computer network	Visualization	1.2437881220295621	86.25974350356223	18913

Geocast, delivering messages to a few specific areas, has become an important issue with the accelerating development of the location-based services in vehicular networks. Different from the conventional geocast schemes focusing on the static target areas, in this paper, we propose a content-based mobile tendency geocast (CMTG) routing protocol for urban vehicular networks from the delay tolerant networks (DTNs) perspective to better deal with the high mobility and transient connectivity issues. The target roads of dissemination depend on the preferred tendency and path of message, based on the determination to the message's expected propagating roads. And vehicle decides whether to relay the messages carried to other encountered vehicles by calculating the mobile tendency to the source location of message. The robustness and adaptability of protocol are also proved theoretically. Extensive performance comparisons with other protocols are conducted to show the advantages of CMTG.	geocast;routing	Haiquan Wang;Tao Zhu;Shuo Lei;Wenjing Yang;Yu Wang	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/163157	telecommunications;geocast;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.325193455225193	85.74767240281328	18927

Base on analysis of energy consumption for LEACH in underwater channel, we propose a novel clustering scheme for UASN based on grouping nodes to ensure that nodes balance energy load by considering residual energy of candidate nodes. We introduce a formation of small clusters (groups) within clusters named as Nested Clustering (NC). Our Energy Efficient Nested Clustering (EENC) scheme divides each cluster into small groups and nodes in each of those small groups switch their operation modes (idle and awake) to achieve energy efficiency. Through simulation results, it is observed that our proposed EENC scheme has better network lifetime and optimized data duplication as compared to the existing clustering schemes.	cluster analysis;computer cluster;simulation	Syed Hassan Ahmed;Abdul Wahid;Dongkyun Kim	2014		10.1145/2554850.2555068	real-time computing;telecommunications;efficient energy use	Mobile	8.554375695670078	80.66434589000487	18979

As a result they are increasingly present everywhere (industry, farm use, buildings, etc.). However, there are still many important areas in which the WSANs can be improved. One of the most important aspects is to give the sensor networks the capability of being wirelessly reprogrammed so that developers do not have to physically interact with the sensor nodes. Many proposals that deal with this issue have been proposed, but most of them are hardly dependent on the operating system and demand a high energy consumption, even if only a small change has been made in the code. In this work, we propose a new way of wirelessly reprogramming based on the concept of neural networks. Unlike most of the existing approaches, our proposal is independent of the operating system and allows small pieces of code to be reprogrammed with a low energy consumption. The architecture developed to achieve that is described and case studies are presented that show the use of our proposal by means of practical examples.	artificial neural network;sensor web	Eduardo Cañete;Jaime Chen;Rafael Marcos Luque Baena;Bartolomé Rubio	2012	J.

4b0edb366eca4773969a9e6538ecc09665148f2c	disjointed multipath routing for real-time data in wireless multimedia sensor networks		Wireless multimedia sensor networks with sensing and processing abilities of multimedia data have recently emerged as one of the most important technologies for high quality monitoring. The routing scheme for multimedia data is an important research issue addressed in wireless multimedia sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a disjointed multipath routing scheme for real-time data transmission in wirelessmultimedia sensor networks.The proposed scheme uses a hybrid routing protocol based on Bluetooth and Zigbee in order to overcome the limitation of low bandwidth in conventional sensor networks. The proposed scheme also performs disjointed multipath routing based on competition to alleviate the delay of routing path setup. To show the superiority of our proposed scheme, we compare it with the existing scheme through performance evaluation. Our experimental results show that our proposed scheme reduces the end-to-end delay by about 30% and the routing path setup costs by about 22% over the existing scheme. Our scheme also increases data reception rates by about 690% over the existing scheme on average.	algorithm;bluetooth;display resolution;download;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);multipath propagation;multipath routing;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time data;real-time transcription;sorting	Kyoungjun Park;Mirim Jo;Dongook Seong;Jaesoo Yoo	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/783697	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	8.170122669885776	84.54536940243756	19062

With content redundancy and storage imbalance in this in-network distributed storage system, how to maximize its storage capacity is a challenge. In other words, how to maximize the average lifetime of sensory data (i.e. images generated by cameras) in network is a fundamental problem need to be solved. This paper presents, VStore, a cooperative storage solution for mobile surveillance in vehicular sensor networks (VSN). The mechanisms in VStore are designed for redundancy elimination by exchanging information between vehicles and storage balancing. Compared with previous work, we deal with new challenges in mobile scenario. Field testing was carried out on a real-trace driven simulator, which utilizes about 500 taxies in Shanghai city. The testing results show that VStore can largely prolong the average lifetime of sensory data by cooperative storage.

The convergence time is considered while the sensors exchange their measurements. After all the sensors achieve the number of CS measurements needed, a CS recovery algorithm is applied at each mobile sensor to reconstruct sensory readings from all the positions in the sensing area that need to be observed.

One approach to cope with this problem is to have a mobile sink node (MS) patrol the network field and collect the data from all the fragments across the network. In this paper, we use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to determine the mobility trajectory of the MS within each fragment such that the energy consumption at the sensor nodes within the fragment is minimized. Moreover, we study the problem of finding the shortest route (cycle) that the MS should take in its journey between fragments in order to reduce a fragment's inter-visit time. For this purpose, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to find the optimal route. As finding the optimal route is NP-hard, we also propose a heuristic approach to find a near optimal solution.	dynamic programming;fragmentation (computing);heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;shortest path problem	Sharhabeel H.

It is a promising approach to raise the formation strength of drones during flight control. The BS can transform the direction of the antennas and transmit energy to the lead drone that could widely enlarge the number of the receivers and increase the transmission speed of the data links.Themillimeter-Wave (mmWave) communication system offers new opportunities to meet this requirement owing to the tremendous amount of available spectrums. However, the massive non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission and the site constraints in urban environment are severely challenging the conventional deploying terrestrial low power nodes (LPNs).

These sensor nodes are sometimes random deployed, so they have to be aware to their location before starting their tasks. Most sensor nodes need hardware support or receive packets with location information to estimate their location, and this needs lots of time or costs, and may have a huge error. In this paper we present a localization mechanism in wireless sensor networks (MRN). This mechanism can cooperate with node localization algorithm and mobile reference node moving direction scheme. We use a mobile reference node with GPS to move to the whole environment, and we use RSSI and trilateration to estimate unknown nodes’ location. We can obtain more unknown nodes location by mobile reference node moving scheme, and will decreases the energy consumption and average location error.

Abstract. Nowadays, routing proposals must deal with a panoply of heterogeneous devices, intermittent connectivity, and the users’ constant need for communication, even in rather challenging networking scenarios. Thus, we propose a Social-aware Content-based Opportunistic Routing Protocol, SCORP, that considers the users’ social interaction and their interests to improve data delivery in urban, dense scenarios. Through simulations, using synthetic mobility and human traces scenarios, we compare the performance of our solution against other two social-aware solutions, dLife and Bubble Rap, and the social-oblivious Spray and Wait, in order to show that the combination of social awareness and content knowledge can be beneficial when disseminating data in challenging networks.	delay-tolerant networking;dot-com bubble;experiment;institute for computer sciences, social informatics and telecommunications engineering;interaction;interference (communication);internet;routing;simulation;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);usb on-the-go;wireless access point	Waldir Aranha Moreira Junior;Paulo Mendes;Susana Sargento	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-04105-6_7	simulation;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	0.29222175501722786	78.57400475244081	19411

Under topology management, a connected dominating set (CDS) of the network topology is elected and maintained for routing protocols as the backbone of the network. A MAC protocol using multi-rate transmission capability in the physical media is further applied to provide high network throughput so that a low data-rate wireless link is substituted with a high data-rate two-hop wireless link by employing an intermediate node. The efficiency of the combined optimization algorithms is validated by network performance analysis and extensive simulations with DSR (dynamic source routing) as the routing protocol. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate that our solution significantly reduces the routing control overhead, improves the network data forwarding performance.	ansi escape code;algorithm;connected dominating set;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;mathematical optimization;network performance;network topology;operand forwarding;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);simulation;source routing;throughput	Haixia Tan;Weilin Zeng;Lichun Bao	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424860	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	6.0321974000547405	83.2987186330695	19454

The 5G application demands include among others, very high data rates, support for huge number of low-power devices and mission critical communication. NR design supports operation in both traditional licensed frequency spectrum bands as well as unlicensed frequencies. In this paper, we present some of the design aspects and architectural details of NR to support spectrum sharing in the unlicensed spectrum. Moreover, we present system level simulation results showing the NR spectrum sharing capabilities while complying with the regulatory requirements.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;coexist (image);interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;microsoft outlook for mac;mission critical;noise reduction;power semiconductor device;quality of service;requirement;scalability;simulation;spatial multiplexing;spectral density	Eliane Semaan;Junaid Ansari;Gen Li;Erika Tejedor;Henning Wiemann	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925443	simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	22.777113091571426	85.84353771040821	19514

In UAV based communications, the channel models consider only the path losses, the received signal strength and the conditions for Rayleigh/Ricean channel but present no multipath profiles for A2G(air-to-ground) channel, while multipath channel models in A2G channel is necessary for UAV based broadcasting to analyze reception performances. Thus according to the decision criterion of Rayleigh/Ricean channel in the UAV communication, we tried to combine approximately this criterion with DVB-T2 multipath channel models of terrestrial broadcasting. We also discussed on the preparations for the influences of yaw and tilt in UAV based broadcasting.	aerial photography;multipath propagation;performance;rayleigh–ritz method;terrestrial television;unmanned aerial vehicle;yaws	Jaehwui Bae;Youngsu Kim;Namho Hur;Heung Mook Kim	2018	2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2018.8539497	signal strength;multipath propagation;rayleigh scattering;digital video broadcasting;dipole antenna;computer science;electronic engineering;broadcasting;communication channel	Mobile	23.81729954839291	77.02630338363247	19596

Four-input two-output switching elements and two-input four output ones employed in the second and (n+th stages are useful in sharing loads efficiently on the first and n-th stages respectively.

Most previous algorithms on time synchronization use a method that chooses a particular node and gives priority to transmitting a beacon signal to that node. Other nodes synchronize to the selected node according to methods like the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function. However, these methods have problems in the accuracy in multi-hop networks, and when nodes have mobility. We propose a new time synchronization algorithm. Nodes do not depend on a specific node, and they use all the received beacon signals and perform the time synchronization on their own. We validated the method with simulation results, which show that time synchronization is performed effectively with short process time.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);mobile device;simulation;transmitter	Yun-Jae Shin;Jung-Ryun Lee	2013	The International Conference on Information Networking 2013 (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496407	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;synchronization;optimized link state routing protocol;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;data synchronization;computer network	Mobile	9.990666771165213	82.62703671398765	19740

The convexity of a rectangle facilitates simple, efficient ways to route messages around fault regions using relatively few or no virtual channels to avoid deadlock. However, such a faulty block may include many nonfaulty nodes which are disabled, i.e., they are not involved in the routing process. Therefore, it is important to define a fault region that is convex, and at the same time, to include a minimum number of nonfaulty nodes. In this paper, we propose an optimal solution that can quickly construct a set of minimum faulty polygons, called orthogonal convex polygons, from a given set of faulty blocks in a 2-D mesh (or 2-D torus). The formation of orthogonal convex polygons is implemented using either a centralized, or distributed solution. Both solutions are based on the formation of faulty components, each of which consists of adjacent faulty nodes only, followed by the addition of a minimum number of nonfaulty nodes to make each component a convex polygon. Extensive simulation has been done to determine the number of nonfaulty nodes included in the polygon, and the result obtained is compared with the best existing known result. Results show that the proposed approach can not only find a set of minimum faulty polygons, but also does so quickly in terms of the number of rounds in the distributed solution.	algorithm;centralized computing;deadlock;fault model;fault tolerance;polygon mesh;routing;simulation	Jie Wu;Zhen Jiang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2005.853039	mathematical optimization;routing;fault tolerance;static routing;two-dimensional space;index term;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;fault model;mathematics;distributed computing	DB	-0.16115100706980032	68.93377922825543	19750

A backward Euler method is developed to efficiently perform reachability analysis by zonotope to deal with multiple device parameters with tuning ranges. Moreover, a sensitivity calculation of zonotope is developed to optimize safety distance by simultaneously tuning multiple SRAM device parameters without multiple repeated computations. As such, sequential robustness optimizations can be performed such that the optimized SRAM designs can depart from unsafe region but converge into safe region. The proposed method is implemented inside a SPICE-like simulator. As shown by numerical experiments, the proposed method can achieve 600× speedup on average compared to the traditional verification method by Monte-Carlo under the similar accuracy. In addition, compared to the traditional small-signal based sensitivity optimization, the proposed method can converge faster with high accuracy.	backward euler method;computation;converge;experiment;gnu nano;large-signal model;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;reachability;spice;simulation;small-signal model;speedup;static random-access memory;zonohedron	Yang Song;Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao;Hao Yu	2014	2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742934	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	22.338714818027295	60.973446640440955	19799

However, most existing schemes for location service incur a high overhead because of the periodical updates of location information. In this paper, we intend to address this issue. Using the temporal relationship among historical locations of mobiles in the network, we propose a novel History information based Light Location Service (HLLS). In HLLS, location information of mobiles is propagated via Hello beacons locally, and location query is performed in a tracing manner with the aid of historical locations. In such a way, HLLS can eliminate the tremendous periodical location updates and significantly reduce the overhead for location service. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HLLS in terms of high accuracy and low overhead.

A larger candidate set indicates smaller one-hop waiting cost to wait for a candidate to wake up, however, a packet is more likely to deviate from the shortest path, which will induce larger remaining cost. Remaining cost of each candidate can be used to construct a coordinate system. Neighbors of a node with high coordinate value is excluded from the candidate set, thus, we can select the next-hop relay by simply taking the first wake-up candidate. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm which is similar to the Bellman-Ford algorithm to construct a coordinate system and find an optimal candidate set for each node. Moreover, we propose an algorithm which induces acceptable overhead to maintain the coordinate system and each node's optimal candidate set. We also use simulation results to show that our proposed opportunistic routing protocol is more efficient than conventional strategies in terms of delay, energy efficiency, and miss ratio.	bellman–ford algorithm;distributed algorithm;network packet;overhead (computing);real-time clock;relay;routing;shortest path problem;simulation	Xinming Zhang;Fan Yan;Lei Tao;Dan Keun Sung	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911799	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.522554299370758	81.39930151853451	19852

Recent works have shown the feasibility of side-channel attacks against software implementations of MAC-Keccak to retrieve the key, with the security assessment of hardware implementations remaining an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and practical side-channel analysis of a hardware implementation of MAC-Keccak on FPGA. Different from previous works, we propose a new attack method targeting the first round output of MAC-Keccak rather than the linear operation θ only. The results on sampled power traces show that the unprotected hardware implementation of MAC-Keccak is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, and attacking the nonlinear operation of MAC-Keccak is very effective. We further discuss countermeasures against side-channel analysis on hardware MAC-Keccak. Finally, we discuss the impact of the key length on side-channel analysis and compare the attack complexity between MAC-Keccak and other cryptographic algorithms.	algorithm;cryptography;field-programmable gate array;key (cryptography);key size;message authentication code;nonlinear system;sha-3;side-channel attack;tracing (software)	Pei Luo;Yunsi Fei;Xin Fang;A.

In this paper we introduce a new routing algorithm based on the relative velocity of mobile nodes, which also incorporates Quality of Service (QoS), termed QoS Multipath Doppler Routing (QaS-MUDOR). The primary aim of QoS-MUBOR is to maintain long link durations, whilst meeting QoS constraints. The routing protocol proposed is based on data retrieval from nodes, where nodes act as content providers. This simulates scenarios such as downloading a file, a web page, or any form of data from other nodes which can provide it. We will show how utilizing the relative velocity of nodes using the Doppler shift subjected to packets assists in selecting stable paths, whilst maintaining the QoS requirements in highly mobile pseudo-linear systems such as an aeronautical ad hoc network.	algorithm;data retrieval;doppler effect;download;hoc (programming language);linear system;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;the australian;throughput;velocity (software development);web page;while	Ehssan Sakhaee;Abbas Jamalipour;Nei Kato	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255625	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile qos;mobile ad hoc network;information engineering;telecommunications;computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.4884538063833899	83.54254694147417	19866

It is shown that non-planar Floating Gate (FG) structure induced field enhance effect helps to cause Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling (F-N tunneling) in tunnel oxide during read operation, which will further lead to the leakage of electrons from FG to Word Line (WL). Then, the sensitivity of read disturb to process variation is investigated to expound the difference between typical cells and weak cells. The experiment has also demonstrated the weakening of read disturb due to induced tunnel oxide traps after program/erase (P/E) cycles. Based on these findings, we have rationally proposed possible solutions to reduce the read disturb on the perspectives of chip testing. The study of intrinsic read disturb mechanism is significant to the scaling of split-gate memory technology as well as to the assessment of read disturb risk in split-gate memory products.	flash memory	Wenyi Zhu;Binghan Li;Tao Yu;Weiran Kong;Shichang Zou	2017	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2016.11.009	embedded system;real-time computing;computer hardware;engineering	Logic	19.68382475674875	60.60636688742376	19897

Nodes communicate with both and infrastructure to provide Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for the purpose of improving safety and comfort. Efficient and adaptive routing protocols are essential for achieving reliable and scalable network performance. However, routing in VANETs is challenging due to the high-speed movement of vehicles, which results in frequent network topology changes. This paper provides an in-depth evaluation of three well-known MANET routing protocols, AODV, OLSR and GPSR, in VANET with urban environment setup. We compare their performance using three metrics: drop burst length (DBL), delay and delivery ratio (PDR). The simulations are carried out using NS2 and SUMO simulators platforms, with scenarios configured to reflect real-world conditions. The results show that OLSR is able to achieve a shorter DBL and demonstrates higher PDR performance comparing to AODV and GPSR under low network load.

In term of delay it is outperformed by GPSR, which delivers packets with the shortest delay.	dbl-browser;design review (u.s. government);greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;hoc (programming language);network performance;network topology;optimized link state routing protocol;scalability;simulation	Awos Kh.

The key challenge in designing a scheduling algorithm lies in solving a combinatorial optimization problem under very stringent distributed constraints. Specifically, given R random variables x1,... , xR taking integer values, each variable is required to find its assignment so that collectively they maximize SigmarWrxr subject to some linear constraints that Ax les C. In doing so, each variable can only avail of two pieces of information (and nothing else): one, its own weight Wr, two, given its current values (and the values of other variables being unknown), can it increase it by +1 or not. As the main result of this paper, we present a randomized algorithm that solves this problem. Our algorithm builds upon classical theory of reversible networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such algorithm for such a stringent distributed problem.	combinatorial optimization;distributed algorithm;future internet;like button;mathematical optimization;network architecture;optimization problem;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing)	Shreevatsa Rajagopalan;Devavrat Shah	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558577	random variable;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;scheduling;statistics	Theory	-4.158652856368554	80.96549426754756	20177

Speech recognition is considered as one such application, where the computational demands have hindered its use on wireless mobile devices. Our analysis considers distributed speech recognition on hardware platforms with PDA-like functionality (i.e. wireless LAN networking, high-quality audio input/output, a low-power general-purpose processing core, and limited amounts of flash and working memory). We focus on quality of service for the end-user (i.e. ASR accuracy and delay) and reduced energy consumption with increased battery lifetimes. We investigate quality of service and energy trade-offs in this context. We present software optimizations on a speech recognition front-end that can reduce the energy consumption by over 80% compared to the original implementation. A power on/off scheduling algorithm for the wireless interface is presented. This scheduling of the wireless interface can increase the battery lifetime by an order of magnitude. We study the effects of wireless networking and fading channel characteristics on distributed speech recognition using Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11b networks. When viewed as a whole, the optimized distributed speech recognition system can reduce the total energy consumption by over 95% compared to a client-side ASR implementation. We present an interleaving and loss concealment algorithm to increase the robustness of distributed speech recognition in a burst error channel. This improvement allows a decreased reliance on error protection overhead, which can provide reductions in transmit energy of up to 46% on a Bluetooth wireless network. The findings presented in this dissertation stress the importance of energy-aware design and optimization at all levels for battery-powered wireless devices.	speech recognition	Brian Delaney	2004			voice activity detection;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;wi-fi array	HCI	11.427637058929092	86.75370543211882	20187

In this paper, we address the clustering problems with a newly deployed multi-hop WSN where most existing clustering algorithms can hardly be used due to the absence of MAC link connections among the nodes. We propose an effective clustering algorithm based on a random contention model without the prior knowledge of the network and the ID's of nodes. Computer simulations have been used to show the effectiveness of the algorithm with a relatively low complexity if compared with existing schemes.	algorithm;channel (communications);cluster analysis;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;leader election;randomness;sensor web	Peng Guo;Tao Jiang;Kui Zhang;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.12.080042	computer simulation;constrained clustering;data stream clustering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cluster analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	0.48543818613094064	75.38043163518725	20222

INTRODUCITON Fixed Alternate Routing (FAR) has been studied in [1,2], and is one of the most common strategies for performing path selection in wavelengthmuted WDM networks. The use of FAR mainly aims at hading the efforts of dynamic link-state dissemination and computation complexity with network throughput. To operate under the architecture of FAR, basically, each node is esuipped with a routing table, in which al!ernate paths (abbreviated as “APs” in the following context) to all the other nodes are defined at the network planning stage. As a connection request arrives at a node prdr, one of the end nodes (called source) looks up the :muting table for deriving the APs to the other end node (which is called destination) and sends probing packets along each of the APs for gathering dynamic link-stale and wavelength availability of each span along the AI’s. The best path is selected among those APs according to predefied cost function and dynamic link-state metrics. The dynamic link-states can be gathered in the following three ways. First, the source sends a probing packet along each AP to the destination ;after a connection request arrives, and the destination makes ronting decision after inspecting the probing packt%s, and then activates the rrsoll~ce reservation along the rselected lightpath. Second, periodic probing is performed lby each potential source node in the network to all its desti.nations for gathering the link-states along the APs defined in the routing, table of the source. Thud, every node periodically uses flooding, or minimum halanced me architecture, to disseminate dynamic link-states af its incharge network resources to all the potential source nodes. Each of the above three methods has its pros and cons. The tirst approach saves the efforts of dissemination while incurs an extra signaling latency before routing decision can be made, which impairs the provisioning dynamics. On $e other hand, the periodic probing or dissemination may suffer from a stalling link-state problem, which impairs the performance and also dynamics if a conflict on resource reservation occurs. Although the FAR scheme has been extensively studied, there have been few reports on solving the problem of arranging APs for each S-D pair and how the different patterns of APs influence the performance behavior. The reference [3] has conducted a comparative study on the performance in blocking probability between the cases of taking a link-disjoint path-pair (or “2D” in the following discussion) and taking a complete set of k-shortat paths as APs between each S-D pair. The results showed that the expximent using a moderate n u m k of k-shortest paths as APs with a limited length in hop count can achieve the best performance. However, using a large number of APs may need a large amount of probing traffic and computation effons. The study in 131 did not consider the efforts of maintaining APs, and the cost (i.e., computation latency, extra control packets, and computation resources at a coordinator and destination, etc.) of dealing with possibly hundreds of APs corresponding to a aingle connection request. In addition, the use of k-shortest paths as APs does not consider the fad that network resources along an AP may highly overlapp with other APs between the same S-D pair, a network link may be probed for several times during a single dissemination. A funher elaboration on the selection of A P s can simply reduce the management cost and facilitate load balancing. As an example shown in Fig. I(a). with PI and P2 as Aps between node A and B ohviouly can yield better performance than the pattern given in Fig. l(b), in which the exhaustion of bandwidth on the links between node C and B can block both PI and E. To verify the above statement in an analytical approach, we assume that the probability for a link to be occupied is b, and is independent from the other links. The blocking probability is [I-(I-~)’]’ for the case in Fig. l(a), and	algorithm;blocking (computing);computation;dynamic-link library;erlang (unit);fractal dimension;link-state routing protocol;load balancing (computing);loss function;network packet;provisioning;routing table;shortest path problem;simulation;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing;xfig	Pin-Han Ho;H.

The pseudorandom testing principle described in this article can be easily integrated into an AES design regardless of the particular implementation of the non-linear modules, and requires access only to the unit's inputs and outputs. The proposed configurations offer full single stuck-at coverage and a fault detection higher than 99.78% for multiple stuck-at faults.	concurrent testing;encryption;error detection and correction;fault coverage;fault detection and isolation;nonlinear system;online and offline;overhead (computing);pseudorandomness	Flavius Opritoiu;Mircea Vladutiu;Lucian Prodan;Mihai Udrescu	2009	2009 5th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics	10.1109/SACI.2009.5136262	advanced encryption standard;electronic engineering;fault coverage;white-box testing;computer science;cryptography;information security;theoretical computer science;statistics;computer engineering	Arch	10.369329403758844	63.18174383772431	20477

Previous approaches in WiFi-based indoor localization and tracking either assume prior knowledge of indoor environment or assume many data samples from location-fixed WiFi sources (i.e. anchor points). However, such assumptions are not always true, especially in emergency scenarios. This paper explores the possibility of real-time indoor localization and tracking without any knowledge of indoor environment and with real-time data samples from only few anchor points outside the building. By using a small set of synchronized directional antennas as outdoor anchor points to actively scan in various directions, a moving device inside the building can be localized and tracked from the received signal in real-time manner. The paper proposes an angle-of-arrival estimator for accurate localization and adaptive per-antenna angular scheduling for real-time indoor tracking. The validation results from real experiment and simulation yield effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed schemes.	algorithm;angle of arrival;angularjs;real-time clock;real-time data;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);simulation;zero-knowledge proof	Thadpong Pongthawornkamol;Shameem Ahmed;Klara Nahrstedt;Akira Uchiyama	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)	10.1109/PERCOM.2010.5466968	real-time data;real-time computing;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;angle of arrival;directional antenna;antenna;ubiquitous computing;zero-knowledge proof	Robotics	17.692541272070518	72.23786607540761	20534

Since there are already systems allocated and operating in mmWave bands, it is critical to evaluate emerging spectrum sharing paradigms and enabling technologies for successful realization of 5G. One of the key challenges is the availability of evaluation metrics and tools to provide technical information enabling evidence-based policy discussions on the allocation and management of mmWave spectrum. In this article, we present and discuss evaluation metrics and simulation tools for 5G mmWave systems from a regulator's perspective. In particular, we propose a systematic approach to develop meaningful spectrum sharing metrics and demonstrate simulation tools suitable for assessing coverage in 5G mmWave small cell networks.	simulation	Humphrey Rutagemwa;Kareem E.

Moreover, it is anticipated that further reduction in size will be possible in the near future [1, 2]. Small footprint devices manufactured with micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology can accommodate a variety of sensing functions such as temperature, pressure, or acceleration, and actuation functions such as rotation, linear displacement, or torque. These mechanical operations can be coupled with electronic functions, which may include onboard communications means. Inclusion of communications would allow these miniature devices not only to exchange and share information among the platforms on which these devices are mounted (e.g., people, animals, rotating machinery parts), but to form a network that implements distributed execution of algorithms. Algorithms executed in such a network interact with and within the environment in which the network is embedded, allowing environment-dependent processing and information sharing. In other words, with inclusion of even a limited amount of memory and processing power on these microdevices, an ad hoc environment can be devised in which the participating entities may both contribute and receive services and information. The far-fetched vision is that of intelligent powder, in which these miniature and lightweight devices can be deployed instantaneously and operate autonomously in a concerted manner to carry out certain actions. The microsensors/actuators, to which we refer in this article , possess the raw ability to transmit a signal between two relatively close devices. To create a network, one must provide the nodes with the following basic functions: a medium access control, an addressing scheme, and a routing algorithm. Of course, these are the traditional issues in the design of a communication network. What is new here is that the traditional algorithms and protocols may not be applicable to the problem at hand, mainly because of the extremely limited computing, storage, and communication resources available in the microsensor nodes. Extremely low battery power and a limited amount of nonvolatile memory lead to a requirement for very low-complexity algorithms and protocols. In other words, the name of the game is to design a system with protocols as simple as possible requiring the least communication among the network nodes. Additional characteristics of our network of miniature devices are the very large number of network nodes (in the thousands) and the ability of these nodes to move relative to the rest of the network. …	as-interface;access control;addressing scheme;algorithm;cubic function;displacement mapping;embedded system;entity;hoc (programming language);microelectromechanical systems;nonvolatile bios memory;routing;sensor;smart environment;telecommunications network	Zygmunt J.

Such microphone arrays are sound acquisition systems composed of multiple microphones used to sample the sound field with spatial diversity. The relatively recent adoption of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to manage the audio data samples and to perform the signal processing operations such as filtering or beamforming has lead to customizable architectures able to satisfy the most demanding computational, power or performance acoustic applications. The presented work provides an overview of the current FPGA-based architectures and how FPGAs are exploited for different acoustic applications.

In this paper, we propose an optimized algorithm Multi-node Renewable based on Charging Range (MRCR) in the large-scale WSN, where multiple sensor nodes are charging simultaneously. A mobile charging vehicle (MCV) is responsible for energy supplement of these nodes group by group at specified docking spots. These spots are selected based on charging range of MCV, which not only maximum the charging coverage, but also improve the energy efficiency as the minimum stops and shortest travel path. We organize MCV schedule into rounds and each round is divided into slots: judgment, charging and rest. Finally, extensive experimental results show the proposal of MRCR algorithm can guarantee a short TSP length in every round and all sensor nodes live immorally.	algorithm;docking (molecular);docking station;mobile television;sql	Guowei Wu;Chi Lin;Ying Li;Lin Yao;Ailun Chen	2015	2015 9th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2015.19	telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	EDA	12.323056552192561	80.25494482584615	20869

In this paper, we propose a scalable, efficient recovery scheme for tree-based reliable multicast transport protocols. The scheme first constructs a logical tree of receivers as close to a multicast routing tree as possible by using error bitmap information. This ensures that the receivers residing at the upper level in a multicast routing tree than ones requesting retransmissions be appointed as parents in a corresponding logical tree. In our scheme, the logical tree is adaptively reconfigured as the session membership or the multicast route changes. Our scheme also forms local groups with separate multicast addresses in the tree for efficient recovery. We compare our scheme with a static tree-based reliable multicast protocol. Results of the simulation show that our adaptive tree-based recovery scheme outperforms the compared protocol in terms of the implosion and exposure as the session size increases.	bitmap;multicast;routing;scalability;simulation	Wonyong Yoon;Dongman Lee	1999		10.1109/ICCCN.1999.805506	communications protocol;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;tree;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Metrics	-0.3433590672057905	82.65290475838091	20968

At the physical and link level, several factors are critical in order to realize a nomadic PAN: co-existence with other systems, efficient use of increasingly scarce spectrum resources and capacity, robustness in the presence of interference, as well as, the availability of low cost individual user devices. In this paper, we examine a concept for nomadic PANs employing low cost, low data rate ultra wideband (UWB) communication links between personal devices and a handset, or mobile bridge, coupled with a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas for communication from a mobile bridge to other networks. Key issues are identified and potential capacity and quality-of-service (QoS) enhancements are evaluated.	end-to-end principle;information system;interference (communication);mimo;quality of service;seamless3d;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	John R.

However, only few facts about link-level characteristics in multi-channel environments have been published. This paper presents observations, made in an indoor testbed, about the impact of channel-assignment on the quality of links.We argue that the assumption 'all radio channels are equal' does not hold in almost all indoor scenarios. Hence, great care must be taken when assigning radio channels to individual links, in order not to spoil network performance. We found that for any given environment the quality and symmetry of a wireless link (quantified by delivery probability) varies significantly depending on the radio channel used. The delivery probability between the best and the worst case could easily exceed a factor of two.However, existing IEEE 802.11 multi-channel protocols assume that all channels are equal, which does not reflect real-world conditions. To remedy to this shortcoming we present the Multi Channel Extremely Opportunistic Routing MCExOR protocol [3].	best, worst and average case;mesh networking;network performance;radio frequency;routing;testbed	Mathias Kurth;Anatolij Zubow;Jens-Peter Redlich	2006		10.1145/1143549.1143736	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;service set;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;mesh networking;wireless network;shared mesh;order one network protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.5233611762487494	86.28626663009528	21055

This is a limiting factor since an intensive pre- measurement campaign is required to determine the model and its parameters. Basing on channel measurement campaigns in different areas we confirmed that the variation in the RSSIs of the IEEE 802.15.4 signal can be described by a two-layer model. We therefore propose a novel target localization method with no prior knowledge of model parameter values. The method is based on a joint maximum likelihood target localization and channel model parameters estimation. The proposed method was experimentally verified in real environments and the results show that the location estimation accuracy outperforms the accuracy of the conventional method where the values of the channel model parameters are known in advance.	channel (communications);estimation theory;experiment;internationalization and localization	Radim Zemek;Shinsuke Hara;Kentaro Yanagihara;Ken-ichi Kitayama	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394355	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;maximum likelihood;statistics	Mobile	21.453323704723804	74.39307296206337	21062

The link metrics are defined as random variables following Weibull probability distributions as empirically reported in [13] and analytically derived in [12]. The problem of finding the most likely path is NP-Hard [24]. Our approach involves reducing the complicated probability convolutions necessary to calculate the most probable path that satisfies a requested delay value. With the reduction of the objective function, an extended Bellman-Ford algorithm is devised to solve the problem. The resulting approach have the same complexity as the standard Bellman-Ford algorithm. Our reduced objective function only needs the location parameter of the Weibull distributions, hence avoiding the complexity of inferring the shape and scale parameters. We evaluate the performance of our approach by simulations and conclude with possible extensions of our work.	convolution;loss function;np-hardness;optimization problem;provisioning;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Suleyman Uludag;Ljubomir Perkovic;Anna Kashkanova;Kemal Akkaya	2007		10.1145/1577222.1577238	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;statistics	EDA	-3.5628923131523567	83.77684504886638	21081

One alternative is to increase the transmit power of each broadcaster's only transmitter. The other alternative is to replace that single transmitter with a multi-transmitter single frequency network (SFN). For both approaches, this paper calculates the relationship between the maximum achievable spectrum efficiency and the cost required to achieve that efficiency as a function of the most important design parameters. Results suggest that increasing power of traditional single-transmitter broadcasters could reduce the amount of spectrum needed for TV by roughly 30%, and would be cost-effective today through much of the U.S. A switch to SFNs could reduce the amount of spectrum needed for TV by roughly 60%, but at a higher cost. Results suggest that the SFN approach could be cost-effective in the most densely populated regions where spectrum is most valuable.	broadcast television systems;interference (communication);internet access;population;single-frequency network;spectral efficiency;spectrum reallocation;terrestrial television;transmitter;ultra high frequency	Rolando Bettancourt;Jon M.

A hierarchical proactive routing scheme is employed that involves two-tiers: an upper tier for large scale cell-level paths and a lower tier for local tree-based routing. The upper-tier routing is accomplished by tracking a next hop cell for L = 2pi/phi virtual routers that represent sectors emanating from a source root thereby forwarding the message to the parent node associated with the next cell's routing tree. Lower-tier routing involves simply routing to the parent node of the tree with respect to a destination base station. Once there, the message is broadcast to the destination user. Routing complexity is reduced from O(n3) to O(1) for this routing scheme at a small cost in accuracy. Simulations are performed on different sized networks ranging from 70,000 nodes to nearly 700,000 nodes to demonstrate successful performance of the large-scale routing approach.	complex network;computer simulation;geographic routing;hop;multitier architecture;network packet;radial (radio);routing table;tree (data structure);tree structure	Alan R.

Furthermore, multihop message forwarding multiplies the amount of simultaneous transmissions, which augment both channel contention and network congestion, increasing interference and reducing protocol performance. With these issues in mind, we propose a variation of MANET which we called interest-centric mobile adhoc network or simply Radnet in which every participant node implements in the network layer an Active Prefix (AP) composed of a prefix and an application interest, which the Radnet protocol uses for node identification, message addressing, probabilistic message forwarding, and name search in a distributed way. To evaluate the effectiveness of Radnets for generating lower disturbance in the shared communication medium, thus enabling resource savings, and reducing message overheads, we compared the simulated performances of Radnet protocol (RP) against those of AODV and AODV + Gossip3 (G3AODV) protocols. The results showed that RP achieved a 16 percent higher message delivery rate and one order of magnitude lower latency and message overhead for short 0.5 kB messages in scenarios with 150 mobile nodes. For 5 kB messages, however, AODV and G3AODV rarely ran until the end, due to their overwhelming message overheads, while Radnet protocol showed performances similar to that of the short message case. To evaluate the use of Radnets in practice, we ran experiments in the laboratory, including a chat application on a 20-node Radnet.	access control;android;application programming interface;download;experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);kilobyte;network congestion;overhead (computing);performance;rp (complexity);routing table;service discovery;simulation;social messaging	Renato C.

Several existing proposals attempt to build QoS-sensitive multicast trees by providing multiple joining paths for a new member using a flooding-based search strategy which has the draw-back of excessive overhead and may not be able to determine which join path is QoS feasible sometimes. In this paper, first we propose a method to propagate QoS information in bidirectional multicast trees to enable better QoS-aware path selection decisions. We then propose an alternative “join point” search strategy that would introduce much less control overhead utilizing the root-based feature of the MASC/BGMP inter-domain multicast architecture. Simulation results show that this strategy is as effective as flooding-based search strategy in finding alternative join points for a new member but with much less overhead. We also discuss extensions to BGMP to incorporate our strategies to enable QoS support.	border gateway multicast protocol;inter-domain;join point;overhead (computing);quality of service;routing;simulation	Aiguo Fei;Mario Gerla	2001		10.1007/3-540-45512-4_10	routing;real-time computing;multicast;the internet;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;service quality;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Web+IR	-4.414389468349966	76.89297877916063	21134

This hampers the data flow continuity and limits the performance of routing protocol. Maintaining an uninterrupted flow of traffic is the key challenge in the design of efficient routing protocol. An algorithm RDCLRP (route discovery using cross layer routing protocol) is proposed to reduce discontinuity of data flow. An on-demand route is discovered in advance before route failure to avoid route instability. The modifications are made to the AODV protocol’s route maintenance mechanism in order to develop RDCLRP. Three variants of proposed work are developed and their results are discussed. Performance of proposed algorithm is investigated for change in traffic. Proposed algorithm illustrates that the data flow discontinuity rate is reduced by 90% over AODV.	algorithm;care-of address;dataflow;instability;reflections of signals on conducting lines;routing;scott continuity;throughput;u.s. route shield	Mehajabeen Fatima;Roopam Gupta;T.

This paper offers an approach to assessing the worst case scalable robustness (WCSR) of an algorithm paired with an error measure, as well as the i.i.d. average case scalable robustness (ACSRiid). In a case study on four linearithmic and quadratic pairwise sorting algorithms suffering faulty comparisons, we confirm that algorithm efficiency is inversely correlated with algorithm robustness, and more unexpectedly, that only round robin sort -- a quadratic algorithm rarely used in computing -- achieves both ACSRiid and WCSR.	algorithmic efficiency;banished;best, worst and average case;best-effort delivery;computation;correctness (computer science);robustness (computer science);scalability;secure two-party computation;software bug;sorting algorithm;time complexity;what if	Thomas B.

Existing works in the literature use clustering approaches, principal component analysis (PCA) and/or compressed sensing (CS) strategies. Our contribution is aligned with PCA and explores whether a projection basis that is not the eigenvectors basis may be valid to sustain a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) threshold in signal reconstruction and reduce the energy consumption. We derivate first the NSME achieved with the new basis and elaborate then on the Jacobi eigenvalue decomposition ideas to propose a new subspace-based data aggregation method. The proposed solution reduces transmissions among the sink and one or more data aggregation nodes (DANs) in the network. In our simulations, we consider without loss of generality a single cluster network and results show that the new technique succeeds in satisfying the NMSE requirement and gets close in terms of energy consumption to the best possible solution employing subspace representations. Additionally, the proposed method alleviates the computational load with respect to an eigenvector-based strategy (by a factor of six in our simulations).	approximation algorithm;bottleneck (software);cluster analysis;compressed sensing;computation;data aggregation;data compression;download;frame (networking);iteration;jacobi eigenvalue algorithm;jacobi method;lossy compression;mean squared error;principal component analysis;scalability;signal reconstruction;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Antoni Morell;Alejandro Correa Vila;Marc Barcelo;José López Vicario	2016	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2016.2531041	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;correlation;wireless;statistics;principal component analysis	Mobile	15.9441286503647	80.23302587004208	21193

There is a wide range of heuristics to calculate the optimal multicast distribution trees with bounds on the maximum delay from the source to all members. However these heuristics require all the members to be known in advance and assume the existence of a centralized service. We present a heuristic Best Cost Individual Join (BCIJ) that joins members one by one, randomly to the existing tree. The method doesn’t need previous knowledge of the group members. Trees are dynamically built when each member arrives in the group. A distributed method Multiple Metric Broadcast (MMB) for nodes to obtain the best valid path to the existing tree is also presented. MMB is inspired by Reverse Path Forwarding and broadcasts queries to the network that reach existing on-tree members. Theses reply with the best valid paths to the joining member. The member then selects the best path. This avoids the use of any centralized service and the need for link-state information to be available in any node. Evaluation presented shows that the BCIJ produces trees with better cost than existing centralized heuristics and t hat MMB doesn’t have a major effect on the network if the group participation is sufficiently large.	autonomous system (internet);border gateway multicast protocol;centralized computing;heuristic (computer science);inter-domain;internet;link-state routing protocol;multicast;overhead (computing);quality of service;randomness;simulation;software propagation	Miguel Rio;Peter F.

We investigate the problem of communication in an ad hoc heterogeneous network comprising of several underlying homogeneous networks. Our proposed solution introduces special multi-interface devices, called drones, that enable communication between dissimilar networks. The optimal placement of drones with accompanying network interfaces is determined by a new placement and interface selection algorithm (PISA). The algorithm is validated, considering example scenarios, using MATLAB simulations. Solutions achievable using PISA result in high connectivity in the heterogeneous network with minimal number of drones and network interfaces.	cluster analysis;combinatorial optimization;genetic algorithm;hoc (programming language);iteration;matlab;maximal set;resultant;run time (program lifecycle phase);selection algorithm;semantic network;simulation;test case;unmanned aerial vehicle	Santosh Pandey;Prathima Agrawal	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.999	wireless ad hoc network;heterogeneous network;computer science;network interface;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-2.3745548683305655	80.4523769930672	21233

Such collisions are hard to overcome with passive tags due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we look into the problem of minimizing the time required to read a set of passive tags. We propose a novel approach, the distance-based clustering, in which the interrogation zone of an RFID reader is divided into equal sized clusters (discs), and tags of different clusters are read separately. The novel contributions of this paper are the following. First, we provide a mathematical analysis to the problem and derive a closed-form formula relating delay to the number of tags and clusters. Second, we devise a method to efficiently find the optimal number of clusters. The proposed scheme can be augmented with any tree-based anti-collision scheme, and substantially improve its performance. Simulation results show that our approach makes significant improvements in reducing collisions and delay.	cluster analysis;overhead (computing);radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;scheme;simulation;tag (metadata)	Waleed Alsalih;Kashif Ali;Hossam S.

In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to reduce the energy consumption of the display subsystems of mobile devices without compromising user experience. In preliminary experiments, we noticed that mobile devices typically perform redundant display updates even if the display content does not change. Based on this observation, we first propose a metric called the content rate, which is defined as the number of meaningful frame changes in a second. Our scheme then estimates an optimal refresh rate based on the content rate in order to eliminate redundant display updates. Also proposed is the flicker compensation technique, which prevents the flickering problem caused by the reduced refresh rate. Extensive experiments conducted on the latest smartphones demonstrated that our system effectively reduces the overall power consumption of mobile devices by 35 percent while simultaneously maintaining satisfactory display quality.	experiment;flicker (screen);mobile device;motion compensation;refresh rate;smartphone;user experience	Dongwon Kim;Nohyun Jung;Yohan Chon;Hojung Cha	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2467393	embedded system;real-time computing;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science;graphics;operating system	Mobile	-2.3992130802759624	60.711509471673274	21474

7b055b195dd55ccbd95bfdc1e3aa9a7e56a0d65c	analysis of side-channel attack aes hardware trojan benchmarks against countermeasures		Hardware Trojan (HT) is one of the well known hardware security issue in research community in last one decade. HT research is mainly focused on HT detection, HT defense and designing novel HT's. HT's are inserted by an adversary for leaking secret data, denial of service attacks etc. Trojan benchmark circuits for processors, cryptography and communication protocols from Trust-hub are widely used in HT research. And power analysis based side channel attacks and designing countermeasures against side channel attacks is a well established research area. Trust-Hub provides a power based side-channel attack promoting Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) HT benchmarks for research. In this work, we analyze the strength of AES HT benchmarks in the presence well known side-channel attack countermeasures. Masking, Random delay insertion and tweaking the operating frequency of clock used in sensitive operations are applied on AES benchmarks. Simulation and power profiling studies confirm that side-channel promoting HT benchmarks are resilient against these selected countermeasures and even in the presence of these countermeasures; an adversary can get the sensitive data by triggering the HT.	adversary (cryptography);benchmark (computing);central processing unit;clock rate;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;encryption;hardware trojan;side-channel attack;simulation;trojan horse (computing);tweaking;usb hub;whole earth 'lectronic link	K SudeendraKumar;Sauvagya Ranjan Sahoo;Abhishek Mahapatra;Ayas Kanta Swain;Kamala Kanta Mahapatra	2017	2017 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2017.106	real-time computing;hardware security module;power analysis;hardware trojan;encryption;advanced encryption standard;adversary;side channel attack;computer security;engineering;denial-of-service attack	Crypto	11.870643341885797	63.74207068229399	21609
443ae3e0c1857c2817578779513910d5ea78faa6	ebkcca: a novel energy balanced k-coverage control algorithm based on probability model in wireless sensor networks		In the process of k-coverage of the target node, there will be a lot of data redundancy forcing the phenomenon of congestion which reduces network communication capability and coverage, and accelerates network energy consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel energy balanced k-coverage control algorithm based on probability model (EBKCCA). The algorithm constructs the coverage network model by using the positional relationship between the nodes. By analyzing the network model, the coverage expected value of nodes and the minimum number of nodes in the monitoring area are given. In terms of energy consumption, this paper gives the proportion of energy conversion functions between working nodes and neighboring nodes. By using the function proportional to schedule low energy nodes, we achieve the energy balance of the whole network and optimizing network resources. The last simulation experiments indicate that this algorithm can not only improve the quality of network coverage, but also completely inhibit the rapid energy consumption of node, and extend the network lifetime.	algorithm	Zeyu Sun;Yongsheng Zhang;Xiaofei Xing;Houbing Song;Huihui Wang;Yangjie Cao	2016	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2016.08.011	network delay;computer network;wireless sensor network;real-time computing;energy consumption;energy balance;brooks–iyengar algorithm;wireless mesh network;computer science;algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;loss network	Mobile	8.585093927749266	80.469638298818	21645

In this demonstration, we present a novel time synchronization scheme that is based on time series analysis. To provide a general model for the practical behavior of low precision oscillators, autoregressive integrated moving average models are explored. Based on the analysis of experimental data, an autoregressive integrated model (ARI (1,1)) is derived. Unlike the resource hungry Kalman filter based formulations, the proposed scheme is resource efficient as it results in simple linear regression processing. Experiments are performed on real sensor devices including Zolertia and TelosB, where an accuracy below 1 clock tick 1 is achieved.	autoregressive integrated moving average;autoregressive model;jiffy (time);kalman filter;time series	Wasif Masood;Jorge F.

Coupled with its location independent addressing, multicasting is a viable alternative to support mobility in the Internet. This paper continues research into using IP multicasting in mobility. Our proposed scheme looks at enabling a mobile node to initiate two way communications with a corresponding node on a shared multicast tree. We use as much of the existing Internet architecture as possible by making the basestation a member of the multicast group. The mobile is not directly connected to the tree but goes through the basestation to send and receive packets. This paper explains the differences and advantages of our proposed scheme compared with other multicast based mobility schemes and Mobile IP.	core-based trees;multicast	Jaipal Singh;Prakash Veeraraghavan;Samar Singh	2004			computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	-0.11056595590405686	83.30368743936485	21763

Subject to a budget limit for sensors, the network is required to secure a certain detection probability and to work for a reasonable long time. One novel model of randomly distributed network is presented to fulfill this requirement. A state switching scheme is developed for sensor to save energy. The functional relationships between detection probability and related parameters about sensor, network and target are analyzed. Moreover, a two-level optimization problem is formulated. At the lower level, we optimize the behavior of each sensor subject to its energy constraint and at the upper level, we maximize the lifetime of the network. Equilibrium solution of the two-level optimization problem is obtained by numerical method. An example is presented to illustrate the main results. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Elevators are vertical links between dies. Because of yield issues, Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) cost, and heterogeneity in dimension, topology, and technology of different dies, vertically-partially-connected topologies seem unavoidable in the emerging 3-D-NoCs as opposed to fully-connected topologies. In such partially-connected topologies, as there are fewer elevators than routers, the assignment of elevators to routers becomes a new 3-D-specific optimization problem. An improper assignment can lead to dramatic network performance degradation. This paper proposes an elevator assignment method for best-effort wormhole 3-D-NoCs to improve the average network performance. Experimental results show an improvement of about 90% even compared to a greedy (intrinsically good) initial assignment.	best, worst and average case;best-effort delivery;elegant degradation;greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);mathematical optimization;network on a chip;network performance;optimization problem;router (computing);tabu search;through-silicon via	Sahar Foroutan;Abbas Sheibanyrad;Frédéric Pétrot	2014	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2014.2323219	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	EDA	2.8189199030733705	62.83379448024276	21877
d55657a3be3e19582eb1c07c0b5e1c11bdbacb7a	a reconfigurable boolean n-cube architecture under faults		Abstract   A reconfigurable modular Boolean n-cube (RMB n ) is proposed in this paper. We embed spare elements, including nodes (processors), switches and links, into each module in order to reconfigure a failed system. The proposed scheme is constructed in two levels. The first level is to build a fault-tolerant module (FTM), using an original 4-cube of 16 nodes with 4 spare nodes and some switches with links. Then, in the second level, we use several FTMs to construct the desired RMB n , n ≥ 4, via connecting the corresponding nodes between any two adjacent FTMs. In our scheme, each spare node can replace any faulty node in the FTM via rebuilding the interconnections, i.e., each FTM can tolerate 4 faulty nodes. A reconfiguration algorithm is developed to choose an adequate spare node such that a faulty node can be replaced. We also develop a distributed routing algorithm to route messages from any source node to any destination node around the faulty nodes. Finally, the RMB n  is evaluated and compared with previous works. It is shown that the proposed scheme can achieve the same or higher reliability while using fewer hardware costs.		Chu-Sing Yang;S.

However, previous work has shown that enterprise WiFi performance is often unsatisfactory and that over-utilization and interference from rogue APs are the two primary reasons. To address the above problem, this paper proposes to improve the capacity of WiFi infrastructures by increasing the enterprise AP deployment density, as well as disabling the wired Internet access in buildings to eliminate rogue APs and their interference. We deployed several WiFi networks with different AP density and vendors on Tsinghua campus. Based on the measurement results from our real-world deployments, we made three main observations: 1) in general, higher AP density improves WiFi performance; 2) over-dense deployment with unnecessarily high transmission power can worsen WiFi performance. 3) choice of AP vendors also has an impact on WiFi performance.	interference (communication);internet access;rogue;serial experiments lain;software deployment	Kaixin Sui;Siqi Sun;Yousef Azzabi;Xiaoping Zhang;Youjian Zhao;Jilong Wang;Zimu Li;Dan Pei	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks (LANMAN)	10.1109/LANMAN.2016.7548845	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Arch	11.21435232031473	87.84976766093567	21911

But protocol simulation of satellite networks is hard to realize due to the difficulty of satellite networks modeling. Currently protocol simulation system can't support satellite constellation networks fully. To improve the dependability and availability of the simulation system, we propose PSOS: a novel protocol simulation platform for satellite networks and its implementation framework in this paper. First, some popular simulation tools and the protocol of satellite networks are presented. Then, the architecture of protocol simulation platform is proposed, which mainly contains satellite constellation model and protocol simulation. The platform is not restricted to any communication protocol or connection mode. The framework, which is based on STK and OPNET, takes full advantage of satellite constellation modeling in STK and network protocol simulation in OPNET. In addition, an integrated workflow for the platform is illuminated to comprehend the simulator clearly. The simulation validation of PSOS is also presented.	capability maturity model;communications protocol;constellation model;dependability;propagation delay;prototype;routing;stk;simulation;software propagation;psos	Qi Zou	2007	2007 15th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	10.1109/MASCOTS.2007.54	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	0.11482595637056024	88.17982305224572	21966

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be an effective solution to provide high rate and reliable transmission in UAV communication systems because of its high spectral efficiency and robustness against frequency selective fading. We herein focus our attention on two critical issues in our proposed UAV aided OFDM system, i.e., timing synchronization and ranging. Moreover, extensive simulations are conducted for evaluation. Finally, we design a real-world field test for verifying the effectiveness of our proposed multi-UAV OFDM communication system.

For our scheme, sensor nodes are deployed in groups called clusters composed of cluster head and cluster members. Therefore, there is a possibility that the nodes in one cluster are not in communication range of neighboring cluster. As we know in WSN, the message has to be transmitted to long distances which increase the communication overhead. For this reason, a gateway node is required, so that two neighboring cluster heads can communicate with each other. We propose a scheme to select a gateway node by identifying the boundary points through convex hull approach. After identifying the gateway node, we choose the protocol for key exchange between the two gateway nodes. It will minimize the communication and computation overhead.	computation;computer cluster;convex hull;key exchange;overhead (computing)	Rabia Latif;Asad Raza	2012	2012 15th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2012.84	normal distribution;wireless sensor network;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;bismuth;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;node;boundary;computer network	Robotics	7.504044312422389	79.15342051601063	21994

VANETs help improve traffic safety and efficiency. Each vehicle can exchange their information to inform the other vehicles about the current status of the traffic flow or a dangerous situation such as an accident. To achieve these, a reliable and efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol with minimal transmission collisions is required. High speed nodes, absence of infrastructure, variations in topology and their QoS requirements makes it difficult for designing a MAC protocol in vehicular networks. There are several MAC protocols proposed for VANETs to ensure that all the vehicles could send safety messages without collisions by reducing the end-to-end delay and packet loss ratio. This paper gives an overview of the several proposed MAC protocols for VANETs along with their benefits and limitations and presents an overall classification based on their characteristics.

5747b4f74953ebad4d178c5ad960324a0a12400c	age-minimal transmission for energy harvesting sensors with finite batteries: online policies		An energy-harvesting sensor node that is sending status updates to a destination is considered. The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size to save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update transmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an error-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is revealed to the sensor causally over time after it arrives, and the goal is to design status update transmission times (policy) such that the long term average age of information (AoI) is minimized. The AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update has reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a random battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR) model. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit rate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and with values that fill up the battery incrementally in a unit-by-unit fashion in the IBR model. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for both models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the inter-update times follow a renewal process in a certain manner that depends on the energy arrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal policy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a status update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on the energy available in its battery. For both the random and the incremental battery recharge models, the optimal energy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form, in terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the optimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the battery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the battery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI. ∗Ahmed Arafa and H.

In this paper, we present the ability of a SPICE-like model of the ATMEL TSTAC™ eFlash technology to guide the design and test phases. This model is composed of two layers: a functional layer representing the Floating Gate (FG) and a programming layer able to determine the channel voltage level controlling the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling effect. It is able to guide the test phase since it allows analyzing and modeling defects that may affect the eFlash array.

We do this by employing both inter-node range measurements and odometry data. Both types of measurement data are applied within the multidimensional scaling paradigm, which maps pairwise dissimilarity values into node coordinates. The mathematical treatment is presented, along with several advantages of our proposed approach. We demonstrate its performance through simulation across various parameter values.

We examined the performance of four network data representation standards: ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and Packed Encoding Rules (PER). We also compare our implementations for BER and PER against the Sun Microsystem's External Data Representation (XDR) and HP/Apollo's Network Data Representation (NDR). To help examine implementation issues, we designed the snacc ASN. 1 compiler that produces compile-based (C and C++) and table-based encoders and decoders as well as type tables. The implementation issues investigated include compiled versus table-based encoding and decoding, implementation language (C/C++), buffering techniques and memory management. We found that the areas crucial to efficient encoder and decoder implementations are memory management, buffer management and the overall simplicity of the encoding rules. Table-based encoders and decoders typically have considerably smaller code size but perform less efficiently than their compiled counterparts. In contrast to popular belief, it is possible to implement ASN.1 BER and PER encoders and decoders that perform as well as their NDR and XDR counterparts.	abstract syntax notation one;binary decoder;bounce message;c++;character encoding;compiler;data (computing);data structure;encoder;external data representation;mega man network transmission;memory management;object language;protocol stack;x.690	Michael Sample;Gerald W.

Circuits implemented in MCML, in fact, have unique characteristics both in terms of power consumption and the dependency of the power profile from the input signal pattern. Therefore, MCML is suitable to protect cryptographic hardware from DPA and similar side-channel attacks. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of different logic styles against power analysis attacks, the non-linear bijective function of the Kasumi algorithm (known as substitution box S7) was implemented with CMOS and MCML technology, and a set of attacks was performed using power traces derived from SPICE-level simulations. Although all keys were discovered for CMOS, only very few attacks to MCML were successful.	algorithm;cmos;cryptography;current-mode logic;experiment;kasumi ninja;nonlinear system;s-box;spice;side-channel attack;simulation;tracing (software)	Francesco Regazzoni;Stéphane Badel;Thomas Eisenbarth;Johann Großschädl;Axel Poschmann;Zeynep Toprak Deniz;Marco Macchetti;Laura Pozzi;Christof Paar;Yusuf Leblebici;Paolo Ienne	2007	2007 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/ICSAMOS.2007.4285753	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science	EDA	12.657852157212337	63.448086146491356	22257

PLC modems of 200 Mbps class become a practical use stage in the West, and the standardization activity is active now. The discussion for deregulation is being continued in also Japan, and regulation values have been proposed. Another topic in this paper is a sensor network application of PLC, which is an indoor fine-grained localization system by acoustic Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiplexed (DS-CDM) signals. The obtained average accuracy of the localization in a 4 m 2  plane was 1 cm if there was no obstacle. To realize the localization system, some novel ideas, such as PLC speakers, a synchronization method based on the zero-crossing timing of the mains frequency, and integrated wired/wireless PLC, are introduced.	power-line communication	Shinji Tsuzuki	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.11.3006	embedded system;wireless sensor network;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;power-line communication;local system;standardization	Visualization	19.68114169111276	76.77232196791948	22310

Wide-sense nonblocking networks are generally believed to have lower network cost than strictly nonblocking networks. However, the analysis for the wide-sense nonblocking conditions is usually more difficult. Moore[2] proved that a v(m;n; 2) network is nonblocking under packing strategy if the number of middle stage switches m 3 2n . This result has been widely cited in the literature, and is even considered as the wide-sense nonblocking condition under packing strategy for the general v(m;n; r) networks in some papers, such as [7]. In fact, it is still not known that whether the condition m 3 2n holds for v(m;n; r) networks when r 3. In this paper, we introduce a systematic approach to the analysis of wide-sense nonblocking conditions under packing strategy for general v(m;n; r) networks with any r values. We first translate the problem of finding the necessary and sufficient nonblocking conditions for v(m;n; r) networks to a set of linear programming problems. We then solve this special type of linear programming problems and obtain an elegant closed form optimum solution. We prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for a v(m;n; r) network to be nonblocking under packing strategy is m j 2 1 F2r 1 n k where F2r 1 is the Fibonacci number. We believe that the systematic approach developed in this paper can be used for analyzing other wide-sense nonblocking control strategies as well.	clos network;linear programming;network switch;non-blocking algorithm;set packing	Yuanyuan Yang;Jianchao Wang	1999	IEEE Trans.

Conservation of battery power has been addressed using many techniquessuch as variable speed CPUs, ash memory, disk spindowns, and so on. We believe that energy conservation should be an important factor in the design of networking protocols for mobile wireless networks. In particular, this paper addresses energy eeciency in medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless networks. The paper develops a framework to study the energy consumption of a MAC protocol from the transceiver usage perspective. This framework is then applied to compare the performance of a set of protocols that includes IEEE 802.11, EC-MAC, PRMA, MDR-TDMA, and DQRUMA ***. The performance metrics considered are transmitter and receiver usage times for packet transmission and reception. The time estimates are then combined with power ratings for a Proxim RangeLAN2 radio card to obtain an estimate of the energy consumed for MAC related activities. The analysis here shows that protocols that aim to reduce the number of contentions perform better from an energy consumption perspective. The receiver usage time, however, tends to be higher for protocols that require the mobile to sense the medium before attempting transmission. The paper also provides a set of principles that could be applied when designing access protocols for wireless networks.	access control;central processing unit;communications protocol;memory data register;mobile phone;network packet;transceiver;transmitter	Jyh-Cheng Chen;Krishna M.

T    his paper     proposes a RSSI-based     refinement of the optimization mechanism (BR 2     O    M)     based on     multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). The basic idea     of the algorithm     is that     establishing sub-areas for localization to ensure the processing of localization can be completed successfully. The sub-area is divided by         cluster which is a tree structure.     At the same time,     the mechanism filters the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based on th    e link quality indication     (    LQI    )     to reduce the error number     of     RSSI.     The RSSI is c    orrect    ed     and refin    ed     by using     cosine rule     and the     limitation of     communication     range    .     T    he     relationship of     relative position     among         blind     node    s is obtained by     adopt    ing     classical MDS algorithm    .         The relative position is finally         converted     into     the     global coordinate. The experiment result shows that     the algorithm has many advantages, such as     high accuracy, simple condition    ,     and moderate cost    .         The algorithm     satisf    ies     the requirement of large-scale     network applications and     also is valua    ble     to the positioning refined problems under         circumstance     of     the non-line-of-sight.

Data mining methods have been successfully used to discover optimized solutions to this problem, and have the capability to learn the network behavior under different network conditions and during operation so that complete knowledge of the network behavior is not required a priori. This article identifies the concepts behind the idea of using data mining for communication network control, provides a structured survey of the results in this area, and discusses the guidelines for future applications.	activity recognition;association rule learning;communications satellite;computer science;context awareness;data mining;data pre-processing;digital signal processing;electronic engineering;game theory;genetic algorithm;information theory;internet of things;machine learning;markov chain;markov decision process;multicast;network performance;point of view (computer hardware company);preprocessor;radio resource management;real-time clock;scientific literature;smartphone;telecommunications network;terrestrial television	Mauro De Sanctis;Igor Bisio;Giuseppe Araniti	2016	IEEE Network	10.1109/MNET.2016.7389827	data modeling;algorithm design;association rule learning;computer science;data science;machine learning;data mining;network simulation;cluster analysis	ML	11.341610111895777	72.74553444837295	22490

To support many applications in VANETs, most studies use GPS to find the furthest node with ACK to ensure successful message reception. However, this ACK procedure can be removed if a channel between the sender and receiver is clear such that the sender can overhear the broadcasted messages from the receiver. If the sender fails, nodes closer to the sender inform the sender of successful rebroadcasting, which serves as an ACK to the sender. This process will either entirely remove costly ACKing processes or at least decouple the messages propagation from ACKing to the sender, which will significantly improve the speed of message propagation. In this paper, we use Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) with ACK decoupling to ensure fast message propagation with reliable message recovery. Detailed simulation results show that the proposed SNR based approach with ACK decoupling outperforms the Smart Broadcast (SB) by 200% in average throughput and per hop delay, while ensuring the reliable dissemination of emergency messages in typical VANETs environments.	acknowledgement (data networks);coupling (computer programming);global positioning system;sandy bridge;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Razvan Cristian Voicu;Hamza Ijaz Abbasi;Huangwei Fang;Billy Kihei;John A.

However, when using crowdsourced fingerprints to construct an indoor radio map, the following challenges should be first addressed: inaccurate location information, nonuniform spatial density, fingerprint dimension diversity and collection device diversity. In this paper, we propose a radio map construction scheme based on crowdsourced fingerprint splitting and fitting to deal with the first three challenges. Our objective is to construct a grid radio map from crowdsourced fingerprints. We propose to split a crowdsourced fingerprint into several neighboring grid cells with some probability. For each grid cell, we propose to first filter out some unimportant features when composing a grid cell fingerprint. Furthermore, for a grid cell with very few or non supporting crowdsourced fingerprints, we propose to construct its fingerprint by using the surface fitting technique. We conduct field measurements and experiments to examine the localization performance. Results show that the proposed scheme can achieve 1.48m mean localization error and is more robustness to location annotation errors.	crowdsourcing;curve fitting;device fingerprint;experiment;internationalization and localization;multivariate interpolation	Yanzhen Ye;Bang Wang	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925655	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy	Mobile	18.762032025675786	73.30351877732222	22529

With concurrent communication on all channels of every node in binary cube networks, the number of element transfers in sequence for K elements per node is K 2 , irrespective of the number of nodes over which the data set is distributed. For a succession of s permutations within disjoint subcubes of d dimensions each, our schedules yield min(K 2 + (s ? 1)d; (s+ 3)d; K 2 + 2d) exchanges in sequence. The algorithms can be organized to avoid indirect addressing in the internode data exchanges, a property that increases the performance on some architectures. For message passing communication libraries, we present a blocking procedure that minimizes the number of block transfers while preserving the utilization of the communication channels. For schedules with optimal channel utilization, the number of block transfers for a binary d-cube is d. The maximum block size for K elements per node is d K 2d e.	addressing mode;algorithm;apollonian network;block size (cryptography);blocking (computing);channel (communications);library (computing);message passing;olap cube;schedule (computer science);succession;throughput	S.

It therefore has been the focus of many researchers. An important problem concerning power consumption is how to minimize the number of maximum power nodes while maintaining a desired network topology. As fault tolerance is vitally important in practice, it is desirable that the constructed network topology is k-edge-connected (or k-connected). In this paper, we study the dual power assignment problem for k-edge connectivity (kEDP) in WSNs. While other studies consider only the special case k=2, our goal is to address the general problem. We prove the NP-completeness of kEDP problem in the geometric case and provide a 2-approximation algorithm using linear programming techniques. To our knowledge, this approximation ratio is currently the best one. We also introduce a heuristic whose performance is better compared with an approximation algorithm in [1].	approximation algorithm;assignment problem;experiment;fault tolerance;geometric networks;heuristic;k-edge-connected graph;k-vertex-connected graph;linear programming;mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem;np-completeness;network topology	Nhat X.

There are some issues in these networks, such as route loss due to topological change and packet errors due to wireless nodes relay. To overcome these issues, we use a multiple route coding scheme in which packets are transmitted on multiple routes from a user node to multiple base stations. This scheme can achieve a diversity gain by combining packets that are transmitted along multiple routes. Some challenges must be met to establish multiple routes for this scheme. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol for multiple route coding. The key idea of this proposed scheme is using a hybrid routing protocol. This can mitigate an increase in control packets and multiple disjoint routes can be constructed.

e875fce1a8520e2c8ba689ad5f3a3255eb86d1fd	planning uav activities for efficient user coverage in disaster areas		Climate changes brought about by global warming as well as man-made environmental changes are often the cause of sever natural disasters. ICT, which is itself responsible for global warming due to its high carbon footprint, can play a role in alleviating the consequences of such hazards by providing reliable, resilient means of communication during a disaster crisis. In this paper, we explore the provision of wireless coverage through UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to complement, or replace, the traditional communication infrastructure. The use of UAVs is indeed crucial in emergency scenarios, as they allow for the quick and easy deployment of micro and pico cellular base stations where needed. We characterize the movements of UAVs and define an optimization problem to determine the best UAV coverage that maximizes the user throughput, while maintaining fairness across the different parts of the geographical area that has been affected by the disaster. To evaluate our strategy, we simulate a flooding in San Francisco and the car traffic resulting from people seeking safety on higher ground.	aerial photography;carbon tetrachloride;chimeric antigen receptor;complement system proteins;deploy;fairness measure;floods;geographic coordinate system;global warming;mathematical optimization;movement;natural disasters;optimization problem;pico;simulation;throughput;unmanned aerial vehicle	Francesco Malandrino;Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini;Claudio Casetti;Luca Chiaraviglio;Andrea Senacheribbe	2018	CoRR		global warming;software deployment;computer network;throughput;carbon footprint;environmental resource management;wireless;computer science;information and communications technology;base station;optimization problem	Mobile	18.297753617218355	86.76973579536715	23052

To bypass holes, most existing geographic routing protocols tend to route data packets along the boundaries of holes by perimeter routing scheme. Such a scheme depletes the energy of nodes on the boundary of holes faster than others and is likely to result in earlier deaths, thus enlarging the hole sizes, a phenomenon we call the hole diffusion problem. Routing along the hole boundary may also lead to increased collisions especially if multiple data streams try to bypass a hole simultaneously. In this paper, we propose virtual circle based geometric modeling of holes for geographic routing to address these problems in wireless sensor networks. Our proposed algorithm avoids routing on the hole perimeter by selecting appropriate intermediate anchor nodes (close to the hole boundary) and routing via this anchor node. We show by simulation that our proposed algorithm provides significant savings in energy consumption, shorter routing delays, higher packet delivery ratio, all with comparable control overhead as compared with state-of-the-art techniques.	algorithm;download;geographic routing;geometric modeling;maxima and minima;network packet;overhead (computing);perimeter;simulation	Fucai Yu;Younghwan Choi;Soochang Park;Euisin Lee;Ye Tian;Sang Ha Kim	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.427	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.750485088150542	80.76992860677178	23067

We present a cross-layer (device-circuit-architecture) approach to energy-efficient cache design using STT MRAM. At the device and circuit levels, we consider different genres of MTJs and bitcells, and evaluate their impact on the area, energy and performance of caches. In addition, we propose micro-architectural techniques viz. sequential cache read and partial cache line update, which exploit the non-volatility of STT MRAM to further improve energy efficiency of STT MRAM caches. A detailed comparison of STT MRAM caches with SRAM-based caches is also presented. Our results indicate that the proposed optimizations significantly enhance the efficiency of STT MRAM for designing lower level caches.	bit cell;magnetoresistive random-access memory;non-volatile memory;static random-access memory;viz: the computer game;volatility	Sang Phill Park;Sumeet Kumar Gupta;Niladri Narayan Mojumder;Anand Raghunathan;Kaushik Roy	2012	DAC Design Automation Conference 2012	10.1145/2228360.2228447	chip;system on a chip;embedded system;parallel computing;energy conservation;computer hardware;network switch;cache;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;efficient energy use;spin;memory;transistor;magnetoresistive random-access memory;integrated circuit design	EDA	17.059326231735717	60.63344251406801	23075

Mobile and battery-powered Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers, such as hand readers and smart phones, are are becoming increasingly attractive. These RFID readers require energy-efficient anti-collision protocols to minimize the tag collisions and to expand the reader's battery life. Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in RFID sensor networks with a growing number of RFID sensor tags. Thus, RFID application developers must be mindful of tag anti-collision protocols. Energy-efficient protocols involve a low reader energy consumption per tag. This work presents a thorough study of the reader energy consumption per tag and analyzes the main factor that affects this metric: the frame size update strategy. Using the conclusion of this analysis, the anti-collision protocol Energy-Aware Slotted Aloha (EASA) is presented to decrease the energy consumption per tag. The frame size update strategy of EASA is configured to minimize the energy consumption per tag. As a result, EASA presents an energy-aware frame. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated and compared with several state of the art Aloha-based anti-collision protocols based on the current RFID standard. Simulation results show that EASA, with an average of 15 mJ consumed per tag identified, achieves a 6% average improvement in the energy consumption per tag in relation to the strategies of the comparison.	capture effect;communications protocol;conflict (psychology);etsi satellite digital radio;electronic product code;mobile device;picrotoxin;power (psychology);protocols documentation;radio frequency identification device;radio-frequency identification;simulation;smartphone;smartphone;collision;disease transmission	Laura Arjona;Hugo Landaluce;Asier Perallos	2018		10.3390/s18061904	engineering;collision;computer engineering;electronic engineering	Mobile	10.735546936422953	81.86607307576794	23076

However, these systems still face a major energy issue that prevent their wide adoption. Indeed, in healthcare applications, continuous sampling and communication tasks quickly deplete sensors' battery reserves, and frequent battery replacement are not convenient. Therefore, there is a need to develop energy-efficient solutions for long-term monitoring applications in order to foster the acceptance of these technologies by the patients. In this paper, we present a new energy-efficient architecture for health monitoring where sensors send the sensed data mainly via the user mobile phone, but they have the possibility to send data to access points when they are available in the user environment. The objective of this strategy is to relieve a unique base station from receiving all the data, and it enables sensor nodes to select the best communication technology in terms of energy consumption. Contrary to existing approaches, our solution allows to optimize the lifetime of both the sensor and the base station. The simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively improves the energy efficiency of the system compared to traditional architectures where wearable sensors can only communicate with the user mobile phone.	activity recognition;end-to-end encryption;mobile phone;sampling (signal processing);sensor node;simulation;user interface;wearable computer;wireless access point	Tifenn Rault;Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah;Yacine Challal;Frédéric Marin	2014	2014 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2014.7020803	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile station;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.10984599133373	75.15200108894715	23094

Numerical results show that CSMA/CA mechanism is not suitable for medium and low traffic BNs, and high traffic BNs encounter heavy collision problems. This suggests the use of a TDMA-based solution that can solve a range of problems including traffic heterogeneity and correlation problems.	numerical analysis;numerical method	Sana Ullah;Daehan Kwak;Cheolhyo Lee;Hyung-Soo Lee;Kyung Sup Kwak	2009	2009 2nd International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2009.5304962	wireless ad hoc network;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;computer security;time division multiple access;wireless;computer network	HPC	10.343517834316048	85.83837420368192	23105

Motivated by the data correlation in dense WSNs, asynchronous sampling strategies assign time shifts to nodes' sampling moments to obtain asynchronous sensory data, which is proved to contain more information than the synchronous sensory data at the same sampling rate. Regarding event report scenario, the proposed active MAC protocol adopts the optimal random slot selection probability not only for the medium access control but also for the sampling moments of nodes. By forming an asynchronous architecture of WSNs, the approach is able to achieve energy efficiency for data gathering applications and event detection applications, respectively.	access control;sampling (signal processing)	Jing Wang	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications	10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912821	asynchronous system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;asynchronous communication;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer network;synchronizer	Embedded	10.618172741247843	81.96016912227226	23139

We provide its theoretical description as well as simulation results according to a park cleaning scenario. Results show that time synchronization has a limited impact on the efficiency of our collaborative system.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;bluetooth;distributed computing;emulator;hoc (programming language);m.u.g.e.n;mobile robot;plasma cleaning;prototype;requirement;simulation;sputter cleaning;swarm;unmanned aerial vehicle;virtual machine	Vincent Autefage;Serge Chaumette;Damien Magoni	2015	2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)	10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194117	vehicular ad hoc network;real-time computing;simulation;mobile ad hoc network;geography;distributed computing;data synchronization;mobile computing	Robotics	3.8156660823853086	78.66385875096775	23195

If there are no ACKs from other candidates, instead of sending ACK immediately, the candidate broadcasts ACK and transmits the packet at transmission-probability.

While several studies have advocated features of both techniques (not without running up against contradicting arguments) a comprehensive study that aligns these results is still lacking. This paper aims at filling this gap. We present an experimental test bed setup used to perform extensive measurements for both single-channel and multichannel communication. We first analyze single-channel and multichannel communication over a single-hop in terms of packet reception ratio, maximum burst loss, temporal correlation of losses, and loss correlations across channels. Results show that multichannel communication with channel hopping significantly reduces link burstiness and packet loss correlation. For multi-hop networks, multi-channel communication and adaptive routing show similar end-to-end reliability in dense topologies, while multichannel communication can outperform adaptive routing in sparse networks with bursty links.	align (company);end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;interference (communication);long-term support;network packet;routing;sparse matrix;testbed	António Gonga;Olaf Landsiedel;Pablo Soldati;Mikael Johansson	2012	2012 IEEE 8th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems	10.1109/DCOSS.2012.15	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	7.602132161729581	86.66260222223981	23290

That results in frequent location update and consequently higher signaling cost. Among various schemes proposed for improving the efficiency of location management, the distance-based and the direction-based location update methods work well for just certain mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a hybrid location update (HLU) scheme, which takes into account both the moving distance and the moving direction when deciding on updating the location. We analyze the performance of the HLU under different mobility patterns and call-to-mobility ratios based on a 2D Markov walk model. The numerical results demonstrate that the HLU scheme can achieve better performance than the distance-based or the direction-based methods applied individually.		Jun Zheng;Emma E.

6ddaaa99480a1a255088b397d09f69ec70686ef7	a scalable multi-target tracking algorithm for wireless sensor networks		Multi-target tracking is a representative real-time application of sensor networks as it exhibits different aspects of sensor networks such as event detection, sensor information fusion, multihop communication, sensor management, and real-time decision making. The task of tracking multiple objects in a wireless sensor network is challenging due to constraints on a sensor node such as short communication and sensing ranges, a limited amount of memory, and limited computational power. In addition, since a sensor network surveillance system needs to operate autonomously without human operators, it requires an autonomous realtime tracking algorithm which can track an unknown number of targets. In this paper, we develop a scalable real-time multi-target tracking algorithm that is autonomous and robust against transmission failures, communication delays, and sensor localization error. The algorithm is based on a rigorous probabilistic model and an approximation scheme for the optimal Bayesian filter. In particular, an extensive simulation study shows that there is no performance loss up to an average localization error of 0.7 times the separation between sensors and the algorithm tolerates up to 50% lost-to-total packet ratio and 90% delayed-to-total packet ratio. The proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to real-time multi-target tracking problems using wireless sensor networks.	algorithm;approximation;autonomous robot;bayesian network;clock rate;computation;computer and network surveillance;end-to-end principle;network packet;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time locating system;scalability;sensor node;simulation;statistical model;supernode (circuit);terminate (software)	Songhwai Oh	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/938521	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;soft sensor;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;visual sensor network	Mobile	14.035830166690419	77.35504241221402	23371

We consider the case where data at nodes is lossy coded with high-resolution, and the information measured by the nodes should be available at the sink within certain total and individual distortion bounds. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal transmission structure and the rate-distortion allocations at the various spatially located nodes, such as to minimize the total power consumption cost of the network. We prove that the optimal transmission structure is the shortest path tree and that the problems of rate and distortion allocation separate in the high-resolution case, namely, we first find the distortion allocation as a function of the transmission structure, and then the rate allocation is computed. Then, we also study the case when the node positions can be chosen, by finding the optimal node placement when two different targets of interest are considered, namely total power minimization and network lifetime extension.	distortion;experiment;image resolution;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;shortest path problem	Razvan Cristescu;Baltasar Beferull-Lozano	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2006.874536	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics	ECom	15.870126680332131	80.46540369475312	23399

The measurement of soft-error tolerance of devices is one of key technologies to guarantee quality reliability. The conventional measurement methods require high-energy neutron beam. In this paper, we propose a method to measure soft-error rate in terrestrial environment irradiating with a low-energy neutron beam. Our proposed method requires low-energy neutron beam whose energy is less than 40MeV and the measurement cost can be reduced comparing the conventional methods. Our proposed method is applied to FPGAs fabricated in 90nm, 65nm, 40nm, and 28nm processes, and results of our proposed method are compared with those of conventional methods.

475f4bb2277476b1f9bd29292bb91dbb195b62f3	delay tolerant networking over the metropolitan public transportation		In this paper we discuss MDTN: a delay tolerant application platform built on top of the Public Transportation System (PTS) and providing service access while exploiting opportunistic connectivity. Our solution adopts a carrier-based approach where buses act as data collectors for user requests requiring Internet access. Simulations based on real maps and PTS routes, with state of the art routing protocols demonstrate that MDTN represents a viable solution for elastic non real-time service delivery. Nevertheless, performance indexes of the considered routing policies show that there is no golden rule for optimal performance and a tailored routing strategy is required for each specific case.	algorithm;computer simulation;data retrieval;delay-tolerant networking;itil;information system;internet access;pts-dos;performance;provisioning;real-time clock;real-time data;routing	Armir Bujari;Sabrina Gaito;Dario Maggiorini;Claudio E.

Well-designed flow-control mechanism should provide efficient allocation of the communicational resources in wide variety of interconnection networks. The goal of this paper is to suggest a highly effective “Step-Back-on-Blocking” buffered flow control. The proposed flow-control mechanism combines the advantages of the Wormhole and Virtual-Cut Through flow controls, whilst adds a means for adaptive allocation of the communicational resources. The “Step-Back-on-Blocking” flow control provides low message latency and achieves high fraction of the channel bandwidth by performing conditional evasion of temporary blocked network resources. The effectiveness of the proposed flow control has been evaluated on the basis of numerous experiments conducted in OMNet++ discrete event simulation environment.	blocking (computing);control flow;dinic's algorithm;evasion (network security);experiment;flow control (data);interconnection;maximal set;multi-commodity flow problem;network packet;simulation;throughput;while	Plamenka Borovska;Dragi Kimovski	2013	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-013-1041-5	parallel computing;real-time computing;resource allocation;computer science;deadlock;flow control;distributed computing;programming language;computer network	Arch	-1.8725164616814705	69.346788155123	23493

However, there still are several problems of in-time multimedia delivery in P2P-MANET: (1) MANET mobility influences the maintenance of P2P overlay. (2) P2P overlay is not proximal to MANET topology, this leads to the inefficient streaming delivery. (3) The unreliable wireless connection leads to the difficulty of multi-source P2P group conferencing. Therefore, P2P conferencing cannot work well on MANET. To overcome the above disadvantages, in this paper, we present a cross-layer P2P group conferencing mechanism over MANET, called RING (Real-time Intercommunication Network Gossip). The RING uses the ring overlay to manage peers and utilizes the cross-layer mechanism to force the ring overlay to be proximal to MANET topology. Therefore, RING can lead efficient in-time multimedia streaming delivery. On the other hand, the ring overlay can deal with peer joining/leaving fast and simply, and improves the delivery efficiency with the minimum signaling overhead. Through mathematical theory and a series of experiments, we demonstrate that RING is workable and it can shorten the source-toend delay with minimal signaling overhead. key words: group conference, P2P-MANET, cross-layer design, wireless ad hoc, P2P live streaming, real-time multimedia service	experiment;hoc (programming language);multi-source;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;real-time transcription;streaming media	Jun-Li Kuo;Chen-Hua Shih;Cheng-Yuan Ho;Ming-Ching Wang;Yaw-Chung Chen	2012	IEICE Transactions	10.1587/transcom.E95.B.2759	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-0.005463187745997367	83.90401363995193	23506

Similar to previous designs, a cell, i, is used to obtain a measure of the difference in period of four ring oscillators and obtain the residue Ri, a random variable. Experiments show it is normally distributed with a mean of 0. A binary output value of 0 or 1 assigned depending on the sign of Ri. When |E(Ri)| is large, this scheme consistently gives the same output. Unfortunately, when it is small, the repeatability is compromised, particularly when variations in operating conditions such as supply voltage and temperature are also taken into account, which is a common problem for all previous works. To address this problem, we propose a cell with configurable ring oscillators together with an orthogonal re-initialisation scheme. Together, these two techniques maximise repeatability by causing the distribution of the mean of different Ri's to change from normal to bimodal. We implement this design in the Xilinx Spartan-3e FPGA. Nine FPGA chips are tested, and experimental results show that the new method significantly enhances reliability of ID generation and tolerance to environmental changes. Bit flip rate is reduced from 1.5% to approximately 0 at a fixed supply voltage and room temperature. Over the 20 – 80°C temperature range, and a 25% variation in supply voltage, the bit flip rate is reduced from 1.56% to 3.125 } 10−7, which is a 50000x improvement.	application-specific integrated circuit;control theory;countermeasure (computer);digital electronics;experiment;field-programmable gate array;parameter (computer programming);physical unclonable function;repeatability;ring oscillator;semiconductor device;side-channel attack	Haile Yu;Philip Heng Wai Leong;Qiang Xu	2010	2010 International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology	10.1109/FPT.2010.5681438	normal distribution;chip;random variable;embedded system;physical unclonable function;real-time computing;environmental change;computer science;ring oscillator;operant conditioning;oscillation;room temperature;field-programmable gate array	EDA	14.216308184710526	63.27037980427848	23510

Nodes are classified as sensor nodes and routers. Some nodes act both as sensors and routers. While traditional MAC protocols must balance between throughput, delay, and fairness concerns, WSN MAC protocols place an emphasis on energy efficiency as well. Schedule-based MAC protocols have been proposed for WSN. A common theme through all these protocols is putting radios to a low-power """"sleep mode"""" either periodically or whenever possible when a node is neither receiving nor transmitting. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the Neighbor-Aware Clusterhead (NAC) under different sleep scheduling protocols. We study the characteristics and performance of the NAC protocol by means of simulation. In NAC protocol, nodes are synchronized with their clusterheads and are allowed to go into asleep mode. The simulation provides a promising results that makes NAC protocol to be considered as a good candidate protocol for sensor network (SNET)."""	bonjour sleep proxy;care-of address;centralized computing;communications protocol;d-mac;fairness measure;low-power broadcasting;randomness;router (computing);scheduling (computing);sensor;sid meier's alpha centauri;simulation;sleep mode;streaming media;throughput;transmitter	Tarek R.

Currently MANETs possess an advanced challenge in providing Quality of Service( QoS) support for real time application data streaming through the network. These applications are delay sensitive and get affected due to congestion in the network. Thus, performance degrades due to high data loss, frequent link breakage and excessive retransmission. The strict layered network structure makes even more difficult to provide solutions for such issues. We propose a protocol which cooperates between adjacent layers and performs cross layer communication. We propose a novel QoS routing for MANET called Cross Layer Best effort QoS aware routing protocol (CLBQ) which considers the metric of link quality, data rates and MAC delay as the QoS parameters. The proposed protocol implements cross layer interaction between PHY, MAC and Network layer. The simulation results conducted shows best effort QoS service to the network in discovering the route and data transfer. Our analysis shows that the protocol has improved throughput and low network overhead.	best-effort delivery;data rate units;end-to-end principle;feedback;hoc (programming language);network congestion;network packet;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);phy (chip);quality of service;queuing delay;requirement;retransmission (data networks);routing;self-organization;simulation;throughput	Mahadev A.

86879e88bb66f91a8e343d8096cad5fcedf1ca1d	a new movement authority based on vehicle-centric communication		The communication system that is presently applied in the European Train Control System can only support data exchange between vehicles and ground, but the direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication is not available. The details of interlocking information and other vehicles’ movements are invisible to drivers who are the last defense to prevent unsafe scenarios. As connected vehicles have been envisioned to enhance transportation efficiency and improve safety, the direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication network is involved in this paper to increase the safety of railway transport. In this paper, a new train movement authority (MA+) is proposed. Apart from a wireless communication unit, this system does not require any other infrastructure. With the assistance of vehiclecentric communication technology, MA+ can detect the condition of switches and trains within a certain scope. In this paper, the system structure of MA+ is proposed. Additionally, different implementation scenarios are also discussed. The detection range is estimated and validated based onmathematical calculation and experimental equations. An application demo ofMA+ is presented on the Driver Machine Interface of the onboard equipment. The results indicate that MA+ can be a flexible and scalable system for furthering the improvement of railway safety.

In this paper, we propose an energy considered routing protocol (ECRP) for FSOSNs. The ECRP is seeking for a more evenly distributed energy load among sensors by providing each node a set of next hop candidates to communicate with the base station (BS) through the shortest hop path. An energy model is set up, and the performance of ECRP is evaluated and compared with simple-link protocol in terms of connectivity, the number of living nodes, and packet delivery ratio by OPNET simulation.	network packet;radio frequency;routing;sensor;simulation;telecommunications link;vii	Rong Xie;Fei Tong;Won-Hyuk Yang;Young-Chon Kim	2011	2011 4th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security	10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720628	embedded system;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	7.063894897267937	80.94833983118546	23865

In such networks, each node is equipped with a practical smart antenna array that can be configured to support multiple beams with adjustable orientation and beamwidth. The special case of this optimization problem in networks with single beams have been extensively studied and shown to be NP-hard. In this paper, we provide a globally optimal solution to this problem by developing a general MILP formulation that can apply to various configurable antenna models, many of which are not supported by the existing formulations. The multicast lifetime capacity is then quantitively studied by simulations. The experimental results show that using two-beam antennas can exploit most lifetime capacity of the networks for multicast communications.

On scalable parallel computers, it is often implemented as a collective communication with a reduction operation followed by a distribution operation. In this paper, we introduce a systematic way of generating efficient algorithms to perform barrier synchronization in mesh networks. The scheme works with any base routing algorithm derivable from the turn model [1]. Our scheme extends the turn grouping method proposed in [9] with two new algorithms, Tail to Central and Central to Tail, for scheduling the message transmission in the reduction and distribution phase respectively. Simulation results show that our approach can take advantage of the adaptivity of the turnmodel based routing algorithms and outperform methods proposed previously.	algorithm;barrier (computer science);computer;mesh networking;parallel computing;performance evaluation;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;xslt/muenchian grouping	Kuo-Pao Fan;Chung-Ta King	1997		10.1109/ICPP.1997.622588	parallel computing;concurrent computing;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	-1.740963258150646	71.64971532952326	23877

To decrease the cost of accessing these data, arranging replicas of data so that the distance between the consumer nodes and replica holder nodes decreases is desirable. Conventional schemes, however, are costly for updating the replicas even if they are not often used or do not support functions for ensuring their consistency. We propose a novel replica arrangement scheme, which adaptively arranges replicas at positions close to nodes for frequent sending of queries. Instead of arranging many replicas on sensor nodes, our scheme consists of nodes with pointers that point to the replica holder nodes in order to save storage for replicas. The pointers, which are smaller than replicas, are arranged so that nodes are in circular arcs surrounding the location where the original data item is associated. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms conventional replica arrangement schemes in terms of the cost required for sending queries and replies with sufficiently low replica update cost.	attribute–value pair;data item;pointer (computer programming);simulation	Susumu Ishihara;Tatsuya Suda	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199409	wireless sensor network;computer science;database;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	9.264934860130136	75.94009982291551	23916

However, even with some proposed optimization techniques, there is still space for improving the performance. In this paper, we present a novel mailbox-based scheme to further improve the performance. In this scheme, each mobile node migrating to a foreign network is associated with a mailbox. A sender sends packets to the receiver's mailbox, which will in turn forward them to the destination. During handoff, a mobile node can decide whether to move its mailbox and report the handoff to the home agent, or simply to report the handoff to the mailbox. In this way, the scheme is adaptive and can be made to reduce the workload on the home agent and minimize the total cost of message delivery and mobility management. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we develop a performance model considering two walk models for mobile nodes, based on which the cost function is derived. We also propose an iterative algorithm for deriving an optimal point where the cost function reaches its minimum. The results show that our new scheme can outperform mobile IP route optimization with smooth handoff extension, no matter how many packets are to be received during each migration.	algorithm;internet;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;network packet;performance evaluation	Jiannong Cao;Liang Zhang;Sajal K.

There is a common-memory architecture called “Cyclic Memory” because the data is refreshed periodically, which is well known in the field of real-time systems. IEEE1394 has been drawing considerable attention as the need for connecting audiohisual electronics with a unijied fast interface increases. We discuss the feasibility of Cyclic Memory on the IEEE1394 with its Isochronous mode. By analyzing the requirements of two prototypical applications, we evaluate the performance and other capabilities of IEEE1394 and the other networks that have the functionality of Cyclic Memory, and discuss their applicability. We also discuss the network reliability based on IEEE1394 when it is applied to an actual motion control system.	arcade game;control system;graphics;ieee 1394;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement	Koji Matsuda;Kang G.

Traditional shortest path routing uses only the static topological information as input, whereas deflection routing takes into account the dynamic queue length information. In the simplest form of deflection routing, a packet being dropped due to queue buffer overflow is """"rescued"""" and is rerouted to other links. Deflection routing can thus reduce the rate of packet drops and allow a network to carry more packets without the need of additional bandwidth. However, it can also lead to unstable deflecting behavior in some congestion scenario. It is important to study deflection behavior when operating near the point of congestion. In this paper, the performance in terms of packet drop rate and traveling time are studied through extensive simulation, and complex behavior in the traffic with self-similarity property is observed and discussed."""	routing	Wilson Wang-Kit Thong;Guanrong Chen	2012	I.

Multicast data is assumed to be layered cumulatively. The multicast tree constructed fulfills the QoS requirements imposed by heterogeneous receivers in terms of the layer of the data and its corresponding bandwidth, and consumes network resource as little as possible. Besides the general state information of the topology and the available bandwidth, two kinds of group-specific state information such as the distribution of multicast tree and the highest receivable layer of on-tree nodes are maintained at a router to calculate a feasible graft path to the multicast tree.

To achieve this goal, we propose a novel approach to dynamically adjust the system's performance level such that energy neutral operation, and thus long-term uninterrupted operation can be achieved. We first consider the annual dynamics of the energy source to design an appropriate power subsystem (i.e., solar panel size and energy store capacity), and then dynamically compute the long-term sustainable performance level at runtime. We show through trace-driven simulations using eleven years of real-world data that our approach outperforms existing predictive, e.g., EWMA, WCMA, and reactive, e.g., ENO-MAX, approaches in terms of average performance level by up to 177%, while reducing duty-cycle variance by up to three orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate the benefits of the dynamic power management scheme using a wireless sensor system deployed for environmental monitoring in a remote, high-alpine environment as a case study. A performance evaluation over two years reveals that the dynamic power management scheme achieves a two-fold improvement in system utility when compared to only applying appropriate capacity planning.	alpine;best, worst and average case;downtime;duty cycle;end-to-end principle;max;performance evaluation;power management;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;software deployment	Bernhard Buchli;Felix Sutton;Jan Beutel;Lothar Thiele	2014		10.1145/2668332.2668333	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science	Mobile	9.48462274969765	72.00801305057686	24372

In these networks energy, computing power and communication bandwidth are scarce. In this paper, we consider a randomly deployed sensor network with sensors acting as a set of distributed datasets. Each dataset is assumed to have its local temporal dataset, along with spatial data and the geographical coordinates of a given object. An approach towards mines global temporal patterns from these datasets and to discovers nonlinear trajectories of a moving object is proposed.

In a community WMN, all mesh routers may not be managed by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Limited capacity of wireless channels and lack of a single trusted authority in such networks can motivate mesh routers to behave selfishly by dropping relay traffic in order to provide a higher throughput to their own users. Existing solutions for stimulating cooperation in multi-hop networks use promiscuous monitoring or exchange probe packets to detect selfish nodes and apply virtual currency mechanism to compensate the cooperating nodes. These schemes fail to operate well when applied to WMNs which have a multi-radio environment with a relatively static topology. In this paper we, propose architecture for a community WMN which can detect selfish behaviour in the network and enforce cooperation among mesh routers. The architecture adopts a decentralized detection scheme by dividing the mesh routers into manageable clusters. Monitoring agents hosted on managed mesh routers monitor the behaviour of mesh routers in their cluster by collecting periodic reports and sending them to the sink agents hosted at the mesh gateways. To make the detection more accurate we consider the quality of wireless links. We present experimental results that evaluate the performance of our scheme. 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.	autonomic computing;experiment;mesh networking;relay;router (computing);scalability;sensor;simulation;throughput;virtual currency;wireless mesh network	Nikhil Saxena;Mieso K.

More recently, deadlock recovery strategies have begun to gain acceptance. Progressive deadlock recovery techniques are very attractive because they allocate a few dedicated resources to quickly deliver deadlocked messages, instead of killing them. However, the distributed deadlock detection techniques proposed up to now detect many false deadlocks, especially when the network is heavily loaded and messages have different lengths. As a consequence, messages detected as deadlocked may saturate the bandwidth offered by recovery resources, thus degrading performance considerably. In this paper we propose an improved distributed deadlock detection mechanism that uses only local information, detects all the deadlocks, considerably reduces the probability of false deadlock detection and is not strongly affected by variations in message length and message destination distribution.	algorithm;critical path method;deadlock;routing;sensor;timeout (computing);wormhole switching	Pedro López;Juan Miguel Martínez;José Duato	1998		10.1109/HPCA.1998.650546	real-time computing;computer science;deadlock;distributed computing;edge chasing;deadlock prevention algorithms;computer network	DB	-2.011035099076884	69.05282561496345	24558
0208e767cc804e7bda65befe1f1381272079a80f	data forwarding with finite buffer capacity in opportunistic networks		The opportunistic networks evolved from mobile ad hoc networks cannot guarantee the existence of a complete network topology and end-to-end data forwarding paths. Routes are built dynamically, and any possible node can opportunistically be used as a next hop. The main challenge in opportunistic networks is to deliver messages with a minimum delay while maximizing delivery ratio. Replicating messages are thus used to hope that at least one of message replicas can reach to the destination. Most of existing replication studies, however, assume infinite buffer to store messages, which is infeasible. In this paper, we eliminate this assumption and let all nodes in a network have the minimum buffer capacity without loss of generality. Our approach selects a relay node that has a minimum drop with a maximum forward for replicating a message. When the buffer capacity of a node reaches to its upper limit, a message that has already been replicated multiple times will be dropped first. Simulation results show that our approach can attain a higher rate of successful message delivery as compared with Spray and Wait and Epidemic under SLAW mobility patterns in opportunistic networks.	apollonian network;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network topology;operand forwarding;relay;scheduling (computing);simulation	Mohd Yaseen Mir;Chih-Lin Hu;Sheng-Zhi Huang	2018	2018 27th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2018.8372708	computer network;hop (networking);mobile ad hoc network;without loss of generality;computer science;wireless;network topology;scheduling (computing);relay	Mobile	5.003073870307718	83.7489123299106	24593

For its NP-complete complexity, we propose an adjustable heuristic based on converting multiple QoS weights to a single metric with energy functions. By applying the breadth-first search (BFS) to Dijkstra's algorithm with adjustable depth, BFS _MCP (BFS for multi-constrained paths) can adjust its time complexity according to the CPU load on a router in real time. Thus, it has an extensive adaptability. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to performance evaluation by generating QoS constraints, named weight-proportion simulation. Generating QoS constraints similar to QoS applications, this method extends the original success ratio, only used in relative performance comparison, to the evaluation of absolute performance. By this method, extensive simulations show that BFS improves the performance greatly. The main contribution of the paper includes a heuristic for multi-constrained routing and a novel approach to performance evaluation.	routing	Yong Cui;Ke Xu;Jianping Wu	2003		10.1109/PCCC.2003.1203693	time complexity;real-time computing;the internet;next-generation network;dijkstra's algorithm;quality of service;breadth-first search;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;computer network;satisfiability	NLP	-3.6581505070805975	82.88246268013555	24640

However these energy efficient exclusive routings only maximize the utilization of ports, which may leave switches underutilized. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware energy efficient routing algorithm with SDN to minimize the overall energy for data center traffic in time dimension. With simulations implemented in OMNeT++, we show that our algorithm can reduce the overall energy with respect to the traffic volume and reduce the flow completion time on average.	algorithm;data center;dynamic circuit network;exclusive or;network switch;performance;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;software-defined networking;tcp congestion control;testbed;throughput	Guan Xu;Bin Dai;Benxiong Huang;Jun Yang	2015	2015 IEEE 17th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications, 2015 IEEE 7th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security, and 2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems	10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.12	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing domain;algorithm design;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;big data;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;network switch;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;software-defined networking;efficient energy use;link-state routing protocol;bandwidth;computer network	Embedded	-2.146032716588593	84.13836399907602	24646

This will require setting up of a network in an urban environment which not only provides the necessary services to the user but also ensures that the network is secure and energy efficient. In this paper, we propose a secure, energy efficient dynamic routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks in urban environments. A decision is made by every node based on various parameters like longevity, distance, battery power which measure the node and link quality to decide the next hop in the route. This ensures that the total load is distributed evenly while conserving the energy of battery-constrained nodes. The protocol also maintains a trusted population for each node through Dynamic Trust Factor (DTF) which ensures secure communication in the environment by gradually isolating the malicious nodes. The results obtained show that the proposed protocol when compared with another energy efficient protocol (MMBCR) and a widely accepted protocol (DSR) gives far better results in terms of energy efficiency. Similarly, it also outdoes a secure protocol (QDV) when it comes to detecting malicious nodes in the network.

In large scale wireless sensor networks, data aggregation is known as an effective technique to save the energy by a trade off between the complexity of local processing and the amount of data transmitted in networks. Normally, in cluster-based WSNs, the sensor node which is elected as the cluster head will become the aggregation point which has the responsibility to aggregate the data from cluster members. In this paper, we analyze the aggregation characteristic in a correlated data field, and then find out the optimal cluster radius for each sensor node in the case of that node has been elected as cluster head. Furthermore, we propose a novel network structure called Unbalanced Clustering (UBC) and compare it to a LEACH-like cluster based network and an equal-sized cluster based network to see how much energy UBC can save and the potentiality of making the energy dissemination among the sensor nodes more evenly.	aggregate data;algorithm;computer cluster;data aggregation;performance evaluation;review aggregator;routing;sensor node;simulation;unbalanced circuit	Fan Bai;Abbas Jamalipour	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664176	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.14361557666161	79.81593648812789	24709
4885ceeb3b839790630d05cef84c8ac40dedc8e0	dynamic power management and adaptive packet size selection for iot in e-healthcare		Wireless communications in e-healthcare must work in a reliable, fast and energy-efficient fashion. In this paper, first, a power level decision (PLD) algorithm is proposed to select the optimal power level for each node, which enables the minimum energy consumption on transmitting data per bit. Second, a power level and packet size decision (PPD) algorithm is presented to decide the optimal packet size, by either minimizing the delay at a prescribed transmission power or minimizing energy consumption with a prescribed delay. Third, a global link decision (GLD) scheme is devised to improve overall reliability and decrease overall delay simultaneously through raising availability of battery energy within nodes. Theoretical analysis demonstrated the validity of the GLD scheme. Moreover, experimental results show that the GLD scheme improves the transmission reliability by 8.70% and decreases the delay by 7.74%, without reducing the network lifetime, which was not achieved in previous research studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The key idea underlying this proposed algorithm is to provide the optimal transmission range for secondary users (SUs) to minimize the power consumption of the overall CRNs. Since energy efficiency is a key factor to consider in designing a node in the CRNs, location information of primary users (PUs) and SUs is valuable to calculate the optimal transmission range so that a spectrally efficient CRN can opportunistically take advantage of the spectrum with no or little interference to the PUs. In addition, the optimal positions of the SUs with known location are determined to improve the final localization accuracy for the whole CRN, which enables the optimal transmission range to be obtained. Thereby, the users in the CRN are localized with minimum energy consumption for a given target root mean square error. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by showing the optimal transmission range for various number of users in the network.	algorithm;cognitive radio;image scaling;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;mean squared error;multidimensional scaling;procrustes analysis;simulation	Nasir Saeed;Haewoon Nam	2017	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2712802	computer network;real-time computing;cognitive radio;computer science;efficient energy use;energy consumption;algorithm;mean squared error;root mean square	Mobile	15.074404035177247	79.69387384576814	24838

Each node in the given network is associated with a connection delay which can be reduced by implementing upgrading actions. For each upgrading action a cost must be paid, and the sum must satisfy a budget constraint. Given a fixed budget, the goal is to choose a set of upgrading actions such that the total delay of establishing paths among predefined node pairs is minimized. This model has applications in areas like multicast communication planning and wildlife reserve design.

We have carried out a set of injection experiments (with 3000 injections each), injecting transient faults of types stuck-at, bit-flip, indetermination and delay on both the signals and variables of the system, running two different workloads. We have analysed the pathology of the propagated errors, measured their latency, and calculated both detection and recovery coverage.

Actually most of these systems use 2.4GHz band with proprietary radio transceivers and leaky feeder as distribution system. All them demand a high QoS radio network to improve the efficiency of railway networks. We present narrow band, broad band and data correlated measurements taken in Madrid underground with a transmission system at 2.4 GHz in a test network of 2 km length in subway tunnels. The architecture proposed has a strong overlap in between cells to improve reliability and QoS. The radio planning of the network is carefully described and modeled with narrow band and broadband measurements and statistics. The result is a network with 99.7% of packets transmitted correctly and average propagation delay of 20ms.

As the wireless vehicular environment is very challenging, it is crucial to test and evaluate the performance of DSRC communications in real conditions through experimental tests. Yet, DSRC communications have been evaluated independently from vehicles, and precise knowledge related to vehicular integration effects (i.e. cable/connector loss, antenna placement, vehicle geometry, etc) on DSRC communications still lacks. In this paper, we measure aspects of vehicular integration influencing DSRC communication in field experimental tests. Considering a global link budget, we illustrate the non-negligible impacts of cable, connectors, hardware, or roof types and antenna design on the communication range. We also measure their influence on the wireless channel and show that a reasonable distance between vehicles and radio obstacles, or metallic side-reflector improve communication range. Applying these results to a Road Hazard Warning application, we illustrate that, while vehicular integration affects its performance, wireless channel effects, in particular side reflectors, partially compensate them.	angularjs;chipset;experiment;hood method;information exchange;silk road	Jerome Haerri;Hugues Tchouankem;Oliver Klemp;Oleksandr Demchenko	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554810	embedded system;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;antenna;vehicular communication systems;computer network	Mobile	23.777091669431318	78.53417541648366	25132

These applications need to store and transmit sensitive or secret data, which requires intrusion detection mechanisms be deployed to ensure sensor node health, as well as to maintain quality of service and survivability. Because wireless sensors have inherent resource constraints, it is crucial to reduce energy consumption due to intrusion detection activities. In this paper by means of a probability model, we analyze the best frequency at which intrusion detection based on probabilistic code attestation on the sensor node should be performed so that the sensor reliability is maximized by exploiting the trade-off between the energy consumption and intrusion detection effectiveness. When given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational and networking conditions, a sensor can dynamically set its intrusion detection rate identified by the mathematical model to maximize its reliability and the expected sensor lifetime.	intrusion detection system;mathematical model;quality of service;sensor node	Ing-Ray Chen;Ding-Chau Wang	2009	2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks	10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.36	embedded system;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Security	10.665683648041	75.84394026621086	25134

The former usually aims at considering how to allocate a certain number of sensor devices in a sensing region to form a WSN so that the objective function value (e.g., the network connectivity or the network lifetime) of the constructed network is optimized. For the message routing problem in WSNs, researchers tend to consider how to find an energy conservable message transmission routing scheme for notifying the supervisor of the WSN when an event occurs. Till now, many solutions have been proposed for the above two categories of optimization problems. However, unifying the above two network optimization problems to maximize the network lifetime, to the best of our knowledge, still lacks related research. This paper considers a joint optimization problem for energy allocation and energy-aware routing called the joint optimization of energy allocation and routing problem (JOEARP) for a hierarchical cluster-based WSN. We propose an exact algorithm to provide the optimum solution for the JOEARP. The simulation results show that this solution performed better in prolonging the network lifetime of a WSN in a real situation, compared to other compositions of conventional energy allocation schemes with some known routing algorithms.

Traditional neighbor discovery protocols mainly focus on static wireless networks or networkswhere all nodes operate on the same frequency.However, the proliferation ofmobile devices andmultichannel communications post new challenges to neighbor discovery problem. In this paper, we present a neighbor discovery protocol named EasiND for asynchronous duty-cycledmultichannelmobileWSNs. First, we propose a neighbor discovery system based on quorum system, which can bound the discovery latency in multichannel scenarios with low power consumptions. Second, we design an optimal asynchronous neighbor discovery system for multichannel mobile WSNs based on cyclic difference set. It is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the power consumption with bounded discovery latency under desired duty cycles. Finally, we validate the performance of EasiND through both theoretical analysis and test-bed evaluations. EasiND provides a 33.3% reduction in powerlatency product in theory compared to U-Connect. Meanwhile, test-bed evaluation results show that EasiND decreases average discovery latency by up to 86% compared to U-Connect and achieves at least 93.5% average fraction of discoveries in a predefined time limitation under various network conditions.	discovery system;quorum (distributed computing);testbed	Tingpei Huang;Haiming Chen;Li Cui;Yuqing Zhang	2013	IJDSN	10.1155/2013/403165	neighbor discovery protocol;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	11.162453721395286	81.96384744834727	25150

For multicasting applications which need large amounts of data, it is important to minimize the total amount of resources consumed on the multicast tree. The greedy multicasting algorithm was proposed by Imase and Waxman as a solution to this problem for the case where receivers can join the multicast group in a dynamic fashion. The greedy algorithm is simple to implement, and is known to be much better than shortest path based strategies such as DVMRP, CBT, and PIM in the worst case. We give both theoretical and simulation results demonstrating that the greedy multicast routing algorithm proposed by Imase and Waxman is much superior to shortest path based strategies even in realistic scenarios and not just for worst case inputs. However, the greedy algorithm does not work well for delay sensitive applications, and does not do a good job of handling deletions from the multicast group. We show how the greedy algorithm can be modified to handle deletions. We also adapt the greedy algorithm for delay sensitive applications. Our adapted algorithm is simple and efficient to implement, and, unlike previous work, gives worst case guarantees for both the delay encountered by each receiver as well as the total cost of the multicast tree. We give extensive simulation results comparing our algorithm with the greedy algorithm as well as with shortest path based strategies. We also describe our experience with implementing the greedy algorithm in an application-switched multicasting system.	best, worst and average case;core-based trees;docsis set-top gateway;greedy algorithm;multicast;online algorithm;overhead (computing);routing;shortest path problem;simulation;steiner tree problem;time complexity	Ashish Goel;Kamesh Munagala	2002	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-001-0122-7	mathematical optimization;greedy algorithm;kruskal's algorithm;multicast;tree rotation;the internet;spanning tree;steiner tree problem;prim's algorithm;computer science;minimum spanning tree;range tree;gomory–hu tree;k-ary tree;interval tree;k-minimum spanning tree;mathematics;distributed computing;search tree;shortest path problem;service quality;k shortest path routing;algorithm;shortest-path tree;computer network	Theory	-3.8616331962726194	77.61007955221018	25224

Although WSNs can provide continuous sensor readings, the battery, computation and communication resources are limited in wireless sensors. Recently, mobile phones have been suggested to be utilized as sensors in various participatory sensing campaigns. However, it is hard to guarantee the sensing quality due to the mobility and sensing quality of individual mobile participants. In this paper, we consider a collaborative sensing paradigm which utilizes both mobile phones and stationary sensors to perform sensing. It enables mobile phones and stationary sensors to complement each other in order to achieve better overall sensing quality and reduce the energy consumption of wireless sensors. We propose an adaptive collaborative sensing algorithm that can coordinate sensing among the available mobile users and the stationary sensors in the area of interest. Mobile phones are given higher priority to perform sensing, while stationary sensors will be enabled if the required sensing quality is not reached. Our algorithm is adaptive to the mobility and sensing quality of the mobile phones, as well as the unusual events in the environment. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the sensing quality, the number of mobile phones and stationary sensors enabled with our algorithm.	algorithm;computation;computer simulation;habitat;mobile phone;participatory sensing;programming paradigm;sensor;stationary process	Edith C.-H.

However, due to the dynamic network topology, high propagation delay and limited resource of satellite network, many great challenges have emerged in designing routing mechanism for it. In this paper, we propose a satellite network routing mechanism based on Dijkstra algorithm for multi-layer satellite network. By considering QoS requirements, service pricing, life cycle and load balance together, we first design an evaluation index, which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the alternative route. Then we utilize the Dijkstra algorithm to select the best path for satellite network. Finally, we evaluate the proposed mechanism on the model of multi-layer satellite network and verify it from many aspects. Evaluation results show that our routing mechanism is feasible and effective.	dijkstra's algorithm;routing	Yinchu Sun;Xingwei Wang;Fuliang Li;Min Huang	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22053-6_61	private network-to-network interface;routing table;is-is;suurballe's algorithm;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;dijkstra's algorithm;hierarchical routing;computer science;pathfinding;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;machine learning;yen's algorithm;distributed computing;order one network protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;k shortest path routing	Robotics	-3.6064530880502734	83.09518396147779	25405

Fundamental differences between underwater acoustic propagation and terrestrial radio propagation call for new criteria for the design of networking protocols. In this paper, we focus on one of these fundamental differences, namely the dependence of usable bandwidth on transmission distance. The main contribution of this work is an in-depth analysis of the impacts of this unique relationship. Furthermore, the relationship between the energy consumptions of acoustic modems in various modes (i.e., transmit, receive, and idle) is different than that of their terrestrial radio counterparts, which also impacts the design of energy-efficient protocols. We present novel insights that are useful in guiding both protocol design and network deployment. We design an energy-efficient routing protocol for underwater sensor networks based on the insights gained in our analysis. This protocol is tested in a number of relevant network scenarios, and shown to significantly outperform greedy minimum link energy protocols, and to provide near optimal total path energy consumption. Finally, we implemented the underwater acoustic channel model in ns2 and used it to analyze the impact of multiple flows on our routing protocol's performance.	acoustic cryptanalysis;channel (communications);communications protocol;greedy algorithm;modem;routing;software deployment;software propagation;terrestrial television	Albert F.

In this paper, we propose a joint localization algorithm that utilizes the position of a mobile sink, e.g., a vehicle, and of the neighbor nodes to estimate the position of nodes with no GPS modules. A data dissemination algorithm is proposed based on the well-known Greedy Geographic Forwarding (GGF) algorithm by combining the position of the neighbors and their remaining power when deciding where to send a packet to. The concept of bridges is also introduced, in which the sink compares its current position with previous positions and calculates whether there is a shortest path in order to create a bridge that will reduce the number of hops a packet has to travel through. According to our performance evaluation experiments, LOGR shows a slight improvement on network lifetime compared to GGF, while keeping similar delivery ratio performance. Including the power level of nodes in the forwarding decision equation tends to increase the path length to the sink. However, results show that bridges can minimize this increase by shortening the path.	experiment;geographic routing;global positioning system;greedy algorithm;network packet;performance evaluation;sensor;shortest path problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mauricio Bertanha;Richard Werner Nelem Pazzi	2016		10.1145/2989275.2989279	geography;telecommunications;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	6.700914243020638	81.42666509997517	25428

FPGA prototyping has provided a proof-of-concept, showing that the BR-PUF could be a promising candidate for strong PUFs. However, due to the limitations (device resources, placement and routing) of FPGA prototyping, the effectiveness of a practical ASIC implementation of the BR-PUF could not be validated. This paper characterizes the BR-PUF further through transistor-level simulations. Based on process variation, mismatch, and noise models provided or suggested by industry, these simulations are able to provide predictions on the figures-of-merit of ASIC implementations of the BR-PUF. This paper also suggests a more secure way of using the BR-PUF based on its supply voltage sensitivity.	application-specific integrated circuit;cryptography;fpga prototyping;field-programmable gate array;haplogroup bt;place and route;routing;simulation;transistor	Qingqing Chen;György Csaba;Paolo Lugli;Ulf Schlichtmann;Ulrich Rührmair	2012	2012 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)		identification;embedded system;figure of merit;electronic engineering;physical unclonable function;computer hardware;sensitivity;temperature measurement;computer science;engineering;noise;cryptography;integrated circuit;reliability;authentication;process variation;proof of concept	EDA	13.516962527724202	63.71709434272013	25450

It enable vehicles to cooperatively assist source vehicle to discover the position of the destination without the help of location services and to adjust the forwarding strategy according to the road density. The proposed scheme overcomes the disadvantage of the greedy forwarding strategy used in CODS-AD where route stability is not considered and thus link-breakage probability is increased. In addition, proposed scheme make better decisions on how to select a more efficient and stable next forwarder by using location prediction and link duration estimation. The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme not only achieves a higher delivery ratio, but also significantly reduces control overhead and end-to-end delay.	end-to-end principle;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);simulation	Chun-Chih Lo;Yau-Hwang Kuo	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362908	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;decision support system;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;probability;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.9558990949096264	83.8514075420023	25542

To explore quantitatively the advantage offered by the use of directional antennas over the case of omnidirectional antennas, we consider the case of connection-oriented multicast traffic. Building upon our prior work on multicasting algorithms, we introduce two protocols that exploit the use of directional antennas and evaluate their performance. We observe significant improvement with respect to the omnidirectional case, in terms of both energy efficiency and network lifetime. Additionally, we show that further substantial increase in the network’s lifetime can be achieved by incorporating a simple measure of a node’s residual energy into the node’s cost function.	algorithm;connection-oriented communication;fractal antenna;hoc (programming language);loss function;multicast	Jeffrey E.

A clustering routing algorithm based on uneven node deployment (CRAUND) is presented. The sensing area is divided into several concentric annuli and nodes are distributed unevenly in the area. The density of sensor nodes in closer area to the sink node is greater than those in further area. In order to balance energy consumption in network, energy cost in each annulus for every period can be made nearly equal. Inner-cluster node competition is introduced to optimize cluster head (CH) selection. Multi-hop transmission between CHs is employed to reduce energy cost, so as to improve their energy efficiency. Simulation results indicate that CRAUND has better performance in terms of balancing and reducing network energy consumption.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;cylinder-head-sector;network topology;performance;routing;simulation;software deployment	Yan Gu;Yucheng Shao;Han Han;Tong Yi	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096879	telecommunications;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	8.522839330450264	80.39169396150179	25672

Proposed algorithm can be seen as a variant of GFG (Greedy Face Greedy of Bose et.al) algorithm, but based on combinatorial properties derived in the Virtual Raw Anchor Coordinate system, which is the localization scheme of interest. We utilize a local planarization algorithm of a geometric graph, which is based on the Schnyder's characterization of planar graphs. The new approach is combinatorial in the sense that the nodes are ordered with respect to three distinct order relations satisfying suitable properties. The coordinate system that motivated the development of this routing algorithm is VRAC (Virtual Raw Anchor Coordinates), which localizes the nodes with the raw distances from three anchors. Since the positions of the anchors are not known, the VRAC coordinate system does not correspond to the Euclidean location of nodes, yet leaving sufficient information to define necessary combinatorial constructs for routing with guaranteed delivery. In particular, the routing algorithm avoids the references to geographical arguments and makes use only of the order relations on the nodes. We expect that our approach will foster further research on building efficient order relations, that will prove to be useful in practical implementation of geographic routing algorithms. In particular, we expect that further work will prove that the combinatorial approach for geographic routing, based on a raw anchor based positioning system is more robust in the presence of distance measurement errors.	geographic routing	Pierre Leone;Kasun Samarasinghe	2016	Theor.

However, VANET still faces many challenges before it could be deployed. One such challenge is shortage of radio frequency spectrum channels. VANET has been allocated 7 channels for dedicated short range communication at 5.9GHz band. The 7 channels are likely to get congested in high vehicle densities when many vehicles are contending for the same medium. Consequently, affecting the transmission of safety and emergency messages. To alleviate the problem of scarcity channels, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) through cognitive radio (CR) technology has been proposed. One of the core functions of a CR is to identify spectrum holes in licensed frequency bands that can be accessed by unlicensed users through spectrum sensing. In VANET, spectrum sensing is challenging because of the mobility nature of vehicles, dynamic topological changes as well as other unique characteristics not found in other networks. However, these challenges have not been fully studied and how they affect spectrum sensing in cognitive vehicular network (CVN). In this paper, we discuss challenges associated with spectrum sensing in CVN. We describe the primary system activity model used by many schemes proposed in literature. Furthermore, we present an in depth analysis of state-of-art cooperative spectrum sensing techniques for CVN from 2010 to May 2016. In addition, we present some of the open issues in spectrum sensing for CVN.	card security code;cognitive radio;frequency band;function model;http 404;radio frequency;spectral density	Chembe Christopher;Rafidah Md Noor;Ismail Ahmedy;Michael Oche;Douglas Kunda;Chi Harold Liu	2017	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.09.002	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	20.034626778637108	84.61586246260305	25750

Spatially biased traffic generated in some applications makes a customization method for removing links more efficient, since some links become low utilization. In this paper, a link removal strategy that customizes the router in NoC is proposed for reconfigurable systems in order to minimize the required hardware amount. Based on the pre-analyzed traffic information, links on which the communication amount is small are removed to reduce the hardware cost while maintaining adequate performance. Two policies are proposed to avoid deadlocks and they outperform up*/down* routing, which is a representative deadlock-free routing on irregular topology. In the case of the image recognition application susan, the proposed method can save 30% of the hardware amount without performance degradation.	field-programmable gate array	Daihan Wang;Hiroki Matsutani;Michihiro Koibuchi;Hideharu Amano	2009	IEICE Transactions		embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;network on a chip;field-programmable gate array	EDA	2.3898576463254897	61.9737132302897	25785

To prolong the network operating time, energy-efficiency should be carefully considered at every layer of the network protocols and algorithms. Moreover, cross-layer effects and interactions have to be carefully analyzed and utilized. We consider the problem of constructing scalable power-efficient broadcast routing trees over densely deployed wireless ad hoc or sensor networks. The keys to resolving scalability issues are: (1) using a distributed implementation; (2) using a hierarchical approach; (3) using a (partially) shared routing tree structure. We achieve these by using, as a basic building block, the idea of a center-oriented broadcast (COBRA) scheme we presented earlier (Kang, I. and Poovendran, R., IEEE Wireless Commun. and Networking Conf., 2004).	algorithm;communications protocol;hoc (programming language);interaction;routing;scalability;sensor;tree structure	Intae Kang;Radha Poovendran	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424836	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;broadcast radiation;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	7.115632003860365	79.84777913593322	25946

A well-established fingerprint database plays an important role in positioning, especially enhancing positioning accuracy. In literature, there are studies that consider only one type of measurements such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth RSS, but these values are not sufficient alone to overcome the problems in dynamically changed environments. In order to deal with this, we propose a novel fingerprint database that contains both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth RSS values in addition to magnetic field measurements obtained from mobile devices. In addition to this, the proposed database also contains Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RSS values obtained from preplaced sensor nodes in the experimental environment. The aims of this fingerprint database are to enhance accuracy, precision, and robustness of the location estimation system to dynamically changed environment and to satisfy researchers' needs who are deal with different problems in indoor positioning.	algorithm;bluetooth;database;fingerprint (computing);indoor positioning system;machine learning;mobile device;modem;rss;sensor	Sinem Bozkurt;Ahmet Yazici;Serkan Günal;Ugur Yayan;Fatih Inan	2015	2015 International Symposium on Innovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)	10.1109/INISTA.2015.7276726	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;hybrid positioning system;computer network	Mobile	20.35176042768977	72.98603117725028	25954

Time synchronization protocols like TPSN, RBS and FTSP have provided great schemes to fulfill fast synchronization with efficiency. In some applications, nodes might hope to sleep for a long time without timestamp exchanges with other nodes. In that case, accurate time drift prediction is quite necessary. For that purpose, firstly, we propose a time synchronization scheme, which fully utilizes the broadcast nature. The scheme achieves time synchronization with fewer timestamps compared with RBS and TPSN. Secondly, we introduce a method to find relative time drift rate on the fly. Thirdly, we introduce a scheme to predict time drift rates of the next few hours. We also analyze a few factors that deteriorate frequency drift or time drift rate. The diurnal periodical environment trend, instead of mathematical extrapolation, is used for time drift rates prediction of the next few hours.	extrapolation;frequency drift;mathematical model;on the fly;performance per watt;quantum fluctuation;synchronization (computer science)	Tao Bian;Ramachandran Venkatesan;Cheng Li	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5198710	synchronization;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	9.27688850965748	71.26210206536669	25970

In DGT, Base stations track each member of a group and build a share multicast routing tree called DGT-Tree for the group in a distributed manner. Transmission of multicast packets among group members is along the group’s DGT-Tree. Simulation study has demonstrated that a better performance can be achieved by DGT over the gateway-based counterpart in terms of transmission cost as well as link load balance. Moreover, the average number of DGT operations decreases as the group size increases, showing the good scalability of the DGT scheme, and the average number of control packets as well as the cache requirement for performing DGT operations demonstrate the moderate overhead introduced by DGT. key words: cellular IP, mobility management, multicast, group communications	internet protocol suite;load balancing (computing);multicast;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;simulation	Chun-Chuan Yang;Chun-Shian Tsai;Kwin-Yee Lin	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.10.2696	telecommunications;computer science;speech processing;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Networks	-2.581677942193956	76.929145856015	25976

In particular, we find, from a statistical analysis of route duration and route change interval, that route dynamics may require complex modelling. Our analysis considers various mobility models, node velocities and node densities of the MANET network. Our findings show that, in a MANET with moderate or high rate of mobility, the route duration could be approximated by an exponential distribution with approximate parameters, while the route duration of specific lengths could not. Our findings suggest that minimum hop-count routing in MANETs may be inappropriate and that further investigation is required in order to develop models that let us understand MANET route dynamics.	approximation algorithm;default route;hoc (programming language);routing;shortest path problem;time complexity	Yangcheng Huang;Kannan Govindan;Saleem N.

Many neurological diseases like paralysis are caused by the interruption of spike propagation due to the malfunctioning neurons in the signaling pathway where the spikes are carried. In this paper, we propose a neuron specific statistical multiplexing scheme to substitute a faulty sensory neural pathway with a neighboring functional one. Since the spikes are stereotyped events and they have no addressing information, we developed an addressing scheme utilizing the spikes themselves. The performance achieved by the proposed technique is analyzed in terms of the percentage of the spikes transmitted under various scenarios. We also compared the results obtained with the previously proposed TDMA based multiplexing schemes. The proposed statistical multiplexing based technique has lower implementation complexity than the previously introduced TDMA based techniques. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of the proposed technique when a priority mechanism is employed. The concept of multiplexing spikes to substitute a faulty neural pathway with a functional pathway reveals new opportunities in neuronal communication and may pave the way to the real healthcare applications of nanonetworking in the near future.	addressing scheme;gene regulatory network;interrupt;multiplexing;nanonetwork;neuron;software propagation	Hakan Tezcan;Sema F.

The novelty lies in using multidestination messages instead of the traditional single destination messages. Two different multidestination worm types, gather and broadcasting, are introduced to implement the report and wake-up phases of barrier synchronization, respectively. Algorithms for complete and arbitrary set barrier synchronization are presented using these new worms. It is shown that complete barrier synchronization in a k-ary n-cube system with e-cube routing can be implemented with 2n communication start-ups as compared to 2n log/sub 2/ k start-ups needed with unicast-based message passing. For arbitrary set barrier, an interesting trend is observed where the synchronization cost keeps on reducing beyond a certain number of participating nodes. >	barrier (computer science)	Dhabaleswar K.

The protocol is defined to be fault-tolerant if messages can be rerouted via another path when the communication channel fails. In this paper, we propose a new synthesis method for generating a fault-tolerant routing protocol for a given service specification and a network topology. The routing protocol thus obtained adopts a multipath routing augmented with sets, where each set stores the next nodes for routing, and updates the sets according to network topology changes. Additionally, the routing protocol can attain flexibility by the multipath routing mechanism in the sense that only a small amount of changes is needed for addition or deletion of nodes. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method through an application to a typical routing service of message delivery from a source node to a destination node.	automata theory;automatic control;automaton;channel (communications);computation;distributed computing;executable;fault tolerance;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;john d. wiley;multipath propagation;multipath routing;network topology;requirement;sethi–ullman algorithm;state transition table;welch's method	Yutaka Hatanaka;Masahide Nakamura;Yoshiaki Kakuda;Tohru Kikuno	1997		10.1109/ICECCS.1997.622301	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;fault tolerance;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network;channel	Networks	0.008775187914688589	83.13616543405041	26078

However, the MCDS problem is NP-Complete even in Unit Disk Graphs. Therefore, many heuristic-based approximation algorithms have been proposed recently. In these approaches, networks are deterministic where two nodes are assumed either connected or disconnected. In most real applications, however, there are many intermittently connected wireless links called lossy links, which only provide probabilistic connectivity. For wireless networks with lossy links, we propose a Probabilistic Network Model (PNM). Under this model, we measure the quality of Connected Dominating Sets (CDSs) using CDS reliability defined as the minimum upper limit of the node-to-node delivery ratio between any pair of dominators in a CDS. We attempt to construct a MCDS while its reliability is above a preset application-specified threshold, called Reliable MCDS (RMCDS). We claim that constructing a RMCDS is NP-Hard under the PNM model. We propose a novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) called RMCDS-GA to solve the RMCDS problem. To evaluate the performance of RMCDS-GA, we conduct comprehensive simulations. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional MCDS algorithms, RMCDS-GA can construct a more reliable CDS without increasing the size of a CDS.	approximation algorithm;deterministic algorithm;genetic algorithm;heuristic;lossy compression;np-completeness;np-hardness;network model;routing;simulation;software release life cycle;traffic sign recognition	Jing He;Zhipeng Cai;Shouling Ji;Raheem A.

e134cd14205f08ad779dc2e5c4b86bcdf1756ed0	energy-efficient unequal chain length clustering for wsn		In WSN, sensor nodes deployed with a large number in remotely unattended sensing environment. In such networks, sensor nodes have a limitation in their capabilities such energy, where nodes deployed without constant power supply. In such environments, the network is no longer useful when the battery dies, which will effect on performance, quality of sensor network and in turn, human lives that can be saved. Many clustering protocols have been proposed to improve the energy consumption and the network lifetime. However, a heavy burden that the cluster head bears during intra-cluster and inter-cluster processing is still high, hence cluster head consumes more energy comparing to non-cluster head nodes. So due to power restriction of sensor nodes and cluster head overloads problem; designing a routing protocol that minimizes energy consumption for each node and maximizes the network lifetime is considered a very important issue. In order to overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose an Energy Efficient Unequal Chain Length Clustering (EEUCLC) protocol which has a suboptimal multi-hop routing algorithm to reduce the burden on the cluster head and a probability-based cluster head selection algorithm to prolong the network lifetime. Simulation results show that the EEUCLC mechanism enhanced the energy balance and prolonged the network lifetime compared to other related protocols.	cluster analysis;data aggregation;global positioning system;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;power supply;routing;satellite navigation;selection algorithm;sensor;simulation	Mohammad Baniata;Mhanwoo Heo;Jinwoo Lee;Juw Won Park;Jiman Hong	2018		10.1145/3167132.3167361	wireless sensor network;selection algorithm;battery (electricity);energy consumption;efficient energy use;routing protocol;computer network;energy balance;cluster analysis;computer science	Mobile	9.039937589643849	80.0086492290207	26167

Communication characteristics such as traffic pattern and communication load change over time and, eventually, they may exceed available network capacity causing congestion and performance degradation. Congestion control based on adaptive routing should be applied in order to adapt quickly to changing traffic conditions. Studies on a vast range of parallel applications show repetitive behavior and can be characterized by a set of representative phases. This work presents a Predictive and Distributed Routing Balancing technique (PR-DRB) to control network congestion based on adaptive traffic distribution. PR-DRB uses speculative routing based on application repetitiveness. PR-DRB monitors messages latencies on routers and logs solutions to congestion, to quickly respond in future similar situations. Experimental results show that the predictive approach could be used to improve performance.	adaptive filter;certified digital radio broadcast specialist;elegant degradation;interconnection;network congestion;pr/sm;parallel computing;router (computing);routing;speculative execution	Carlos Nunez Castillo;Diego Lugones;Daniel Franco;Emilio Luque	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing	10.1109/CLUSTER.2011.66	routing domain;parallel processing;routing;static routing;parallel computing;network traffic control;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;prediction;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	HPC	-3.888885380867587	70.56910060335373	26184

In this paper, we systematically analyze the energy efficiency problem in CCN by turning off the content routers and network links. We formulate the energy consumption issue as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, and propose a centralized solution via spanning tree heuristic and a fully distributed consensus optimization algorithm via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem for CCN. By duplicating flow variables, the energy consumption problem decomposes into node specific subproblems with local variables. These variables are iteratively driven into consensus via the ADMM. Simulation results reveal that the proposed distributed algorithm is amenable to energy-efficient implementation, due to smaller amount of local information exchange at each iteration. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can converge to final status in a significantly smaller number of iterations compared to the method based on dual decomposition. In addition, our algorithm scales better to large networks and it does not require intensive finetuning of the step size.	augmented lagrangian method;centralized computing;consensus (computer science);converge;cyclomatic complexity;distributed algorithm;file spanning;heuristic;information exchange;integer programming;iteration;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming;local variable;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);scalability;simulation;spanning tree	Chao Fang;Fei Richard Yu;Tao Huang;Jiang Liu;Yunjie Liu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249206	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer network	EDA	5.8908908279241885	81.55972275284209	26203

However, it results in pin-ball routing and multiple encapsulations especially in the nested NEMO. In order to solve these problems, we propose a simple route optimization scheme for NEMO and nested NEMO. In the proposed scheme, a correspondent node (CN) maintains network prefix binding information of intermediate MRs to obtain optimal path to the mobile network node (MNN). For a CN to receive network prefix bindings, each intermediate MR updates its network prefix binding to the inner source of the encapsulated packet, when it receives an encapsulated packet from its HA. The proposed scheme uses the routing header type 0 (RH0) and the routing header type 2 extension (RH2 extension) to deliver packets to the MNN through the optimal path and to remove multiple encapsulations. In addition, we extend the Router Alert Option (RAO) so that the MR knows the original source address of the packet, when ingress filtering is applied.	attachments;ingress filtering;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;nsa product types;network packet;proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);routing	Hanlim Kim;Geunhyung Kim;Cheeha Kim	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-30582-8_42	filter;cellular network;routing;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;node;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-3.372748118589994	76.92695474537194	26251

The information in vanets can be shared among vehicles or sent in unicast, multicast or broadcast mode with the main goal of improving safety or even providing multimedia or commercial services. Several protocols and techniques have been proposed to be used in specific scenarios depending on the vehicle density and the spatial distribution. Anyway, it is necessary to have a tool for testing different scenarios and protocols proposed. Although simulation is usually a powerful technique for evaluating wireless or routing protocols, it is also necessary to have a real test bench to implement the protocols that could be already simulated with success. In this paper, we present a real framework for vanets that use wireless communication among vehicles and RFID for different traffic signalling information, such as bus stop or semaphore location, speed limit information, etc.	test bench	Andrés Ortiz;Alberto Peinado;Jorge Munilla	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04091-7_7	test bench;multicast;semaphore;spatial distribution;computer network;wireless;routing protocol;unicast;computer science;broadcasting	HCI	4.305128894709869	87.1558967753559	26287

In this work, we are concerned with understanding the functional relationship between these influential factors and performance of mobile ad hoc networking systems. We show how a systematic statistical design of experiments (DOE) strategy can be used to analyze network system and protocol performance, leading to more objective conclusions valid over a wide range of network conditions and environments. Using a DOE strategy and a 2k factorial design, we quantify the main and interactive effects of five factors (i.e., network density, node mobility, traffic load, network size, and medium access control scheme) on two response metrics (i.e., packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay). Using these effects measures, we then develop two first-order linear regression models that define the functional relationship between the influential factors and two performance metrics.	access control;communications protocol;design of experiments;end-to-end principle;experiment;first-order predicate;hoc (programming language);network packet;retransmission (data networks);timer	Michael W.

In the core of these environments are the wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) which have seen an unprecedented development in the last decade both in terms of complexity and supporting concepts [1]. In this respect, there are still a number of issues that have to be solved in new ways suitable to the specifics and requirements of the smart environment. One such pressing issue is providing high level of fault tolerance. Fault tolerance is defined as the ability of a network to continue functioning in the presence of link and node failures. As the wireless media has highly varying characteristics and the nodes are easily prone to failures, the development of new fault tolerance algorithms is a pressing question. Furthermore, traditional layered protocol design has proved ineffective for WSAN and the new cross layer design approach has emerged as a foundation for protocol design in smart environments. The paper presents integrated fault tolerance module for WSAN based on the cross layer design approach. The results presented, based on packet loss, delay and energy consumption, support the thesis that adoption of the suggested fault management module improves the general performance of the network."""	algorithm;communications protocol;fault tolerance;high-level programming language;network packet;osi model;requirement;smart environment	Radosveta Sokullu;Ozlem Karaca	2012	2012 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 9th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.159	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network;intelligent sensor;actuator	Robotics	6.1829894960181	73.72141164378792	26451

Hence in this paper, we develop an estimated data accuracy model for randomly deployed sensor nodes which can sense more accurate data from the physical environment. We compare our results with other information accuracy models and shows that our estimated data accuracy model performs better than the other models. Moreover we simulate our estimated data accuracy model under such situation when some of the sensor nodes become malicious due to extreme physical environment. Finally using our estimated data accuracy model we construct a probabilistic approach for selecting an optimal set of sensor nodes from the randomly deployed maximal set of sensor nodes in the network.

Recently, it has been discussed that routing protocols can be improved by conditioning routing decisions to the past behavior of forwarding peers. However, churn — the continuous process of node arrival and departure — may severely hinder the applicability of rating mechanisms. In particular, short lifetimes mean that reputations are often generated from a small number of transactions. To examine how high rates of churn affect rating mechanisms, this paper introduces an analytical model to compute at which rate transactions has to be performed so that the generated reputations are sufficiently reliable. We then propose a new routing protocol for structured P2P systems that exploits reputation to improve the decision about which neighbor choose as next hop. Our results demonstrate that routing algorithms can extract substantial benefits from reputations even when peer lifetimes are short.	algorithm;peer-to-peer;reputation system;routing	Marc Sánchez Artigas;Pedro García López;Blas Herrera	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03869-3_51	policy-based routing;routing domain;routing;static routing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;peer-to-peer;database;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Metrics	4.494600176156535	84.01328412535538	26454

While substantial progress in sensor network performance has appeared, new challenges have also emerged as these systems have been deployed in the natural environment. First, in order to achieve minimum sensing fidelity performance, the rapid spatiotemporal variation of environmental phenomena requires impractical deployment densities. The presence of obstacles in the environment introduces sensing uncertainty and degrades the performance of sensor fusion systems in particular for the many new applications of image sensing. The physical obstacles encountered by sensing may be circumvented by a new mobile sensing method or Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS). NIMS integrates distributed, embedded sensing and computing systems with infrastructure-supported mobility. NIMS now includes coordinated mobility methods that exploits adaptive articulation of sensor perspective and location as well as management of sensor population to provide the greatest certainty in sensor fusion results. The architecture, applications, and implementation of NIMS will be discussed here. In addition, results of environmentally-adaptive sampling, and direct measurement of sensing uncertainty will be described.	adaptive sampling;biconnected component;embedded system;network performance;physical security;sampling (signal processing);software deployment	Richard Pon;Maxim A.

The network-on-chip (NoCs) has been proposed as a scalable and high-bandwidth fabric for interconnect design. The advent of the 3D technology has provided further opportunity to reduce on-chip communication delay. However, the design of the 3D NoC topologies has important distinctions from 2D NoCs or off-chip interconnection networks. First, current 3D stacking technology allows only vertical inter-layer links. Hence, there cannot be direct connections between arbitrary nodes in different layers — the vertical connection topology are essentially fixed. Second, the 3D NoC is highly constrained by the complexity and power of routers and links. Hence, low-radix routers are preferred over high-radix routers for lower power and better heat dissipation. This implies long network latency due to high hop counts in network paths. In this paper, we design a low-diameter 3D network using low-radix routers. Our topology leverages long wires to connect remote intra-layer nodes. We take advantage of the start-of-the-art one-hop vertical communication design and utilize lateral long wires to shorten network paths. Effectively, we implement a small-to-medium sized clique network in different layers of a 3D chip. The resulting topology generates a diameter of 3-hop only network, using routers of the same radix as 3D mesh routers. The proposed network shows up to 29% of network latency reduction, up to 10% throughput improvement, and up to 24% energy reduction, when compared to a 3D mesh network.	complexity;interconnection;lateral thinking;mesh networking;network on a chip;network planning and design;network topology;router (computing);scalability;stacking;thermal management (electronics);three-dimensional integrated circuit;throughput	Yi Xu;Yu Du;Bo Zhao;Xiuyi Zhou;Youtao Zhang;Jun Yang	2009	2009 IEEE 15th International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture	10.1109/HPCA.2009.4798234	wireless mesh network;routing;parallel computing;computer science;distributed computing;network on a chip;network topology;computer network	Arch	2.636797413508229	62.38232860838916	26701

The routing function guarantees absence of deadlocks and livelocks up to two faulty channels. The routing logic does not require reconfiguration when a fault occurs. The routes themselves are dynamic. Based on the faults in the network, alternative routes are used to reroute packets. Routing decisions are based only on local knowledge, which allows for fast switching. Our approach does not use any costly virtual channels. As we do not prohibit cyclic dependencies, the routing function provides minimal routing from source to destination even in the presence of faults. We have implemented the architecture design using synthesizable HDL. To ensure deadlock freedom, we have extended a formally verified deadlock detection algorithm to deal with fault tolerant designs.

a92cfff2eab5f5a2865402207e2e7a0ae91b23d5	multipath routing protocol based on cross-layer approach for manet		Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) involved in many applications, whether smart or traditional and for both civilian and military uses, and that because of their special features, where it does not depend on any infrastructure during its working, as well as the nodes in MANETs have a freedom of movement with the ability to self-configure, in addition, to working as a router or client at the same time. Moreover, MANETs considered as an infrastructure less network, so the cost of this type of networks is less in comparison to other traditional networks. On the other hand, the routing considered one of most important challenges in MANETs due to the  perpetual motion and randomness of the nodes that can causing a continuous change of the network topology and thus to all paths between nodes, where finding valid paths between the nodes is the core task of routing protocols. Recently, it has been argued that the traditional layered architecture is ineffective to deal with receiving signal strength related problems. In an effort to improve the performance of MANETs, there has been increased in protocols that rely on cross-layer interaction between different layers. In this paper, a Cross-layer design among Network, MAC and Physical layers based on Threshold Multipath Routing Protocol (CTMRP) is proposed. The CTMRP is designed for decision maker based on threshold value of average paths signal for efficient transmission of the Text, image, audio and video as well as sending the data via multiple paths, which mitigate the negatives effects causes from forcing the nodes to send the data via single. The Route Discovery Delay, Number of RREQ Messages, Number of RREP Messages, End-to-End Delay, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and Throughput were selected as the main performance evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance and lead to increase stability of transmission link.	multipath routing	Alaa Azmi Allahham;Muamer Mohammed;Nassir Sallom Kadhim	2017	iJIM		multipath propagation;telecommunications;multipath routing;computer security;computer network	EDA	4.701961048792484	84.92192276747387	26759

The design of MAC protocol in ad hoc networks becomes a more challenging task due to the interruptible energy source or limited battery life of nodes. This brings energy efficiency as the preliminary goal of the MAC protocol. MAC protocol for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UWASN) has to face even more challenges; many of them are due to the harsh underwater channel. Recently, a number of MAC protocols have been proposed for UWASN and selection of a suitable protocol has a great impact on the system efficiency. In this paper, we first highlight the unique aspects of acoustic channel and the problems associated with the MAC layer in UWASN. Existing MAC solutions for UWASN and open research issues are investigated and the summary of the protocols is provided to see the performance against different parameters considered in UWASN applications for selection of protocol.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;hoc (programming language);open research	Ghalib A.

With the proliferation of many time-critical applications with real-time delivery, low latency, and/or specific bandwidth requirements, Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) are increasingly being used for reliable contention-free data transmission by nodes within beacon-enabled WPANs. To evaluate the performance of the 802.15.4 GTS management scheme, this paper introduces a new GTS simulation model for OMNeT++ / MiXiM. Our GTS model considers star-topology WPANs within the 2.4 GHz frequency band, and is in full conformance with the IEEE 802.15.4 – 2006 standard. To enable thorough investigation of the behaviors and impacts of different attacks against the 802.15.4 GTS mechanism, a new GTS attacks simulation model for OMNeT++ is also introduced in this paper. Our GTS attacks model is developed for OMNeT++ / NETA, and is integrated with our GTS model to provide a single inclusive OMNeT++ simulation model for both the GTS mechanism and all known-to-date attacks against it.

It is therefore important to build an alternative network for delivering emergency bulletins about earthquakes and tsunamis. We propose a broadcast distribution system integrating the ETWS (Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System) and ProSe (Proximity Services) on LTE that delivers emergency bulletins to UEs outside eNB coverage and incorporates DTN to maximize the message arrival rate. We showed the effectiveness of our proposed system by carrying out an evacuation simulation using the system.	collision domain;compaq lte;delay-tolerant networking;network packet;queueing theory;simulation;ues (cipher)	Yutaka Musaka;Yoshitaka Nakamura;Hiroshi Inamura	2017	2017 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Computing and Ubiquitous Network (ICMU)	10.23919/ICMU.2017.8330108	user equipment;tsunami warning system;computer network;synchronization;business;broadcasting;cellular network;base station	Mobile	5.0625015599417456	87.99656333425743	26823

Transmitting this data from the sensor field to the sink is reliant on efficient data collection mechanisms. Various collection processes address the following fundamental questions: how fast can we transmit the data carrying emergency events? What data actually needs to be transmitted? How do we ensure the accuracy of the transmitted data? In my PhD, I investigate these questions by exploring and evaluating different techniques for efficient data collection in terms of time delay, energy consumption, and accuracy of the reported data. This paper presents an overview of our proposed solutions to reduce emergency messages transmission delay in WSNs based Road Traffic Monitoring, as well as our current and future works.	broadcast delay;download	Imane Horiya Brahmi	2014		10.1145/2611166.2611172	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.608393462144848	75.04071662299565	26882

We carry out our comparison for different network topologies: random, grid, and clustered. Our analysis is performed at the link layer level using a MAC-independent propagation model based on real experiments from the literature. Our main metrics are bandwidth, energy usage, and broadcast latency. Our analytical and experimental results show that, given a desired high reliability for all topologies, flooding and site percolation has the lowest latency; but flooding consumes the most energy per broadcast compared to site percolation. For dense networks, modified bond percolation further lowers energy consumption compared to site percolation, while basic bond percolation leads to a latency increase. For sparse networks, results are similar to a dense network except that site percolation consumes lower energy than modified bond percolation. We briefly discuss implications for different broadcast applications.	algorithm;experiment;network topology;percolation theory;simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix	Vijay Raman;Indranil Gupta	2009	2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops	10.1080/17445760903548309	gossip;link layer;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;percolation;distributed computing;network topology;computer network	Mobile	5.365058151064494	81.07519215784158	26899

We propose a new method for intellectual property protection which facilitates design watermarking at the combinational logic synthesis level. We developed protocols for embedding designer- and/or tool-specific information into a logic network while performing multi-level logic minimization and technology mapping. We demonstrate that the difficulty of erasing an author's signature or finding another signature in the synthesized design can be made arbitrarily computationally difficult. We also developed a statistical method which enables us to establish the strength of the proof of authorship. The watermarking method has been tested on a standard set of real-life benchmarks where an exceptionally high probability of authorship has been achieved with a negligible overhead in solution quality.	circuit minimization for boolean functions;combinational logic;digital watermarking;logic synthesis;overhead (computing);real life;statistical model;watermark (data file)	Darko Kirovski;Yean-Yow Hwang;Miodrag Potkonjak;Jason Cong	1998	1998 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

From the RSSI measurements between transmitters and receivers situated on a set of landmarks, we construct appropriate probabilistic descriptors associated with a device’s position in the contiguous space using a pdf interpolation technique. We then develop a localization system that relies on these descriptors and the measurements made by a set of clusterheads positioned at some of the landmarks. The localization problem is formulated as a composite hypothesis testing problem. We develop the requisite theory, characterize the probability of error, and address the problem of optimally placing clusterheads. Experimental results show that our system achieves an accuracy equivalent to 95% < 5 meters and 87% < 3 meters.	experiment;internationalization and localization;interpolation;portable document format;situated;transmitter	Ioannis Ch.

7a12b365ccad3517f0e09a6a563add676a702ee0	reference node selection in dynamic tree		The reference node RN is a central node that has minimum distance/hop count to all other nodes in the network. This central node can play several critical roles such as being the time reference in order to synchronise computer nodes. For synchronisation, the main goal is to minimise the sum of synchronisation errors. The time synchronisation error, known for each link between two nodes, accumulates for each hop along the path used for synchronisation between two nodes. In such a context, the best RN is defined as having the minimal sum of time synchronisation errors between itself and every other node. Thus, the first step for error minimisation is to select a minimum spanning tree MST, formed by the links with minimum synchronisation error, as synchronisation path. The second step is to select an RN, which minimises the sum of synchronisation errors to all nodes in the MST, as time reference for synchronisation. In a dynamic network, where communication links appear and disappear, and synchronisation accuracy improves as more packets are exchanged, a static RN would entail suboptimal synchronisation accuracy. All existing models in this area are limited to static RNs because of the computing cost of updating the RN, yielding a suboptimal total synchronisation error over time and causing problems if the selected node is removed from the dynamic network. This paper presents a novel and efficient method for dynamic RN selection in dynamic networks. The approach proposed in this paper improves the performance of RN computation and update in live mode for dynamic networks. This new method concentrates on the altered path with respect to the RN, each time the MST is updated. This provides an efficient way to find and maintain a RN incrementally in an average time complexity of Olog n per update, which n is the total number of nodes in the network. The proposed approach was tested with a huge dynamic network containing 60000 simulated nodes, in a number of different situations. The proposed approach achieves excellent running time while minimising synchronisation error. Although this work is currently used for time synchronisation purposes, several dynamic network tools can benefit from an efficient incremental algorithm to calculate hop counts and select a central point for the network.

The results are based on a series of experiments carried out in indoor and industrial environments in the presence of different types of electromagnetic interference (EMI) on the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The performance of the wireless sensors is assessed using the packet loss and packet received rates. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensors operating on low transmission power levels perform well in the presence of high levels of EMI. However, performance is sensitive to the nature and the peak power of the interference. The results reported herein provide a useful performance guidance when deploying ad hoc wireless sensor networks in industrial floors.	emi;experiment;hoc (programming language);ieee 1471;ieee 754-1985;industrial pc;interference (communication);network packet;sfiaplus;sensor;wireless router	Abdullah Kadri	2012	2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314259	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;electromagnetic interference;embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.693671412258665	86.87202927882585	27084

We propose the partition of the road network into same size urban cells, and we use the migration ratios between adjacent urban cells in order to infer the better locations for the deployment of the roadside units. Our goal is to identify those α locations maximizing the number of distinct vehicles experiencing at least one V2I contact opportunity. We compare our strategy to two deployment algorithms: MCP-g relies on full mobility information (full knowledge of the vehicles trajectories), while MCP-kp does not assume any mobility information at all. Results demonstrate that our strategy increases the number of distinct vehicles contacting the infrastructure in 6.8% when compared to MCP-kp. On the other hand, MCP-g overcomes our strategy by 8.5%. We must evaluate whether the 8.5% improvement worthies tracking the trajectories of vehicles. Complementary, the marginal contribution of adding a new roadside unit becomes much more assertive when employing our strategy, enabling a better evaluation of the return on investments by network designers. Such guarantees are not provided by MCP-kp, and they are too weak in MCP-g.	software deployment	Cristiano Maciel da Silva	2014	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2015.01.021	vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;computer science;computer security;computer network	DB	18.061772416934396	84.88698304601907	27222

We first explore the performance of a common scenario in which a single technology is employed to connect smart meters sending traffic to the utility. Based on simulations with actual city maps, we study the coverage provided to smart meters by an LTE cellular network. In order to improve the coverage, an optimization model that considers network capacity and range is proposed to determine the optimal location of base stations to achieve a target coverage of smart meters. According to these preliminary results with a single access technology, we propose an evolved network architecture that considers several alternatives of wireless heterogeneous networks to guarantee the coverage to smart meters with the least use of resources. We introduce a heuristic model that involves elements from base stations, universal data aggregation points, number of smart meters, and an optimal routing to achieve the desired connectivity from the group of smart meters. We employ geo-referenced models to consider actual characteristics of cities as well as geographical conditions. Results from the evolved model demonstrate that by combining technologies and employing data aggregation points with optimized localizations, the network is able to achieve a target coverage of smart meters with a reduced cost in terms of technological resources.	assistive technology;compaq lte;data aggregation;heuristic;map;mathematical optimization;network architecture;reduced cost;routing;scalability;simulation;single-access key;smart meter;software deployment	Esteban Inga;Sandra Céspedes Umaña;Roberto C.

Error-prone overclocking of Flash memory chip I/O links can trade such ECC underutilization for opportunistically improving SSD speed performance, and its effectiveness strongly depends on how well the ECC decoding can handle the overclocking-induced I/O link errors. As SSDs are quickly adopting low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, this brief concerns LPDC-based overclocked SSDs. Experiments with 20-nm NAND Flash memory chips reveal unique bit error characteristics of the overclocked I/O link, based upon which this brief develops solutions that can leverage the error characteristics to improve LDPC decoding performance. Results show that the developed techniques can reduce LDPC code decoding power consumption by 60% and reduce the decoding failure rate by over two orders of magnitude.	best, worst and average case;bit error rate;code word;ecc memory;error detection and correction;experiment;failure rate;flash memory;forward error correction;input/output;low-density parity-check code;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;memory cell (binary);multi-level cell;overclocking;solid-state drive	Kai Zhao;Jiangpeng Li;Jun Ma;Rino Micheloni;Tong Zhang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2350377	parallel computing;real-time computing;bit error rate;computer hardware;telecommunications;sequential decoding;computer science;error floor	Embedded	7.663067514099995	61.740119964793166	27546
afb2e01c4f987e2144eafff52544f0c7f51950d5	scalable distributed-sensing scheme with prioritized reporting for multi-band wlans		To support the increasing number of wireless devices for Internet of Things (IoT), wireless LAN (WLAN) is envisioned to provide both wide spatial coverage and sufficient spectrum resources. Multi-band WLAN allows flexible use of multiple frequency bands. To efficiently monitor wireless resources in IoT-enabled multi-band WLAN, station (STA) based distributed-sensing system is considered. Distributed sensing alleviates sensing constraints at access points (APs) and expands sensing coverage area. This paper addresses the problem of how to efficiently collect the necessary information of wireless resources. We propose a scalable distributed-sensing scheme to efficiently collect the wireless resource information such as channel occupancy ratio from STAs. A key feature of the proposed approach is that a prioritized reporting process is employed at each STA for collection of sensing results with high scalability.

In this article, we introduce a framework for WSN that combines three design approaches: (1) clustering, (2) routing, and (3) topology control. In this framework, we implement an energy-efficient zone-based topology and routing protocol. The framework features a new set of graphs referred to as the Mini Gabriel (MG) graphs. The simulation results demonstrate that the framework with the MG graphs and without these graphs are generally 28% better than the framework with an existing geometric graph. This is in terms of the total network energy consumptions. In addition, the proposed framework is 10, 25, 26, and 46% better than the proposed work with an existing geometric graph in terms of the end-to-end data transmission delay, the transmission energy consumptions, the number of hops in established paths and the routing delay, respectively. Moreover, the MG demonstrates that it achieves the connectivity property, which is critical for WSNs.	cluster analysis;end-to-end principle;geometric graph theory;mg (editor);network packet;routing;simulation;topology control	Lutful Karim;Tarek El Salti;Nidal Nasser;Qusay H.

Long distance transmission by sensor nodes is not energy efficient since energy consumption is a superlinear function of the transmission distance. One approach to prolonging network lifetime while preserving network connectivity is to deploy a small number of costly, but more powerful, relay nodes whose main task is communication with other sensor or relay nodes. In this paper, we assume that sensor nodes have communication range r>0, while relay nodes have communication range Rgesr, and we study two versions of relay node placement problems. In the first version, we want to deploy the minimum number of relay nodes so that, between each pair of sensor nodes, there is a connecting path consisting of relay and/or sensor nodes. In the second version, we want to deploy the minimum number of relay nodes so that, between each pair of sensor nodes, there is a connecting path consisting solely of relay nodes.

fdec2edee51209a3e0c717a36e3bc1df80bf3477	post-disaster data evacuation from isolated data centers through leo satellite networks		Today's communication networks require special redundancy to overcome severe multiple element failures. These severe failures can isolate entire sub-components of terrestrial networks — e.g., possible aftermath of natural disasters and threats such as a High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP). An integrated use of all communication systems available is important to help lessen the impact over distressed areas. This work investigates the use of aerial platforms with well-defined trajectories (such as LEO satellites) to evacuate data from systems within the affected regions. We propose an algorithm capable of generating an evacuation plan for data located in terrestrial isolated systems, such as Data Centers, through the satellite network, towards final destinations in the main network. Our method works whether the satellite network is damaged or not. The evacuation plan is a node-to-node transmission schedule that maximizes the amount of evacuated data. Post-disaster scenarios are used to analyze how our method performs under different impact sizes and satellite network configurations. The results show that the proposed algorithm produces node-to-node transmission schedules that maximize evacuated data while maintaining fairness among disconnected components.	aerial photography;algorithm;data center;fairness measure;half-life 2: episode one;leo (computer);schedule (computer science);telecommunications network;terrestrial television	Rafael B.

In this work we present the first method for localization in inductively coupled networks which only requires a single anchor. The utilization of passive relays with known positions resolves the associated problem of localization ambiguity. We demonstrate that a single impedance measurement can be sufficient to locate a node in two dimensions. Localization performance can further be increased by deterministic load switching. Numerical results indicate that a median localization error in the millimeter range is possible under realistic conditions.	characteristic impedance;inductive coupling;internationalization and localization;joint entropy;loss function;radio-frequency identification;relay;simulation	Eric Slottke;Armin Wittneben	2015	2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2015.7421116	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	18.248998863579803	77.65589082468593	27788

The information for proximity of users can be an indicator of users' reliability. Some methods of proximity detection, without localization of users, utilize similarity of received signals such as FM, bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ambient sounds. However, ambient sounds can be similar even when users are not nearby and the available range of proximity detection in the methods utilizing other signals is limited and varying from half of the wavelength to 2 m. The purpose of this study is to realize room-level proximity detection without localization: we propose a method based on similarity of received signal strength (RSS) of beacon frames received from ambient multiple access points. Through experiments, in which we recognize whether or not users exist in the same room with a size approximately equal to 5 m square, we demonstrate that our proposed method can be applied to room-level proximity detection.	approximation;bluetooth;experiment;fm broadcasting;lazy evaluation;rss;wireless access point	Yugo Agata;Jihoon Hong;Tomoaki Ohtsuki	2015	2015 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)	10.1109/APSIPA.2015.7415411	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;computer security	Robotics	20.867222422549734	71.48428565579331	27836

One of the coordination systems is formed by the collaboration of aerial ad hoc network and ground ad hoc network that performs cognitive coordination to form an effective guidance system despite operating with different configurations and dynamics. For guidance system, unmanned aerial vehicles form a cognitive map and relay them effectively to the intended node which is a part of ground ad hoc unit. The data sharing is difficult between the networks operating under different circumstances and configurations. An efficient approach is required to provide low-complex relaying for faster communications in these coordinated networks. One of the solutions can be found from the fuzzy formation of the problem that can be applied to some optimization algorithms to efficiently select the cognitive corridors intended for enhanced transmission. In this paper, a fuzzy-based bee colony optimization algorithm is proposed which operates over cooperative trust value, cognitive relaying value and situational awareness to provide efficient cognitive relaying between the two ad hoc units, and uses a cloud server to provide coordination between the nodes. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme and its applicability is tested using simulations.	aerial photography;ant colony optimization algorithms;artificial bee colony algorithm;bees algorithm;centralized computing;cloud storage;cognitive map;computer cluster;computer simulation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;guidance system;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;multi-user mimo;relay;scalability;server (computing);unmanned aerial vehicle;virtual private server	Vishal Sharma;Kathiravan Srinivasan;Rajesh Kumar;Han-Chieh Chao;Kai-Lung Hua	2017	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-017-2015-9	optimized link state routing protocol;distributed computing;mobile ad hoc network;vehicular ad hoc network;fuzzy logic;computer science;cloud computing;cognitive map;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer network;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	18.235933379342896	87.3692794612369	27851

We propose an alternative context-aware cross-layer (CACL) broadcast model that relies only on contextual information available to the 802.11 MAC. We compare CACL and the 802.11 MAC in conjunction with a controlled flooding routing protocol, Self-Balancing Supply/Demand (SBSD). We test three different road-based mobility levels, varying the rate of request posting in each. We observe that CACL strongly outperforms the 802.11 MAC at high posting rates.	hop;routing	Doug Lundquist;Aris M.

Such replication is used in a multisensor environment or in a distributed sensor network. We model a continuous valued sensor as an interval of real numbers containing the physical value of interest. Given n sensors of which at most f of them can suuer arbitrary failures, we present an eecient O(n log n) fault tolerant algorithm whose output is reliable, that is, guaranteed to contain the correct value at all times, and is fairly accurate when f < n=2. The output of the algorithm could be a single interval or a set of intervals depending on the nature of the multisensor environment. This algorithm can be used not only to detect all the possible faulty sensors but to detect all sets (combinations) of possibly faulty sensors. We prove the following results pertaining to the possibly faulty sensors pointed out by the algorithm: 1) The number of sets each containing f possibly faulty sensors is at most (f +1). 2) The number of possibly faulty sensors pointed to by the algorithm is at most 2f. 3) The number of sets each containing f or fewer faulty sensors is at most (2f + 1). These results help narrow down the search to detect faulty sensors and to bound the number of intervals needed to construct an accurate and reliable \abstract sensor""""."""	algorithm;fault tolerance;like button;sensor	D.

In order to save the energy, the selective wakeup approach is effective way in the wireless sensor networks. However, most previous researches concentrated on individual objects such as intruders, tanks, and animals cannot be applied to the continuous object tracking because it is hard to expect that the diffusion of continuous object has the uniform velocity or acceleration. Recently, a prediction-based selective wakeup algorithm, denoted by PRECO is proposed. Nevertheless, this mechanism is still not acceptable. First, its prediction result is very inaccurate because a sensor node calculates next boundary line with only a few data while the continuous objects are pretty flexible and vicissitudinous. Second, its prediction tasks among current boundary nodes should be operated at the same time but it is a hard problem for the nodes to have synchronization in the wireless sensor networks. Therefore, we propose a novel prediction and selective wakeup scheme for energy efficient and accuracy continuous object tracking by using structured clustering. Hence, when objects are detected in some specific area, appointed areas where the target may move activate to keep guard without any complex calculations. Moreover, our scheme is asynchronous so that it is suitable for the sensor networks.	algorithm;asynchronous i/o;british informatics olympiad;cluster analysis;guard (information security);guard digit;sensor node;velocity (software development)	Wanseop Lee;Yongbin Yim;Soochang Park;Jeongcheol Lee;Hosung Park;Sang Ha Kim	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093203	real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Mobile	9.515191444129414	78.96197139618444	28090

This paper presents the first steady-state combinatorial model and analysis for diffracting trees, and usesit to answer several critical algorithmic design questions. Our model is simple and sufficiently high level to overcome many implementation specific details, and yet as we will show it is rich enough to accurately predict empirically observed behaviors. As a result of our analysis we were able to identify starvation problems in the original diffracting tree algor~thm and modify it to a create a more stable version. We are also able to identify the range in which the diffracting tree performs most efficiently, and the rangesin which its performance degrades, We believe ourmodel and modeling approach open the way to steady-state analysis of other distributed-parallel structures such as counting networks and elimination trees.	high-level programming language;load balancing (computing);scalability;steady state	Nir Shavit;Eli Upfal;Asaph Zemach	1996		10.1145/237502.237505	computer science;steady state	Theory	-2.9823563131990323	67.00875439171584	28128

OSA allows both dramatically higher spectrum utilization and near-zero deployment time, with an obvious and significant impact on both civilian and military communications. We discuss two broad classes of challenges to OSA: spectrum agility, which involves wideband sensing, opportunity identification, coordination and use; and policy agility, which enables regulatory policies to be applied dynamically using machine understandable policies. Focusing on spectrum agility, we present an architecture based on an OSA adaptation layer. We describe protocols for OSA, including a hole information protocol, idle channel selection and use, and an access protocol for the coordination channel. We present a simulation study, discuss insights, and show that even a simple protocol for opportunistic spectrum allocation can provide an order-of-magnitude performance improvement in throughput over a legacy system.	frequency allocation;legacy system;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Cesar A.

However, location-based routing protocols need location services to query the location information of the communication partner node so that packets could be forwarded properly. In this paper, we propose a proactive flooding-based location service which named Semi-Flooding Location Service (SFLS). The basic design issue in our proposal is to minimize the number of update packets sent over the whole network. We employed a conditional update technique that manages the number of the updates at the forwarder nodes. This way reduces significantly the overhead of location updates. To study the effectiveness of our algorithm, a mathematical model is developed, and some numerical results are generated. Results demonstrated that SFLS achieves its design goals.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);location-based service;mathematical model;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);routing;scalability;semiconductor industry	Éric Renault;Ebtisam Amar;Hervé Costantini;Selma Boumerdassi	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594281	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.462682107983452	82.35216668638108	28175

In clustering, multihop routing techniques increase the load of the Cluster head near the sink. This unbalanced load on the Cluster head increases its energy consumption, thereby Cluster heads die faster and create an energy hole problem. In this paper, we propose an Energy Balancing Cluster Head (EBCH) in wireless sensor network. At First, we balance the intra cluster load among the cluster heads, which results in nonuniform distribution of nodes over an unequal cluster size. The load received by the Cluster head in the cluster distributes their traffic towards direct and multihop transmission based on the load distribution ratio. Also, we balance the energy consumption among the cluster heads to design an optimum load distribution ratio. Simulation result shows that this approach guarantees to increase the network lifetime, thereby balancing cluster head energy.

Although there is no ultimate consensus on radiation power levels and their respective impacts on human health, methods are necessary to reduce exposure as much as possible because of the rapid deployment of wireless communications systems. In our work we scrutinize the exposure reduction potential of the multi-hopping approach for two standardized but different wireless network types: IEEE 802.11b as a representative example for networks with distributed channel access control and HIPERLAN/2 as a representative example for centrally controlled networks. Our results show that multi-hopping has the potential to reduce the received electromagnetic power and energy for both network types although it suffers from a decreased network capacity. When attempting to compensate for this decrease by adapting the data rate used over an individual link, the ensuing transmission power adaptation required to maintain acceptable error rates does not necessarily neutralize the benefit of multi-hopping. We show that the sophisticated use of multi-hopping in conjunction with data rate adaption positively affects the received electromagnetic power and energy.	centralized computing;data rate units;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hop;mandatory access control;martin kay;mebibyte;megabit;overhead (computing);relay;simulation;software deployment;throughput;uncompressed video;usability	Jean-Pierre Ebert;Daniel Hollos;Holger Karl;Marc Löbbers	2005	Comput.

While network control overhead is an issue for many to most of such protocols, we present an approach that is virtually overhead-free. We introduce the implementation of an autonomous network coding implementation that can be implemented for existing applications and added over existing routing mechanisms with no need to change the application or networking protocols. We discuss and carefully evaluate the approach for applicability and gain according to the most prominent optimization metrics for WSN networking protocols. Especially, we consider the comparison of autonomous network coding to state-of-the-art collection protocols and multipath routing.

In this work, we study the problem of channel assignment in MRMC-WMN, and the optimization problem is known to be NP-complete. We propose a novel dynamic channel assignment scheme which can be performed in distributed manner. Moreover, our scheme is suitable for both unicast and multicast communication. The analysis and comparison demonstrates that our proposed scheme is feasible and more efficient compared with the existing distributed channel assignment schemes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.	mesh networking;wireless mesh network	Yan Xia;Zhenghu Gong;Yingzhi Zeng	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17587-9_3	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;wireless network;shared mesh;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	13.434310289737668	84.6167688466381	28319

Cost and coverage are the most key indexes for WSN applications. The differences in crop conditions are influenced by the spatial distribution of soil nutrients. If the nutrients are distributed evenly, the crop conditions are expected to be approximately uniform with little difference; on the contrary, there will be great differences in crop conditions. In accordance with the differences in the spatial distribution of soil information in farmland, fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to divide the farmland into several areas, where the soil fertility of each area is nearly uniform. Then the crop growth information in the area could be monitored with complete coverage by deploying a sensor node there, which could greatly decrease the deployed sensor nodes. Moreover, in order to accurately judge the optimal cluster number of fuzzy c-means clustering, a discriminant function for Normalized Intra-Cluster Coefficient of Variation (NICCV) was established. The sensitivity analysis indicates that NICCV is insensitive to the fuzzy weighting exponent, but it shows a strong sensitivity to the number of clusters.	cluster analysis;coefficient;deploy;discriminant;index;infertility study;node - plant part;nutrients;sensor node;statistical cluster	Naisen Liu;Weixing Cao;Yan Zhu;Jingchao Zhang;Fangrong Pang;Jun Ni	2015		10.3390/s151128314	environmental engineering;software deployment	Mobile	10.41913021318959	76.93971050228572	28322

We present a novel geographic routing protocol, named MDT, for 2D, 3D, and higher dimensions with these properties: (i) guaranteed delivery for any connected graph of nodes and physical links, and (ii) low routing stretch from efficient forwarding of packets out of local minima. The guaranteed delivery property holds for node locations specified by accurate, inaccurate, or arbitrary coordinates. The MDT protocol suite includes a packet forwarding protocol together with protocols for nodes to construct and maintain a distributed MDT graph for routing. We present the performance of MDT protocols in 3D and 4D as well as performance comparisons of MDT routing versus representative geographic routing protocols for nodes in 2D and 3D. Experimental results show that MDT provides the lowest routing stretch in the comparisons. Furthermore, MDT protocols are specially designed to handle churn, i.e., dynamic topology changes due to addition and deletion of nodes and links. Experimental results show that MDT's routing success rate is close to 100% during churn and node states converge quickly to a correct MDT graph after churn.	connectivity (graph theory);converge;geographic routing;maxima and minima;mobile data terminal;model-based testing;network packet;protocol stack;spaces	Simon S.

It provides near-hitless recovery when coding is performed on connections with the same destination node. When the coding structure is extended to cover the primary paths, diversity coding can achieve higher capacity efficiency than its conventional version and other restoration techniques. In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to implement the diversity coding structures for pre-provisioning with coding of the protection and primary paths. In addition, we present an algorithm to map these coding structures into arbitrary topologies. We present simulation results that show capacity efficiency of diversity coding.	algorithm;circuit restoration;heuristic (computer science);optical mesh network;provisioning;secure copy;simulation	Serhat Nazim Avci;Ender Ayanoglu	2012	2012 International Symposium on Network Coding (NetCod)	10.1109/NETCOD.2012.6261895	linear network coding;simulation;geography;telecommunications;multiple description coding;communication	Theory	18.004464773377883	81.37723122142317	28402

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Channel Beacon Train (MCBT) protocol in which coordinator nodes send trains of beacons on all channels at random instants during the inactive part of a superframe, so that nodes entering the network can quickly acquire the network parameters or routing metrics and join the network.

bb864ffe8318d21c732a9d92740cc41939932d8d	a power efficiency routing and maintenance protocol in wireless multi-hop networks	signal strength;path maintenance mechanism;wireless multi hop network;power aware routing;transmission bandwidth;power consumption	In wireless multi-hop networks, selecting a path that has a high transmission bandwidth or a high delivery rate of packets can reduce power consumption and shorten transmission delay during data transmission. There are two factors that influence the transmission bandwidth: the signal strength of the received packets and contentions in the contention-based MAC layer. These two factors may cause more power to be consumed during data transmission. We analyze these two factors and propose a power-aware routing protocol called MTPCR. MTPCR discovers the desired routing path that has reduced power consumption during data transmission. In addition to finding a desired path to reduce power consumption, MTPCR also takes into account the situations in which the transmission bandwidth of the routing path may decrease, resulting in much power consumption during data transmission because of the mobility of nodes in a network. MTPCR is thus useful in a network: it analyzes power consumption during data transmission with the help of neighboring nodes, and it uses a path maintenance mechanism to maintain good path bandwidth. The density of nodes in a network is used to determine when to activate the path maintenance mechanism in order to reduce the overhead of this mechanism. With the proposed path maintenance mechanism, power consumption during data transmission can be efficiently reduced, as well as the number of path breakages. In our simulation, we compared our proposed routing protocol, MTPCR, with the following protocols: two classical routing protocols, AODV and DSR; two power-aware routing protocols, MMBCR and xMBCR; and one multiple path routing protocol, PAMP. The comparisons are made in terms of throughput of the routing path, power consumption in path discovery, power consumption in data transmission, and network lifetime.	ansi escape code;overhead (computing);performance per watt;routing;simulation;throughput	Ching-Wen Chen;Chuan-Chi Weng	2012	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/j.jss.2011.07.012	signal strength;private network-to-network interface;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;engineering;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.860127979955046	82.99108818870411	28479

However, among land networks in the United States, the demand for data is growing at a rapid annual rate of 20 percent, while demand for voice has slowed to less than 5 percent. Currently, the demand for voice is fueling the expansion to digital techniques in cellular. Since even conservative estimates indicate several million portable computers and fax units will be in use within the next few years, demand for mobile data is certain to grow. Once again, we are faced with the challenge of incorporating data into networks designed for voice. Analog cellular solutions cater to data but only within the constraints of channels established for voice communication. Digital cellular systems, however, are planned to exist as integrated services networks, and data must be given adequate consideration in the early definition of these networks. This requirement will have a significant impact on the architecture and signaling in digital cellular systems across the globe.	fax;integrated circuit;integrated services;portable computer;requirement	Jay Jayapalan;Mike Burke	1994	IEEE Personal Communications	10.1109/MPC.1994.298465	gsm;cellular network;electronic circuit;telecommunications;computer science;forward error correction;radio frequency;fading;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	22.997877972665684	82.53534635885114	28486

In the absence of a central controlling entity and due to its dynamic network topology, the problem of controlling the network communications in an energy-efficient way is non-trivial in ad hoc networks. The problem is elevated due to the wireless nature of the communication, where a large amount of energy expenditure in the nodes is due to overhearing packets not meant for themselves. In this paper, we introduce battery-aware routing metrics which not only take care of the battery reserve in the nodes in the routes, but also the number of neighbors these nodes can potentially interfere, and the energy reserve of these neighbors, such that the energy due to overhearing is minimized throughout the network, specially when the neighbors are battery-deficient.	care-of address;hoc (programming language);network packet;network topology;routing;sleep mode;throughput	Nirisha Shrestha	2007	27th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW'07)	10.1109/ICDCSW.2007.69	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	6.606569165342972	81.00359308877076	28524

Among existing localization algorithms, DV-Hop algorithm can estimate the location of nodes using the estimated distance of nodes without any additional devices to measure range information. However, DV-Hop is not accurate in estimating the geographic location of nodes because the average size for one hop is calculated without considering the positioning error and the path configuration between nodes. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on DV-Hop algorithm is proposed for the approach to estimating the average size of a hop by minimizing anchor's positioning error using Least Squares Estimation with other anchors. Moreover, unknown nodes have their own average hop size for one hop to alleviate the location error of the unknown occurring as more than the minimum hop count for the distance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the DV-Hop algorithm in location estimation.	algorithm;geographic coordinate system;hoc (programming language);hop;internationalization and localization;least squares;simulation	Sang-Woo Lee;Dong-Yul Lee;Chaewoo Lee	2010		10.1145/2108616.2108698	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	16.37306368751005	75.04082315623175	28576

In a typical outdoor scenario the propagation of the radio signal can be affected by several factors like the rainfall, foliage, path loss effect and fading effect. The outdoor wireless sensor network can experience QoS variation due to these environmental catastrophes. The QoS can be affected by many factors like packet delivery rate, jitter, latency, delay etc. The performance of a wireless sensor network is mostly characterized with the packet delivery rate. Hence we aim to maximize the packet delivery rate by minimizing packet error rate for improving the QoS. This paper accords an optimized frequency selection for any outdoor wireless sensor networks which can wane the packet error rate at any worst environmental conditions through real data analysis.	bit error rate;network packet;quality of service;radio wave;software propagation	Maneesha Vinodini Ramesh;Parvathy Rajan;P.

Like in most OSes, networking, cryptography, and other daily routines require local random input of very low predictability. Generating unclonable individual numbers on microcontrollers, though, is surprisingly hard, since most devices run on a deterministic clock and show almost no distinguishing features. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are a promising class of solutions to this problem. They extract unique or reconfigurable output from individual hardware properties.

We prove that BGPSep_S guarantees complete visibility in normal situations. And the performance of BGPSep_S is evaluated on several real-world backbone topologies. Experimental results show that the maximum degrees of the IBGP topologies generated by BGPSep_S for these IGP topologies can be reduced by about 27%-68%, compared with full mesh and BGPSep.	algorithm;border gateway protocol	Xicheng Lu;Peidong Zhu;Jinjing Zhao	2006		10.1007/11947950_42	separator;visibility;computer science;distributed computing;shortest path problem;algorithm	Vision	-3.419398595638695	75.4545575506205	28709

There are many important sensor network design problems where the physical dimensionality of the network plays a significant role. One such problem is determining how to deploy minimum number of sensor nodes so that all points inside the network is within the sensing range of at least one sensor and all sensor nodes can communicate with each other, possibly over a multi-hop path. The solution to this problem depends on the ratio of the communication range and the sensing range of each sensor. Under sphere-based communication and sensing model, placing a node at the center of each virtual cell created by truncated octahedron-based tessellation solves this problem when this ratio is greater than 1.7889. However, for smaller values of this ratio, the solution depends on how much communication redundancy the network needs. We provide solutions for both limited and full communication redundancy requirements. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.		S. M. Nazrul Alam;Zygmunt J.

We developed a Tool for Automated INsertion of Trojans (TAINT) providing numerous benefits. First, TAINT can evaluate FPGA based designs against known and unknown attacks. Second, TAINT can insert Trojans at different stages in the FPGA based design cycle such as the Register-Transfer Logic and the post-synthesis translate, map, and route. Moreover, TAINT offers fine-grained controls to a user to precisely insert Trojans in particular FPGA resources. Most importantly, TAINT can automate Trojan Testing. Our experiments will use TAINT to explore the attack spaces at the pre-and post-synthesis stages of a FPGA design.	experiment;field-programmable gate array;ibm notes;register-transfer level;through-hole technology;trojan horse (computing)	Vinayaka Jyothi;Prashanth Krishnamurthy;Farshad Khorrami;Ramesh Karri	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)	10.1109/ICCD.2017.95	real-time computing;hardware trojan;embedded system;trojan;field-programmable gate array;computer science	EDA	11.810750707335622	62.05284099097123	28792

The objective is to propose a cross-layer optimized forwarding scheme to maximize the Successful Transmission Rate (STR) while satisfying the given end-to-end energy consumption constraint. The channel coding, energy allocation, and route planning are jointly considered to improve the STR. After formulating the problem as a local stochastic optimization, we propose a low-complexity distributed scheme to reduce the implementation complexity. We show by simulations that the proposed scheme can achieve much higher STR in comparison with existed energy-efficient routing protocols, in which no joint design is considered.	algorithm;channel capacity;code;coupling (computer programming);end-to-end principle;form;forward error correction;mimo;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;portable document format;region of interest;relay;routing;sensor;simulation;stochastic optimization	Yan Zhang;Lingyang Song;Wenqing Yao	2010	2010 The 5th Annual ICST Wireless Internet Conference (WICON)		real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;stochastic optimization;statistics;computer network	Embedded	16.292427467438074	81.12427434517554	28858

An accurate planning of indoor radio networks and/or the setup of localization procedures based on IEEE 802.11 requires the characterization of the propagation channel. Starting from experimental data obtained in the campus area of the University of Rome Tor Vergata we evaluated the parameters for different multiwall (MVV) like path loss models. Differently from the standard MW model indicated in the literature, we included losses due to doors and fire proof doors that according to their status, open or closed, may lead to significant contributions to the overall attenuation. The developed channel model was used in a computer simulator for the optimal positioning of the access points inside the campus' buildings.	algorithm;channel (communications);computer simulation;internationalization and localization;mathematical model;microwave;minimal working example;multiply-with-carry;network planning and design;software propagation;systems design;tor messenger;wireless access point	Andrea Borrelli;Cristiano Monti;Marco Vari;Franco Mazzenga	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE Cat.

By exploiting the geometrical relations among the MS, scatterers, and the single base station, we present a Geometric Characteristics Based (GCB) localization algorithm with ROS model which provides conditional information for accurate location estimation of MS and scatterers. Simulation results illustrate the superior performance of proposed algorithm in typical NLOS environments.

In this paper we introduce Partial DDL, a technique in which DDL is applied only to a part of the cryptographic hardware implementation. We propose principle rules for Partial DDL to guide the designer in how to split up a circuit into DDL protected and unprotected paths. In order to validate our approach we implemented a lightweight architecture of AES in the Partial Separated Dynamic Differential Logic (Partial SDDL) for FPGAs. The results show that our implementation with Partial SDDL is as resistant to DPA as a full SDDL implementation while it consumes only 76% of the total area occupied by the full SDDL design. This is an area increase of 2.3 times over an unprotected single ended design.	cipher;cryptography;field-programmable gate array;glitch;information leakage;security descriptor definition language;spectral leakage	Jens-Peter Kaps;Rajesh Velegalati	2010	2010 18th IEEE Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines	10.1109/FCCM.2010.49	embedded system;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;field-programmable gate array	Arch	12.521520664704411	62.827510013812365	28966

Since the number of wireless devices is incessantly increasing, it is frequently possible to establish a spontaneous cooperative cluster in the close proximity of any wireless device. These devices forming the cluster are connected to both a cellular-based network such as WiMAX, 3G, or LTE and a short-range network based on technologies such as WLAN, Zigbee, Bluetooh, or UWB, among other possibilities. The main idea behind the proposed MC-ARQ scheme is that, upon transmission error through the cellular interface, retransmission can be requested from the wireless grid surrounding the destination device using the short-range interface instead of the primary cellular link. Therefore, besides the cooperative diversity attained with C-ARQ schemes, the traffic load in the cellular interface is reduced benefiting thus a high number of users and reducing both energy consumption and interference. The Persistent Relay Carrier Sensing Medium Access (PRCSMA) protocol is presented as an example of solution for the MAC layer in this emerging new topic.		Jesus Alonso-Zarate;Elli Kartsakli;Marcos D.

In contrast, the traditional packet forward mechanism is more flexible than the former in terms of dynamic packet forwarding routing. In this paper, we put forward an adaptation routing mechanismARM for short of combination of packet forward with virtual circuits that is based on combination of the advantages of these transmission mechanisms. It can overcome the shortcomings of static and manual configurations in the MPLS mechanism. The experimental results show that it can not only improve the packet forwarding speed without replacing the router hardware, but also has advantages in reducing load pressure of partial nodes in the network topology and optimizing the partial or entire network transmission performance.	routing;virtual circuit	Xianming Gao;Xiaozhe Zhang;Zexin Lu;Shicong Ma	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41428-2_24	routing table;virtual routing and forwarding;link state packet;routing;real-time computing;forwarding information base;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;processing delay;packet forwarding;transmission delay;virtual circuit;packet switch;computer network	Arch	-0.4393609609424296	84.41189713089166	29124

Given these paths, it is possible to use aggressive techniques to reduce the average value and variability of the response time for short, critical messages. One technique is to send a copy of a packet over an alternate path before it is known whether the first copy failed or was delayed. A second technique is to split a single stream of packets over multiple paths. The authors analyze both approaches and show that they can provide significant improvements over conventional, conservative mechanisms. >		Ben Kao;Hector Garcia-Molina;Daniel Barbará	1994	IEEE Trans.

Second, the protocol is loop-free: starting from any state where a spanning tree is present, the protocol stabilizes, without forming any loops, to a state where a maximal tree is present. The stabilization time of this protocol is Oðn degÞ, where n is the number of nodes, and deg is the node degree in the network. # 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)	file spanning;maximal set;metrics (networking);routing;spanning tree	Jorge Arturo Cobb;Mohamed G.

Memristive technologies are attractive due to their nonvolatility, scalability, and compatibility with CMOS. Numerous physical experiments have shown the existence of a threshold voltage in some physical memristors. Additionally, as shown in this brief, some applications require voltage-controlled memristors to operate properly. In this brief, a Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor (VTEAM) model is proposed to describe the behavior of voltage-controlled memristors. The VTEAM model extends the previously proposed ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor (TEAM) model, which describes current-controlled memristors. The VTEAM model has similar advantages as the TEAM model, i.e., it is simple, general, and flexible, and can characterize different voltage-controlled memristors. The VTEAM model is accurate (below 1.5% in terms of the relative root-mean-square error) and computationally efficient as compared with existing memristor models and experimental results describing different memristive technologies.	algorithmic efficiency;cmos;experiment;logic gate;memristor;neuromorphic engineering;spice;scalability;simulation;verilog;verilog-a	Shahar Kvatinsky;Misbah Ramadan;Eby G.

In this paper we propose TC-ADHOC MAC, a medium access algorithm with topology control capabilities. The proposed algorithm aims at maintaining the minimum number of bidirectional neighbors of any wireless terminal very close to a certain connectivity threshold. The correctness of the algorithm is evaluated through detailed simulation and several test on the impact of different algorithm parameters are carried out in static network scenarios. Furthermore, the ability of TC-ADHOC MAC of reusing the radio resources is assessed by a detailed simulation in a dynamic traffic environment. Our results show that the topology control solution integrated at the MAC layer helps increasing the channel reuse and, consequently, the network efficiency.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);heart rate variability;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);maximum power transfer theorem;performance;simulation;topology control	Flaminio Borgonovo;Luca Campelli;Matteo Cesana	2006	I.

While many routing protocols have been developed to find and maintain routes based on a best-effort service model, quality-of-service (QoS) routing in an ad-hoc network is difficult because the network topology may change constantly and the available state information for routing is inherently imprecise. In this paper, we discuss how to support QoS routing in OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing Protocol, one of the routing protocols under study by the IETF MANET Working Group). We develop heuristics that allow OLSR to find the maximum bandwidth path, show through simulation that these heuristics do improve OLSR in the static network case, and finally, we prove that for our ad-hoc network model, two of the heuristics are indeed optimal (i.e., guarantee that the highest-bandwidth path between any two nodes is found).	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);best-effort delivery;cyclic redundancy check;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;network model;network topology;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);quality of service;residue number system;simulation	Ying Ge;Thomas Kunz;Louise Lamont	2003		10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174847	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-2.42368420009665	83.49026623022783	29437

Most existing work mainly focuses on weak greedy routing over geographic location network or strong greedy routing over greedy embedding network. It is a difficult job and needs much cost to obtain geographic location or greedy embedding of the network. We propose a light-weight Tree-based graph embedding (TGE) for sensor networks. Over the TGE, we design a weak greedy routing protocol, TGR. TGR can archive good performance on path stretch factor and load balance factor.	archive;geographic coordinate system;graph embedding;greedy algorithm;greedy embedding;load balancing (computing);routing	Zhigang Li;Nong Xiao	2010	Wireless Sensor Network	10.4236/wsn.2010.29082	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;mathematical optimization;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;greedy algorithm;graph embedding;zone routing protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;machine learning;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing	Mobile	5.6423192641786395	78.36444740695607	29480

Minimum latency broadcast scheduling (MLBS) aims to achieve a schedule to broadcast messages with a minimum latency. In duty-cycle networks, a node alternates between active and sleep states, which causes decrease in energy consumption at the cost of increased broadcast latency. An existing scheme mathematically remodels the MLBS problem for duty-cycled WSNs and proposes a vector integration algorithm to solve the problem. In this paper, we propose a broadcast scheduling scheme by first finding critical-paths in a duty-cycled WSN. By scheduling transmissions with a preference of nodes in the critical-path, the proposed scheme reduces the broadcast latency as shown in the simulation results.	algorithm;duty cycle;scheduling (computing);simulation	Giyeol Im;Duc Tai Le;Hyunseung Choo;Dongsoo S.

a091864ef08b3f7431452fb339e6fcc053fba8bd	an analysis of the collection tree protocol (ctp) in mobile sensing environments		The Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) is widely used for data collection in wireless sensor network applications due to its simplicity and its capability to dynamically adapt to ad-hoc changes in the network even though it is designed for static networks. With the increasing deployment of mobile wireless sensor networks, the performance of this scheme in mobile scenarios becomes extremely important. The motivation in using collection style protocols in mobile sensor networks is that the sensors primarily send data to key collecting nodes, and often there is no need for the more complex Mobile and Ad hoc routing protocols that are typically used in MANETs or the formation of clusters. Our objective in this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the shortcomings of CTP in mobile scenarios, and to propose changes to CTP to improve its performance in mobile scenarios. This is done by a comprehensive simulation study of CTP's performance in mobile sensor environments, and identify root causes for its performance degradation in mobile scenarios. We also study the impact of introducing a mix of mobile and fixed nodes in a CTP network and evaluate how their presence improves network performance.

In this paper, in order to evaluate the feasibility of SDR modems, we study the amount of computing throughput of a recent wireless system and determine a suitable modem architecture. Firstly, the functions for which SDR techniques provide significant benefits are clarified. Secondly, the computing throughputs are measured under the assumption that a dynamically reconfigurable processor, FlexSword™, is employed. Finally, based on a consideration of timing charts, we propose the architecture of an SDR-based modem with FlexSword. The possibility of implementing several wireless systems is also considered.	cognitive radio;modem;reconfigurable computing	Ren Sakata;Daisuke Takeda;Noritaka Deguchi;Tatsuma Hirano;Takashi Yoshikawa	2012	IEICE Transactions		embedded system;cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;software-defined radio;computer network	Visualization	20.423823219679093	85.6279880140875	29547

These correlations bring significant potential advantages for the development of efficient strategies for reducing energy consumption. In this paper, spatial data correlations are exploited to design clusterbased routing algorithms of high data aggregation efficiency. We define the problem of selecting the set of cluster heads as the weighted connected dominating set problem. Then we develop a set of centralized approximation algorithms to select the cluster heads. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the designed algorithms.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;connected dominating set;data aggregation;routing;simulation	Chongqing Zhang	2010	JCM	10.4304/jcm.5.3.232-238	wireless routing protocol;embedded system;routing;ant colony optimization algorithms;wireless sensor network;dominating set;computer science;dynamic source routing;data mining;distributed computing;spatial analysis;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;cluster analysis;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.206208808396715	79.31607201622015	29766

It is however beyond the scope of these routing protocols to transfer messages along the reverse path, i.e., from the sink to individual nodes in the network. In this paper, we present CBFR, a novel routing scheme that builds upon collection protocols to enable efficient point-to-point communication. We propose the use of space-efficient data structures known as Bloom filters to efficiently store routing tables on the networked devices. In particular, each node in the collection tree stores the addresses of its direct and indirect child nodes in its local Bloom filter. A packet is forwarded down-tree only if the node's local filter indicates the presence of the packet's destination address among the node's descendants. In order to cater for the presence of mobile nodes, we apply the concept of counting Bloom filters to allow for the removal of elements from the filter by means of gradual forgetting. The effectiveness of our approach in achieving both high delivery rates and low overhead is demonstrated by means of simulations and experiments.	bloom filter;bounce address;data structure;experiment;gradual typing;memory management;network packet;overhead (computing);point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);reachability;routing table;scalability;simulation;software propagation;software release life cycle;tinyos;tree (data structure)	Andreas Reinhardt;Olivia Morar;Silvia Santini;Sebastian Zöller;Ralf Steinmetz	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263685	wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;embedded system;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;source routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;tree;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.9223053883144856	81.39832444503213	29769

Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), which caters to a large number of low-data rate and low-cost devices, is such an use case. Smart utility meters, automated sensors in farms, and vehicle tracking nodes for logistics monitoring are all examples of emerging mMTC devices. Ensuring efficient mechanisms to access the wireless channel for such a massive number of densely deployed devices is the key challenge posed by mMTC applications. A framework for the analysis of the one-stage massive access protocol is proposed in this paper, which allows to model and evaluate its performance with respect to important performance metrics for mMTC services.	compaq lte;logistics;monte carlo method;next-generation network;qualitative comparative analysis;random access;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;smart tv;traffic collision avoidance system;uncompressed video;vehicle tracking system	Nurul Huda Mahmood;Nuno Pratas;Thomas Jacobsen;Preben E.

This is especially true in the logistics domain, where timely and accurate monitoring of containers is required, while the cost pressure is high. Thus, besides the need for energy efficiency, wireless sensor network deployments in logistics require cost efficiency as well. As data transmission represents the most expensive operation in terms of energy consumption and monetary costs, we present a concept for the local determination of transmission relevance in this paper. By omitting irrelevant events from transmission, the amount of data to transmit is effectively reduced. Our approach employs concepts from the business economics sector and is based on the use of scoresheets, which evaluate information on a wireless sensor node to decide whether they are “worth” transmitting or not. Thus, a scoresheet-based approach provides a viable solution for local filtering to realize energy- and cost-efficient operation of a wireless sensor network while maintaining the benefits of data fidelity and real-time event notifications.	application domain;cost efficiency;logistics;real-time transcription;real-time web;relevance;sensor node;transmitter	Sebastian Zöller;Andreas Reinhardt;Stefan Schulte;Ralf Steinmetz	2011	2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks	10.1109/LCN.2011.6115190	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Embedded	11.152170257612932	74.54006214722075	29811

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is an emerging technology which can be deployed with SHM applications. However, some system requirements have been overlooked in the current WSN designs for SHM applications. Therefore a complete analysis in system requirements is needed for WSN for SHM. In this paper, the system requirements posed by SHM applications are considered to assess potential candidates for the protocols in WSN for SHM. Based on that, we show that none of the commonly available protocols satisfy all the requirements associated with SHM systems. Hence, it is necessary to modify the existing protocols or design an entirely new protocol to completely satisfy the requirements of WSN for SHM application.	communications protocol;requirement;super high material cd;system requirements	Sumudu Wijetunge;Upul Gunawardana;Ranjith Liyanapathirana	2010	2010 17th International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/ICTEL.2010.5478798	communications protocol;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer security;computer network	Embedded	6.329026174953963	72.79281882531886	29823

After random deployment, the sensors are required to disperse autonomously without central control to maximize the coverage and re-establish the connectivity of the network. In this paper, we propose a Physarum inspired self-healing autonomous network connectivity restoration algorithm that minimize movement overhead and keep load balance. The mechanism to select the alternative nodes only involves the one-hop information table, and depends on actor node location from base station (regions of k-influence), and residual energy. Our model achieved almost complete coverage, and fault repair in one or two rounds with minimal number of movement overhead.	circuit restoration	AbuBakr Awad;Wei Pang;George Macleod Coghill	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-97982-3_27	residual;software deployment;wireless;load balancing (computing);distributed computing;physarum polycephalum;internet of things;base station;physarum;computer science	Mobile	8.009375701535662	78.5536439751423	29913

These clusters can be built at a much lower cost than traditional supercomputers of comparable performance. A key decision that will greatly affect the overall performance of the cluster is the method used to connect the nodes together. Choosing the best interconnect and topology is not at all trivial since performance and cost will change as the system size is scaled. This paper presents throughput models used for the analysis and comparison of performance in two leading System Area Networks (SANs), Myrinet and Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI). First, analytical models for throughput are developed by determining the theoretical bandwidth of all internal buses and links that are part of the interconnect architecture. Then, experiments are conducted to measure the actual bandwidth available at each of these components, and the models are calibrated so they accurately represent the experimental results. Finally, the models are used to compare the maximum throughput of Myrinet and SCI systems with respect to system size and overall dollar cost.	bandwidth (signal processing);bus (computing);coherent;computer;experiment;image scaling;maximum throughput scheduling;parallel computing;supercomputer	Sarp Millich;Alan D.

3cbb40db6639737f979a1dea38871ad4c3267193	congestion control mechanism for intermittently connected wireless network		Based on the “storing-carrying-forwarding” transmission manner, the packets are forwarded flexibly in Intermittently Connected Wireless Network (ICWN). However, due to its limited resources, ICWN can easily become congested as a large number of packets entering into it. In such situation, the network performance is seriously deteriorated. To solve this problem, we propose a congestion controlmechanism that is based on the network state dynamic perception. Specifically, through estimating the congestion riskwhen a node receives packets, ICWN can reduce the probability of becoming congested. Moreover, due to ICWN’s network dynamics, we determine the congestion risk threshold by jointly taking into account the average packet size, average forwarding risk, and available buffer resources. Further, we also evaluate the service ability of a node in a distributed manner by integrating the recommendation information from other intermediate nodes. Additionally, a node is selected as a relay node according to both the congestion risk and service ability. Simulation results show that the network performance can be greatly optimized by reducing the overhead of packet forwarding.	network congestion;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);relay;simulation	Ruyan Wang;Yang Tang;Junjie Yan	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/4819349	network traffic control;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;distributed computing;packet forwarding;packet loss;network congestion;slow-start;computer network	Metrics	4.9516749578542605	84.59603235520594	30021

So, by caching the frequently accessed data item within MANET, it is possible to reduce the cost of accessing the same data from the external source. In this perspective, an effective data cache mechanism is proposed by Paul et al., using the distributed spanning tree as a communication structure to lessen network overload. As an enhancement, ant colony optimisation technique has been applied on DST to cope with the fragile nature of the MANET. In this paper, a theoretical model has been formulated to assess the performance factors such as cooperative cache, mobility and hand-off and routing technique. In addition to these, the performance improvement of DCM in MANET has been proved experimentally using cache hit and data consistency using appropriate simulation.	cache (computing);quality of service	N.

First, the WSN model was established based on field theory with vectors and operators to analyze the transfer process of message packets given that the source node in such networks is characterized by source points while the sink node can be regarded as a gathering point. Second, a vector routing algorithm was developed for a WSN that was modeled according to field theory. Finally, the WSN routing algorithm was simulated in given two scenarios; simulation results show that throughput can be significantly increased by choosing routes such that traffic is spread as uniformly as possible throughout the network.	algorithm;routing	Ming Li;Huanyan Qian	2016	iJOE		policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;embedded system;routing;static routing;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;backpressure routing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Embedded	6.950554172260976	81.52700633152584	30270

In this paper, we discuss this problem under a mobile environment with limited capacity of wireless links. The assignment problem is to schedule a group of related objects from a resource-constrained mobile device to its powerful proxy machine so that program activity migrates among processors as execution proceeds, and hence the overall performance will improve. First, we reduce this optimization problem to the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, and therefore show that it is NP-hard. Second, two heuristic algorithms are proposed.

These routings use greedy modes or forwarding paths to forward packets. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular network such as frequently changed topology, vehicles density and radio obstacles, could create local maximum, sparse connectivity and network partitions. We propose GeoSVR, a geographic stateless routing combined with node location and digital map. The proposed GeoSVR scheme enhances forwarding path to solve local maximum and sparse connectivity problem, and the proposed restricted forwarding algorithm overcomes unreliable wireless channel issues. In our study, simulations and real world experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed solution. Our results show GeoSVR can provide higher packet delivery ratio with comparable latency to other geographic routing schemes.	routing;stateless protocol	Yong Xiang;Zheng Liu;Ruilin Liu;Weizhen Sun;Wei Wang	2013	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2012.02.015	routing table;virtual routing and forwarding;routing;static routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;ip forwarding;maxima and minima;distributed computing;packet forwarding;forwarding plane;reverse path forwarding;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.576387222799926	83.2053628516229	30392

Independent progress support in messaging layer, network interface offload capability and application usage of non-blocking communications are believed to increase overlap and yield performance benefits. In this paper, we analyze four MPI implementations on top of three high-speed interconnects (InfiniBand, Myrinet and iWARP Ethernet) in their ability to support overlap and communication progress. The results confirm that the offload ability needs to be supported with communication progress to increase the level of overlap. Our progress engine micro-benchmark results show that in all examined networks transferring small messages makes an acceptable level of progress and overlap. On the other hand, in most cases, transferring large messages does not make progress independently, decreasing the chances of overlap in applications.	benchmark (computing);blocking (computing);computation;electrical connection;iwarp;infiniband;instant messaging;network interface controller;non-blocking algorithm;overlap–add method	Mohammad J.

The first contribution of this paper is the architecture based on a feedback control loop that enforces desired relative delays among classes via dynamic connection scheduling and process reallocation. The second contribution is our use of feedback control theory to design the feedback loop with proven performance guarantees. In contrast with ad hoc approaches that often rely on laborious tuning and design iterations, our control theory approach enables us to systematically design an adaptive web server with established analytical methods. The design methodology includes using system identification to establish a dynamic model, and using the Root Locus method to design a feedback controller to satisfy performance specifications of a web server. The adaptive architecture has been implemented by modifying an Apache web server. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive server achieves robust relative delay guarantees even when workload varies significantly. Properties of our adaptive web server include guaranteed stability, and satisfactory efficiency and accuracy in achieving the desired relative delay differentiation.	adaptive architecture;control system;control theory;feedback;hoc (programming language);hypertext transfer protocol;iteration;locus;mathematical model;scheduling (computing);server (computing);system identification;web server	Chenyang Lu;Tarek F.

Although wormhole routing offers high throughput in an uncongested network, its throughput sharply drops whenever there is a congestion or blocking. In this paper, we present a new flow control technique, called header population based flow control (HP), for direct networks employing wormhole switching. When the traffic of a node increases, HP takes two actions: (1) it prevents the local processor of the node from injecting a new packet if the number of header flits in the router reaches a given injection threshold, and (2) among those header flits requesting the same output channel of the router, it selects the header flit whose buffer is filled with more flits if the number of header flits in the router reaches a given selection threshold. We have conducted extensive simulations to compare the network performance with and without HP in the networks using wormhole switching. Our simulation results show that HP improves network throughput significantly at high network traffic without sacrificing network latency. This paper also introduces an analytical model and derives a closed form expression for network latency when HP is used along with wormhole switching in direct networks. This model is validated through simulations and is found to agree closely with simulations.	flow control (data);parallel computing	Hasan Çam	1999	Journal of Systems and Software	10.1016/S0164-1212(99)00020-5	high-throughput screening;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;flow control;network performance;computer network	Arch	-4.474135258217967	88.00474269768016	30541

The proposed approach is based on multi level discrete set concept in order to find a fault free shortest path among several paths provided. We also prove our fault tolerant routing algorithm to have the best performance among fault tolerant routing algorithms in Hyper-de Bruijn network.	algorithm;de bruijn graph;failure cause;fault tolerance;high-level programming language;integrated circuit;multi-storey car park;routing;shortest path problem;very-large-scale integration	Ngoc Chi Nguyen;Thanh Vu Dinh	2013	2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583660	routing;fault tolerance;parallel computing;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;very-large-scale integration;link-state routing protocol;computer network;integrated circuit design	EDA	0.21913565005592756	68.64138777660915	30606

The high costs associated with the installation and maintenance of RSUs, however, keep these units from seeing widespread deployment. One approach to this problem is for cars to be used opportunistically as RSUs, and in urban areas, the presence of large numbers of parked cars make these entities promising candidates for establishing vehicular support networks. In this paper we introduce new methods for parked cars to self-organize and act as a support network to the existing urban vehicular network, alleviating the need for costly deployments of fixed road-side units. Our approach considers parked cars that can both complement existing fixed RSUs and take the role of RSUs themselves, improving the network's performance on multiple applications. We show that even a small number of parked cars can bring considerable improvements to the network, and that our proposed methods for self-organization create support networks of parked cars that can cover the urban area with an optimal numbers of vehicles.	algorithm;autonomous car;digital distribution;dynamic programming;entity;map;mathematical optimization;relay;self-organization;simulation;software deployment;window of opportunity	Andre B.

These TOA estimates can then be used to solve for the location of the MS. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the location of the MS directly by incorporating the received signals at all APs in a direct estimator of position. This article presents a deeper analysis of a previously proposed maximum likelihood (ML)-TOA estimator, including a uniqueness property and the behavior in nonline-of-sight (NLOS) situations. Then, a ML direct location estimation technique utilizing all received signals at the various APs is proposed based on the ML-TOA estimator. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used as a performance reference for the ML direct location estimator.	multipath propagation;time of arrival;wireless access point	Chia-Pang Yen;Peter J.

Nevertheless, it is a big challenge to transfer the broadcast frames over the IEEE 802.11 based multi-hopad hocwireless networks due to the high bit error rate, the high collision probability, and the lake of acknowledgement (ACK). Unfortunately, most of routing protocols need the broadcast function to exchange important information between nodes. From our observations, the efficiency of the routing protocol, such as DSR and AODV, finding the path from source to destination is strongly depending on the supported broadcast scheme in the underlying media access control (MAC) protocol. In this paper, we will first investigate the uncertain broadcast problem in the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol while delivering the necessary broadcast frames. Since no acknowledgement will be sent by any recipient of the broadcast frame in IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, we will propose a highly reliable broadcast scheme to solve such uncertain problem. The proposed scheme, which is still compatible with standard, can efficiently minimize bandwidth consumption as well as propagation delay.	ansi escape code;access control;acknowledgement (data networks);bit error rate;broadcast domain;hoc (programming language);network packet;propagation delay;routing;scheme;software propagation	Shiann-Tsong Sheu;Yihjia Tsai;Jenhui Chen	2002		10.1109/ICC.2002.996925	ieee 802.11s;broadcast domain;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;switching loop;telecommunications;computer science;virtual lan;distributed computing;routing protocol;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer network;terminating reliable broadcast	Mobile	1.4759896266137262	83.6437654821655	30838

Low delivery delay is essential for the transmission of real time media. In this paper, we propose a method to decide optimal locations of repair proxies that minimizes the mean delivery delay of all receivers in heterogeneous network using a dynamic programming approach. The evaluation results of our optimal proposal in a simulation topology show that the mean delivery delay of all receivers can be reduced by about 10ms in network size of 1000 nodes. Our method can be used by network providers in order to reduce delivery delay in their HRM network.	dynamic programming;human race machine;multicast;numerical analysis;numerical method;proxy server;randomness;relocation (computing);simulation	Sang-Seon Byun;Chuck Yoo	2006		10.1007/11751588_126	best-effort delivery;transmission time;routing;real-time computing;multicast;heterogeneous network;internationalization and localization;reliable multicast;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;network delay;server;computer network	Metrics	-3.4249885790822074	77.15359059261216	30899

In the seminal work on SLP, phantom routing was proposed as a viable approach to address SLP. However, recent work has shown some limitations of phantom routing such as poor performance with multiple sources. In this paper, we propose phantom walkabouts, a novel version and more general version of phantom routing, which performs phantom routes of variable lengths. Through extensive simulations we show that phantom walkabouts provides high SLP levels with a low message overhead and hence, low energy usage.	computational human phantom;imaging phantom;overhead (computing);phantom reference;routing;simulation;superword level parallelism	Chen Gu;Matthew Bradbury;Arshad Jhumka	2017		10.1145/3019612.3019732	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	7.586666314647893	85.70698087936726	30922

However, the single path is easily broken and needs to perform a route discovery process again due to the dynamic topology of ad hoc networks. In ad hoc networks, multipath routing is better suited than single path in stability and load balance. Because mobile nodes have limited battery power, it is therefore very important to use energy in a MANETs efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new routing algorithm called grid-based energy aware node-disjoint multipath routing algorithm (GEANDMRA). In GEANDMRA, grid partitioning is the same as in the GRID routing protocol. The main difference between these two protocols is that GEANDMRA considers energy- aware and node-disjoint multipath but the GRID does not. Simulation results indicate that GEANDMRA outperforms AODV and DSR.	ansi escape code;algorithm;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);multipath propagation;multipath routing;simulation	Zhengyu Wu;Xiangjun Dong;Lin Cui	2007	Third International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2007)	10.1109/ICNC.2007.40	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.0466232887345575	82.75535100808138	30929
3caa18e524a945a09087b7cc53ef133fabb36c99	a distributed monitoring strategy for detecting version number attacks in rpl-based networks		The Internet of Things is characterized by the large-scale deployment of low power and lossy networks (LLN), interconnecting pervasive objects. The routing protocol for LLN (RPL) protocol has been standardized by IETF to enable a lightweight and robust routing in these constrained networks. A versioning mechanism is incorporated into RPL in order to maintain an optimized topology. However, an attacker can exploit this mechanism to significantly damage the network and reduce its lifetime. After analyzing and comparing existing work, we propose in this paper a monitoring strategy with dedicated algorithms for detecting such attacks and identifying the involved malicious nodes. The performance of this solution is evaluated through extensive experiments, and its scalability is quantified with the support of a monitoring node placement optimization method.	algorithm;experiment;internet of things;lossy compression;malware;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;routing;scalability;sensor;software deployment;software versioning	Anthéa Mayzaud;R&#x00E9;mi Badonnel;Isabelle Chrisment	2017	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2017.2705290	telecommunications;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	6.456820126058169	75.54811339400331	31054

The reduction of interference is consequently considered one of the foremost goals of topology control. Almost all of the related work however considers this issue implicitly: Low interference is often claimed to be a consequence of sparseness or low degree of the constructed topologies. This paper, in contrast, studies explicit definitions of interference. Various models of interference-both from a sender-centric and a receiver-centric perspective-are proposed, compared, and analyzed with respect to their algorithmic properties and complexities.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;foremost;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);neural coding;topology control	Pascal von Rickenbach;Roger Wattenhofer;Aaron Zollinger	2009	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1145/1514070.1514084	wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	11.71421441286993	82.09067988635547	31058
0087099ef3586220163ad54be008f81f26b97ed6	ego-betweenness centrality in link streams		The ability of a node to relay information in a network is often measured using betweenness centrality. In order to take into account the fact that the role of the nodes vary through time, several adaptations of this concept have been proposed to time-evolving networks. However, these definitions are demanding in terms of computational cost, as they call for the computation of time-ordered paths. We propose a definition of centrality in link streams which is node-centric, in the sense that we only take into account the direct neighbors of a node to compute its centrality. This restriction allows to carry out the computation in a shorter time compared to a case where any couple of nodes in the network should be considered. Tests on empirical data show that this measure is relatively highly correlated to the number of times a node would relay information in a flooding process. We suggest that this is a good indication that this measurement can be of use in practical contexts where a node has a limited knowledge of its environment, such as routing protocols in delay tolerant networks.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;ambiguous name resolution;betweenness centrality;cobham's thesis;computation;delay-tolerant networking;evolving networks;reachability;relay;routing;similarity measure;the times;user-centered design	Marwan Ghanem;Florent Coriat;Lionel Tabourier	2017		10.1145/3110025.3110158	streams;id, ego and super-ego;machine learning;artificial intelligence;centrality;computation;computer science;routing protocol;betweenness centrality	Security	3.8568421116312956	86.13493582437333	31092

The Dynamic Static Clustering (DSC) protocol is an energy efficient clustering protocol; however, it does not provide any fault tolerance mechanism. Moreover, the non-Cluster Head nodes send data to the Cluster Heads (CH) in every time slot of a frame allocated to them using TDMA scheme, which is an energy consuming process. Considering these limitations of the DSC protocol, we have proposed a more energy efficient and fault tolerant Dynamic Static Clustering (FT-DSC) protocol of WSN to enhance the performance of DSC. The performance of the proposal protocol has been tested by means of simulation and compared against the original DSC protocol. Simulation results show that the FT-DSC protocol has better performance than the DSC protocol in terms of energy efficiency and reliability.	cluster analysis;communications protocol;fault tolerance;simulation;solaris cluster	Lutful Karim;Nidal Nasser;Tarek R.

00c06069a6db6ee0fe0678bde38f46f1740fc554	data-driven link quality prediction using link features	link quality prediction;link quality estimation	As an integral part of reliable communication in wireless networks, effective link estimation is essential for routing protocols. However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling, and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical-layer information, that is, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment.

We investigate this problem in the case where the monitored area is characterized by a geographical irregularity of the sensed events. Precisely, we consider that each point of the deployment area requires a minimum threshold guarantee on the event detection probability. Our proposed scalable deployment method, named Potential Field-based Deployment Algorithm (PFDA), is based on the Potential Field and the Virtual Force approaches. Our proposal is able to (1) satisfy the required event detection probability threshold for each point, in a large-scale area, while minimizing the number of deployed sensors and (2) to ensure the network connectivity. The results and evaluation analysis show that PFDA outperforms the other strategies proposed in literature.	algorithm;geographic information system;robot;scalability;sensor;software deployment	Nadjib Aitsaadi;Nadjib Achir;Khaled Boussetta;Guy Pujolle	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199345	wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Robotics	8.481024436701325	77.53977225543166	31126

1cd7dcb6308e81591cb09ff79fafb47e7b7a87d9	a hybrid energy efficient protocol for mobile ad hoc networks		We proposed an energy conservation technique called Location Based Topology Control with Sleep Scheduling for ad hoc networks. It uses the feature of both topology control approach and power management approach. Like the topology control approach, it attempts to reduce the transmission power of a node, which is determined from its neighborhood location information. A node goes to sleep state based on the traffic condition as that of power management approach. In the proposed scheme, a node goes to sleep state only when its absence does not create local partition in its neighborhood. We preformed extensive simulation to compare the proposed scheme with existing ones. Simulation results show that the energy consumption is lower with increase in the network lifetime and higher throughput in the proposed scheme.		Niranjan Kumar Ray;Ashok K. Turuk	2016	Journal Comp.

For routing I/O permutations of Clos networks, sequential routing algorithms are too slow, and all known parallel algorithms are not practical. We present the algorithm-hardware codesign of a unified fast parallel routing architecture called distributed pipeline routing (DPR) architecture for rearrangeable nonblocking and strictly nonblocking Clos networks. The DPR architecture uses a linear interconnection structure and processing elements that performs only shift and logic AND operations. We show that a DPR architecture can route any permutation in rearrangeable nonblocking and strictly nonblocking Clos networks in O(√N) time. The same architecture can be used to carry out control of any group of connection/disconnection requests for strictly nonblocking Clos networks in O(√N) time. Several speeding-up techniques are also presented. This architecture is applicable to packet and circuit switches of practical sizes.	clos network;input/output;interconnection;network packet;network switch;parallel algorithm;routing	Si-Qing Zheng;Ashwin Gumaste;Enyue Lu	2006	2006 Symposium on Architecture For Networking And Communications Systems	10.1145/1185347.1185351	parallel computing;computer science;clos network;distributed computing;circuit switching;computer network	Arch	-1.2986770291199954	70.26057457497674	31187

Hardware Trojans are deliberate and malicious modifications to the logic function implemented within digital and mixed signal chips. In contrast to software Trojans, it is not possible to simply """"scan the hard drive"""" to eradicate a hardware Trojan. Hardware Trojans can be designed to shutdown the chip at some predetermined time and/or when some specific signal or data pattern is received. They may also be designed to remain hidden while leaking confidential information covertly to the adversary. Determining whether a hardware Trojan has been inserted into a chip is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons, e.g., nanometer feature sizes and chip design complexity combine to make optical inspection difficult or impossible. This paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of a Trojan detection method that is based on the analysis of a chip's Jddqs (steady-state current), which are measured simultaneously from multiple places on the chip. The proposed method also incorporates a technique for virtually eliminating process and test environment variations effects which act to reduce detection sensitivity of traditional testing approaches. Used together, resolution enhancements of up to a 1000 x are possible over conventional single power supply current measurement techniques. A regression-based statistical technique is applied to the data collected from a set of chips fabricated in a 65-nm process to illustrate the detection capabilities and limitations of this type of approach."""	adversary (cryptography);boolean algebra;confidentiality;deployment environment;emulator;experiment;hard disk drive;hardware trojan;mixed-signal integrated circuit;power supply;sensor;shutdown (computing);signal processing;spectral leakage;steady state;test card;trojan horse (computing)	Jim Aarestad;Dhruva Acharyya;Reza M.

A mobile underwater acoustic sensor network drifting with the pollution pattern and reporting to radio-equipped surface buoys can provide wide coverage, real-time sensing and can be deployed efficiently. This paper investigates the feasibility of such a network application by evaluating the performance of two recent pressure routing protocols: Depth Based Routing and HydroCast for delivering sensed data from a depth-restricted layer of nodes. Previous work on these protocols has only focused on low-traffic scenarios with infrequent broadcasts made by nodes throughout the network, or with only one source node. A key contribution of this paper is an investigation of the effect that current drift has on networking. The performance of the routing protocols over time is measured, under a modified 3D Meandering Current Mobility model that takes into account lower current speeds with increased depth. Results show that even in a slow-moving coastal current, packet delivery in an initially dense network becomes unviable within 3 hours of drift. This work suggests controlled mobility management be investigated in future to extend network lifetime.	acoustic cryptanalysis;network packet;real-time clock;routing	Yu Ren;Winston Khoon Guan Seah;Paul D.

Because of the lack of coordination on channel access in the initialization phase, hello messages from multiple nodes face a high risk of data collision in the exchange course. A discovery ratio is hereby defined to measure the sufficiency of the HME procedure. The discovery ratio is related to the precision of the parameter estimates for the probability density function of a node's neighborhood residual energy distribution. To achieve an arbitrarily high discovery ratio within a resolvable time interval, the HME procedure is implemented using Birthday protocol, which results in large node energy consumption. To overcome this flaw, a method termed carrier sensing mini-slot algorithm is proposed to carry out the HME procedure. The time duration and the node energy consumption for the HME procedures based on the Birthday protocol and the carrier sensing mini-slot algorithm, respectively, are theoretically analyzed and verified by simulations.

Resources constraint is among the most serious issues in DTN. In this paper, we consider the scenario where we want to transmit an information (message) from a source to a group of people in the network area. Using the epidemic routing protocol the message can reach its destinations as fast as possible, but the protocol consumes too much resources. We model the messages propagation under the epidemic routing protocol by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). And, we derive the optimal retention of a message by a node, taking into account that all nodes are infected. Simulations results show that, using the proposed optimal control in epidemic routing context, we can reach the same performances of epidemic routing while minimizing the resource consumption.	computer simulation;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;optimal control;performance;routing;software propagation	Ahmed El Ouadrhiri;Mohamed El-Kamili;Imane Rahmouni	2017	2017 13th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986515	wireless routing protocol;dynamic source routing;computer network;distributed computing;geographic routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer science;routing protocol;zone routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol	Mobile	4.093094454692028	84.64470210644647	31270

We consider a network comprising a server with an interface to the wired network, and some nodes requiring access to the information stored at the server. In order to reduce access latency in such a communication environment, an effective strategy is caching the server information at some nodes distributed across the network. Caching, however, can considerably impact the system energy expenditure; for instance, disseminating information incurs additional energy burden. Since wireless devices have limited amounts of available energy, we need to design caching strategies that optimally trade-off between energy consumption and access latency. We pose our problem as an integer linear program. We show that this problem is the same as a special case of the connected facility location problem, which is known to be NP-hard. We devise a polynomial time algorithm which provides a sub-optimal solution. The proposed algorithm applies to any arbitrary network topology and can be implemented in a distributed and asynchronous manner. In the case of a tree topology, our algorithm gives the optimal solution. In the case of an arbitrary topology, it finds a feasible solution with an objective function value within a factor of 6 of the optimal value. This performance is very close to the best approximate solution known today, which is obtained in a centralized manner. We compare the performance of our algorithm against three candidate caching schemes, and show via extensive simulation that our algorithm consistently outperforms these alternative schemes.	approximation algorithm;cache (computing);centralized computing;facility location problem;hoc (programming language);linear programming;loss function;np-hardness;network topology;optimization problem;p (complexity);polynomial;serial experiments lain;server (computing);simulation	Pavan Nuggehalli;Vikram Srinivasan;Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini	2003		10.1145/778415.778419	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	1.8665203229372254	75.97432037281561	31463

Recent scatternet formation schemes by Li, Stojmenovic and Wang [Ref. 1] are position based and were applied for multihop networks. These schemes are localized and can construct degree limited and connected piconets, without parking any node. In this article we apply their methods to single-hop networks, by showing that position information is then not needed. Each node can simply select a virtual position, and communicate it to all neighbors in the neighbor discovery phase. Nodes then act according to the scheme in [X.Y. Li et al., 2004] using such virtual positions instead of real ones. In addition, we use Delaunay triangulation instead of partial Delauliay triangulation proposed in [X.Y. Li et al., 2004], since each node has all the information needed. Finally, we design experiments to study both the properties of formatted scatternets (such as number of piconets) and the performances of different localized routing methods on them. The experiments confirm good functionality of created Bluetooth networks in addition to their fast creation and straightforward maintenance.	algorithm;bluetooth;delaunay triangulation;experiment;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);performance;routing;scheduling (computing)	Yu Wang;Ivan Stojmenovic;Xiang-Yang Li	2004	Proceedings.

The results of this study suggest that a proactive protocol, such as RPL, is the best candidate for most deployment scenarios.

bf788e5a6168e4489815c540cae826e54f8e9c4e	online optimization of wireless sensors selection over an unknown stochastic environment		Wireless communication is considered to be more challenging than the typical wired communication due to unpredictable channel conditions. In this paper, we target coverage area problem, where a group of sensors is selected from a set of sensors placed in a particular area to maximize the coverage provided to that area. The constraints to this optimization are the battery power of the sensor and number of sensors that are active at a given time. We consider a variant of the coverage related to a particular sensor, where coverage is considered to be an unknown stochastic variable, and hence, we need to learn the best subset of sensors in real time. We propose an online combinatorial optimization algorithm based on multi-armed bandits framework that learns the expected best subset of sensors, and the regret of the proposed online algorithm is sub-linear in time. The achieved performance proves the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed online algorithm in wireless sensor selection over an unknown stochastic environment.	combinatorial optimization;mathematical optimization;multi-armed bandit;online algorithm;online optimization;sensor	Muhammad Anjum Qureshi;Wardah Sarmad;Hira Noor;Ali Hassan Mirza	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404570	online algorithm;wireless sensor network;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;regret;computer science;robustness (computer science);combinatorial optimization;real-time computing;wired communication;wireless;communication channel	Robotics	13.474962221090339	78.2096841742898	31558

Direct communication with mobile beacons has an advantage of improvement in location accuracy by enabling sensor nodes to measure distances to the mobile beacons. Thus, it is important to improve the accuracy in the distance for high accurate positioning. In this letter, we propose a distance estimation scheme with weighted least squares in mobile beacon-based localization. First, we model distance measurements to a beacon node moving along the given linear tracks. Given our measurement model, the proposed scheme uses weighted least squares to minimize errors in distance measurements. Additionally we analyze the lower bound of errors in our distance estimation based on the Cramer-Rao bound. Simulation results show that our scheme can provide improved accuracy in both distance estimation and position estimation.	least squares;sensor node;simulation	Eunchan Kim;Kiseon Kim	2010	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2010.2047169	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics	Mobile	16.567900397757075	74.83091390723241	31573
50d775addce06f71680ee1fccb9e3821fba9d3e3	k-coverage persevering routing technique based on event occurrence patterns for wireless sensor networks		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprising of tiny, power-constrained nodes are gaining popularity due to their potential use in a wide range of applications, including monitoring of environmental attributes, intrusion detection, and various military and civilian environments. While the sensing objectives of these environments are unique and application dependent, a common performance criteria for wireless sensor networks is prolonging network lifetime while satisfying coverage and connectivity in the deployment region. In many real-world scenarios, reoccurring spatial patterns of occurrence could be identified in the sensed event information. This paper proposes a new routing algorithm schema based on event occurrence history to secure K-Coverage of event paths and maintain the maximum degree of coverage. In the proposed method the nodes located around event path try to save their battery power by not participating in data packet forwarding to neighbor nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed method improves network lifetime by shifting the routing responsibility from sensing nodes to communication nodes, while maximizing the degree of coverage in the main path of event occurrence. As a consequence, the lifetime of main path coverage is increased dramatically as compared to previous methods.	routing	Majid Rafigh;Maghsoud Abbaspour	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/164641	real-time computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.623996164367082	78.35134545853593	31608

The sensor reader (SR), which is in charge of capturing the RSS to infer the tag position, can be attached to an omnidirectional or directional antenna. Unlike commonly-employed omnidirectional antennas, directional antennas can receive a stronger signal from the direction in which they are pointed, resulting in a different RSS distributions in space and, hence, more distinguishable fingerprints. A simulation tool and a system management software have been also developed to control the system and assist the initial antenna deployment, reducing time-consuming costs. A prototype was mounted in a real scenario, with a number of SRs with omnidirectional and directional antennas properly positioned. Different antenna configurations have been studied, evidencing a promising capability of directional antennas to enhance the performance of RSS fingerprinting-based ILS, reducing the number of required SRs and also increasing the localization success.	acetaminophen 500 mg oral tablet;addresses (publication format);antenna device component;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cns disorder;calibration;centralized computing;dna integration;deploy;directive (programming);experiment;financial cost;fingerprint (computing);fractal antenna;greater than;indoor positioning system;inference;integrated learning system;java programming language;matlab;many antennas;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;numerous;one thousand;planar (computer graphics);prototype;rss;rss gene;radio fingerprinting;server (computing);simulation;systems architecture;systems management;testbed;tracer;disease transmission;sensor (device);width	Raúl Guzmán-Quirós;Alejandro S.

They enable multi-hop peer-to-peer routing without any requirement of predefined infrastructure for its deployment. The topology of MANETs change dynamically which necessitates development of efficient routing protocols for message packets that reduce energy consumption, congestion and propagation delays. Existing routing protocols such as BRAWN, AODV and DSDV improve the quality of service (QoS) in MANETs only when there are less number of hops and nodes close to each other. Determining an efficient route for packets considering the current location of nodes is a challenging task, especially when the distance between the nodes is too long in a MANET. In this paper, we present an efficient protocol to maintain higher QoS in MANETS. In addition to bandwidth and data rate, additional parameters namely queuing delay, distance and energy are incorporated in order to dynamically compute the paths for a specific communication with minimum delay. We provide a theoretical approach to determine multiple efficient paths and to rank them. We also use information of node position that is captured periodically for computing the latest direct distance between any two nodes.

A vehicle in VANET is considered to be an intelligent mobile node capable of communicating with its neighbors and other vehicles in the network. As in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) it is necessary to identify or address each vehicle in the vehicular ad-hoc network with a unique address. The current addressing mechanisms in VANET do not succeed in configuring the vehicle with a unique address. Furthermore, there is a need for address reconfigurations depending on the mobility patterns. In order to deal with these problems, we have presented a centralized addressing scheme for VANET using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). Results obtained in our approach are compared against the results presented in one of the existing addressing mechanism in VANET. It is observed that our approach is efficient and feasible for vehicular ad-hoc networks.	addressing scheme;centralized computing;hoc (programming language);mac address;simulation;time of arrival;vehicle-to-vehicle	Brijesh Kadri Mohandas;Ramiro Liscano	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664252	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;ip address management;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	2.32967200522937	87.63711428368809	31662

Traditionally utilized predominantly in fixed or At-The Halt (ATH) applications, new improvements in the LinkWayS2 waveform make ground-mobile and even airborne mesh communications using LinkWayS2 possible. High-speed mesh communications with a manned ISR aircraft was demonstrated in a mesh MF-TDMA network which combined At-the-Halt (ATH), ground mobile, and an airborne SATCOM terminal in a single, hubless tactical LinkWayS2 meshed IP network. In two separate exercises using the LinkWayS2 mesh MF-TDMA modem, high-definition (HD), high-speed ISR video was transmitted from a King Air manned ISR aircraft to 2.4m aperture ATH terminals while the aircraft simultaneously participated in IP video teleconferences (VTCs) with the ATH terminals. Operating on a 10 Msps Mesh TDMA carrier, ISR HD video rates exceeding 6 Mbps, and VTC rates exceeding 1 Mbps, were transmitted and received without error while the aircraft performed evasive maneuvers at airspeed in excess of 230 mph. The ground mobile SATCOM terminals communicated with the ATH terminals simultaneous with the airborne terminal operation, and, for the first time, direct mesh communication between an airborne terminal and a ground mobile terminal. These exercises were the first demonstrations of airborne mesh satellite communications, achieved the highest speed TDMA operation from any mobile terminal (10 Msps) to date, and are the first networks to combine airborne and ground mobile terminals is a single mesh MF-TDMA network. These exercises conclusively demonstrate that high-speed mesh satellite communications-on-the-move (COTM) is possible using LinkWayS2 without requiring a large hub infrastructure and is being deployed today.	airborne ranger;communications satellite;data rate units;fastest;hdmi;halting problem;information systems research;interference (communication);mobile phone;modem;modulation;offset binary;parabolic antenna;usb hub;waveform	Lawrence E.

In order to support certain level of service quality, a mechanism for recourses allocations/reservation has to be implemented to provide the needed assurance for the desired level of quality.However, in such a mobile environment (unlike networks with fixed topology), no service guarantee can be assured by any reservation/allocation mechanism and all what those mechanisms can offer is a better chance or a promise for better service. Several mechanisms have been developed, they differ in the level of assurance they can provide ranging from no assurance to relatively high level of assurance.In this paper, we present a survey of the current research that has developed to address the problem. Some of those mechanisms are, DiffServ, DSRRSVP, DRSVP and MRSVP. We also compare them based on certain criteria (complexity, scalability, level of assurance, control overhead, and types of environments that they support).	hoc (programming language);quality of service	Hussein Ali;Mohammad Inayatullah;Shmuel Rotenstreich	2004		10.1145/1071509.1071521	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;geography;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-2.0590063553398585	87.3170509557535	31792

Their application in Developing Countries is even more interesting: they can help solve problems that affect communities. One of the limitations of current wireless sensors is the communication range, with most devices having 100 meters as maximum range. In contrast, many applications require long-range wireless sensor network where nodes are separated by large distances, giving the advantage of being able to monitor a large geographic area. In this paper we will present the results of an integrated approach combining a planning step using simulations and an experimental step carried out using off-theshelf equipment over distances ranging from 600m to 12km. The results reveal that the simulation results agree with experimentation and show that long distance wireless sensor networks (LDWSN) are possible and that the quality of these links is high. Finally, we discuss the relative efficiency of our solution in terms of range compared to other wireless sensor networks.	frequency band;modulation;real life;relevance;sensor web;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;testbed;transceiver	Marco Zennaro;Antoine B.

Massive MIMO has been successful in providing high spectral and energy efficiency, and it is of importance to investigate the potential gains and limitations it exhibits when applied for URLLC. We study a scenario where two sets of nodes with different traffic characteristics communicate with a central node equipped with multiple antenna elements. We characterize the outage probability when fully orthogonal training sequences are used versus sharing of the training sequences between the two sets of nodes. It is shown that substantial performance gains can be reaped with shared training sequences when there are strict latency requirements and/or large number of nodes to be served.	automation;best, worst and average case;downtime;interrupt latency;mimo;next-generation network;requirement;signal processing;software propagation	Antonios Pitarokoilis;James Gross;Mikael Skoglund	2018	2018 15th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2018.8491190	periodic graph (geometry);computer network;automation;real-time computing;latency (engineering);mimo;wireless;latency (engineering);decoding methods;efficient energy use;computer science	Embedded	24.08344032805329	87.70715355034102	31982

MANET is a self configuring network of mobile devices connected by wireless links. Each device in the MANET is free to move independently in any direction; therefore, it changes links to other devices frequently. The proposed QoS-based routing in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol relates bandwidth and delay using a fuzzy logic algorithm. The path computations are examined and the reason behind the selection of bandwidth and delay metrics is discussed. The performance of the protocol is investigated by simulation. The results in FQOLSR indicate an improvement in mobile wireless networks compared with the existing QOLSR system. but a route that satisfies the end-to-end QoS requirement. The QoS requirement chosen are distinctively different routing metric and neither of these metrics is inferable from each other. These metrics should use separate rules for defining the best route (Tan, 2001). The value of a metric over any directed path p = (i, j, k...q, r) can be any one of the following compositions. Additive Metric: Metric is additive if metric (p) = metij + metjk +...+metqr. Delay, delay jitter, hop-count and cost follow the additive composition rule. Multiplicative Metric: Metric is multiplicative if Metric (p) = metij X metjk X...X metqr. The probability of successful transmission follows the multiplicative composition rule. Concave Metric: Metric is concave if metric (p)=min {metij, metjk,..,metqr}. Bandwidth follows the concave composition rule.

The use of fuzzy logic greatly simplifies the process of associating two inputs through the use of the straightforward membership function and the linguistic types of fuzzy rules make the performance fine-tuning process. The output generated is able to give a good approximation on what is to be expected. Qos is more difficult in Ad hoc networks than in other networks, because network topology changes as the nodes move. This paper aims at specifying in FQOLSR in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. The implementation is done in limited available resources. The author has proposed the FQOLSR protocol, which is an enhancement of the QOLSR routing protocol prescribed in Johnson and Maltz (1996). This paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the network parameters chosen. Existing system method to relate two metrics is presented, as well as the design of fuzzy logic algorithm. The author also describes FQOLSR protocol, which is an enhancement of the QOLSR routing protocol to support multiple-metric routing criteria. Therefore, the author validates the proposal by means of performance evaluation.

The resource allocation of an energy-constrained, heterogeneous WBAN is a critical issue that should consider both energy efficiency and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements with the dynamic link characteristics, especially when the limited resource cannot satisfy the expected QoS requirements. In this paper, a buffer aware Energy-efficient and QoS-effective resource allocation scheme is proposed in which the sensor queue buffer states, constraints of QoS metrics and the characteristics of dynamic links are considered. Specifically, a buffer aware sensor evaluation method is designed to dynamically evaluate the sensor state with considering the sensor buffer states for improving the system performance. We then formulate the resource allocation problem for optimizing the transmission power, the transmission rate and the allocated time slots for each sensor to minimize the sum mix-cost, which is defined to characterize the energy cost and QoS cost between attainable QoS support and QoS requirements. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the buffer aware sensor evaluation method and the proposed energy-efficient and QoS-effective resource allocation scheme.	performance;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;sensor;simulation;the quality of life	Zhiqiang Liu;Bin Liu;Chang Wen Chen	2016	2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)	10.1109/HealthCom.2016.7749508	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	10.926781813530782	84.5139280544926	32127

Fingerprinting techniques can provide a low-cost and high-accuracy localization solution by utilizing in-building communication infrastructures. However, existing fingerprinting localization algorithms are not resistant to outliers, for example, the accidental environment changes, access point (AP) attacks. Another drawback is that traditional K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm in the literature may not select the candidate reference points (RPs) correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel environmentally robust and attack resistant probabilistic fingerprinting localization method. In the offline phase, the distribution estimation of the signal strength is performed using probabilistic histogram method. Then in the online phase, a three-step location sensing method is proposed. In the first step, a simple and efficient outlier detection method named non-iterative “RANdom SAmple Consensus” (RANSAC) is run to detect and eliminate part of APs from which the signals measured are severely distorted by unexpected environment effects. In the second step, a novel region-based RP selection method which works like a “family of probability” is proposed to improve the possibility of the correctness of selection of the nearest RPs. In the final step, the location is obtained using a weighted-mean method. In the experiment section, we demonstrate the proposed method in our lab and find that the proposed strategies are resistant to outliers and can improve the localization accuracy effectively compared with existing methods.	anomaly detection;correctness (computer science);error-tolerant design;experiment;fingerprint (computing);internationalization and localization;iterative method;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;online and offline;rp (complexity);rss;radio fingerprinting;random sample consensus;robustness (computer science);selection (genetic algorithm);wireless access point	Wei Meng;Wendong Xiao;Wei Ni;Lihua Xie	2011	2011 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation	10.1109/IPIN.2011.6071908	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Robotics	17.34677740543361	73.39529341909048	32184

The popularity of this approach is attributed to the natural properties of random walks such as locality, simplicity, low-overhead and inherent robustness. However, throughout the variety of research works that assess the effectiveness of random walk techniques, most results are derived from a qualitative view or by means of simulations. Furthermore, when analytical tools are used, the obtained results often provide bounds on various performance metrics of interest, which may have little consequences for practical applications. Instead, our goal in this paper is to quantify the effectiveness of such techniques based on the derivation of closed-form expressions.In particular, we focus on the delay taken for the random walk to deliver messages from sensor to sink nodes and study its statistics through closed-form derivations.	locality of reference;overhead (computing);simulation	Issam Mabrouki;Gwillerm Froc;Xavier Lagrange	2008	2008 Fifth International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of Systems	10.1109/QEST.2008.30	wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;random walk;statistics;computer network	Embedded	8.66969499505624	86.66629594120195	32189
d3dc8bfa0ba6a5b204b506f80efc3955c0018de9	a novel approach for designing delay efficient path for mobile sink in wireless sensor networks		In the recent years, the use of mobile sink has drawn enormous attention for data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Mobile sink is well known for solving hotspot or sinkhole problem. However, the design of an efficient path for mobile sink has tremendous impact on network lifetime and coverage in data collection process of WSNs. This is particularly an important issue for many critical applications of WSNs where data collection requires to be carried out in delay bound manner. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for delay efficient trajectory design of a mobile sink in a cluster based WSN so that it can be used for critical applications without compromising the complete coverage of the target area. Given a set of gateways (cluster heads), our scheme determines a set of rendezvous points for designing path of the mobile sink for critical applications. The scheme is based on the Voronoi diagram. We also propose an efficient method for recovery of the orphan sensor nodes generated due to the failure of one or more cluster heads during data collection. We perform extensive simulations over the proposed algorithm and compare its results with existing algorithms to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of network lifetime, path length, average waiting time, fault tolerance and adaptability etc. For the fault tolerance, we simulate the schemes using Weibull distribution and analyze their performances.

Communication and localization in rail applications represents a permanent and evolutionary need, motivated by the improvement of the quality and safety of transports. Ultra wide band appears as a very suitable technology for this kind of application, due to its large bandwidth, also to its good resistance to the interference and to multipath. Time Reversal channel pre-filtering facilitates signal detection and helps increasing the received energy in a targeted area. In this paper, we evaluate the characteristics of spatio-temporal focusing of time reversal on the one hand, and secondly we compare systems without time reversal UWB location and tracking systems with time reversal UWB in terms of error localization.

1939d81e9a2752997acbd4070694255447bc69f7	spectrum occupancy measurement and analysis in kochi-india from a cognitive radio perspective		In the context of Cognitive Radio, spectrum occupancy estimate of a geographical region is very important to develop strategies to utilize the unoccupied spectrum. Most of the spectrum occupancy measurements carried out till date are based on measurements at outdoor high points. In this work, spectrum occupancy is measured in an indoor setup. An attempt is made to find the utility of the licensed spectrum in the region of Kochi, India. For this purpose spectrum activity within the range 50MHz-4400MHz is recorded and presented as psd plots. Spectrum holes in the frequency-time domain is obtained through detailed measurement at certain frequency bands where activity is noticed. Average duty cycle of certain channels and specific bands are also analyzed. Results reveal that CRs with different complexity can work at different types of spectrum holes. This implies that a high end device with multiple protocols can adapt to any type of spectrum holes. There is also the possibility that a low end CR device specific to the type of spectrum hole can exist and perform certain specific functions.	bands;chromium;cognitive radio;duty cycle;frequency band;labview;location (geography);preparation;protocols documentation;spectrum analyzer	Jaison Jacob;Babita R.

In other words, energy modeling plays a greater role in energy optimization that helps designers to produce an economical and practical design of sensor nodes. In this paper, the issue of energy-efficient WSNs design is investigated by focusing on the setting of physical layer parameters. This is achieved by deriving an energy consumption model that considers most of the parameters of the physical layers. The proposed model is validated with real measurements to measure the accuracy of the proposed model. Results show good agreement between proposed model and experimental measurements with mean absolute percentage error less than 6%.

To support the node mobility, a lot of mobility agents are deployed in the packet network of a cellular system to remain the continuous network connectivity while mobile node move their locations. lf a mobility agent fails, the mobile nodes under its coverage area will be aflected. The network connectivity ofthese mobile node will be disrupted. The main god of this paper is to present an ellicient approach to tolerating the failures of mobile agents. Once failures occur in B mobility agent, its in-progress and new-arrival workload cam be redirected to other mobility agents. The mobile nodes under the mobility agent's coverage area do not lose their data executive ability. The overhead of the proposed fault-tolerant approach i s also measured in terms of the performance degradation om other mobility agents by using am M W d m queueing mode. The analytic results show that the performance degradation is very low if the workloads of the faulty mobility agent are not too heavy.	backup;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;mobile ip;mobile agent;network packet;overhead (computing);packet switching	Jenn-Wei Lin;Jichiang Tsai;Chin-Yu Huang	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188158	fault tolerance;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;mobility model;statistics;computer network	Mobile	1.7907164055627074	84.59750459093496	32468

As an example of an applied system, we developed a distributed wireless network emulator that permits precise and stable synchronized time-based wireless link scheduling. In our system, each agent node simply emulates schedule-based wireless links without exchanging control messages with any other nodes. This emulator is designed to test IP-based protocols for high scalability and high-speed mobility while maintaining high accuracy levels over extended periods of time. In our previous work, we showed the existence of a relationship between packet handling size and accuracy in a developed emulator system. In this study, we evaluate the performance of agent node loads, and their relationship to processing time accuracy, by obtaining time information from PTP v2. These factors are important when deciding future extension policy. From our experimental results, we determined that performance has two kind of influence. Specifically, processing time increases as loading increases, and some processing elements become excessively long under high load conditions. These factors have a significant influence on time-based distributed systems, such as our distributed mobile network emulator, which is designed to handle processes at microsecond speeds.	central processing unit;distributed computing;emulator;experiment;input/output;load (computing);network packet;performance evaluation;picture transfer protocol;precision time protocol;prototype;real-time clock;real-time operating system;scalability;scheduling (computing);system call	Tomoaki Tsutsumi;Minoru Koizumi;Tomoichi Ebata;Kohta Ohshima;Matsuaki Terada	2013	The International Conference on Information Networking 2013 (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2013.6496368	synchronization;real-time computing;scalability;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;wi-fi array;computer network	Embedded	4.376452517368562	72.1104446484962	32487

Thus, the main issue in sensor networks is often to extend the lifetime of the network by reducing energy consumption. On the other hand, some applications have high priority traffic that needs to be transferred within a bounded end-to-end delay while maintaining an energy efficient behavior. We propose MaCARI, a time segmentation protocol that saves energy, improves the overall performance of the network and enables quality of service in terms of guaranteed access to the medium and end-to-end delays. This time segmentation is achieved by synchronizing the activity of nodes using a tree-based beacon propagation and allocating activity periods for each cluster of nodes. The tree-based topology is inspired from the cluster-tree proposed by the ZigBee standard. The efficiency of our protocol is proven analytically, by simulation and through real testbed measurements.	end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;interval arithmetic;priority queue;quality of service;relay;sensor;simulation;software propagation;stellar classification;testbed	Gérard Chalhoub;François Delobel;Michel Misson	2010	CoRR		real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.66816244551856	83.62752304863469	32528

The irregular link quality, especially link asymmetry, has significant impacts on the design of WSN protocols. In this paper, we propose two asymmetry-aware link layer services, including the neighborhood link quality service (NLQS) and the link relay service (LRS). The novelty of the NLQS service is taking the link asymmetry into consideration, providing timeliness link quality and distinguishing the inbound and outbound neighbors with the support of LRS, which builds a relay framework to alleviate the effects of link asymmetry. To demonstrate the proposed link layer service, we design and implement two example applications, building the shortest-hop routing path (SHRT) and the best path reliability routing path (BRRT), on the TinyOS platform. We found that the performance of two example applications is improved substantially. More than 40% of nodes identify more outbound neighbors and the percentage of increased outbound neighbors is between 14% and 100%. In SHRT, more than 15% of nodes reduce hops of the routing path and the percentage of reduced hops is between 14% and 100%. In BRRT, more than 16% of nodes improve the path reliability of the routing path and the percentage of the improved path reliability is between 2% to 50%.		Junzhao Du;Weisong Shi;Kewei Sha	2009	J.

A minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) offers an optimized way of sending messages. However, MCDS construction is a NP-Hard problem. In this paper, we propose a new degree-based greedy approximation algorithm named as Connected Pseudo Dominating Set Using 2 Hop Information (CPDS2HI), which reduces the CDS size as much as possible. Our method first constructs the CDS and then reduces its size further by excluding some of the CDS nodes cleverly without any loss in coverage or connectivity. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing CDS construction algorithms in terms of both the CDS size and construction cost. CPDS2HI retains the current best performance ratio of (4 . 8 + ln 5) | opt| + 1 . 2 , | opt | being the size of an optimal CDS of the network, and has the best time complexity of O ( D ), where D is the network diameter. To the best of our knowledge this is the most time efficient and size-optimal CDS construction algorithm. It has a linear message complexity of O ( n ), where n is the network size and is the maximum degree of all the nodes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

47f7b9c16065f50aa34c565fd130485c4b953172	overoptimistic voltage scaling in pre-error avs systems and learning-based alleviation	decoding;clocks;logic gates;markov processes;field programmable gate arrays;delays	In-situ timing error detection and correction mechanisms (such as Razor) monitor the performance of actual datapaths, and are believed more resilient in adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) systems, especially when considering local variations. However, Razor has serious hold time problems, of which the overwhelming buffer padding makes it infeasible in advanced process technologies. Pre-error (or in-situ canary) detection was then proposed as an alternative. In addition, sophisticated error correction is no longer needed accordingly. The Markov chain model was proposed by independent researchers to design the pre-error AVS controller to explicitly trade quality for energy, where the input patterns are assumed to have a Gaussian delay distribution. For error-tolerant applications where few errors are acceptable, pre-error AVS is shown more efficient than Razor-based approaches. In this paper, a pre-error AVS system has been constructed on a 28nm FPGA platform with programmable power supply. It is observed that when the delay distributions are time-varying and non-Gaussian, overoptimistic voltage scaling (OVS) can occur and may lead to serious problems in pre-error AVS. To resolve the OVS problem, we propose to insert certain logics to collect the delay criticality information, which is fed into a Q-learning model to create the learning-based AVS. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme saves 10.50% power while reducing 0.16% error rate for random inputs and saves 12.51% power while reducing 0.06% error rate for non-random inputs, compared with the original pre-error AVS that assumes a static Gaussian delay distribution.	criticality matrix;dynamic voltage scaling;error detection and correction;error-tolerant design;field-programmable gate array;image scaling;markov chain;power supply;q-learning;randomness;razor	Yi-Hsuan Ting;Chih-Yang Wang;Yu-Sian Chang;Tay-Jyi Lin;Shih-Chieh Chang;Jinn-Shyan Wang	2016	2016 29th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)	10.1109/SOCC.2016.7905508	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;markov process;field-programmable gate array;statistics	EDA	15.59087668563346	62.81623258110762	32788

The problem considered here is single-class routing to one/multiple sinks with lifetime maximization as the objective. The formulation to correct the routing paths is not heuristic and takes its theoretical basis from a macroscopic model, that is, based on a set of partial differential equations iteratively solved by the Gauss-Seidel method. We then theoretically investigate the convergence of GSC. Furthermore, an initial value estimation algorithm is presented to alleviate the long-path problem during the delivery of the first several packets, thus accelerating the convergence of GSC. Simulation results show that GSC effectively achieves load balancing, particularly for regions of interest with holes.	expectation–maximization algorithm;gsc bus;gauss–seidel method;heuristic;load balancing (computing);region of interest;routing;simulation	Ren-Song Ko;Po-Liang Lin;Pei-Yu Chiang	2013	TOSN	10.1145/2529190	embedded system;mathematical optimization;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;mathematics;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;partial differential equation;routing information protocol;gauss–seidel method	Metrics	5.480382059537406	81.12318661253629	32802

We are given a directed network with arc capacities and a set of anycast requests. Anycast is a one-to-one-of-many delivery technique that allows a client to choose a content server of a set of replicated servers. In the context of unsplittable flows, anycast request consists of two connections: upstream (from the client to the server) and the downstream (in the opposite direction). The objective of UAFP is to find a subset of the requests of maximum total demand for which upstream and downstream connection uses only one path and the capacity constraint is satisfied. To our best survey, this is the first study that addresses the UFP (unsplittable flow problem) in the context of anycast flows. After formulation of UAFP, we propose several heuristics to solve that problem. Next, we present results of simulation evaluation of these algorithms.

Load-balancing algorithms can be operated by centralized and distributed implementation. Centralized implementation needs to collect global neighborhood information, which leads to a large amount of signaling overhead. On the contrary, distributed implementation can overcome such issue. However, it only achieves sub-optimal load-balancing. Thus, it is obscure that which type of implementation is more energy-efficiency. In this paper, a novel distributed implementation for load-balancing routing is proposed. We make a series of analyses of comparing the energy-efficiency between centralized and distributed implementation. The results show that, the overhead for constructing load-balancing routing via distributed implementation is always less than that via centralized implementation. However, the heaviest one-hop node in distributed implementation suffers from more loads so that according to its energy consumption, distributed implementation can maintain energy-efficiency only in the condition that routing update cycle is shorter than a threshold.	algorithm;centralized computing;load balancing (computing);network load balancing;overhead (computing);routing	Xin Di;Zhaoyu Zhang;Chen Ao;Jun Tian;Kazuyuki Ozaki;Yun Wen;Hiroshi Fujita	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289107	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;load balancing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;efficient energy use;link-state routing protocol;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	5.4789747980316	80.95246698728376	32877

The long-term acquisition process for ECG produces large amount of data, which puts forward high demand on sensor lifetime. Fortunately, compressive sensing (CS) theory has been proved useful in energy saving by compressing signal in certain degree and fulfilling transmission. However, the reconstruction error will increase with fixed compression ratio since users or the sparsity of ECG signal will change during monitoring process. This paper concerns the flexibility and reconstruction quality problem existed in traditional CS-based ECG signal processing. One adaptive ECG compression scheme inspired by closed-loop control theory is proposed, in which the compression ratio can be adjusted according to both real-time reconstruction error and prior knowledge support. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve the compression performance of 10.83% compared with traditional CS-based methods.	compressed sensing;control theory;ibm notes;real-time clock;signal processing;simulation;sparse matrix	Yang He;Wenbin Yu;Cailian Chen;Yiyin Wang;Xin-Ping Guan	2015	2015 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341255	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	11.802900795894422	73.61380544955131	32894

In this work we evaluate the performance of clustering under RWP and random walk (RW) derivatives mobility models through simulations, since a particular mobility model cannot represent the mobility behavior of all nodes. The performance evaluation is conducted for two clustering approaches; the non-overlap and overlap clusters. In the first, a non-cluster-head node belongs exactly to one cluster, while in the second to more than one cluster. The latter is quite realistic and scarcely examined in the literature. Simulation results show that the performance of a clustering algorithm is strongly affected by the node mobility model selection and by many aspects of the model.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;model selection;network packet;network performance;performance evaluation;read-write memory;simulation;velocity (software development);waypoint;worst-case complexity;worst-case scenario	Maria Iloridou;Fotini-Niovi Pavlidou	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450360	random walk;wireless sensor network;wireless;distributed computing;waypoint;cluster analysis;parametric statistics;mobility model;computer science	Mobile	3.510413177974729	86.37569285763563	32951

This is followed by the demonstration of embedding the Hopfield neural network as a static optimizer into the wireless sensor network in fully parallel and distributed mode. The outcome is a wireless sensor network operating as a parallel and distributed computing hardware platform for a Hopfield neural network configured to solve a static optimization problem. The nesC-TinyOS model of the proposed computational framework and the corresponding simulation study are deferred to the second and third papers, respectively, in the three-paper sequence.	artificial neural network;computation;distributed computing;embedded system;hopfield network;independent set (graph theory)	Gürsel Serpen;Jiakai Li	2011		10.1016/j.procs.2011.08.073	optimization problem;probabilistic neural network;wireless sensor network;independent set;computer science;recurrent neural network;theoretical computer science;machine learning;brooks–iyengar algorithm;time delay neural network;network simulation;distributed computing;hopfield network;artificial neural network	Embedded	2.7565710639260965	67.3824540528865	32960

A new scheme based on threshold is presented to control message copies efficiently in the networks. A contact counter is added in every node for Epidemic routing scheme and the counter of every node records the number of nodes, which it contacts, with the same copy for a message. If the counter value of a node reaches the threshold which was set, then the node drops message copy. We analysis threshold in theory and derive the lower bound of threshold in delay tolerant networks. According to the lower bound of threshold, we can set a proper threshold in the networks. Using the new scheme message copies reduce obviously and are dropped completely in the end. The successful delivery ratio is no less than Epidemic routing and message copies are controlled efficiently. We show that it is validity in our scheme by comparing with the trends of message copies among different thresholds in two mobility scenes.	delay line memory;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end principle;network packet;routing;simulation;time to live;transistor–transistor logic	Haizheng Yu;Hong Bian	2011	JNW	10.4304/jnw.6.1.96-103	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	4.163998476051899	83.99497935181844	33005
94e8270299742e8696daffd171cae04d95a997ee	survivability-aware topology evolution model with link and node deletion in wireless sensor networks		The paper proposes the algorithm of survival topology evolution model. The model applies the survival analysis to the research on the topology of networks. On one hand, it takes the survivability of every node into account. Since the state of a node is affected by the node itself, the environment and so on, it’s necessary to study the survivability of nodes. In addition, the survival analysis on the nodes can indicate whether the nodes work well in real time. On the other hand, it also takes the deletion of links and nodes determined by the survivability of the nodes into account. Then it reaches the conclusion by mean field method. The result shows that the degree distributions of WSNs are approximately power law as B-A model and that the survivability of the nodes is proportional to the degree distribution of the network consisting of the previous nodes. These are further confirmed by simulation example.	node deletion	Yanliang Jin;Xuqin Zhou;Zhishu Bai;Wei Ma;Lina Xu;Zhuo Wu;Su Ki Ooi;Yue Liu	2014	IJDSN	10.1155/2014/278629	exposed node problem;telecommunications;fitness model;hierarchical network model;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	13.254011820037388	86.01641774689975	33009
84460334d4ddfcf5a8a97e89837fae1aa7acad77	stopping-time management of smart sensing nodes based on tradeoffs between accuracy and power consumption		This paper concerns stopping-time management of smart sensing nodes, a kind of very large scale integration system, based on the tradeoffs between sensing accuracy and power consumption, which are foundations of Internet of Things systems and cyber-physical systems. In practice, smart sensing nodes work periodically, and more samples leads to higher accuracy but more energy cost, so when to stop sampling in a periodic cycle to achieve the optimal tradeoff is an interesting issue. This paper formulates this issue as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and develops a POMDP-based Optimal Stopping-time Algorithm to make the above tradeoff.

LetN denote the size of the network. Our routing scheme runs in 2·logN+1 time using constant size buffers (if the routing information is not counted). Its probability of successful routing is at least 1−N −2.419·logN+1.5, proving Rabin's conjecture. The scheme runswithin the said time bound without queueing delay, and it toleratesO(N) random link failures with high probability. Optimal on-line and efficient wire maintenance on the hypercube can be realized if our fault-tolerant routing scheme is used. Let α denote the total number of links in the hypercube. It is shown that a constant fraction (≈α/352) of the wires can be disabled simultaneously without disrupting the ongoing computation or degrading the routing performance much. This property suggests various on-line maintenance procedures.	algorithm;computation;fault tolerance;grid network;online and offline;queuing delay;routing;with high probability	Yuh-Dauh Lyuu	1991	Mathematical systems theory	10.1007/BF02090403	fault tolerance;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	Theory	-0.03711200543119159	70.74998656288695	33088

The idea of transmitter cooperation has been widely considered in topology control to improve network connectivity or energy efficiency. However, receiver cooperation has not previously been considered in topology control. In particular, we show that we can improve both connectivity and energy efficiency if we employ receiver cooperation in addition to transmitter cooperation. Consequently, we conclude that a system based both on transmitter and receiver cooperation is generally superior to one based only on transmitter cooperation. We also show that the increase in network connectivity caused by employing transmitter cooperation in addition to receiver cooperation is at the expense of significantly increased energy consumption. Consequently, system designers may opt for receiver-only cooperation in cases for which energy efficiency is of the highest priority or when connectivity increase is no longer a serious concern.	centralized computing;internet access;simulation;topology control;transmitter	Ki-Ryang Moon;Do-Sik Yoo;Wonjun Lee;Seong-Jun Oh	2015	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2014.2374617	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	15.660521087334635	86.4596481679546	33184

Since the power of the sensor Nodes are limited, conserving energy and network life is a critical issue in wireless sensor network. Clustering is one of the known methods widely used to face these challenges. In this paper, a cluster based communication protocol with considering the low energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, is introduced which balances the energy load among sensor nodes. The nodes close to each other have more overlap; they sense the same data from environment and cause a waste of energy by generating repetitive data. In this paper, a cluster based routing protocol is introduced, in the proposed protocol, in each round a certain number of nodes are specified; the nodes which have at least one neighboring node at a distance less than the threshold. Then, among them the nodes with less energy and greater overlap with their neighbors have been chosen to go to sleep mode, Also, the energy imbalance among sensor nodes is reduced by integrating the distance of the nodes from the base station into clustering policies. A simulator was developed in the MATLAB environment to evaluate the performance of this protocol. On the basis of the simulation results the proposed protocol increases the network lifetime, balances the load among sensor nodes further, and increases the network coverage.	algorithm;cluster analysis;communications protocol;computer cluster;data aggregation;energy level;goto;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;matlab;overlap–add method;routing;simulation;sleep mode	Dana Anderson	2011	CoRR		wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;embedded system;wireless wan;network architecture;wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;wireless site survey;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;wireless network;order one network protocol;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;base transceiver station;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	8.526587254759251	80.29072037563803	33232

The adverse characteristics in UWSNs communication and high cost limit the sensor nodes to spare deployment, causing delay, low propagation, power efficiency and floating node mobility. This proposed protocol is developed to handle these problems in under water sensor networks, two static sinks and four courier nodes are used to perform routing. Sensor nodes select their appropriate nearby static courier node to forward their data towards destination. Courier nodes have maximum energy, as compare to sensor nodes causing to enhance the network life time and provide equal distribution of energy consumption resulting to provide maximum throughput and stability of the network. Network field is hundred by hundred and providing maximum rounds through which we can closely over view the network life time, energy efficiency and throughput. Simulation results show maximum packet delivery per round. Courier nodes have maximum energy so the maximum routing will be performed by the courier nodes and sensor nodes will only sense their data and forward it to courier nodes causing to minimize the destabilization period of the network. Simulation results provide maximum throughput, minimum dead versus alive nodes and equal energy consumption per round.	distributed bragg reflector;energy level;maximum throughput scheduling;network packet;performance per watt;routing;sensor node;sensor web;simulation;software deployment;software propagation	Zia ur Rahman;Zaheer Ahmad;Amir Murad;Tanveer Khan;Zahoor Ali Khan;Umar Qasim;Nadeem Javaid	2016	2016 IEEE 30th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2016.170	embedded system;communications protocol;routing;throughput;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	7.8328832360695975	81.19841975176055	33235

The model of earthquake debris resulting from a collapsed building was constructed based on a real earthquake disaster site in northeastern Tibet. The model consists of two human beings with different vital signals, i.e., with different cardio-respiration features, posed in different position, and buried at different depth in the debris. We start the model with a setup of single source multiple receiver impulse radar, and then expand the model to a setup of single-source and single receiver profiling case. This paper presents the simulation results using the UWB impulse radar technique and recommends the appropriate practice for earthquake rescue efforts.	computer simulation;detection theory;finite difference;finite-difference time-domain method;history of radar;ultra-wideband	Lanbo Liu;Hao Xie;Zijian Liu;Amvrossios C.

The methodology is applicable to sequential designs that are made available as firm Intellectual Property (IP), the designation commonly used to characterize designs specified as structural descriptions or circuit netlists. The watermarking is obtained by manipulating the state transition graph of the design in such a way as to make it exhibit a chosen property that is extremely rare in non-watermarked circuits, while, at the same time, not changing the functionality of the circuit. This manipulation is performed without ever actually computing this graph in either implicit or explicit form. We present both theoretical and experimental results that show that the watermarking can be created and verified efficiently.	digital watermarking;netlist;sequential logic;state diagram;state transition table;watermark (data file)	Arlindo L.

0dea74f895868acfb9c7ecce9aee2b37683c1d37	rnob: receiver negotiation opportunity broadcast protocol for trustworthy data dissemination in wireless sensor networks		The broadcast data dissemination is an important transmission mode of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. Seeking the optimal forwarding path of the broadcast data is a non-deterministic polynomial problem, and therefore, we tried to use the theory of opportunistic routing for reducing redundant rebroadcasts and enhancing the trustworthiness of transmission. However, minimum research is available focusing on the opportunistic broadcast in planar structure network which is point-to-multipoint transmission model. This paper explores the performance of broadcast data dissemination by using opportunistic routing for point-to-multipoint in theory. A new protocol called receiver negotiation opportunity broadcast (RNOB) protocol is proposed, including the distributed cooperation scheme and the priority scheduling algorithm. Simulation results showed that the performance of RNOB is better than traditional protocols, which shall improve the trustworthiness and efficiency of data transmission for WSNs in IoT systems.	algorithm;dynamic priority scheduling;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;polynomial;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;trust (emotion);trustworthy computing	Xiaoyang Lai;Huan Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2871082	wireless sensor network;computer network;data transmission;scheduling (computing);network topology;dissemination;computer science;negotiation;routing protocol;distributed computing;broadcasting	Mobile	7.969975854055083	87.38647046038449	33405

To overcome the difficulty, several multicast protocols for mobile hosts have been proposed. But they include glitches such as a non-optimal delivery route, duplicated datagrams, and overheads caused by the frequent reconstruction of a multicast tree. We summarize these problems and propose an efficient multicast protocol. The proposed protocol reduces the data delivery path length and decreases not only the amount of duplicated data but also multicast traffic load. The performance of the proposed protocol was evaluated by simulation and we got an improved performance.	multicast;routing	Hee-Sook Shin;Young-Joo Suh	2000		10.1109/ICC.2000.853730	local area network;communications protocol;cellular network;intelligent network;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;resource reservation protocol;protocol independent multicast;computer science;software agent;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;quantum tunnelling;routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;overhead;computational model;xcast;computer network;multicast address;unicast	Mobile	0.9384565368858002	83.31637301767319	33434

However, LTE and LTE-Advanced were designed with a distributed architecture in mind. Therefore, there are certain inherent technical issues when the link connecting the baseband and RRU (Remote Radio Unit) has a non-negligible latency. In this paper, we study the impact of this non-ideal fronthaul on the downlink and uplink performance of LTE-Advanced networks. We show that, while the impact on the peak throughput is quite severe, it is more modest when we have a larger number of active UEs. The degradation in performance is larger in the uplink than in the downlink due to the synchronous HARQ mechanism used in LTE uplink. In the downlink, we compare the performance of centralized RAN with that of distributed RAN in case of non-ideal fronthaul (FH) and backhaul (BH), respectively, and determine whether it is better to incur backhaul or fronthaul latency from a performance perspective. In the uplink, we analyze the loss in performance due to fronthaul latency. We have developed a novel look-ahead scheduling scheme that results in significant improvement in performance, especially when the number of active UEs is small.	backhaul (telecommunications);baseband;centralized computing;compaq lte;distributed computing;elegant degradation;harri porten;hybrid automatic repeat request;interrupt latency;profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing);software deployment;telecommunications link;throughput;x86	Shalini Gulati;Balamurali Natarajan;Suresh Kalyanasundaram;Rajeev Agrawal	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504400	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Metrics	23.67901553178815	88.34227337541869	33500

Traditional low-power methods such as channel polling and periodic duty cycling are unable to satisfy WBANs requirements due to idle listening, collision, and control packet overhead problems. In this paper, we propose an RFID-enabled MAC protocol (RMAC) for WBAN that dynamically adjusts the wakeup and sleep modes of the nodes according to the traffic, thus solving the idle listening and overhearing problems. The protocol accommodates normal and emergency traffic using pre-scheduled and RFID wakeup methods. Analytical expressions are derived to analyze the power consumption and delay of the proposed protocol for normal and emergency traffic. The analytical expressions are further validated by extensive simulations using Network Simulator 2(NS2).	duty cycle;low-power broadcasting;network packet;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);requirement;simulation	Sana Ullah	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6655565	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer network	Mobile	10.299483861306719	85.34670772613357	33687

In this paper, we introduce a variant of this problem (directional localization) where each node must be aware of both its position and orientation relative to the network. This variant is especially relevant for the applications in which mobile nodes in a sensor network are required to move in a collaborative manner. Using global positioning systems for localization in large scale sensor networks is not cost effective and may be impractical in enclosed spaces. On the other hand, a set of pre-existing anchors with globally known positions may not always be available. To address these issues, in this work we propose an algorithm for directional node localization based on relative motion of neighboring nodes in an ad-hoc sensor network without an infrastructure of global positioning systems (GPS), anchor points, or even mobile seeds with known locations. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our algorithm scales well for large numbers of nodes and provides convergent localization over time, even with errors introduced by motion actuators and distance measurements. Furthermore, based on our localization algorithm, we introduce mechanisms to preserve network formation during directed mobility in mobile sensor networks. Our simulations confirm that, in a number of realistic scenarios, our algorithm provides for a mobile sensor network that is stable over time irrespective of speed, while using only constant storage per neighbor.	algorithm;global positioning system;html element;hoc (programming language);internationalization and localization;mobile phone;network formation;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping	Hüseyin Akcan;Vassil Kriakov;Hervé Brönnimann;Alex Delis	2006		10.1145/1140104.1140113	embedded system;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	15.221698256378934	74.81585990196581	33752

Simulations with real traffic show that it is a scalable, cost-effective approach that enhances per-flow queuing performance, thereby allowing per-flow QM without the need for extra external memory at speeds up to 10 Gbps.

7b0c79ab83d36c0179daca1343fce28c6729094d	wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks: evaluation of radio disjoint multipath routing		A wireless multi-hop ad hoc network consists of a collection of nodes, which can communicate without any fixed base stations or networking infrastructure. Multi-hop ad hoc networks are ideally suited in areas such as sensor networking, community networking and networking used in emergency situations. Since transmission is wireless and nodes could be mobile, ad hoc networks bring about new challenges to be considered when designing routing algorithms. Multipath routing discovers more than one route between a source node and a destination node in a wireless multi-hop ad hoc network. These routes can be used simultaneously to distribute traffic among several paths or used as backup paths. Multipath routing can provide benefits such as load balancing, bandwidth aggregation, fault tolerance and improvement in QoS. The work done in this thesis investigates the simultaneous use of multipath routes in wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks. In wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks, the simultaneous use of multiple routes may degrade the performance of applications due to mutual interference of discovered paths, irrespective of whether paths are physically node disjoint or link disjoint. Therefore, the selection of noninterfering routes is the main criterion to be addressed when using multiple routes simultaneously. This thesis introduces a new metric to select multiple routes by reducing the effect of interference between paths as far as possible and also selecting the least congested paths. The proposed protocol is named Radio Disjoint Multipath (RDM). The concept of the RDM protocol which can be applied to both reactive and proactive ad hoc protocols is developed and feasibility of the protocol is proven by an implementation and also through an analytical model. Furthermore, this thesis introduces a novel mechanism to distribute multiple flows as well as packets of a single flow based on the properties of the discovered path, which is computed considering the Background Traffic Load (BTL) of each path and the mutual interference between paths. The single flow distribution is further investigated by replicating packets among the RDM paths. This distribution is used to enhance the reliability in adverse environments such as a fire-fighting scenario. The evaluation of results is done considering the non-interfering RDM routing, the interfering RDM routing and the single path routing. When using the RDM routes, two distribution methods, viz., the single flow and the multiple flow distribution methods are considered. The performance of the applications is compared using real application flows consisting of audio conferencing, video transmissions, HTTP web accessing and FTP downloads that use different scenarios with and without mobility. The analysis shows that the use of non-interfering RDM routes simultaneously to distribute application flows significantly outperforms the use of single path routing for most of the scenarios investigated. In summary, all investigations presented in this thesis can help to enhance the application performance in different kinds of wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), by discovering RDM routes and using them simultaneously.	algorithm;backup;community informatics;fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);hypertext transfer protocol;interference (communication);load balancing (computing);multipath propagation;multipath routing;rdm (lighting);sensor;viz: the computer game;wireless mesh network	Koojana Kuladinithi	2009				Mobile	0.39919506336034377	85.61089447315484	33809

In LEO satellite the problem of huge system capacity and simultaneous communications between many single or multipoint mobile users can be solved by using a well-known beamforming. However common digital beamforming technology consumes a lot of the satellite's power to create a very narrow beams while resources of the satellite systems are limited. In this paper, a tradeoff between digital beamforming and analog beamforming are investigated for the purpose of providing a huge system capacity in limited satellite resources.	assistive technology;beamforming;channel capacity;mobile phone;multipoint ground;phased array	Andrey Ivanov;Vadim Teplyakov;Vladimir Kalinin	2015	2015 IEEE East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)	10.1109/EWDTS.2015.7493178	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	23.12969561436535	84.60019261324214	33846

Since the nodes in the virtual backbone need to carry other node's traffic, and node and link failure are inherent in wireless networks, it is desirable that the virtual backbone is fault tolerant. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Connecting Dominating Set Augmentation (CDSA) to construct a 2-connected virtual backbone which can resist the failure of one wireless node. We show that CDSA has guaranteed quality by proving that the size of the CDSA constructed 2-connected backbone is within a constant factor of the optimal 2-connected virtual backbone size. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that in practice, CDSA can build a 2-connected virtual backbone with only small overhead.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;dominating set;fault tolerance;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;overhead (computing);routing;simulation	Feng Wang;My T.

By carefully optimizing the decoder parallelism under the assumption of a prescribed minimum data throughput, a selected CCSDS LDPC decoder is implemented on FPGA and experiments are made with voltage supplies from 3.0v down to 0.9v. Power reports show that the increased parallelism permits the decoder to benefit from a lower supply voltage with constant data throughput and greatly decreased power consumption. In addition, some stopping iteration scheme is explored to detect the un-decodable blocks at early stages and hence reduce the dynamic power consumption of the LDPC decoders.	experiment;field-programmable gate array;iteration;iterative method;parallel computing;parity bit;throughput;very-large-scale integration	Jianing Su;Jun Han	2015	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on ASIC (ASICON)	10.1109/ASICON.2015.7517202	electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;soft-decision decoder;computer science	EDA	19.336783892171788	61.96886844318838	34037
801769ee8cc4da90f7d4251595d11fc4f845614f	spectrum sensing strategy to enhance the qos in white-fi networks		The rapidly growing number of wireless devices running applications that require high bandwidths, has resulted in increasing demands for the unlicensed frequency spectrum. Given the scarcity of allocated unlicensed frequencies, meeting such demands can become a serious concern. Cognitive Radio (CR) technology opens the door for the opportunistic use of the licensed spectrum to partially address the issues relevant to the limited availability of unlicensed frequencies. Combining CR and Wi-Fi to form the socalled White-Fi networks, has been proposed for achieving higher spectrum utilization. This article discusses the spectrum sensing in White-Fi networks and the impacts that it has on the QoS of typical applications. It also reports the analysis of such impacts through various simulation studies. Our results demonstrate the advantages of an adaptive sensing strategy that is capable of changing the related parameters based on QoS requirements. We also propose such a sensing strategy that can adapt to the IEEE 802.11e requirements. The goal of the proposed strategy is the enhancement of the overall QoS of the applications while maintaining efficient sensing of the spectrum. Simulation results of the scenarios that implement the proposed mechanisms demonstrate noticeable QoS improvements compared to cases where common sensing methods are utilized in IEEE802.11 networks.	artificial intelligence;bandwidth (signal processing);cognitive radio;email;ibm systems network architecture;limited availability;quality of service;requirement;simulation;spectral density	Nabil Giweli;Seyed A.

3188978daa70a7f774918fdef8eed0b8266e7e50	unlocking 5g spectrum potential for intelligent iot: opportunities, challenges, and solutions		The Internet of Things (IoT), one of the hottest trends in technology, is transforming our future by interconnecting everything; humans, vehicles, appliances, utilities, infrastructures, street lights, etc., through intelligent connections. For deploying the realization of IoT by 2020, Fifth Generation (5G) wireless communication networks are considered as an essential unifying fabric that will connect billions of devices in some of the fastest, most reliable and most effi cient ways possible, whose impact will be revolutionary, reshaping industries and transforming our world. Therefore, 5G is currently attracting extensive research interest from both industry and academia. It is widely agreed that in contrast to 4G, 5G should achieve 1000 times system throughput, 10 times spectral effi ciency, higher data rates (i.e., the peak data rate of 20 Gb/s and the user experienced rate of 1Gb/s), 25 times average cell throughput, less than 1 ms in end-to-end (E2E) latency, and 100 times higher connectivity density. Among those requirements, the 1000-fold increase in system capacity becomes the most important and maybe the most challenging for 5G systems.

By sharing their position estimates using short range radios, neighboring devices may suppress unnecessary GPS activations in order to reduce energy consumption. We describe and evaluate two collaborative GPS localization protocols based on substitution and averaging of position estimates. The evaluation focuses on entertainment park scenarios and relies on realistic simulations to capture the mobility of park visitors. We demonstrate that the simple collaboration protocols, which do not require distance estimation between the neighbors, may provide significant energy savings. We discuss the impact of device density and provide guidelines for choosing the transmission range of their radio interfaces.	global positioning system;hoc (programming language);location awareness;mobile device;simulation	Vladimir Vukadinovic;Stefan Mangold	2012		10.1145/2159576.2159587	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;geography;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	16.853281963344845	76.18904915755688	34095

The basic concept of the proposed protocol is that it reduces traffic overloads in low depth nodes by introducing full sleep state for one frame. To maximize network performance, we only control traffic from non-relay nodes which are leaf nodes in the tree. We introduce a new superframe structure for pre-scheduling to alleviate contentions and packet collisions between children nodes. In addition, leaf nodes go into a full sleep mode for one superframe in heavy traffic loads by using control packets, which results in a considerable reduction of energy consumption at low depth nodes. Simulation results show the proposed protocol saves more energy and achieves better packet delivery ratio compared to the DMAC with a moderate increase of a latency performance.	scheduling (computing)	Kyoungseok Oh;Gyuhyeon Gim;Wansu Lim;Byeong Man Kim	2018	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-018-5825-z	computer network;computer science;latency (engineering);real-time computing;wireless sensor network;scheduling (computing);superframe;energy consumption;tree structure;network packet;network performance	Mobile	7.748691443709746	82.74544032386348	34110

This paper discusses a method of selecting the best wireless channel within Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) when several technologies could be used in the same WPAN range of the needed access point. The issue is to keep away from already occupied channels. The method is divided into four steps: the passive probing of the power level detecting IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) channels using a new and affordable hardware, the transformation of the probed data to a linguistic level using Fuzzy Set Theory (FST), the classification of the data, and finally the sorting and selection of channels based on whose power levels.	dbm;fuzzy set;sensor;set theory;sorting;wireless access point	Lennart Isaksson;Markus Fiedler;Elisabeth Rakus-Andersson	2006	2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)	10.1109/ICWMC.2006.4	spectrum;wi-fi;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;personal area network;radio spectrum;fuzzy set;wi-fi array;computer network	Robotics	18.820438447805387	79.90654186542723	34135

In this paper, we study the delay- and delay variation-bounded multicast tree (DVBMT) problem which is NP-complete. The problem is to construct a spanning tree for destination node, which has the minimized multicast delay variation, and the delay on the path from the source to each destination is bounded. A solution to this problem is required to provide decent real-time communication services such as on-line games, shopping, and teleconferencing. Performance comparison shows that the proposed scheme outperforms DDVCA which is known to be effective so far in any network topology. The enhancement is up to about 3.6%∼11.1% in terms of normalized surcharge for DDVCA. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(mn 2 ).	algorithm;multicast	Moonseong Kim;Young-Cheol Bang;Hyunseung Choo	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-25978-7_45	time complexity;multicast;teleconference;np-complete;spanning tree;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;mobile computing;service quality;network topology;algorithm;xcast;computer network;satisfiability	EDA	-3.4011392390223922	77.91239907978256	34213

In this paper, we propose an on-demand bandwidth-constrained routing protocol for multi-radio multi-rate multi-channel WMNs with the IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC protocol. The routing protocol is based on a distributed threshold-triggered bandwidth estimation scheme, implemented at each node for estimating the free-to-use bandwidth on each associated channel. According to the free-to-use bandwidth at each node, the call admission control, which is integrated into the routing protocol, predicts the residual bandwidth of a path with the consideration of inter-flow and intra-flow interference. To select the most efficient path among all feasible ones, we propose a routing metric which strikes a balance between the cost and the bandwidth of the path. The simulation results show that our routing protocol can successfully discover paths that meet the end-to-end bandwidth requirements of flows, protect existing flows from QoS violations, exploit the capacity gain due to multiple channels, and incurs low message overhead.	design rule for camera file system;end-to-end encryption;interference (communication);mesh networking;metrics (networking);overhead (computing);quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation;wireless mesh network	Tehuang Liu;Wanjiun Liao	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/T-WC.2009.070369	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.624956812622579	87.36936908457406	34216

5d9a03516a2bdf05b4faaa8be38da43cdf5d24b6	contention- and interference-aware flow-based routing in wireless mesh networks: design and evaluation of a novel routing metric	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;wireless mesh network;article;communications engineering networks	As the popularity of IEEE 802.11-based Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) grows, end users of these environments demand better performance and quality of service (QoS). However, the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of the IEEE 802.11 standard was not initially designed to provide either multihop or QoS capabilities. Therefore, the performance of IEEE 802.11-based WMNs is not optimal. One approach that can mitigate the limitations of IEEE 802.11-based WMNs relies on routing flows through appropriate paths according to: (i) the characteristics of the flows, (ii) the quality of the WMN links, (iii) the contention in transmission, and (iv) the interference in reception. Considerable research effort has been devoted to this topic. However, as we argue in this paper, a comprehensive solution is still needed. This paper presents the Weighted Contention and Interference routing Metric (WCIM). Extensive simulation results show that WCIM outperforms state-of-the-art solutions.	access control;application lifecycle management;computer simulation;database;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;fully buffered dimm;hop;ieee 802.1aq;interference (communication);linux;load balancing (computing);mesh networking;metrics (networking);multipoint ground;np-hardness;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;testbed;type of service;wireless mesh network;wireless router	Miguel Catalan-Cid;José Luis Ferrer;Carles Gomez;Josep Paradells Aspas	2010	EURASIP J.

We propose an annotation based approach to wireless network power management that analyzes the variations in data transfer bandwidth during playback and uses the results to buffer data into larger burst transmissions with longer idle periods when the network card is transitioned into a lower power, sleep mode.

77014429f9f58f4ea64b9104d5a6a2283289f220	policy-based routing with non-strict preferences	robustness;policy based routing	Traditional studies of routing problems often assumed strict preferences on paths, by eliminating ambiguity in path comparisons, or imposing a priori deterministic tie-breaking. Such an assumption is outpaced by today's common practice of non-deterministic,multi-path routing, which is crucial to traffic engineering, QoS routing, multicasting and virtual private networking. A pair of paths may be incomparable or equally preferred. In the presence of ambiguous preferences at pairs, or even multiple collections of paths, a challenge is to ensure robustness in the complex and sophisticated situations of policy-based routing where heterogeneous routing policies are allowed among routing systems. This paper presents an extensive study of policy-based routing with non-strict preferences, deriving sufficient conditions that ensure the existence, optimality and asynchronous convergence of stable routings.	asynchronous i/o;design tool;linear algebra;mv-algebra;multicast;multipath routing;nondeterministic algorithm;requirement;strict function;virtual private network;wheels	Chi-Kin Chau	2006		10.1145/1159913.1159957	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;mathematical optimization;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;robustness;computer network	Networks	-1.106651724864875	80.32010340205811	34314

The usage of reconfigurable hardware gives an interesting alternative to existing microcontroller based solutions. A modular gateway prototype based on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) with specialized routing modules allows a significant speed up compared to microcontroller solutions. The architecture of the routing hardware modules as well as the most relevant implementation details are described in this paper. The complete routing functionality was implemented and tested under series constraints. A performance comparison shows significant speedups.

7dc01056dab42212a144739459000b5b18ca018a	fault aware dynamic adaptive routing using lbdr		Network-on-Chip (NoC) is evolving as an efficient and scalable in- terconnect architecture for current and future CMP, MPSoC systems. An impor- tant challenge in NoC design is to choose an appropriate routing algorithm, as it impacts the NoC performance. As technology scales down to Deep-Submicron (DSM), on-chip networks are becoming increasingly prone to failures. At higher level these failures are handled by fault tolerant routing algorithms. Fault toler- ant routing algorithms avoid faulty regions and route traffic through safe regions. Currently, routing algorithms are implemented as source or distributed routing. To handle faults, both source and distributed routing make use of routing ta- bles. Algorithms implemented with routing tables do not scale well with network size. Scalable routing implementation, such as Logic Based Distributed Routing (LBDR) has been proposed for efficient and compact implementation of routing. LBDR handles faults without using routing table. In this paper we propose a fault tolerant routing scheme based on LBDR which aims to handle faults while at the same time addressing network congestion. Proposed method integrates deter- ministic and adaptive routing schemes to avoid congestion as well as faults that may be present in the network. Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed method in case of single and multiple link failures.	routing	Rimpy Bishnoi;Vijay Laxmi;Manoj Singh Gaur;Mohit Baskota	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-42024-5_36	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Arch	2.851527174572173	64.13842506708163	34392

However, NAND flash based Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are inherently prone to soft errors from various sources, e.g., wear-out, program and read disturbance, and hot-electron injections. To address this issue, flash devices employ different error-correction codes (ECC) to detect and correct soft errors. Using ECC induces non-trivial overhead costs in terms of flash area, performance, and energy consumption. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of reducing the need for strong ECC while maintaining the correct execution of the applications. Specifically, we explore data-level error tolerance in various data-centric applications, and study the system implications for designing a low-cost yet high performance flash storage system, SoftFlash. We explore three key aspects of enabling SoftFlash. First, we design an error modeling framework that can be used in runtime for monitoring and estimating the error rates of real-world flash devices. Our experiments show that the error rate of SSDs can be modeled with reasonable accuracy (13%) using parameters accessible from operating systems. Second, we carry out extensive fault-injection experiments on a wide range of applications including multimedia, scientific computation, and cloud computing to understand the requirements and characteristics of data level error tolerance. We find that the data from these applications show high error resiliency, and can produce acceptable results even with high error rates. Third, we conduct a case study to show the benefits of leveraging data-level error tolerance in flash devices. Our results show that, for many data-centric applications, the proposed SoftFlash system can achieve acceptable results (or better in certain cases), with more than a 40% performance improvement, and a third of the energy consumption.	adobe flash;cloud computing;code;computation;computational science;computer data storage;correctness (computer science);data access;electron;error detection and correction;error-tolerant design;experiment;fault injection;firmware;flash memory controller;hard disk drive;hot-carrier injection;input/output;operating system;overhead (computing);requirement;smart;solid-state drive;throughput	Xin Xu;H.

To this end, different positioning techniques have been developed aiming to minimize the localization error. UWB signals are well-suited to communication and tracking systems, as they provide increased tolerance to localization errors due to the fine time resolution of the transmitted pulses and their large bandwidth. Thiswork presents two indoor Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning schemes based on the hybrid combination of Fingerprinting with temporal or angular data. The proposed schemes are evaluated using five different propagation models and different numbers ofAnchor Nodes (AN) that emit omnidirectional UWB signals. Then, measures are gathered for these parameters and results are presented in terms of localization and angular error. Also, results are provided for the basic statistics, cumulative distribution function and the boxplot of the positioning error, thus providing probabilistic modeling for the localization error. The performance evaluation shows that the two proposed hybridUWBschemes provide accurate indoor positioning independently of the type of data used during the localization procedure and optimum placement along with the optimum number of the ANs is provided.

Our results show that RLB outperforms deterministic algorithms (25% more bandwidth than Dimension Order Routing) and minimal oblivious algorithms (50% more bandwidth than 2 phase ROMM [9]) on worst-case traffic. At the same time, RLB offers higher throughput on local traffic than a fully randomized algorithm (4.6 times more bandwidth than VAL (Valiant's algorithm) [15] in the best case). RLBth (RLB threshold) improves the locality of RLB to match the throughput of minimal algorithms on very local traffic in exchange for a 4% reduction in worst-case throughput compared to RLB. Both RLB and RLBth give better throughput than all other algorithms we tested on randomly selected traffic permutations. While RLB algorithms have somewhat lower guaranteed bandwidth than VAL they have much lower latency at low offered loads (up to 3.65 times less for RLBth).	best, worst and average case;load balancing (computing);locality of reference;randomized algorithm;randomness;routing;throughput;variable assembly language	Arjun Singh;William J.

de808e3f7c1c0190075aa07b7c4129f7c72415db	ebp: an efficient broadcast protocol for warning message dissemination in vanets		Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) enable vehicle-to-vehicle communications to share relevant road information with various applications. Road safety is one of the main objectives of VANETs that has attracted great interest from researchers. Other so-called comfort applications have also been studied which can improve driving experience and passenger safety. In all these applications, sharing of warning messages can help drivers minimize accidents and congestions, and plan better itinerary during the congestion situations or the anticipation of potential and highly hazardous events. In this paper, we present an efficient broadcast protocol (EBP) for broadcasting warning messages in VANETs. As an improved strategy for alert data dissemination, EBP can be applied in whatever the nature of the risk, with a particular focus on mobile dangers. We first conduct an in-depth analysis and evaluation, under different conditions, of the existing approaches and mechanisms used for information dissemination in VANETs. Then, we point out their drawbacks and design the EBP to avoid these drawbacks. As a result, the EBP is an improved, well-justified and more effective protocol. We validate it by simulation experiments under various scenarios.

As pervasive computing has been identified as a notable trend in computing, investigations on effective software testing techniques for WSN are essential. In particular, energy is a crucial and scarce resource in WSN nodes. Programs running correctly but failing to meet the energy constraints may still be problematic. As such, testing techniques for power-aware applications are useful; otherwise, the quickly depleted device batteries will need frequent replacements, hence challenging the effectiveness of automation. Since current testing techniques do not consider the issue of energy constraints, their automation in the WSN domain warrants further investigation. This paper proposes a novel power-aware technique built on top of the notion of metamorphic testing to alleviate both the test oracle issue and the powerawareness issue. It tests the functions of programs in WSN nodes that are in close proximity, and uses the data consolidation criteria of data aggregation in programs as the basis for verifying test results.

Existing fully adaptive routing algorithms apply conservative VC re-allocation: only empty VCs can be re-allocated, which limits performance. We propose two novel flow control designs. First, whole packet forwarding (WPF) re-allocates a nonempty VC if the VC has enough free buffers for an entire packet. WPF does not induce deadlock if the routing algorithm is deadlock-free using conservative VC re-allocation. It is an important extension to several deadlock avoidance theories. Second, we extend Duato's theory to apply aggressive VC re-allocation on escape VCs without deadlock. Finally, we propose a design which maintains maximal routing flexibility with low hardware cost. For synthetic traffic, our design performs averagely 88.9 percent better than existing fully adaptive routing. Our design is superior to partially adaptive and deterministic routing.	algorithm;cpu cache;cache coherence;coherence (physics);coherent;deadlock;deterministic routing;flow control (data);maximal set;network packet;synthetic intelligence;theory;vc dimension	Sheng Ma;Zhiying Wang;Natalie D.

However, nodes usually differ significantly in terms of available resources: energy, buffer space, and bandwidth. Routing algorithms need to make the most efficient use of custodian resources while also making sure those in limited supply are not exhausted. This paper proposes a distributed scheme for calculating resources available in node vicinity, as a tool to support meaningful routing decisions. A generic model is developed first, and is then applied to individual network assets. The model is based on a sparse network, where resources are potentially not uniformly distributed. It uses recent encounters to estimate resource availability in node vicinity. It is shown that a store-carry-forward scheme may benefit from accessing vicinity resource estimates. This knowledge allows nodes to implement meaningful custodian election and queue management strategies, approached here from a holistic perspective. It is demonstrated that routing protocols not only use up fewer resources overall, but also consume resources preferentially from nodes with higher resource levels, sparing nodes with limited supplies. As a result, disparities in available resources across the node population are significantly reduced, and nodes are less likely to leave the network as a consequence of resource depletion.

In this paper, we present an in-depth study to characterize the surprisingly notable systemic impacts of low-pass filter (LPF) design, which is a small yet indispensable component used for shaping spectrum and rejecting interference. Using a bottom-up approach, we examine how signal-level distortions caused by the trade-off of LPF design propagate to the upper-layers of wireless communication, reshaping bit error patterns and degrading link performance of today's 802.11 systems. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm that harnesses LPF defects for improving video streaming, which substantially enhances video quality in mobile environments.	algorithm;bit error rate;bottom-up parsing;byte;cylinder-head-sector;distortion;interference (communication);low-pass filter;noise shaping;roll-off;std bus;streaming media;top-down and bottom-up design;transceiver	Alireza Ameli Renani;Jun Huang;Guoliang Xing;Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056967	computer hardware;computer network;transceiver;computer science;wireless;video quality;distortion	Visualization	22.247044883879703	64.49402818883455	34983

Unlike terrestrial WSNs (TWSNs) which uses electromagnetic signaling, underwater WSNs (UWSNs) require underwater acoustic (UWA) signaling. Received signal strength (RSS)-based source localization is considered in this paper due to its practical simplicity and the constraint of low-cost sensor devices, but this area received little attention so far because of the complicated UWA transmission loss (TL) phenomena. In this paper, we address this issue and propose two novel semidefinite programming (SDP) approaches which can be solved more efficiently. The numerical results validate our proposed SDP solvers in underwater environments, and indicate that the placement of the anchor nodes influences the RSS-based localization accuracy similarly as in the terrestrial counterpart. We also highlight that adopting traditional terrestrial RSS-based localization methods will fail in underwater scenarios.	acoustic cryptanalysis;global positioning system;loss function;numerical analysis;rss;semidefinite programming;sensor web;terrestrial television;underwater robotics	Tinghui Xu;Yongchang Hu;Bingbing Zhang;Geert Leus	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472409	embedded system;session description protocol;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;underwater	Robotics	18.676951572455817	75.79435954354065	35005

The proposed algorithm is a trimodal version of variational message passing (VMP). Compared to VMP and bimodal VMP algorithms, the so called tri-VMP algorithm features better localization accuracy for almost the same complexity and cost.

fd4872ed110ad2aec3c4a99c474cf3ff75336ae2	virtual clustering: a communication cost reduction strategy for distributed consensus-based estimation in cooperative networks		In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed consensus-based estimation in cooperative networks, e.g., wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To solve this problem and achieve an accurate consensus-based estimate solution, many iterative distributed algorithms require the information exchange among nodes at each iteration suffering from huge communication overhead. In our previous work, a new strategy of virtual clustering was discussed with the purpose of reducing communication overhead for distributed consensus-based estimation. By classifying the data using virtual clusters, data with reduced size will be transmitted during the distributed processing. Here, we further propose two methods to reduce the size of transmitted data for arbitrary network topologies. One method is based on finding the shortest path in a network and the other relies on linear independence of constraint qualification (LICQ). The study shows that both methods can successfully reduce communication overhead. Moreover, the second method outperforms the first one and provides the optimal communication cost for the distributed consensus-based estimation.	cluster analysis;consensus (computer science);distributed algorithm;distributed computing;download;information exchange;iteration;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;network topology;overhead (computing);reduction strategy (lambda calculus);shortest path problem	Shengdi Wang;Guang Xu;Henning Paul;Armin Dekorsy	2018			cluster analysis;cost reduction;consensus;computer science;distributed computing	HPC	13.652644464112871	80.49962255737455	35122

Developing cost-effective multicast routing algorithm plays a crucial role in implementing multicast routing protocol successfully. However, most of prior multicast routing algorithms are dedicated to two QoS constraints, few researches focus on the case with three or more constraints. In this paper, we explore the multicast routing problem with K constraints where K > 2. To address this problem, we propose FAMOUS, a <u>f</u>ast <u>m</u>ulti-c<u>o</u>nstrained m<u>u</u>ltica<u>s</u>t routing algorithm. The algorithm leverages an entropy-based process to aggregate all weights into a comprehensive metric for simplifying the problem, and then applies this metric to search a multicast tree on the constructing shortest path tree basis. We conduct complexity analysis and extensive simulations for the proposed algorithm. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that FAMOUS is superior to a representative multi-constrained multicast routing algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy, and thus it is applicable to realistic networking scenarios.	aggregate data;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;multicast;quality of service;routing;shortest path problem;simulation	Jun Huang;Xiang Li;Yin Ying;Yi Sun;Qiang Duan;Cong-Cong Xing	2014		10.1145/2663761.2663763	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;multicast;inter-domain;equal-cost multi-path routing;protocol independent multicast;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;path vector protocol;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-3.4081646415432214	82.83477988991471	35172

We want to obtain location information from a device by using its existing communication modality. DASH7 is designed for low power sensor and actuator communication on a medium range, using the license exempt radio frequency channels below one gigahertz. In this paper, we present a method to localize a DASH7 mobile node based on a single message and a deterministic propagation model. The propagation model is used to indicate the distance between sender and receiver so that single measurement localization approach is possible without maintaining a fingerprint database. We obtain a median location error of 3.9 m, where we still see room for improvement.	dash7;fingerprint;internet of things;modality (human–computer interaction);radio frequency;software propagation	Rafael Berkvens;Ben Bellekens;Maarten Weyn	2017	2017 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2017.8115875	computer network;engineering;electronic engineering;license;dash7;actuator;radio frequency;communication source;logic gate;wireless;communication channel	Mobile	20.713441350709193	71.60793779345076	35216

In achieving indoor localization, a set of transmitters from wireless communication networks are often used as reference nodes to localize target nodes with unknown locations. The accuracy of such localization process is considerably affected by the spatial distribution of the reference nodes with respect to the target node to be localized. Hence, deploying the reference nodes at best locations will notably increase the localization precision. In this paper, a novel reference nodes deployment scheme is introduced which minimizes the average Mean Square Error (MSE) of the localization over the area of interest with certain shape. The proposed scheme is evaluated for deploying the reference nodes in the circular, square, and hexagonal localization regions. The proposed scheme is validated and illustrated by numerical simulations.	computer simulation;gps signals;global positioning system;internationalization and localization;mean squared error;mined;mined-out;numerical analysis;software deployment;telecommunications network;transmitter	Fei Long;Aydin Behnad;Xianbin Wang	2015	2015 IEEE 34th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2015.7410310	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	18.10492759877148	75.26271793640038	35284

This brings on the visual information retrieved from adjacent camera nodes usually exhibits high levels of correlation. In this paper, first, based on the analysis of 3D directional sensing model of camera sensor nodes, a correlation model is proposed by measuring the intersection area of multiple camera nodes&#x2019; field of views. In this model, there is a asymmetrical relationship of the correlation between two camera nodes. Then, to farthest eliminate the data redundancy and use the node collaboration characteristic of wireless (multimedia) sensor networks, two kinds of cluster structure, camera sensor nodes cluster, and common sensor nodes cluster are established to cooperate on image processing and transmission tasks. A set of experiments are performed to investigate the proposed correlation coefficient. Further simulations based on a sample of monitoring a crossing by three correlative camera nodes show that the proposed network topology and image fusion and transmission scheme released the pressure of camera node greatly and reduce the network energy consumption of communication of the whole network efficiently.

Parallel expansion in the interest for fast deployable, short-term systems that work with no centralized base station have been studied. MANETs venture to turn the imagination of getting connected anywhere and at any time into a reality, in this work, we examined a cluster-based routing by utilizing a multi-meshed tree model. The key objective is to decrease the control overheads needed in the organization and maintenance of network while providing a robust connectivity. We proposed a (HMMT) Hybrid Multi-Meshed Tree, routing protocol features a combination of Proactive and Reactive (Hybrid) routing. This proposed protocol solves the challenges associated with dynamic adaptation and improved connectivity via a Hierarchical Cluster based method along with a Virtual Identifier. The simplicity of its algorithm and reduced message complexity are suitable for limited power, resource constrained networks and limited bandwidths are its major advantages.	algorithm;centralized computing;identifier;router (computing);routing	Kolog Solomon Polpiem;Tetteh J.

Such failures may convert a fully-connected sensor network into multiple disjoint sub-networks, leading to the network partition problem. The placement of relay nodes is the only way to restore the lost connectivity because these devices, compared to the sensor nodes, have a higher energy backup, with a longer communication range. In this paper, a new solution is proposed to heal the network partition problem in the wireless sensor network. The solution is based on a zero gradient point inside the convex hull polygon. The proposed solution is compared with various naive approaches, along with existing state-of-the-art solutions, that is, the Spider Web-1C heuristic and Steiner-minimum-tree based optimal relay node placement algorithm. The simulation experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, we focus on mobility scenarios characterized by heterogeneous, highly changing mobility roles in the network. To capture these high dynamics of diverse sensory motion we propose a novel network parameter, the mobility level, which, although simple and local, quite accurately takes into account both the spatial and speed characteristics of motion. We then propose adaptive data dissemination protocols that use the mobility level estimation to optimize performance, by basically exploiting high mobility (redundant message ferrying) as a cost-effective replacement of flooding, e.g. the sensors tend to dynamically propagate less data in the presence of high mobility, while nodes of high mobility are favored for moving data around. These dissemination schemes are enhanced by a distance-sensitive probabilistic message flooding inhibition mechanism that further reduces communication cost, especially for fast nodes of high mobility level, and as distance to data destination decreases. Our simulation findings demonstrate significant performance gains of our protocols compared to non-adaptive protocols, i.e. adaptation increases the success rate and reduces latency (even by 15%) while at the same time significantly reducing energy dissipation (in most cases by even 40%). Also, our adaptive schemes achieve significantly higher message delivery ratio and satisfactory energy-latency trade-offs when compared to flooding when sensor nodes have limited message queues.	message queue;sensor;simulation	Athanasios Kinalis;Sotiris E.

In wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, a Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is useful as a virtual backbone due to the absence of fixed infrastructure or centralized management. Most of CDS construction methods seek to minimize the size of the backbone. Nevertheless, other constraints than reducing the number of nodes can be considered. In that case, it is more interesting to consider nodes' weights (according to a specific purpose) and to reduce the total backbone's weight. This construction is called a Low Weight Connected Dominating Set (LWCDS). In this paper, we present a self-stabilizing distributed algorithm for the construction of a LWCDS. The self-stabilizing property confers to our algorithm the ability to recover in a finite time after a transient fault. Our algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations that show the efficiency of our solution in different contexts and the large possible applications of our algorithm. We also introduce two new evaluation criteria to evaluate the algorithms of CDS construction in the specific context of mobility.	centralized computing;connected dominating set;distributed algorithm;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;routing;scheduling (computing);self-stabilization;simulation	Karim Bessaoud;Alain Bui;Laurence Pilard	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM 17th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications	10.1109/DS-RT.2013.33	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;service set;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	5.995033360257253	79.08448510195107	35458

With the introduction of the Generation 5 Parallel Enterprise Server in May 1998, a number of important new fiber optic features and enhancements to existing features were made available for applications in input/output device attachment, networking, and parallel sysplex coupling. In this paper, we describe the main applications of fiber optic data links on System/390, with emphasis on the new features announced with the G5. In particular, we describe the fiber connection (FICONTM) links, the Gigabit Ethernet interface for the open systems adapter (OSA Express), the Fiber Transport Services fiber quick connect system featuring a new type of small-form-factor fiber optic connector, and the Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex using the 9729 Optical Wavelength Division Multiplexer. We also describe the use of optical modeconditioning patch cables in FICON, Gigabit Ethernet, and Parallel Sysplex data links as a way to reuse an installed multimode cable infrastructure at higher data rates, and to overcome distance-limiting phenomena such as differential mode delay associated with modal power distribution. Technical data is presented for each of these applications, and we discuss how the new fiber optic interconnects fit into the overall IBM strategy for future large systems.	attachments;cmos;central processing unit;channel i/o;channel capacity;communications protocol;data center;disaster recovery;disk mirroring;escon;electrical connection;expansion card;ficon;form factor (design);gigabit;ibm parallel sysplex;input/output;modal dispersion;modal logic;multiplexer;multiplexing;network switch;open systems adapter;optical fiber;output device;passive optical network;patch cable;patch panel;powerpc 970;relocation (computing);scalability;server (computing);small form factor;uniprocessor system	Casimer M.

Drew on our LLC scheme that adjusts cluster coverage to minimize energy consumption, low-energy localized clustering for RFID networks (LLCR) addresses RFID reader anti-collision problem in this paper. LLCR is a RFID reader anti-collision algorithm that minimizes collisions by minimizing overlapping areas of clusters that each RFID reader covers. LLCR takes into account each RFID reader's energy state as well as RFID reader collisions. For the energy state factor, we distinguish homogeneous RFID networks from heterogeneous ones according to computing power of each RFID reader. Therefore, we have designed efficient homo-LLCR and hetero-LLCR schemes for each case. Our simulation-based performance evaluation shows that LLCR minimizes energy consumption and overlapping areas of clusters of RFID readers.	algorithm;cluster analysis;collision problem;energy level;fairness measure;hierarchical clustering;natural language processing;performance evaluation;radio-frequency identification;scheduling (computing);simulation	Joongheon Kim;Wonjun Lee;Jieun Yu;Jihoon Myung;Eunkyo Kim;Choonhwa Lee	2005	Proceedings. 14th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, 2005.

A hypercube is one of the most popular topologies for interconnection networks. In this paper, we propose two new fault-tolerant routing algorithms for hypercubes based on approximate directed routable probabilities. Probabilities represent the ability of routing toward any node located at a specific distance and are calculated by considering from which direction the message has been received. Each node chooses one of its neighbor nodes to forward the message by comparing the approximate directed routable probabilities. We also conducted a computer experiment to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.	approximation algorithm;routing	Thuy Dinh Duong;Keiichi Kaneko	2014	Future Generation Comp.

Since the communication usually accounts as a major power consumption, there is some techniques, such as topology control and network coding, to decrease the activity of sensors’ transceivers. If we utilize the techniques synchronously, then may overall performance do not increase as expected. This paper provides an optimization problem for energy consumption in WSNs, where the network employs both topology control and network-coding-based multi-cast simultaneously. This approach improves overall performance in comparison with employing them distinctly. The proposed optimization problem is transformed into a convex problem which leads to a numerous theoretical and conceptual advantages. Then the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions are presented to derive analytical expressions of the globally optimal solution.

However, relying upon a perception-based hybrid fault model and a fairly realistic system model, our results are valid for a wide variety of node and link faults and apply to very high-precision applications as well: Impairments due to clock granularity and discrete rate adjustment cannot be ignored here anymore. Our accuracy analysis focuses on the nodes' local accuracy interval, which provides the atop running application with an on-line bound on the current deviation from external time. We show that this bound could get larger than twice the necessary lower bound (""""traditional accuracy""""), hence OP is considerably suboptimal in this respect."""	clock synchronization	Ulrich Schmid;Klaus Schossmaier	2003	Inf.

We observe that Primary Users (PUs) in CRNs exhibit unevenly geographic distribution due to their social behaviors. In the area with densely-distributed PUs, the low spectrum availability will severely decrease the Secondary Users (SUs) communication reliability. We are motivated to exploit Primary User (PU) social features to set up a multi-hop routing path providing reliable end-to-end communications. There are two main challenges: 1) how to quantitatively represent and characterize PU social features in CRNs; 2) given the knowledge of the PU social features, how to design an efficient route to improve the packet-forwarding reliability. We first propose the concept of PU community in CRNs. Maximum likelihood estimation method is then employed to predict the number of potential PUs. The estimated results effectively reflect the spectrum utilization, and hence, provide important information for PU community formulation. After that, considering the existence of PU community, we propose a hybrid routing scheme to alleviate the impact of PU community on packet-forwarding reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves the reliability of end-to-end communications.	cognitive radio;dynamic programming;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;ibm systems network architecture;network packet;one-class classification;perimeter;routing;simulation	Huimin Wu;Yan Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883321	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.69259602016876	85.5522361068401	35671

In particular, access transport networks connecting radio access with core networks are of critical importance. They should be able to support massive connectivity, super high data rates, and real time services in a ubiquitous environment. To attain these targets, transport networks should be constructed on the basis of a variety of technologies and methods, depending on application scenarios, geographical areas, and deployment models. In this paper, we present several technologies, including analog radioover-fiber transmission, intermediate-frequency-over-fiber technology, radio-on-radio transmission, and the convergence of fiber and millimeter-wave systems, that can facilitate building such effective transport networks in many use cases. For each technology, we present the system concept, possible application cases, and some demonstration results. We also discuss potential standardization and development directions so that the proposed technologies can be widely used.	access network;communications of the acm;end-to-end principle;frequency band;intermediate frequency;internet access;radio wave;software deployment	Pham Tien Dat;Atsushi Kanno;Naokatsu Yamamoto;Tetsuya Kawanishi	2015	2015 ITU Kaleidoscope: Trust in the Information Society (K-2015)	10.1109/Kaleidoscope.2015.7383643	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;wired communication;computer network;broadband networks	HCI	21.990288878424977	86.41869750075219	35690

However, despite extensive research on indoor localization techniques, they are still not ready for deployment in large and complex environments, like shopping malls and hospitals, where navigation assistance is needed. To achieve accurate, continuous, and real-time localization with smartphones in such environments, we present a series of key techniques enhancing a probabilistic localization algorithm. The algorithm is designed for smartphones and employs inertial sensors on a mobile device and Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. We evaluate the proposed system in a 21,000 ${\text{m}^{2}}$ shopping mall which includes three multi-story buildings and a large open underground passageway. Experiments in this space validate the effect of the proposed technologies to improve localization accuracy. Field experiments with visually impaired participants confirm the practical performance of the proposed system in realistic use cases.	algorithm;bluetooth;experiment;ground truth;internationalization and localization;mobile device;rss;real-time clock;sensor;smartphone;software deployment;unified framework	Masayuki Murata;Dragan Ahmetovic;Daisuke Sato;Hironobu Takagi;Kris M.

This solution guarantees the low-latency requirements of the URLLC service by means of edge processing, e.g., for vehicle-to-cellular use cases, as well as the high spectral efficiency for eMBB traffic via centralized baseband processing. In addition to the conventional orthogonal multiplexing of the two services, this work evaluates the performance of Heterogeneous Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (H-NOMA), which enables eMBB and URLLC data, to share the same radio resources. Both uplink and downlink are analyzed by considering practical aspects such as fading, lack of channel state information for URLLC transmitters, rate adaptation for eMBB transmitters, finite fronthaul capacity, and different coexistence strategies, such as puncturing.	baseband;centralized computing;channel state information;coexist (image);edge detection;interrupt latency;multiplexing;puncturing;radio access network;requirement;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;transmitter	Rahif Kassab;Osvaldo Simeone;Petar Popovski;Toufiqul Islam	2018	CoRR		ran;computer network;broadband;computer science	Mobile	23.28542749735836	88.15262193815401	35844

One interface operates in infrastructure mode to serve IEEE 802.11(b) client devices so that they can readily use the mesh network without any software modification or installation. The other interface operates in ad-hoc mode to forward packets among mesh access points until they reach an Internet gateway or the access point with which the destination client device is associated. Compared with a single-radio WMN, such a WMN offers ease of use and higher network throughputs for client devices. In this paper, we implement and evaluate the performance of three routing protocols (OSPF, AODV, and STP) operating in dual-radio-dual-mode IEEE 802.11(b) WMNs. Our simulation results show that among the tested protocols, OSPF provides the highest system total througput and results in the largest number of stable connections in such a WMN.	coexist (image);etx (form factor);gateway (telecommunications);hoc (programming language);internet;metric;mesh networking;network switch;performance;routing;scalability;simulation;throughput;usability;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	S.

Scarceness of resources and node mobility turn routing into a challenging problem and therefore, we claim that building DHT as an overlay network (like in wired environments) is not the best option. Hence, we present a proof-of-concept DHT, called cell hash routing (CHR), designed from scratch to cope with problems like limited available energy, communication range or node mobility. CHR overcomes these problems, by using position information to organize a DHT of clusters instead of individual nodes. By using position-based routing on top of these clusters, CHR is very efficient. Furthermore, its localized routing and its load sharing schemes, make CHR very scalable in respect to network size and density. For these reasons, we believe that CHR is a simple and yet powerful adaptation of the DHT concept for wireless ad hoc environments.	cell (microprocessor);cluster analysis;constraint handling rules;distributed hash table;fault tolerance;geographic routing;global serializability;hoc (programming language);key (cryptography);need to know;overlay network;perimeter;population;requirement;routing table;scalability;self-replication;unit disk graph	Filipe Araújo;Luís E.

470bf5d0b14cf5d93c47820eb21738bf03aa401d	eeis: an energy efficient at idle slots mac layer protocol for wireless sensor networks		Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a new class of distributed Systems. WSN consists of several thousands of tiny devices called sensor nodes, which are distributed autonomously to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure and motion at different locations. Energy plays an important role in WSN because nodes are battery operated and every sensor node has limited battery power. Therefore Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocol should be energy efficient. The main objective of this paper is to minimize energy of WSN, in low duty cycles [7] using Energy Efficient at Idle Slots Medium Access Control layer Protocol (EEIS). It provides more energy efficiency at Cluster Head (CH) into idle Slots by letting each and every node to stay into sleep mode unless the numbers of packets in its buffer are greater than the packet threshold. It causes packet loss. This problem is solved by sending all remaining data, with the last frame slot in a round. Therefore the energy consumption is decreased and networks life increases by EEIS protocol. The experimentation is done using NS 2.34 simulator and results reveal that, the proposed protocol significantly reduces the energy consumption as compared to the existing LEACH protocol.

In the algorithm, k-means algorithm is used to divide nodes into k different clusters. Nearest-neighbor distances algorithm is used to calculate the optimal transmission power of nodes which are in the same cluster. Then sink node broadcasts to inform other nodes that they use optimal transmission power for communicating with neighbor nodes which are in the same cluster and use default maximum transmission power for communicating with neighbor nodes which are in the different clusters. Simulation results show that by selecting the appropriate parameters, NNCPCA can prolong network lifetime, reduce network latency time and enable cost-effective energy consumption.

However, careful consideration is required when SSD-based systems employ parity protection. First, additional writes are required for parity updates. Second, parity consumes space on the device, which results in write amplification from less efficient garbage collection at higher space utilization.  This article analyzes the effectiveness of SSD-based RAID and discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks in terms of reliability. A Markov model is presented to estimate the lifetime of SSD-based RAID systems in different environments. In a small array, our results show that parity protection provides benefit only with considerably low space utilizations and low data access rates. However, in a large system, RAID improves data lifetime even when we take write amplification into account.	amplifier;data access;data striping;garbage collection (computer science);markov chain;markov model;overhead (computing);raid;solid-state drive;standard raid levels	Sangwhan Moon;A.

Although the CR concept was invented with the core idea of realizing """"cognition"""", the research on measuring CR cognition capabilities and intelligence is largely open. Deriving the intelligence capabilities of CR not only can lead to the development of new CR technologies, but also makes it possible to better configure the networks by integrating CRs with different intelligence capabilities in a more cost- efficient way. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a data-driven methodology to quantitatively analyze the intelligence factors of the CR with learning capabilities. The basic idea of our methodology is to run various tests on the CR in different spectrum environments under different settings and obtain various performance results on different metrics. Then we apply factor analysis on the performance results to identify and quantize the intelligence capabilities of the CR. More specifically, we present a case study consisting of sixty three different types of CRs. CRs are different in terms of learning-based dynamic spectrum access strategies, number of sensors, sensing accuracy, and processing speed. Based on our methodology, we analyze the intelligence capabilities of the CRs through extensive simulations. Four intelligence capabilities are identified for the CRs through our analysis, which comply with the nature of the tested algorithms."""	algorithm;artificial general intelligence;cognition;cognitive radio;factor analysis;latent variable;multi-user;sensor;simulation;spectral efficiency	Monireh Dabaghchian;Songsong Liu;Amir Alipour-Fanid;Kai Zeng;Xiaohua Li;Yu Chen	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841906	algorithm design;cognitive radio;simulation;cognition;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;management science;measurement;statistics;computer network	EDA	19.11642616995285	88.20249809797183	36017

Most of the used techniques are based on integration of Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS). However, navigation through areas such as tunnels, where GPS coverage is vulnerable, obliges the use of a different approach. Based on this observation, we designed and implemented a lightweight cooperative positioning algorithm based on Adaptive Localization Protocol (ALP). In this paper, we apply our method as support to an intersection service for traffic regulation, in which a group of concurrent cars shares an intersection/critical section.

The IETF designed the Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for supporting these constrained networks. Keeping in mind the different requirements of such networks, the protocol supports multiple routing topologies, called DODAGs, built using different objective functions, so as to optimize routing based on several metrics. A DODAG versioning system is incorporated into RPL in order to ensure an optimized topology. However, an attacker can exploit this mechanism to damage the network and reduce its lifetime. In this paper we propose a detection strategy based on a distributed monitoring architecture with dedicated algorithms that is able to identify malicious nodes performing such attacks in RPL-based environments. The performance of this solution is evaluated through extensive experiments and its scalability is quantified considering a monitoring node placement method.	algorithm;embedded system;experiment;internationalization and localization;internet of things;lossy compression;malware;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;routing;scalability;sensor;software deployment;software versioning;version control	Anthéa Mayzaud;Remi Badonnel;Isabelle Chrisment	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM)	10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818408	maintenance engineering;communications protocol;routing;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer security;network topology;computer network	Mobile	6.503724880554725	75.59004997571942	36080

Existing neighbor discovery protocols mostly assume a single-channel network model and can only support a subset of duty cycles, thus limiting the energy conservation levels of wireless devices. In this paper, we study the neighbor discovery problem in multi-channel networks where the wireless nodes have heterogeneous duty cycles, asynchronous clocks and asymmetrical channel perceptions, which we formulate as heterogeneous neighbor discovery problem. We first establish a performance bound for any neighbor discovery protocol by relating the two performance metrics, discovery delay and diversity. We then present the design, analysis and evaluation of Mc-Dis, a multi-channel neighbor discovery protocol that can support can practically support almost all duty cycles and guarantee discovery on every channel in multichannel networks even when nodes have asynchronous clocks and asymmetrical channel perceptions.	asynchronous circuit;bootstrapping (compilers);limbo;network model	Lin Chen;Kaigui Bian	2013	CoRR		neighbor discovery protocol;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	11.07922988512653	82.13594785538815	36087

The insertion of a hardware Trojan involves a deliberate and malicious change to an IC that adds or removes functionality or reduces its reliability. Trojans are designed to disable and/or destroy the IC at some future time or they may serve to leak confidential information covertly to the adversary. Trojans are cleverly hidden by the adversary to make it extremely difficult for chip validation processes, such as manufacturing test, to accidentally discover them. This paper investigates a power supply transient signal analysis method for detecting Trojans that is based on the analysis of multiple power port signals. In particular, we focus on determining the smallest detectable Trojan in a set of process simulation models that characterize a TSMC 0.18 um process.	adversary (cryptography);confidentiality;hardware trojan;integrated circuit;malware;microprocessor;power supply;scalability;sensor;signal processing;simulation;test strategy;trojan horse (computing);unified model	Reza M.

In this paper, we propose a routing protocol based on a balanced tree, called BATR (balanced aggregation tree routing), which uses near optimal minimal spanning tree for balancing the power consumptions over all nodes. Our key idea is that a near optimal data aggregation can be achieved in terms of network lifetime when power consumption at each node can be nicety balanced. Simulation results show that the BATR can lengthen system lifetime as compared with the conventional data aggregation protocols.	analytical engine;data aggregation;file spanning;minimum spanning tree;routing;self-balancing binary search tree;sensor web;simulation	Hyunsook Kim;Ki Jun Han	2005	First International Conference on Distributed Frameworks for Multimedia Applications	10.1109/DFMA.2005.8	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	9.297933324992357	79.77841607262529	36101

Hong Ph.D., Purdue University, December 2013. Resource-Aware Distributed Particle Filtering for Cluster-Based Object Tracking in Wireless Camera Networks. Major Professors: Johnny Park and Hong Z. Tan. The proliferation of miniaturized low-power computing devices, advances in wireless communications, and the availability of inexpensive imaging sensors have enabled the development of wireless camera networks (WCN). In this dissertation, we consider the problem of real-time object tracking with a WCN. Existing object tracking methods designed for multi-camera systems do not take into account the unique constraints of WCNs. Specifically, an effective object tracking system for WCNs must anticipate unreliable network communication, limited memory, and limited computational power in each camera node. In particular, unreliable communication degrades the quality of the visual information shared by the cameras, which ultimately degrades the tracking performance in the network. We present a novel resource-aware framework for the implementation of distributed particle filters in resource-constrained WCNs. Our method focuses on the effects of communication failures on object tracking performance by adjusting the amount of data packets generated and transmitted by the cameras according to the network conditions. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using three different mechanisms to share the particle information among nodes: synchronized particles, Gaussian mixture models, and Parzen windows. We show that all three approaches benefit from the proposed resource-aware mechanism in terms of tracking accuracy or energy efficiency.	kernel density estimation;low-power broadcasting;microsoft windows;mixture model;network packet;os-tan;particle filter;real-time clock;sensor;tracking system	Kihyun Hong;Henry Medeiros;Paul J.

However, how to get better performance to support data acquisition of pervasive applications over WSNs remains to be a nontrivial and challenging task. The network lifetime and application requirement are two fundamental, yet conflicting, design objectives in wireless sensor networks for tracking mobile objects. The application requirement is often correlated to the delay time within which the application can send its sensing data back to the users in tracking networks. In this paper we study the network lifetime maximization problem and the delay time minimization problem together. To make both problems tractable, we have the assumption that each sensor node keeps working since it turns on. And we formulate the network lifetime maximization problem as maximizing the number of sensor nodes who don’t turn on, and the delay time minimization problem as minimizing the routing path length, after achieving the required tracking tasks. Since we prove the problems are NP-complete and APX-complete, we propose three heuristic algorithms to solve them. And we present several experiments to show the advantages and disadvantages referring to the network lifetime and the delay time among these three algorithms on three models, random graphs, grids and hypercubes. Furthermore, we implement the distributed version of these algorithms.	apx;algorithm;cobham's thesis;data acquisition;entropy maximization;experiment;grid computing;grid network;heuristic;np-completeness;new source performance standard;pervasive informatics;random graph;requirement;routing;sensor node;stationary process;ubiquitous computing	Li Liu;Bin Hu;Lian Li	2009	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-009-0108-9	heuristic;random graph;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;data acquisition;mobile wireless sensor network;ubiquitous computing;network delay;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	12.456456226485995	78.60936632960696	36126

They are characterized by complex communication patterns that require area expensive interconnect and memory management. Channel decoders based on Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have been proposed in the literature, showing unmatched degrees of flexibility, but yielding high area occupation and power consumption. While general and applicationspecific power reduction techniques are available to save energy, the gap with respect to dedicated decoders is still large. This paper proposes techniques that reduce and optimize the traffic on the network for NoC-based channel decoders, and can be applied to any NoC architecture.

The RSSI-based positioning is roughly classified into two types: user navigation and monitoring. Our target is the user monitoring scenario by using commercially available BLE dongles, which are compact, inexpensive, and low power consumptions. In this case, the user device sends beacon signals to a large number of receivers in the room. Due to the insufficient BLE transceiver for the accurate positioning, sophisticated support vector machine (SVM)-aided machine learning algorithm plays a vital role in dealing with impairments induced by BLE. Furthermore, according to contiguous movements of the object, prior information of the positioning can be yielded for improving the object tracking capability. Finally, Kalman filter is applied to smooth the tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.		Hiroyuki A.

However, there are several challenges in such a design: first, it is difficult to characterize the energy consumption of a MIMO-based link; second, without a careful design, the broadcasted RREP packets, which are used in most energy-efficient routing protocols, could flood over the networks, and the destination node cannot decide when to reply the communication request; third, due to node mobility and persistent channel degradation, the selected route paths would break down frequently and hence the protocol overhead is increased further. To address these issues, in this paper, a novel Greedy Energy-Efficient Routing (GEER) protocol is proposed: (a) a generalized energy consumption model for the MIMO-based link, considering the trade-off between multiplexing and diversity gains, is derived to minimize link energy consumption and obtain the optimal transmit model; (b) a simple greedy route discovery algorithm and a novel adaptive reply strategy are adopted to speed up path setup with a reduced establishment overhead; (c) a lightweight route maintenance mechanism is introduced to adaptively rebuild the broken links. Extensive simulation results show that, in comparison with the conventional solutions, the proposed GEER protocol can significantly reduce the energy consumption by up to 68.74%.	hoc (programming language);mimo;multiplexing;routing	Hu Shen;Shaohe Lv;Xiaodong Wang;Xingming Zhou	2015	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2015.02.012	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;efficient energy use;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	4.013564682639803	83.5897662686857	36173

In the Internet setting the utility function to be maximized is usually assumed to be a sum of individual utilities of end-to-end flows. For WSNs the situation is highly different. Usually a sensor network is deployed to monitor the evolution of a particular phenomenon over time in some region of interest. The key performance metric of the network becomes then how accurately the network measures this evolution compared to the requirements of the application. This makes utility-based reasoning on network performance much more complex for WSNs compared to the traditional Internet model, since the utility will depend in a complex manner on phenomena under study, the topology of the network, as well as on the algorithms used for state estimation from the individual measurements.We focus here on spatial and temporal monitoring problems, give an overview of the various estimation approaches that are applicable for data processing in the corresponding WSN deployments, and give examples on how utility-based optimization and be used to enhance the lifetime and performance of WSNs. We also discuss the related architectural issues, in particular how utility functions for WSNs could be expressed in a form suitable for automated processing.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;internet protocol suite;machine to machine;mathematical optimization;network performance;region of interest;requirement;utility	Petri Mähönen;Janne Riihijärvi	2012	2012 Conference Record of the Forty Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2012.6489074	computer science;data mining;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network;visual sensor network	Metrics	7.84075107727813	75.73753887807545	36180

The rationale is that intermittent connectivity directly affects the ability of routers to synchronize on their view of the network, thus making it difficult to converge on efficient distribution trees, while network wide broadcast may be prohibitively expensive for relatively sparse groups. We describe a hybrid approach, called Elastic Multicast, which dynamically expands to limited scope broadcast when needed, and converges single path forwarding if the network is stable, through independent routing decisions made at each node.	converge;design rationale;multicast;overhead (computing);proxy mobile ipv6;router (computing);routing;sparse matrix	Claudiu Danilov;Thomas R.

By incorporating dynamically self-reconfigured bidirectional communication channels between adjacent routers, BiNoC architecture promises more flexibility for various traffic flow patterns. A novel inter-router communication protocol is proposed that prioritizes bandwidth arbitration in favor of high priority GS traffic flows. Multiple virtual channels with prioritized routing policy are also implemented to facilitate data transmission with QoS considerations. Combining these architectural innovations, the QoS aware BiNoC promises reduced latency of packet delivery and more efficient channel resource utilizations.

This paper proposes an enhancement of the regular SNOW-3G ciphering algorithm based on HC-PRNG. The proposed cipher scheme is based on hyperchaotic generator which is used as an additional layer to the SNOW-3G architecture to improve the randomness of its output keystream. The objective of this work is to achieve a high security strength of the regular SNOW-3G algorithm while maintaining its standardized properties. The originality of this new scheme is that it provides a good trade-off between good randomness properties, performance, and hardware resources. Numerical simulations, hardware digital implementation, and experimental results usingXilinx FPGAVirtex technology have demonstrated the feasibility and the efficiency of our secure solution while promising technique can be applied to secure the new generation mobile standards.Thorough analysis of statistical randomness is carried out demonstrating the improved statistical randomness properties of the new scheme compared to the standard SNOW-3G, while preserving its resistance against cryptanalytic attacks.	algorithm;compaq lte;confidentiality;cryptanalysis;field-programmable gate array;input/output;linear-feedback shift register;lorenz system;numerical linear algebra;plaintext;pseudorandom number generator;randomness;requirement;simulation;stream cipher;throughput	Mahdi Madani;Ilyas Benkhaddra;Camel Tanougast;Salim Chitroub;Loïc Siéler	2017	Security and Communication Networks	10.1155/2017/5746976	cipher;randomness;architecture;computer security;theoretical computer science;computer science;keystream;virtex;pseudorandom number generator;statistical randomness;stream cipher	Security	13.358210598483854	66.33021279163256	36600

WSNs provide an adequate infrastructure for the last-link communication with smart objects. Nevertheless, the wireless communication medium being inherently unreliable, there is the need to increase its communication reliability. Techniques based on the use of cooperative communication concepts are one of the ways to achieve this target. Within cooperative communication techniques, nodes selected as relays transmit not only their own data, but also cooperate by retransmitting data from other nodes. A fundamental step to improve the communication reliability of WSNs is related to the use of efficient relay selection techniques. This paper proposes a relay selection technique based on multiple criteria to select the smallest number of relay nodes and, at the same time, to ensure an adequate operation of the network. Additionally, two relay updating schemes are also investigated, defining periodic and adaptive updating policies. The simulation results show that both proposed schemes, named Periodic Relay Selection and Adaptive Relay Selection, significantly improve the communication reliability of the network, when compared to other state-of-the-art relay selection schemes.	as-interface;conflict (psychology);genetic selection;internet of things;mathematical optimization;name;neuronal calcium-sensor proteins;optimization problem;physical object;policy;procedural reasoning system;programming paradigm;relay device component;retransmission (data networks);revision procedure;slurp1 gene;simulation;smallest;smart objects;message;sensor (device)	Suelen Laurindo;Ricardo Moraes;Ríad Nassiffe;Carlos Montez;Francisco Vasques	2018		10.3390/s18103263		Mobile	13.38987324356873	81.84815059525494	36677

Despite those impressive improvements the cost of communication processing is still high. Traditional layered structured network protocols fail to achieve high throughputs because they access data several times. Network protocols which avoid routing through the kernel can remove this limit on communication performance and support very high transmission speeds which are comparable to the proprietary interconnection found in Massively Parallel Processors.	active message;bip-8;communications protocol;interconnection;internet protocol suite;kernel (operating system);microprocessor;overhead (computing);pipeline (computing);programming model;protocol stack;routing;solaris cluster;workstation	Panagiotis Melas;Ed Zaluska	1998		10.1007/BFb0057903	high-throughput screening;embedded system;communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer performance;information system;computer network	Arch	-2.576164651864941	68.54182029925391	36730

Numerous error correction codes (ECCs) have been developed to detect and correct these multiple erroneous bits within a codeword, such as bose-chaudhuri-hocquenghem (BCH) and reed-solomon (RS) codes. However, most of these existing techniques do not take into account the uneven distribution of bit errors over flash pages, thus they cannot meet varying correction needs of the flash memories during its lifetime. Specifically, weak ECCs are eventually unable to correct some particular pages' bit errors beyond their correction capabilities, while powerful ECCs can protect each page longer yet incur unnecessary computation overhead too early. In this paper, an elastic error correction code (EECC) technique is proposed, which can progressively enhance the error correction capability for each page when performing program operation. In particular, based on a scalable coding mapping model, EECC technique can enhance the ECC level progressively, by allowing each page to employ changeable ECC parity in its own spare out-of-band area according to its own remaining lifetime as well as the hot level of the data in it. In this way, this technique not only meets the changing error correction demands for different page, but also obtains a good reliability-performance tradeoff. Analytically and experimentally, the results demonstrate EECC scheme is efficient in many aspects of performance, and particularly is able to make significant power consumption savings without degrading the error correction capability 1.	bch code;code word;computation;ecc memory;error detection and correction;experiment;flash memory;forward error correction;multi-level cell;out-of-band agreement;overhead (computing);reed–solomon error correction;scalability	Yupeng Hu;Nong Xiao;Xiao-Fan Liu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2013.6490234	parallel computing;constant-weight code;computer hardware;computer science;theoretical computer science;forward error correction;bch code;reed–solomon error correction	Arch	7.618073222420232	61.75834444209025	36767

In this paper we consider the problem of optimising link scheduling for wireless mesh networks, making a number of contributions. Adopting a protocol-based model, we introduce an integer programming approach for an optimised schedule using a time-slot model. This model compares favourably against previously published methods and we introduce a rapid heuristic approximation that can present near-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time. We show that taking into consideration the affect of varying data rates across individual links during different time slots can further enhance the throughput achieved. This decreases the local data rate on some links but concurrently reduces the interference range of the transmitted signal which increases spatial reuse across the network. We present efficient heuristics to rapidly find near-optimal solutions to an integer programming model of this problem and provide rigorous justification on benchmark problems.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);catastrophic interference;data rate units;flow network;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;interference (communication);mesh networking;programming model;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);throughput;uncompressed video;while;wireless mesh network	Stuart M.

The field coverage of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be enhanced and consequently network lifetime can be prolonged by optimizing the sensor deployment with a finite number of mobile sensors. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy for WSN self-deployment in which three sensor relocation algorithms are proposed to match the mobility degree of sensor nodes, particle swarm optimization based algorithm (PSOA), relay shift based algorithm (RSBA) and energy efficient fuzzy optimization algorithm (EFOA). PSOA regards the sensors in the network as a swarm, and reorganizes the sensors by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, in the full sensor mobility case. RSBA and EFOA assume relatively limited sensor mobility, i.e., the movement distance is bounded by a threshold, to further reduce energy consumption. In the zero mobility case, static topology control or scheduling schemes can be used such as optimal cluster formation. Simulation results show that our approaches greatly improve the network coverage as well as energy efficiency compared with related works. key words: deployment, sensor networks, mobility, coverage, energyefficiency	algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;relay;relocation (computing);scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;software deployment;topology control	Xiaoling Wu;Jinsung Cho;Brian J. d'Auriol;Sungyoung Lee	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.8.2056	simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;swarm intelligence;computer science;operating system;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;evolutionary computation	Mobile	-0.04852645958182901	75.53542508979913	36823

This dynamic behavior is either caused by external factors or initiated by the system designers themselves. To adapt to such conditions, sensor networks often adopt machine learning techniques to eliminate the need for unnecessary redesign. Machine learning also inspires many practical solutions that maximize resource utilization and prolong the lifespan of the network. In this paper, we present an extensive literature review over the period 2002-2013 of machine learning methods that were used to address common issues in WSNs. The advantages and disadvantages of each proposed algorithm are evaluated against the corresponding problem.

3adac1d481ad67ed41c248f8bbb0e5148694ddff	opportunistic spatiotemporal routing in wireless sensor networks		We propose an opportunistic spatiotemporal data dissemination protocol in order to solve the transmission failure problem in error-prone WSNs. Retransmission is well-known for recovery of transmission failure; however, this may cause the severe time delay possibly to violate the real-time requirement. To solve the problem, our protocol exploits both broadcasting nature and temporal opportunity concept. In a radio-range of a sensor node, there may be multiple neighbor nodes to satisfy the real-time requirement. By broadcasting property, all neighbors can receive a data from a node, and only each satisfying neighbor decides its relay toward the destination by using temporal selection function. The temporal function is related to the tolerable time period to be able to satisfy the real-time requirement. By giving the priority to the node with smaller tolerable time, we have more opportunities to forward toward the destination. That is, even if a node with a long tolerable time waits for the longer period of time, it still has a chance to forward with the real-time requirement. In summary, the proposed protocol attains the high reliability and real-time requirement by removing data retransmission and multiple opportunities with temporal consideration.	broadcast delay;cognitive dimensions of notations;real-time clock;real-time data;relay;retransmission (data networks);routing;sensor node;waits	Seungmin Oh;Yongbin Yim;Jeongcheol Lee;Hosung Park;Sang Ha Kim	2013			wireless routing protocol;routing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	8.79152659628696	82.83627494709499	37029
a6c1601465ecbf895f265fb1980e29552c6b5a23	elastic multicast: design extensions and experimentation results		This paper describes a new implementation of the Elastic Multicast (EM) protocol including new design enhancements for improved dynamic operation. The paper also presents additional performance data collected from emulation-based mobile network experiments. EM is a low complexity extension to Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) that adds group-specific dynamic pruning of the SMF-based multicast forwarding mesh for higher rate traffic flows. It therefore reduces overhead by pruning the SMF relay sets in areas where no receivers exist. Our experimental emulation results show that, under a variety of mobility conditions and multicast group distribution patterns, EM maintains SMF-like data delivery robustness while significantly reducing overhead. We also demonstrate that a new design feature that provides preemptive ACK messages for active receiver groups leads to lower loss under mobility and sparse receiver groups. Based upon the results, we consider this feature critical to be included in any future EM design. We also present experimental results examining the performance of EM with classical flooding (CF) and connected dominating set (CDS) relay modes. We show, for the experiments examined, that CF provides some reduced loss with minimal additional overhead when used with EM. We also discuss future work and ongoing issues.	acknowledgement (data networks);connected dominating set;elastic net regularization;emulator;experiment;goodput;mesh networking;multicast;overhead (computing);relay;sparse matrix	Brian Adamson;Joseph P.

The application of traditional security schemes on sensor nodes is limited due to the restricted computation capability, low-power availability, and the inherent low data rate. In order to avoid dependencies on a compromised level of security, a WSN node with a microcontroller and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used along this work to implement a state-of-the art solution based on ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). In this paper it is described how the reconfiguration possibilities of the system can be used to adapt ECC parameters in order to increase or reduce the security level depending on the application scenario or the energy budget. Two setups have been created to compare the softwareand hardware-supported approaches. According to the results, the FPGA-based ECC implementation requires three orders of magnitude less energy, compared with a low power microcontroller implementation, even considering the power consumption overhead introduced by the hardware reconfiguration.	accessibility;cipher;computation;coprocessor;data rate units;ecc memory;elliptic curve cryptography;field-programmable gate array;flash memory;low-power broadcasting;memory footprint;microcontroller;overhead (computing);reconfigurability;shattered world	Jorge Portilla;Andrés Otero;Eduardo de la Torre;Teresa Riesgo;Oliver Stecklina;Steffen Peter;Peter Langendörfer	2010	IJDSN	10.1155/2010/740823	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security	Mobile	9.249176296020199	66.4223828284013	37336

The algorithm starts by transforming the network graph into an expanded graph that captures the wireless broadcast advantage (WBA) while simplifying point-to-multi-point transmissions in the original graph into point-to-point transmissions in the auxiliary expanded graph. Using an appropriate function to calculate the weights of the expanded graph links we also capture the wireless unreliable transmission (WUT) characteristics of the wireless medium. By solving the minimum Steiner tree problem on the expanded graph we obtain the optimal solution of the initial problem. Since the optimal algorithm is of non-polynomial complexity, we proceed to propose a heuristic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristics have performance close to that of the optimal algorithm, at least for the instances for which we were able to track optimal solutions, while outperforming other heuristic multicast algorithms.	algorithm;graph rewriting;heuristic (computer science);knowledge society;multicast;point-to-point protocol;polynomial;simulation;steiner tree problem;time complexity;transmission (bittorrent client);weight function;why–because analysis;wireless router	Christos A.

8da8af92f3c0e639eff364f98ec43caa750da59d	capacity of cellular wireless network		In cellular networks, under ARQ and SINR model of transmission, the effective downlink rate of packet transmission is the reciprocal of the expected delay (number of retransmissions needed till success). We define the cellular network capacity as the ratio of the basestation (BS) density and the expected delay. Exact characterization of this natural and practical but non-trivial (because of SINR temporal correlations) capacity metric is derived. The capacity is shown to first increase polynomially with the BS density and then scale inverse exponentially with the increasing BS density. Two distinct upper bounds are derived that are relevant for the low and the high BS density regimes. A single power control strategy is shown to achieve the upper bounds in both the regimes upto constants. Our result is fundamentally different than the transport and transmission capacity for ad hoc networks that scale as the square root of the (high) BS density. Our results show that the strong temporal correlations of SINRs with PPP distributed BS locations model for cellular networks is limiting, and the realizable capacity is much smaller than previously thought.	control theory;hoc (programming language);network packet;point-to-point protocol;polynomial;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Rahul Vaze;Srikanth K.

Another objective of the proposed routing strategy is the selection of stable paths in order  to achieve robust network operation; to accomplish this scope a new routing metric is presented combining the residual energy  level of nodes with an estimation of the stability of links.

10b048e48ef034638b174ac62dffc7d0e3fd03f4	directional communication with movement prediction in mobile wireless sensor networks	mobile wireless sensor networks;mobility knowledge;directional communication;movement prediction	By introducing mobility to some or all the nodes in a wireless sensor network (WSN), WSN can enhance its capability and flexibility to support multiple missions. In mobile wireless sensor networks, mobile nodes collect data and send data to a sink station. When the sink station employs directional antennas to send and receive data, its communication capability can increase. Using directional antennas implies the transmitters must know the direction or location of the receiver. It is necessary to predict a mobile receiver’s movement to keep the transmitter’s antenna pointing to the right direction. A mobility prediction algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is based on the knowledge extracted from real vehicles traces. The validation experiments indicate that the prediction accuracy rate of the algorithm is 96.5 % and the communication using directional antenna with movement prediction saves about 92.6 % energy consumption with a suitable beam-width and shakehand interval.	algorithm;experiment;mobile phone;tracing (software);transmitter	Xiaofeng Lu;Zhaowei Qu;Pietro Liò;Pan Hui;Qi Li;Peng Lu;Rongfang Bie	2014	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-014-0793-0	telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	16.851782358869414	76.3169578044201	37542

It could be as small as the desk area in a laboratory, medium on a campus or within a building, or as large as the wide area in the Internet. Traditionally, one would construct the testbed in a laboratory so that all the environmental parameters could be programmed and controlled, and the results could be reproduced. However, since some of the environmental parameters are too complicated to program and control, often we need to use the real environment as the testbed. This extends the testbed from a laboratory to a building, a campus, or even the Internet. As the parameters in the real environment are often not programmable and controllable, we thus lose the exact reproducibility of results. One common way to solve this problem is to repeat the experiments for a prolonged period and average over the huge number of repetitive runs. Then the testing period is usually weeks to months instead of hours. Another less common way is to capture the environmental parameters as traces and replay them onto a laboratory testbed. Precise reproducibility can be achieved, but the environment parameters in the captured traces can only be “replayed” instead of programmed and controlled. The results from such tracedriven testing are useful if the environments and captured traces are representative enough.

Simulation provides researchers with a number of significant benefits, including repeatable scenarios, isolation of parameters, and exploration of a variety of metrics. The topology and movement of the nodes in the simulation are key factors in the performance of the network protocol under study. Once the nodes have been initially distributed, the mobility model dictates the movement of the nodes within the network. Because the mobility of the nodes directly impacts the performance of the protocols, simulation results obtained with unrealistic movement models may not correctly reflect the true performance of the protocols. The majority of existing mobility models for ad hoc networks do not provide realistic movement scenarios; they are limited to random walk models without any obstacles. In this paper, we propose to create more realistic movement models through the incorporation of obstacles. These obstacles are utilized to both restrict node movement as well as wireless transmissions. In addition to the inclusion of obstacles, we construct movement paths using the Voronoi diagram of obstacle vertices. Nodes can then be randomly distributed across the paths, and can use shortest path route computations to destinations at randomly chosen obstacles.

99ba9b44708857260ce600d72d5556179f69e269	performance analysis of wave communication for emergency broadcasting in metro environments		Recently, subway trains running underground have become an issue of passengers inconvenience and safety due to the failure of announcements in emergencies such as breakdown, train accidents and power outage in tunnels. Thus, there is a need to develop an emergency broadcasting system that can provide announcements to all passenger cars in any emergency on the railway route. WAVE communication technology based on IEEE 802.11p standard using 5.9GHz dedicated frequency band enables direct communication between terminals more than 200m without additional relay infrastructure. Especially, it is considered to be a suitable communication technology for the emergency broadcasting system of the urban subway, showing robust communication performance even in the tunnel areal [1]. In this paper, the applicability of various wireless communication technologies for the emergency broadcasting system through the measurement campaign was examined in Seoul metropolitan subway. The WAVE is a communication technology that can use 5.9GHz dedicated frequency band without charge and it is possible to communicate between terminals without the help of additional relay infrastructure. Especially, it confirms robust communication performance in a tunnel which is an operating environment of urban subway, and therefore, it is considered to be suitable as a communication method of a radio-connected emergency broadcasting system for an urban subway. It is also expected that it will be possible to develop the emergency broadcasting system capable of safe evacuation and emergency guidance to passengers using urban subway in any emergencies.

Many design-for-trust (DFT) techniques have been proposed to address such threats. However, many HT detection techniques are not effective due to the dependence on golden chips, limitation of useful information available and process variations. In this paper, we data-mine on path delay information and propose a variation-tolerant path delay order encoding technique to detect HTs.	data mining;hardware trojan;outsourcing;trojan horse (computing)	Xiaotong Cui;Kaijie Wu;Ramesh Karri	2018	2018 IEEE 23rd European Test Symposium (ETS)	10.1109/ETS.2018.8400708	real-time computing;hardware trojan;encoding (memory);process variation;logic gate;outsourcing;computer science	EDA	12.053490716053846	62.635009018948416	37797

Such a process is a majo task to develop an efficient network layer, since it allows routing protocols to efficiently use neighbors as relays for multi-hop communications. In the last years, a number of link-quality aware routing metrics have been proposed and analyzed. However, such metrics usually adopt simple link-quality estimators based on moving average filters, which lead to poor performances due to their static nature. In this paper, we propose to improve the estimation of the link quality resorting to a bio-inspired estimator based on the neural network paradigm. The effectiveness of the proposal has been proved by means of a numerical performance com-parison between the proposed estimator and the traditional ones under several environmental conditions.	artificial neural network;british informatics olympiad;hoc (programming language);mesh networking;numerical analysis;performance;programming paradigm;relay;routing;wireless mesh network	Marcello Caleffi;Luigi Paura	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks & Workshops	10.1109/WOWMOM.2009.5282423	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;artificial neural network;computer network	Mobile	0.7618409109178564	85.58673255952476	37875

It is assumed that multiple transmission modes that allow a tradeoff between the energy consumption and packet error probability are available to the sensor nodes. Taking into account the energy harvesting capabilities of the nodes, decision policies are developed to determine the transmission mode to use at a given instant of time in order to maximize the quality of coverage. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the performance of the transmission policy thus derived is compared with that of energy balancing as well as aggressive policies. An upper bound on the performance of arbitrary policies, and lower bounds specific to energy balancing and aggressive policies are derived.	bit error rate;markov chain;markov decision process;network packet	Alireza Seyedi;Biplab Sikdar	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558613	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;efficient energy use;statistics	Embedded	15.02994685723926	82.28386755099429	38072

The system captures relevant parameters in link establishment process, from which the location-related information can be parsed. The system is divided into the main pointing device and the auxiliary positioning device. The main positioning device is responsible for screening the identity of the target and obtaining the relevant parameters to determine the general direction of the target while the auxiliary positioning device is responsible for approximation precise positioning.

Efficient scheduling becomes indispensable if multiple channels and time slots are utilized. Optimum scheduling of multiple channels and time slots in multihop networks is an NP-complete problem. We apply metaheuristic approaches to solve the scheduling problem because of the fact that not only the global solution but near-optimal solutions can satisfy a given end-to-end delay bound. We adopt simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to schedule the resources. Different measures and stopping conditions are explored to validate the feasibility of scheduling via SA and PSO, and to compare the performance of the two metaheuristics in satisfying the desired end-to-end delay. Although the purpose of this article is to compare SA and PSO, the simulation results demonstrate that PSO-based scheduling outperforms SA-based scheduling in terms of end-to-end delay.	end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;np-completeness;particle swarm optimization;scheduling (computing);simulated annealing;simulation;throughput	Yang Gyun Kim;Myung J.

In this paper, we address the design of an overlay mesh which achieves low source-to-peer delay, accommodates asymmetric and diverse uplink bandwidth, and continuously improves delay based on an existing pool of peers. By considering a streaming mesh as an aggregation of data flows along multiple spanning trees, the peer delay in the mesh is then its longest delay (including both propagation and scheduling delay) among all the trees. Clearly, such delay can be very high if the mesh is not designed well. In this paper, we propose and study a mesh protocol called Fast-Mesh, which optimizes such delay while meeting a certain streaming bandwidth requirement. Fast-Mesh is particularly suitable for a mildly dynamic network consisting of proxies, supernodes, or content distribution servers. We first formulate the minimum delay multiple trees (MDMT) problem and show that it is NP-hard. Then we propose a centralized heuristic based on complete knowledge, which may be used when the network is small or managed, and serves as an optimal benchmark for all the other schemes under comparison. We then propose a simple distributed algorithm, Fast-Mesh, where peers select their parents based on the concept of power in networks given by the ratio of throughput and delay. By maximizing the network power, our algorithm achieves low delay. The algorithm makes continuous improvement on delay until some minimum delay is reached. Simulation and PlanetLab experiments show that our distributed algorithm performs very well in terms of delay and source workload, and substantially outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;digital distribution;distributed algorithm;experiment;fast fourier transform;file spanning;heuristic;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;np-hardness;peer-to-peer;planetlab;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;software propagation;spanning tree protocol;streaming algorithm;streaming media;telecommunications link;throughput	Dongni Ren;Yui Tung Hillman Li;Shueng-Han Gary Chan	2009	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2009.2032677	switched mesh;electrical network;data flow diagram;communications protocol;propagation delay;mesh generation;distributed algorithm;transmission time;throughput;real-time computing;spanning tree;telecommunications;content management;computer science;processing delay;elmore delay;operating system;shared mesh;end-to-end delay;peer-to-peer;np-hard;distributed computing;overlay;transmission delay;computational complexity theory;scheduling;round-trip delay time;transport layer;network delay;bandwidth;asymmetry;server;computer network;data transmission;bandwidth allocation	HPC	-4.179568379234289	77.257184714904	38225

A challenging issue in these networks is the communication, mainly due to the impairments of the acoustic transmission. Thus, efficient mechanisms to improve the data delivery must be proposed. In this work we present a novel anycast greedy geographic forwarding protocol and two topology control mechanisms. The proposed geo-routing protocol considers the anycast network architecture in the data forwarding process. The proposed centralized topology control (CTC) and distributed topology control (DTC) mechanisms organize the network via depth adjustment of some nodes. The simulation results show that with these mechanisms, the data packet delivery ratio achieves more than 90% even in hard and difficult scenarios of very sparse or very dense networks, the end-to-end delay and energy consumption per delivered packet is reduced.	acoustic cryptanalysis;anycast;centralized computing;control system;end-to-end principle;geographic routing;greedy algorithm;network architecture;network packet;network topology;operand forwarding;simulation;sparse matrix;topology control	Rodolfo W.

Wireless Body Area Sensor networks consist of fixed sensor nodes. Sometimes, creating such a fixed sensor networks could be a daunting task. Wireless Body Area Sensor nodes assume deploying a stationary sensor network over a human body area. Even if an advanced method to make the deployment safer is used, diverse element will cause a coverage holes. Even though perfect coverage can be achieved initially, various factors such as body movements will certainly degrade network coverage as time goes on. However, mobile wireless body area sensor networks can solve some of the problems. Some node of mobile wireless body area sensor network has mobility. Mobility reinforces fault-tolerance and the scalability of the network. But conventional sensor routing protocols find it hard to deal with the mobile wireless body area sensor networks. Therefore, this study suggests an energy efficient routing scheme by using the location information of a global positioning system (GPS) and the energy levels of sensor nodes.	energy level;fault tolerance;global positioning system;mobile phone;routing;scalability;sensor;software deployment;stationary process	Ki Hyun Kim;Ick-Soo Lee;Mahnsuk Yoon;Junhyung Kim;Honggil Lee;Ki Jun Han	2009	2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications	10.1109/NetCoM.2009.36	fault tolerance;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;body area network;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;routing protocol;wi-fi array;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	6.930072167287049	79.4010973954657	38284

It is, however, susceptible to environmental unknowns from both temporal and spatial domains. As a result, the fluctuation of RSS may degrade performance of RSS based applications. In this work, we propose a novel RSS processing method at the receiver for three antenna based systems. The output of our approach is `RSS-Ratio', which eliminates the environmental unknowns and thus is a more stable variable compared to RSS itself. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments in a range of wireless scenarios, including indoor laptop based measurement, indoor software defined radio - WARP based measurement, and outdoor wireless measurement. In addition, we also give an analysis to the relationship between the location of transmitter and the value of RSS-Ratio, and examine the accuracy of the estimated RSS-Ratio value via both simulations and experiments. All the experimental, analytical, and simulated results demonstrate that RSS-Ratio will be a better replacement for RSS to improve the performance of RSS based applications.	dbm;experiment;interference (communication);laptop;quantum fluctuation;rss;simulation;transmitter	Wei Cheng;Kefeng Tan;Victor Omwando;Jindan Zhu;Prasant Mohapatra	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567120	embedded system;decision support system;telecommunications;computer science;software-defined radio	Mobile	20.864687701529597	75.70497274852418	38296

One is an efficient bandwidth usage which requires minimum delay between transfers of packets. Establishing permanent routes from the source to destination addresses this challenge since the received packet can be immediately transmitted to the next node. However, any disruption on the established path either causes packet loss, lowering the delivery rate, or invokes a costly process of creating an alternative path. The second challenge is the ability to tolerate permanent and transient failures of nodes and links, especially since such failures are frequent in sensor networks. Protocols that chose the forwarding node at each hop of a packet are resilient to such failures, but incur the delay caused by selection of the forwarding node at each hop of the multi-hop path. This paper presents a novel wireless sensor routing protocol, Self-Selecting Reliable Paths (SRP) for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) routing, that addresses both challenges at once. This protocol evolved from the Self-Selecting Routing (SSR) protocol which is essentially memory-less. In the first generation of SSR protocol each packet selects the forwarding node at each hop on its path from the source to destination. The protocol takes advantage of broadcast communication commonly used in WSNs as a communication primitive. It also uses a prioritized transmission back-off delay to uniquely identify the neighbor of the forwarder that will forward the packet. As a result, the protocol is resistant to node or link failures as long as an alternative path exists from the current forwarder to the destination. The second generation of SSR protocols, called Self-Healing Routing (SHR) added the route repair procedure, invoked when no neighbor of the forwarder closer to the destination is alive. In a series of transmissions, a packet trapped at the current forwarder by failures of its neighbors is capable of backing off towards the source to find an alternative route, if such exists, to the destination. The main contribution of this paper is the third generation of SSR protocols, termed Self-Selecting Reliable Path, SRP. It preserves SHR’s dynamic path selection in face of failure. Yet it also enables packets to follow established paths without selection delay if failures do not occur. The important change in the protocol is to make it memorize the successfully traversed path and attempt to reuse it for subsequent packets flowing to the same destination. The interesting behavior of SRP arising from this property is that if a path from the source to destination exists on which no transient failures occur, SRP would converge its routing to such a reliable path. In the paper, we describe novel elements of the SRP protocol that resulted in the desired properties. Using simulation, we compare SRP protocol with the representatives of the two other approaches: AODV as the routebased protocol, and GRAB and SHR as the hop-selection protocols.	algorithm;converge;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;fault tolerance;internet protocol suite;network packet;node (computer science);routing;shr;seamless3d;sensor web;simulation;topology control	Thomas A.

Strategies have been proposed to tolerate faulty wires by replacing them with spare ones or by partially using the defective links. However, these strategies either suffer from high area and power overheads, or significantly increase the average network latency. In this paper, we propose a novel flit serialization method, which divides the links and flits into several sections, and serializes flit sections of adjacent flits to transmit them on all available fault-free link sections to avoid the complete waste of defective links bandwidth. Experimental results indicate that our method reduces the latency overhead significantly and enables graceful performance degradation, when compared with related partially faulty link usage proposals, and saves area and power overheads by up to 29% and 43.1%, respectively, when compared with spare wire replacement methods.	elegant degradation;experiment;fault tolerance;hyperlink;image scaling;network on a chip;overhead (computing);routing;serialization;transistor;transmitter	Changlin Chen;Ye Lu;Sorin Dan Cotofana	2012	2012 IEEE/ACM Sixth International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip	10.1109/NOCS.2012.22	embedded system;real-time computing;fault tree analysis;computer science;network on a chip;computer network	EDA	5.975942143350286	60.68691937037561	38336

Logistic regression models are developed to capture the dynamic relationship among implementation factors affecting the performance of an RFID system. Distance and angle between tag and antenna, orientation and position of tag on the container are found to be important factors among other implementation factors. A test bed is used to represent the flow of tagged products on a rolling conveyor passing by an antenna. It is shown that controlled and designed experimentation about RFID yields valuable data that, subject to appropriate statistical models, may result in a better practical understanding of the technology. In addition to the performance assessment and evaluation for RFID systems with respect to various factors, this study also aims to establish a reliable literature base for the development of this technology in the future.	logistic regression;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;statistical model;testbed	Nebil Buyurgan;Mustafa A.

585ae4f4700325b84969d6f96d177fada906bd50	an adaptive channel utilization method with traffic balancing for multi-hop multi-channel wireless backbone network		This chapter presents an effective channel utilization method for a multi-hop wireless backbone network (WBN) constructed with multiple channels. In the previous work, we proposed a novel OpenFlow based management framework for the WBN, which enables access points to handle the unlimited number of channels simultaneously. Since the framework also enables us to easily and programmably use channels for packet forwarding, the utilization of multiple channels can be potentially optimized, thereby maximizing the network capacity of the WBN. However, since the previous work focused on the framework, the effective use of multiple channels was not completely addressed. Therefore, in this chapter, we propose a channel utilization method that balances the amount of traffic among multiple channels to maximize the network capacity. Through the performance evaluation in a real testbed, the proposed method can effectively use all channels in a 3-hop WBN.	internet backbone;throughput	Yuzo Taenaka;Kazuya Tsukamoto	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-19743-2_34	telecommunications;backbone network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-2.2932846161540197	85.4189650937794	38375
0b5798f5ba9abc47b986760f9027805b91ee92b4	development of multi-hop field sensor networks with arduino board		Wireless sensor networks have been focused to enhance agricultural pro- duction because environmental information is useful to estimate growing conditions of plants, diseases of plants etc. A density of sensors is also an important factor to obtain an accurate estimation. Therefore, a lot of sensors are required in a practical field sensing. In conventional systems, the number of sensors is limited due to a cost of an installation and management. Additionally, their devices typically use a single- hop communication. Hence, it is difficult to cover a larger area due to the limit of a communication distance. This paper proposes a wireless sensor network for agricul- tural usages. The proposed protocols for the wireless sensor network can work with a limited memory resource and CPU performance. Therefore, a developed system can employ Arduino micro-computer boards that have a limited hardware resource. Since a price of Arduino boards is usually inexpensive, it is easy to deploy a lot of sensors in a field to improve an accuracy of estimation. Additionally, our network supports multi-hop communication to extend a sensing area. It also supports a sleep operation at all nodes to mitigate consumed power even if typical multi-hop rout- ing protocols do not support a sleep operation at relay nodes. Experimental results show that the developed sensor network can construct a multi-hop network by the proposed protocols, and work well on a resource constrained hardware.	arduino	Tomoya Ogawa;Katsuhiro Naito	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39345-2_21	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;visual sensor network	Mobile	8.70095881318596	73.79553746894855	38404

In this paper, the performance of radio frequency (RF) to DC energy converters using transparent and flexible rectennas based on graphene in an ambient RF energy-harvesting scenario is evaluated. Full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations of a dipole antenna assuming the reported state-of-the-art sheet resistance for few-layer, transparent graphene yields an estimated ohmic efficiency of 5%. In the power budget calculation, the low efficiency of transparent graphene antennas is an issue because of the relatively low amount of available ambient RF energy in the frequency bands of interest, which together sets an upper limit on the harvested energy available for the RF-powered device. Using a commercial diode rectifier and an off-the-shelf wireless system for sensor communication, the graphene-based solution provides only a limited battery lifetime extension. However, for ultra-low-power technologies currently at the research stage, more advantageous ambient energy levels, or other use cases with infrequent data transmission, graphene-based solutions may be more feasible.

31853c3eeb824b01c90764c9e8cf1d70d7a77640	a near optimal algorithm for lifetime optimization in wireless sensor networks		A problem that has received a lot of interest in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is lifetime optimization. Indeed, in WSN each sensor node is battery powered and it is not convenient to recharge or replace the batteries in many cases, especially in remote and hostile environments. In this paper, we introduce an efficient energy-aware algorithm to enhance the lifetime of WSN by i) organizing/clustering the sensor nodes into disjoint cover sets where each cover set is capable of monitoring all the targets of the region of interest and ii) scheduling these cover sets successively/periodically. This study differs from previous works for the following reasons: i) it achieves near optimal solutions compared to the optimal ones obtained by the exact method and ii) unlike existing algorithms that construct gradually cover sets one after the other, our algorithm builds the different sets in parallel. Indeed, at each step of the clustering process, the algorithm attempts to add to each cover set a sensor capable of monitoring the most critical target (a critical target is defined to be the one covered by the smallest set of sensors). The choice of a sensor to be placed/clustered in each cover set is based on solving a linear assignment problem. The proposed algorithm provides a lower bound Kmin of the optimal number of disjoint cover sets Kopt . Intuitively, the upper bound Kmax of the optimal value is given by the size of the smallest set of sensors covering a target. We deduce Kopt by performing a binary search procedure. At each step of the binary search process, we check if there exists a partition of the sensors in K cover sets by solving an integer programming problem. Simulation results show the efficiency of our algorithm.	centralized computing;cluster analysis;computation;integer programming;iteration;mathematical optimization;maximal set;optimization problem;organizing (structure);rechargeable battery;region of interest;scheduling (computing);sensor node;simulation;time complexity	Karine Deschinkel;Mourad Hakem	2013			key distribution in wireless sensor networks	EDA	11.667455303489925	78.97104046790311	38551
035b8fa5575e0ebc2d1ce60a32484201b8e9086c	an improved gpsr algorithm based on energy gradient and apit grid		We investigate GPSR algorithms of WSN and propose an improved routing algorithm based on energy gradient and APIT grid to solve the problem of high and unbalanced energy consumption of GPSR. In GPSR, network uses greedy algorithm and righthand rule to establish routing paths, and the path keeps running till some nodes within the path are invalid because energy is exhausted, which would lead to the high energy consumption of some nodes in the path and the low energy consumption of others nearby the nodes not in the path as well as bringing high and unbalanced energy consumption of the network. Regarding these problems, we use APIT localization algorithm and APIT grid to query and establish routing paths and establish the corresponding energy gradient when messages are transmitted along the routing paths. When some nodes are approaching the threshold status, we use right-hand rule and recursion greedy algorithm in advance to plan a new routing path towards the target area. When query messages arrive at the event area, the network uses a different method to transmit data according to the density of sensor nodes. Simulation experiments show that the improved routing algorithm is capable of reducing the energy consumption of network and extending the lifecycle of network.

This observation is confirmed on six distinct experimental data sets. It is at odds with the exponential decay implied by most mobility models. In this paper, we study how this new characteristic of human mobility impacts a class of previously proposed forwarding algorithms. We use a simplified model based on the renewal theory to study how the parameters of the distribution impact the delay performance of these algorithms.

Multicast benefits data center group communication in both saving network traffic and improving application throughput. However, given data centers are experiencing an exponential increase in the amount of network traffic, multicast routing have to face the challenge of overload. In this paper, we present two algorithms: BLD (Based on Load and Distance multicast tree building), which is a novel multicast tree building algorithm for data center networks and RLPR (Reliable Lowest Prior Recover algorithm), which is an effective packet repair algorithm. The key idea of BLD is to build a multicast tree based on the load of server and distance between source and destination. This approach leverages the combination of ant colony algorithm and genetic algorithm to find the best solution, which effectively reduces the latency and improve the throughput. In RLPR, the packet loss rate of a node is estimated according to node's position, nodes with high packet loss rate are given priority to select their backup nodes. Finally, we verify the correctness and validity of algorithms through several simulations.	ant colony optimization algorithms;backup;cloud computing;correctness (computer science);data center;genetic algorithm;multicast;network packet;network traffic control;routing;server (computing);simulation;throughput;time complexity	Yang Qin;Yibing Ye;Weihong Yang;Xiao Ai;Qiwei Sun	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7498058	data center;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;communication in small groups;protocol independent multicast;computer science;load balancing;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	-0.954247582647394	83.51573558663546	38866

For this purpose nine RMTP-based multicast scenarios with different network conditions like loss rate, delay and bandwidth are simulated.

5a4ad101535fa68a4fd513d07f45899eac196a35	hotspot localization and prediction in wireless cellular networks via spatial traffic fitting		With the proliferation of bandwidth-demanding mobile applications in the era of 5G, the aggregation of a few users may lead to extremely high load in cellular base stations, producing traffic hotspot in wireless networks. Therefore the higher requirement is imposed on the flexibility of a 5G network, namely the capability of performing rapid capacity enhancement in hotspot area, which makes hotspot localization and critical prediction functions. In this paper, we proposed to localize hotspots with Gaussian Random Field (GRF)-based spatial traffic density model deduced from load data of base stations, together with the prediction with Holt-Winters. We measured the spatial traffic in a specific area within a short time span and forecasted the spatial traffic density distribution. Numeric results show the proposed approach can localize hotspot efficiently, and during traffic peak hours, hotspot prediction is of high success rate.	java hotspot virtual machine;mobile app;software deployment;traffic analysis	Xiang Zhang;Fanqin Zhou;Jinghua Ning;Peng Yu;Wenjing Li	2018	NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406292	data modeling;distributed computing;computer science;computer network;hotspot (wi-fi);wireless network;wireless;base station;graphical model;gaussian random field;cellular network	Mobile	19.646702606329463	84.85090510476657	38930

Such over-deployment can extend network life, improve robustness, and accommodate network dynamic. To enable large deployments, tiered and clustered network structures may be adopted for scalability and manageability. This article presents a highly scalable, distributed control method to manage the activity of sensors in each cluster so that dynamic application-specific spatial resolution requirement can be achieved with minimum energy cost and with uniform participation of sensors. The method, Look-Ahead Resolution Control (LARC), utilizes a look-ahead prediction of activities of sensors in the cluster and provides feedback to nodes as part of acknowledgments to transmissions. LARC is shown to be highly responsive to system dynamics such as changes in the resolution requested, node failures or replenishment. Existing control methods not only fall short in network life and scalability, but also do not provide such responsiveness and uniform participation to ensure a diverse representation of sensed data. LARC is extended to tradeoff between energy and delay in recovery from failures of large number of nodes, by multiplexing sleeping, listening, and transmissions probabilistically in such a way that the control overhead is minimized while the delay is bounded. The article presents the control strategy for LARC along with performance studies showing near-uniform participation and near-optimal cluster lifetime.	control theory;data rate units;distributed control system;multiplexing;network packet;overhead (computing);responsiveness;scalability;sensor;software deployment;system dynamics;throughput;univac larc	Biyu Liang;Jeffrey Frolik;Xiaoyang Sean Wang	2009	IJDSN	10.1080/15501320701863437	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;network dynamics;efficient energy use;system dynamics;computer network	Mobile	9.639179668824246	76.9240650896372	38979

These characteristics imply that it will be feasible to create dense networks of devices. We can take advantage of high-density networks to achieve high levels of reliability and provide resiliency to malicious attack while decreasing contention and improving throughput. This paper presents our findings when simulating multi-hop communication through high-density networks. We were able to significantly mitigate the effect of massive contention by dividing the motes into redundant networks communicating over separate channels. This decreased contention by reducing the number of motes sharing the channel and improved reliability by providing redundant routes to the data sink such that if one network is disrupted, other networks may continue to function. This method also provides resilience in the face of failing sensors or malicious tampering by providing multiple representations of the same data.	communications protocol;computer data storage;cyclic redundancy check;failure;mission critical;network congestion;overhead (computing);robustness (computer science);sensor;simulation;throughput	Theodore L.

The path pa ir route formed depends on the number of hops and multi-crit eria used. The cross-layer criteria observed is power consumption, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and load variance optimized using multi -criteria optimization through scalarization with varying wei ghts. With many path pair routes and complicated computing the n in finding the optimal value genetic algorithm method was used . From the simulation results, the optimal path pair routes we re obtained with varying weights; greater weight had higher prioriti es and produced optimum performance and computing time for scalariz ation function with varying weights having a very small d ifference even almost identical.

We also propose a routing algorithm that uses the created topologies in order to provide QoS in HSN. Simulation results showed that the three topologies can provide different levels of QoS that can be used in many sensor network applications. We also compare our framework to the literature topology to provide QoS in HSN and our framework presents better tradeoff between energy consumption and latency during data communication.	algorithm;archive;network topology;quality of service;routing;sensor;simulation	Daniel L.

bdc4b7d94091c9dbff2a903bdf9b024df9cd766c	a markov chain prediction model for routing in delay tolerant networks	会议论文	In Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), nodes seldom keep in contact with each other because of the disorder movements of nodes. Thus many traditional routing protocols may not be applicable in this emerging network. In recent years, many routing protocols have been proposed to improve the routing performance in DTNs, however, most of them do not fully mine the inherent regular pattern of the movements of nodes. In this paper, we propose a Markov Chain Prediction (MCP) model for routing in DTNs to mine the movements of nodes property with historical contact information and use this model to improve the delivery ratio of message transferring within the network.	markov chain;routing	Shuai Liu;Fan Li;Qian Zhang;Meng Shen	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22047-5_39	routing domain;routing;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	3.8343324659689255	84.66273511406688	39235

Illegal repeaters are installed by end users, without the consent of authorities, because they are considered to be a cheap solution to the low signal strength problem. As these devices are not controlled by the operator, they transmit using a high power, thus jamming the useful signals and degrading the link's quality. In this paper, we propose and develop a Software Defined Radio (SDR) tool for the detection and localization of illegal transmission in both 3G and 4G networks. In our approach, we implement a direction finding tool on the Universal software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) and complement it with statistical analysis tool for the 3G network. Extensive lab and field test results show the high accuracy of the developed platform yet with a reduced cost.	direction finding;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);radio frequency;radio jamming;reduced cost	Wissam Abdessamad;Youssef Nasser;Hassan Artail;Samah Chazbek;Ghassan Fakher;Oussama Bazzi	2016	2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765230	simulation;telecommunications;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	22.18653042310855	79.947137513365	39339

In this paper, we propose two cache invalidation methods in ad hoc networks where each data item is updated at inconstant intervals. In the first method, when a mobile host holding an original data item updates the data item, it broadcasts an invalidation report to all connected mobile hosts. In the other method, when two mobile hosts are connected, they rebroadcast invalidation reports received before to newly connected mobile hosts. Our proposed methods reduce the number of accesses to invalid cached data items which have been updated and the number of roll backs caused by such invalid accesses. We also show the results of simulation experiments regarding the performance evaluation of our proposed methods.	cache invalidation;hoc (programming language)	Hideki Hayashi;Takahiro Hara;Shojiro Nishio	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39964-3_32	wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;cpu cache;telecommunications;computer science;cache invalidation;distributed computing;computer security;wireless;telecommunications network;computer network	Mobile	-2.206171967938449	76.92467452359894	39363
47ff1135c131624e0584bd7eb2692dfd1ad180fd	measuring qos in an aeronautical opportunistic network architecture with limited access to a satellite communications backhaul	delay tolerant networking;article peer reviewed;dtn;qos;transoceanic aircraft;quality of service	We measure quality of service (QoS) in a wireless network architecture of transoceanic aircraft. A distinguishing characteristic of the network scheme we analyze is that it mixes the concept of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) through the exploitation of opportunistic contacts, together with direct satellite access in a limited number of the nodes. We provide a graph sparsification technique for deriving a network model that satisfies the key properties of a real aeronautical opportunistic network while enabling scalable simulation. This reduced model allows us to analyze the impact regarding QoS of introducing Internet-like traffic in the form of outgoing data from passengers. Promoting QoS in DTNs is usually really challenging due to their long delays and scarce resources. The availability of satellite communication links offers a chance to provide an improved degree of service regarding a pure opportunistic approach, and therefore it needs to be properly measured and quantified. Our analysis focuses on several QoS indicators such as delivery time, delivery ratio, and bandwidth allocation fairness. Obtained results show significant improvements in all metric indicators regarding QoS, not usually achievable on the field of DTNs.	backhaul (telecommunications);communications satellite;delay-tolerant networking;download;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);network architecture;network model;network packet;quality of service;quantifier (logic);routing;scalability;simulation;tree network	Rubén Martínez-Vidal;Ramon Martí;Cormac J.

Specifically, we rely on the design of mechanisms at the source node to study forwarding probability of the message in a DTN using the two-hop routing. We study the forwarding probability as a function of the competition within a large population of mobiles which need occasionally to make some action. In particular, for each message generated by a source, each mobile may take a decision that concerns the strategy by which the mobile participates to the relaying of the message from source to destination. A mobile that participates receives a unit of reward if it is the first to deliver a copy of the packet to the destination. The action taken by a mobile determine not only the immediate reward but also the transition probability to its next battery energy state. We characterize the Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS) for these games and propose a method to compute them. We also propose a mechanism design at the source in order to maximize the message delivery probability to the destination, given the equilibrium behavior (called Evolutionary Stable Strategy - ESS).	delay-tolerant networking;energy level;markov chain;network packet;routing	Rachid El Azouzi;Habib B.

Our approach is to reduce the energy consumption at routing discovery phase and to establish suitable routing paths with respect to energy-saving. At the routing discovery phase, we use a dynamic flood filtering algorithm to eliminate the nodes that are predicted not to participate in the final routing paths. The prediction rules are based on energy requirement by each connection, energy availability at each node, and neighbor nodes' status. Finally, at the destination node, by using an energy-efficient route selection algo- rithm, the selected routing path would have small energy consumption with an ample residual energy capacity.	hoc (programming language);routing	Tran Minh Trung;Seong-Lyun Kim	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24614-5_18	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;knowledge base;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;expert system;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.2597479475594104	76.13038444901825	39559

We apply our study to the realworld case of parking service in busy city areas. As the vehicles drive around the area, they opportunistically collect and share with each other information on the location and status of each parking spot they encounter. This opportunistically assisted scenario is compared against one that implements a“blind”non-assisted search and a centralized approach, where the allocation of parking spots is managed by a central server with global knowledge about the parking space availability. Results obtained for both uniformly distributed travel destinations and a single hotspot destination reveal that the relative performance of the three solutions can vary significantly and not always inline with intuition. Under the hotspot scenario, the opportunistic system is consistently outperformed by the centralized system, which yields the minimum times and distances at the expense of more distant parking spot assignments; whereas, for uniformly distributed destinations, the relative performance of all three schemes changes with the vehicle volume, with the centralized approach gradually becoming the worst solution and the opportunistic one emerging as the best scheme. We discuss how each approach modulates the information dissemination process in space and time and resolves the competition for the parking resources. We also outline models providing analytical insights to the behavior of the centralized approach.	automatic parking;centralized computing;interference (communication);java hotspot virtual machine;local variable;modulation;organizing (structure);randomness;self-organization;server (computing);service discovery;simulation	Evangelia Kokolaki;Merkourios Karaliopoulos;Ioannis Stavrakakis	2012	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2011.06.003	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;parking guidance and information;computer security;computer network	Mobile	18.220500665797356	84.860790537841	39685

The key idea is to exploit the capabilities of resource-rich devices (called micro-servers) to reduce the communication burden on smaller sensor nodes which are energy, bandwidth and memory constrained. The goal is to deliver sensor data to the nearest micro-server, which can (i) store it, (ii) forward it to other micro-servers using out-of-band communication, or (iii) perform the desired actuation. Our approach is to construct an anycast tree rooted at each potential event source, which micro-servers can dynamically join and leave. Our anycast mechanism is self-organizing, distributed, robust, scalable, and incurs very little overhead. Simulations using ns-2 show that our anycast mechanism can reduce network energy consumption by more than 50%, both the mean end-to-end latency of the transmission and the mean number of transmissions by more than 50%, and achieves 99% data delivery rate for low and moderate micro-server mobility rate.	anycast;computer simulation;end-to-end principle;organizing (structure);out-of-band agreement;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;scalability;self-organization;sensor;server (computing)	Wen Hu;Nirupama Bulusu;Sanjay Jha	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

TRNGs) appear to be critical components of many cryptographic systems. Yet, such building blocks are still too seldom provided with a formal assessment of security, in comparison to what is achieved for conventional cryptography. In this work, we present a comprehensive statistical study of TRNGs based on the sampling of an oscillator subject to phase noise (a.k.a. phase jitters). This classical layout, typically instantiated with a ring oscillator, provides a simple and attractive way to implement a TRNG on a chip. Our mathematical study allows one to evaluate and control the main security parameters of such a random source, including its entropy rate and the biases of certain bit patterns, provided that a small number of physical parameters of the oscillator are known. In order to evaluate these parameters in a secure way, we also provide an experimental method for filtering out the global perturbations affecting a chip and possibly visible to an attacker. Finally, from our mathematical model, we deduce specific statistical tests applicable to the bitstream of a TRNG. In particular, in the case of an insecure configuration, we show how to recover the parameters of the underlying oscillator.	bitstream;cryptography;electronic oscillator;entropy rate;experiment;hardware random number generator;mathematical model;phase noise;random number generation;random number generator attack;ring oscillator;sampling (signal processing)	Mathieu Baudet;David Lubicz;Julien Micolod;André Tassiaux	2009	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/s00145-010-9089-3	entropy;statistical hypothesis testing;random number generation;computer science;mathematics;oscillation;algorithm;statistics	Crypto	15.062232100852249	65.84979563118596	39936

Advance reservations are likely to become increasingly important as networks and distributed applications become functionally richer, and there have been a number of previous works and investigations that explored various related aspects. However, the impact of advance reservations on path selection is a topic that has been left largely untouched. This paper investigates several service models for advance reservations, which range from the traditional basic model of reserving a given amount of bandwidth for some time in the future, to more sophisticated models aimed at increasing the flexibility of services available through advance reservations. The focus is primarily on the issue of computational complexity when supporting advance reservations, and in that context, we derive a number of algorithms and/or intractability results for the various models we consider.

For example, these protocols are possible to reduce redundant traffic by controlling a propagation direction of a packet based on the positional relation among nodes. To implement direction-oriented communication protocols, we must make a mechanism to detect the direction from which a packet comes. We construct a communication system equipped with a DOA (Direction Of Arrival) detection mechanism by using GNU Radio and USRP, which decides whether a signal is received from the front or rear. In our system, a node measures RSSIs (Received Signal Strength Indicator) at two directional antennas and detects a DOA by comparing each RSSI. In order to use two directional antennas, one node consists of two USRPs, and each USRP has a directional antenna. To show a usefulness of our system, we implement DORP (Direction Oriented Routing Protocol) which is a routing protocol using a direction of a neighbor and destination node. We show an experiment of a multi-hop wireless communication by a video. In our video, each node can flexibly select a relay node without additional control packets like a route recovery packet by utilizing the direction of neighborhood and destination nodes.	direction of arrival;gnu radio;network packet;packet switching;relay;routing;software propagation;universal software radio peripheral	Hiroki Matoba;Yuichi Miyaji;Hideyuki Uehara	2014	2014 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2014.7013329	wireless routing protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	5.277636881582784	86.00905114358889	39972

Most of the prevailing solutions are network-wide and require all routers to participate in the route flap suppressing process, which not only lack flexibility and scalability but also occupy additional computation resources across the network. In this paper, a localized approach is proposed to suppress the routing flap through dynamically tuning the hello interval of OSPF. To support the real-time adjustment of the hello timer, an analytical model is also established to investigate the relationship between link flap and route flap. Simulation results show that our approach can achieve better performance in eliminating routing flap and at the same time consume much less computation resources than the network-wide method.	central processing unit;computation;instability;period-doubling bifurcation;point-to-point protocol;real-time transcription;routing;scalability;simulation;timer;zero suppression	Fang Wang;Shanzhi Chen;Xin Li;Yuhong Li	2008	2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists	10.1109/ICYCS.2008.17	communications protocol;availability;routing;real-time computing;convergence;telecommunications;computer science;routing protocol;computer network	HPC	0.7824293784145336	84.24554177608995	39989

Before they can believe received pieces of information, they must evaluate their reliability. Trust is a mechanism to estimate this reliability based on the sender. It depends on friendship-like relations between vehicles, the social structure. Our traffic and network simulation shows that such relations indeed arise, because vehicles often drive the same route. Within this simulation, all vehicles are equipped with the proposed trust model, which continuously monitors the experiences made with others. The model focuses on these direct experiences of the individual and does not depend on a central reputation unit. It continuously evaluates the performance and reputation of other vehicles and includes a feedback loop to faster adapt to changes in the other’s behaviour. Since the performance of a vehicle depends on the abilities of its sensors, like different abilities in velocity measurement or in traffic sign detection, the proposed model develops trust depending on the sender and on the type of the information.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;binary erasure channel;cognition;dynamical system;experience;feedback;information exchange;machine learning;sensor;simulation;social structure;velocity (software development)	Walter Bamberger;Josef Schlittenlacher;Klaus Diepold	2012	IJSCCPS	10.1504/IJSCCPS.2012.047701	simulation;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	4.564691157854965	74.61902804376562	39996

To ensure high coverage and reduce cost in coverage problems, efficient deployments of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks become the target of coverage optimization. This paper focuses on using the fewest number of sensor nodes to cover more areas in regular or irregular interesting areas with irregular obstacles inside. To optimize the deployment of sensor nodes, in this paper, a brain storm optimization algorithm is utilized and simulation results show that the algorithm performs well on optimizing the coverage percentage and minimizing the needed sensor nodes under complex environments. In addition, the balance of coverage percentage and needed sensor nodes' number can be adjusted according to specific requirements of different networks. For better optimization results in coverage problems, the step size in the generation process of the brain storm optimization algorithm has also been modified to reach higher coverage using fewer sensor nodes under the same environment.	algorithm;evaluation function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;requirement;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Meng Wei;Yuhui Shi	2015	2015 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)	10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407092	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	10.906853016228467	78.35493665523602	40095

The algorithms are strongly greedy in the sense that they attempt to send packets in good directions whenever possible. Furthermore, the routing operations are simple and independent of the time that has elapsed. The first algorithm gives the best evacuation time known for delivering all the packets to their destinations. A batch ofk packets with maximal source-to-destination distanced max is delivered in 2(k-1)+d max. The second algorithm improves this bound tok+d max when all packets are destined to the same node. This also implies a new bound for the multitarget case, which is the first to take into account the number of in-edges of a node. The third algorithm is designed for routing permutations with source-to-destination distance at most three, in which case the algorithm terminates in at most seven steps. We also show a lower bound of five steps for this problem.	greedy algorithm;hot-potato and cold-potato routing;maximal set;network packet	Ishai Ben-Aroya;Tamar Eilam;Assaf Schuster	1995	Distributed Computing	10.1007/BF01784239	routing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;algorithm;computer network	Theory	-2.5482874826358026	73.47589992970556	40135

And, consequently, to save sensor's energy effectively so as to extend the lifetime of the sensor network is one of important issues for the network deployment. In this article, we assume that limited sense nodes are equipped with high power and moving capabilities in the cluster based sensor network. The main objective of these high power nodes is to support the cluster header, which is going to exhaust its power, for data forwarding. The power consumption required for the movement is much larger than that of data forwarding. If the mobile node moves frequently, it will exhaust its power shortly. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to effectively guide the movement of the high power nodes by considering the above issues. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can balance the sensor energy and extend the network lifetime when compared to the LEACH-C scheme for the same network environment.	bcm theory;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;operand forwarding;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Yen-Wen Chen;Hwa-Chun Ma;I-Hsuan Peng;Ta-En Chang	2008	2008 International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms, and Networks (i-span 2008)	10.1109/I-SPAN.2008.48	embedded system;sensor node;telecommunications;engineering;packet forwarding;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	9.021402716846865	79.27466593546957	40180

Under the uneven condition, balance network node energy consumption, prolong the network life cycle and improve the network security have become the main goal of designing routing protocols. In this paper, we propose a low-energy security-enhanced routing protocol based on DBSCAN partition (LESERP-DP). The DBSCAN algorithm is used to optimize the clustering in the case of non-uniform nodes distribution, and the key distribution mechanism is designed to enhance the anti-attack ability of the protocol. The simulation results show that the routing protocol is excellent in energy consumption and to a certain extent, reduces the threat of node capture to sensor networks.	dbscan;routing	Yating Hou;Feng Xu;Ruilin Ding	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68505-2_30	wireless sensor network;link-state routing protocol;computer science;subclu;node (networking);cluster analysis;network security;distributed computing;dbscan;routing protocol	Mobile	7.878589775571856	79.79231890686188	40231

In order to mitigate MBUs errors, interleaving schemes together with single error correction SEC codes can be used to provide the greatest protection for advanced computer memories. In this paper, an algorithm of iterative scrubbing strategy ISS is proposed for the optimal interleaving distance ID, which should be maximized under some conditions. The proposed algorithm should keep the complexity and the area overhead of designing ID as low as possible without compromising memory reliability. The key principle is to take advantage of the locality of MBU errors and to realize efficient scrubbing. The efficiency of the proposed approach will be compared with conventional strategy.	memory scrubbing	Yun Wang	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31854-7_38	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science	HPC	7.5035596667336355	60.50670759802382	40250

In this paper, we propose a new interconnection network called twisted crossed cube TCQn and investigate its basic network properties in terms of the regularity, connectivity, fault tolerance, recursiveness, hamiltonicity and ability to simulate other architectures, and so on. Then, we develop an effective routing algorithm Route u, v for TCQn that takes no more than du, v+1 steps for any two nodes u, v to communicate with each other, and the routing process shows that the diameter, wide diameter, and fault-tolerant diameter of TCQn are about half of the corresponding diameters of the equivalent hypercube with the same dimension. In the end, by combining TCQn with crossed cube CQn, we propose a preferable dynamic network structure, that is, the dynamic crossed cube, which has the same network diameter as TCQn/CQn and better properties in other respects, for example, its connection complexity is half of that of TCQn/CQn when the network scale is large enough, and the number of its average routing steps is also much smaller than that in TCQn/CQn.

We studied the performance of representatives from each of three major protocol categories: (1) low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), a cluster-based protocol, (2) power efficient gathering for sensory information systems (PEGASIS), a chain-based protocol, and (3) hybrid indirect transmissions (HIT), a hybrid of chains and clusters. First, the ability of each protocol to perform in-network source separation was judged. We consider a human-machine interaction application in which implanted bio-sensors communicate motor unit actions of human muscles to a remote computer. Motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were modeled, and source separation and recovery at each sensor was simulated. We compare the performance of HIT and LEACH in terms of signal distortion ratios and the energy costs of fusion and communication. Second, we report on the efficiency of each protocol for in-body data collection, using Gupta et al's propagation loss model for biomedical applications (PMBA) - an accurate model of power loss due to signal absorption by the human body. We investigate the effectiveness of HIT, LEACH, and PEGASIS under this model, and compare their performance in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime	action potential;british informatics olympiad;cluster analysis;communications protocol;distortion;human–computer interaction;information system;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;performance evaluation;remote computer;sensor;software propagation;source separation;sparse matrix	Melody Moh;Benjamin Jack Culpepper;Lan Dung;Teng-Sheng Moh;Takeo Hamada;Ching-Fong Su	2005	GLOBECOM '05.

Previous research has explored the construction of such hierarchies by ranking the nodes according to general performance metrics. However, these approaches have been mostly confined to two levels with just predictable metric values, considering the multi-level case only by recursive application of the two-level approach. In this paper, we show that this methodology yields only suboptimal results in many cases. Hence, we present a distributed algorithm to construct a multi-metric multi-level independent dominating set topology for unpredictable metric values, which overcomes the constraints of suboptimality faced previously. Further, our algorithm is also easily parameterizable in order to balance the tradeoff between performance optimality and message complexity which is particularly desirable in dynamic networks. We substantiate the performance of our algorithm by extensive simulations.	distributed algorithm;dominating set;hoc (programming language);independent set (graph theory);leader election;mobile computing;network topology;network utility;recursion;relevance;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;simulation;software performance testing;tree network	Johannes Lessmann;Arvind Krishnamurthy	2007	Third IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob 2007)	10.1109/WIMOB.2007.26	wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;computer science;wireless network;machine learning;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-1.5227362023670667	79.53498170109519	40431

They are typically used for monitoring and automation purposes of large areas. Due to their simplicity, these networks quickly run out of energy, and often have problems regarding scalability and available bandwidth. To solve these issues, current research is mostly limited to the addition of extra sinks to the network, or the use of gateways to request sensor data over the Internet. In this paper, we explore how wireless sensor networks can be combined with wireless mesh networks to obtain a more optimized solution. The mesh network can be used to connect separate sensor networks, to connect sensor nodes with a monitoring platform, or as a scalable backbone for sensor to sensor communication. Additionally, we give an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of existing interconnection techniques between wireless and mesh networks, and propose several new interconnection strategies. Finally, we identify remaining challenges, upon which future research can be based.	communications protocol;converge;fits;gateway (telecommunications);global serializability;interconnection;internet backbone;mesh networking;organizing (structure);routing;scalability;self-organization;sensor;throughput;wireless mesh network	Stefan Bouckaert;Eli De Poorter;Pieter De Mil;Ingrid Moerman;Piet Demeester	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425861	wireless mesh network;sensor web;switched mesh;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	6.228390016983309	75.60271072725314	40433

To generate an intrinsic identification (ID) for each die, embedded SRAM PUFs of three types were implemented using 45-nm bulk CMOS technology: 1) single power-on scheme, 2) divided-power-on scheme, and 3) low/low writing scheme. Measured Hamming distances of IDs between 64 dies showed no significant advantage or disadvantage in three SRAM-based PUFs in terms of uniqueness, being acceptable for practical use. The measured error rates of IDs in iteration, supply voltage variation, and temperature variation show that the divided-power-on scheme has better reliability than the other schemes.	cmos;divided power structure;embedded system;hamming distance;iteration;static random-access memory;window function	Hidehiro Fujiwara;Makoto Yabuuchi;Koji Nii	2014	Fifteenth International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design	10.1109/ISQED.2014.6783371	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;mathematics;silicon	Arch	14.850180023270688	62.71114485468109	40468

Two versions of scheme are presented to satisfy different application requirements. The first general version scheme can detect single error for the whole AES process with high efficiency. Another run-time version scheme is used to immediately terminate the error round with no time delay and no computation wasted on the rest rounds for propagating errors. Utilizing the ready-made arithmetic units in AES, single error can be detected by the sender and prevent the misdirected information from sending out. The results of the hardware FPGA implementation and simulation show that the proposed scheme can be integrated both on software and hardware without making many changes to the original AES implementation.	advanced encryption standard process;algorithm;broadcast delay;byte;computation;error detection and correction;fault tolerance;field-programmable gate array;newman's lemma;overhead (computing);processor register;propagation of uncertainty;requirement;s-box;simulation;software propagation;terminate (software);time complexity	Chang Nian Zhang;Qian Yu;Xiao Wei Liu	2013	I.

This method prolongs the durability of the target coverage task. Moreover, it is shown that the optimised selection of the sensors in each timeslot does not lead to an optimum selection across the lifetime of the network due to non-uniformity in energy consumption pattern. Uniformity control is achieved using the sensors’ panning capability to select the sensing area. The major notion of energy uniformity in this paper is typified with the network area sections level. For this criterion, sensor selection has been modeled as a binary integer programming (BIP) problem, and optimal solutions have been obtained for both point target model and circular target model which are used in k-coverage and full-angle coverage, respectively. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm has also been proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that exerting uniformity control can significantly increase the lifetime of the network.	circuit complexity;distributed algorithm;durability (database systems);experiment;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;online algorithm;sensor;simulation	Mojtaba Hosseini;Mehdi Dehghan;Hossein Pedram	2013	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2013.058506	telecommunications	AI	11.810775143467524	78.50921898770153	40551
d57da5c10da9e7209b1cdec5b0fcc95ef515c10a	ieee access special section editorial: high mobility 5g lte-v: challenges and solutions		The Internet of Vehicles, previously referred to as Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), will be a collection of mobile ad hoc networks for vehicular communications to improve driving safety and traffic efficiency. Major categories include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Collectively these (and future categories) can be termed V2X communications. These two categories entail a variety of communication channels, network topologies, vehicle densities and communication scenarios, and in response to this, IEEE has released the IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 protocols for VANETs. With the global commercial application of Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile communication systems, LTE based vehicular (LTE-V) networks have been shown to offer advantages in V2I communications, coverage, high mobility and complicated communication scenarios. Therefore, in the 5th generation’s (5G) mobile communication networks, the 3GPP is discussing V2V communications as a device-to-device (D2D) communication application. As is well known, in high mobility scenarios, the wireless channel is rapidly time- varying, Doppler shifts and spreads can be much larger than in cellular, network topology can change quickly, and switching among base stations and vehicles is more frequent. All this presents formidable challenges to realizing reliable communications with low latency in 5G LTE-V systems.	compaq lte	Wen Chen;Ruisi He;David W.

This gives rise to scalability and efficiency problems for accurate logical clocks. In this paper we propose a class of logical clocks called plausible clocks that can be implemented with a number of components not affected by the size of the system and yet they provide good ordering accuracy. We develop rules to combine plausible clocks to produce more accurate clocks. Several examples of plausible clocks and their combination are presented. Using a simulation model, we evaluate the performance of these clocks.	causality;distributed computing;logical clock;scalability;simulation;vector clock	Francisco J.

The problem is viewed as a queue control problem where the objective is to maintain a reference energy level of the energy storage device. A validated nonlinear queueing model is considered and a robust nonlinear controller is considered whose convergence properties are established analytically. The proposed control algorithm incorporates predictions of the energy to be harvested which are generated using the recently proposed Accurate Solar Irradiance Prediction Model (ASIM). The combined control and prediction scheme is evaluated using analysis and simulations. Preliminary simulation results conducted on the NS-3 simulator demonstrate the ability of the scheme to achieve its design objective as the energy level oscillates about values close to the desired level.	algorithm;control theory;energy level;network congestion;nonlinear system;queueing theory;simulation	Nouman Ashraf;Waqar Asif;Hassaan Khaliq Qureshi;Marios Lestas	2017	2017 13th Annual Conference on Wireless On-demand Network Systems and Services (WONS)	10.1109/WONS.2017.7888757	communications protocol;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;energy level;mathematical model;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless;computer network;energy management	Embedded	11.992785775818584	86.65946428822703	40579

When such a network is deployed, there are usually restrictions in the way the nodes can be positioned, and this results in a time-varying and node-dependent attenuation of the available solar energy. Unfortunately, conventional resource provisioning methodologies do not take into account these positional variations, and therefore the deployed system may be over-provisioned. In this paper the resource provisioning problem is considered from this point of view. A linear programming formulation is first developed which gives lower bounds on the node resource provisioning cost assignments. A provisioning algorithm is then introduced that takes positional solar energy variations into consideration. Our results show that a significant reduction in provisioning cost can be obtained using the proposed methodology when compared to the conventional case.	algorithm;causality;downtime;linear programming formulation;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;node (computer science);password authentication protocol;provisioning;routing;self-propelled particles;simulation;wireless mesh network	Mohammad Sheikh Zefreh;Ghada H.

8a32a5d0f8f9c737a49ab054f32a966915c02a1d	random graph models for wireless communication networks	electronic engineering;thesis;computer science	This thesis concerns mathematical models of wireless communication networks, in particular ad-hoc networks and 802.11 WLANs. In ad-hoc mode each of these devices may function as a sender, a relay or a receiver. Each device may only communicate with other devices within its transmission range. We use graph models for the relationship between any two devices: a node stands for a device, and an edge for a communication link, or sometimes an interference relationship. The number of edges incident on a node is the degree of this node. When considering geometric graphs, the coordinates of a node give the geographical position of a node. One of the important properties of a communication graph is its connectedness — whether all nodes can reach all other nodes. We use the term connectivity, the probability of graphs being connected given the number of nodes and the transmission range to measure the connectedness of a wireless network. Connectedness is an important prerequisite for all communication networks which communication between nodes. This is especially true for wireless ad-hoc networks, where communication relies on the contact among nodes and their neighbours. Another important property of an interference graph is its chromatic number — the minimum number of colours needed so that no adjacent nodes are assigned the same colour. Here adjacent nodes share an edge; adjacent edges share at least one node; and colours are used to identify different frequencies. This gives the minimum number of frequencies a network needs in order to attain zero interference. This problem can be solved as an optimization problem deterministically, but is algorithmically NP-hard. Hence, finding good asymptotic approximations for this value becomes important. Random geometric graphs describe an ensemble of graphs which share common features. In this thesis, node positions follow a Poisson point process or a binomial point process. We use probability theory to study the connectedness of random graphs and random geometric graphs, which is the fraction of connected graphs among many graph samples. This probability is closely related to the property of minimum node degree being at least unity. The chromatic number is closely related to the maximum degree as n→∞; the chromatic number converges to maximum degree when graph is sparse. We test existing theorems and improve the existing ones when possible. These motivated me to study the degree of random (geometric) graph models. We study using deterministic methods some degree-related problems for Erdaős-Rényi random graphs G(n, p) and random geometric graphs G(n, r). I provide both theoretical analysis and accurate simulation results. The results lead to a study of dependence or non-dependence in the joint distribution of the degrees of neighbouring nodes. We study the probability of no node being isolated in G(n, p), that is, minimum node degree being at least unity. By making the assumption of non-dependence of node degree, we derive two asymptotics for this probability. The probability of no node being isolated is an approximation to the probability of the graph being connected. By making an analogy to G(n, p), we study this problem for G(n, r), which is a more realistic model for wireless networks. Experiment shows that this asymptotic result also works well for small graphs. We wish to find the relationship between these basic features the above two important problems of wireless networks: the probability of a network being connected and the minimum number of channels a network needs in order to minimize interference. Inspired by the problem of maximum degree in random graphs, we study the problem of the maximum of a set of Poisson random variables and binomial random variables, which leads to two accurate formulae for the mode of the maximum for general random geometric graphs and for sparse random graphs. To our knowledge, these are the best results for sparse random geometric graphs in the literature so far. By approximating the node degrees as independent Poisson or binomial variables, we apply the result to the problem of maximum degree in general and sparse G(n, r), and derived much more accurate results than in the existing literature. Combining the limit theorem from Penrose and our work, we provide good approximations for the mode of the clique number and chromatic number in sparse G(n, r). Again these results are much more accurate than existing ones. This has implications for the interference minimization of WLANs. Finally, we apply our asymptotic result based on Poisson distribution for the chromatic number of random geometric graph to the interference minimization problem in IEEE 802.11b/g WLAN. Experiments based on the real planned position of the APs in WLANs show that our asymptotic results estimate the minimum number of channels needed accurately. This also means that sparse random geometric graphs are good models for interference minimization problem of WLANs. We discuss the interference minimization problem in single radio and multi-radio wireless networking scenarios. We study branchand-bound algorithms for these scenarios by selecting different constraint functions and objective functions.	approximation;clique (graph theory);color;deterministic algorithm;geometric graph theory;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical model;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;point process;random geometric graph;random graph;relay;simulation;sparse matrix;telecommunications network	Linlin Song	2010			computer science;theoretical computer science;network dynamics;geometric networks;complex network;computer engineering	Theory	14.41599305588339	87.27917484839082	40663

54c55287af38860774f189d1fdd053974e03dd11	a data predication model for integrating wireless sensor networks and cloud computing		Cloud computing has been proved to be a promising solution for managing and processing big data by providing a data center centric and efficient algorithms for managing and organizing the data. One of the cloud system's data sources is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). WSNs present a new way of data-stream sources in which data is received periodically from different sensors; resulting in a large amount of data accumulated over a short period. WSNs have limited resources in which a finedetailed data streams lead to exhaustive energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a data prediction model that is built within the sensor nodes and used by the cloud system to generate the data. The purpose of the proposed model is to exempt the sensor nodes from sending a large amount of data and thus reduces the energy consumption of the sensor's battery. We manage to formulate the prediction model as a line equation through two n-dimensional vectors in n-space. Initial results showed that the proposed model will be capable to achieve a better error rate as compared to traditional data prediction techniques. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the fact that each node has to transmit not only its own traffic, but also traffic on behalf of other nodes, leads to unfairness among the communication rates of the nodes.

Although Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) seems to be a more promising solution, careful transmission scheduling is needed in order to achieve error-free communication and fairness. Several algorithms may be found in the literature for scheduling TDMA transmissions in wireless multihop networks. Their main goal is to determine the optimal scheduling, in order to increase the capacity and reduce the delay for a given network topology, though they do not consider the traffic requirements of the active flows of the multihop network or fairness issues. In this paper, we propose a joint TDMA scheduling/load balancing algorithm, called Load-Balanced-Fair Flow Vector Scheduling Algorithm (LB-FFVSA). This algorithm schedules the transmissions in a fair manner, in terms of throughput per connection, taking into account the communication requirements of the active flows of the network. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves improved performance compared to other solutions, not only in terms of fairness, but also in terms of throughput. Moreover, it was proved that when a load balancing technique is used, the performance of the scheduling algorithm is further improved.	access control;algorithm;computer engineering;computer science;email;emoticon;fairness measure;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;informatics;interference (communication);lattice boltzmann methods;load balancing (computing);network congestion;network topology;requirement;router (computing);schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation;systems engineering;throughput	Dimitrios J.

A WSN is modelled as a unit disk graph G = (V, E) where V and E denote the sensors deployed in the plane and the links among them, respectively. A link between two sensors exists if their Euclidean distance is at most 1. We present a distributed algorithm that computes a family S of S1, S2, · · · , Sm non-trivial connected dominating sets (CDS) with the goal to maximize α = m/k where k=maxu∈V |{i : u ∈ Si}|. In other words, we wish to find as many CDSs as possible while minimizing the number of frequencies of each node in these sets. Since CDSs play an important role for maximizing network lifetime when they are used as backbones for broadcasting messages, maximizing α reduces the possibility of repeatedly using the same subset of nodes as backbones. We provide an upper bound on the value of α via a nice relationship between all minimum vertex-cuts and CDSs in G and present a distributed (localized) algorithm for the α maximization problem. For a subclass of unit disk graphs, we show that our algorithm achieves a constant approximation factor of the optimal solution.	approximation;care-of address;centralized computing;cut (graph theory);distributed algorithm;dominating set;euclidean distance;expectation–maximization algorithm;sensor;unit disk graph	Kamrul Islam;Selim G.

For instance, since packet loss is common in mobile wireless networks, the adversary can exploit this fact by hiding its malicious intents using compliant packet losses that appear to be caused by environmental reasons.In this paper we study two routing attacks that use non-cooperative network members and disguised packet losses to deplete ad hoc network resources and to reduce ad hoc routing performance. These two routing attacks have not been fully addressed in previous research. We propose the design of """"self-healing community"""" to counter these two attacks. Our design exploits the redundancy in deployment which is typical of most ad hoc networks; Namely, it counters non-cooperative attacks using the probabilistic presence of nearby cooperative network members.To realize the new paradigm, we devise localized simple schemes to (re-)configure self-healing communities in spite of random node mobility. We develop a general analytic model to prove the effectiveness of our design. Then we implement our secure ad hoc routing protocols in simulation to verify the cost and overhead incurred by maintaining the communities. Our study confirms that the community-based security is a cost-effective strategy to make off-the-shelf ad hoc routing protocols secure."""	adversary (cryptography);dfa minimization;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);kilobyte;mobile phone;network packet;overhead (computing);programming paradigm;routing;simulation;software deployment;weatherstar	Jiejun Kong;Xiaoyan Hong;Yunjung Yi;Joon-Sang Park;Jun Liu;Mario Gerla	2005		10.1145/1062689.1062722	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;cost-effectiveness analysis;dsrflow;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;packet loss;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.665217392311156	82.59485356860773	40878

Because the quality of an mote application is strongly relevant to the behavior patterns of the mote (a behavior pattern in this work is referenced to a commonly occurring way of performing actions of the mode, which resides in the programming framework, i.e., the code structure of the program, of the mote application), this paper studies how to design behavior patterns for mote applications, which will act as guidelines for implementing programs, to improve the QoS of applications. This paper first summarizes a collection of fundamental behavior patterns which can be often found in mote applications and then analyzes the relationships between quality properties and behavior patterns of mote applications based on a series of experiments. It also demonstrates how to design code structures to realize the expected behavior patterns in mote applications for improving the QoS of mote applications."""	bloom (shader effect);experiment;quality of service;sensor node	Tingxun Shi;Ruizhi Wang;Daolan Zhang;Wenpin Jiao;Bing Xie	2013		10.1145/2532443.2532467	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	HCI	8.949468722995967	72.78097105950775	40899

The principle of sidewalk and lookahead are similar to two existing approaches. Lookside is an improved version of either of them. Sidewalk, lookahead and lookside guarantee successful routing in a d-cube if the number of link failures is less than d. For higher degree of link failures, the authors measure their performance by probability of successful routing and expected routing distance using two fault distribution models, probability fault model and random fault model. Lookside demonstrates better properties than sidewalk and lookahead in that it has the highest successful routing rate with reasonable routing distance. >	algorithm;fault tolerance;routing	Chungti Liang;Sourav Bhattacharya;Wei-Tek Tsai	1991		10.1109/SPDP.1991.218261	routing;fault tolerance;static routing;parallel computing;real-time computing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;statistics;computer network	DB	-0.8320099572579059	69.17864161706642	40974

Reference circuits (e.g., S-BOX, crypto core) were designed in various logic styles, and their robustness against LPA attacks was comparatively evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations in 65 nm. Analysis allowed for better understanding the impact that process variations have on the outcome of LPA attacks, which is an aspect that is not understood currently. Results show that LPA attacks are rather effective also under die-to-die and within-die process variations. Moreover, the comparison between different logic styles showed that standard CMOS logic circuits are extremely vulnerable to LPA attacks. Other logic styles that are robust against traditional Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks were also compared. Interestingly, analysis showed that these logic styles are still vulnerable to LPA attacks. Hence, LPA attacks are an even greater threat to Smart Cards information security, compared to DPA attacks. Moreover, traditional methods to protect Smart Cards against DPA attacks are ineffective in counteracting LPA attacks, thereby showing that a significant research effort will be needed to counteract LPA attacks with suitable solutions that ensure high security standards.	boolean circuit;cmos;cryptography;information security;logic gate;monte carlo method;simulation;smart card;spectral leakage	Milena Djukanovic;Luca Giancane;Giuseppe Scotti;Alessandro Trifiletti;Massimo Alioto	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5937998	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;information security;mathematics;computer security;statistics;monte carlo method	Security	12.681095521752937	63.254758159900696	41083
8750ef5c322b94059506542d61a47cd756991a1d	probabilistic fingerprinting based passive device-free localization from channel state information		Given the ubiquitous distribution of electronic devices equipped with a radio frequency (RF) interface, researchers have shown great interest in analyzing signal fluctuation on this interface for environmental perception. A popular example is the enabling of indoor localization with RF signals. As an alternative to active device-based positioning, device-free passive (DfP) indoor localization has the advantage that the sensed individuals do not require to carry RF sensors. We propose a probabilistic fingerprinting-based technique for DfP indoor localization. Our system adopts CSI readings derived from off-the-shelf WiFi 802.11n wireless cards which can provide fine-grained subchannel measurements in the context of MIMO-OFDM PHY layer parameters. This complex channel information enables accurate localization of non-equipped individuals. Our scheme further boosts the localization efficiency by using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the most relevant feature vectors. The experimental results demonstrate that our system can achieve an accuracy of over 92% and an error distance smaller than 0.5m. We also investigate the effect of other parameters on the performance of our system, including packet transmission rate, the number of links as well as the number of principle components.	aggregate data;csi-dos;channel state information;digital subchannel;feature vector;fingerprint (computing);mimo-ofdm;network packet;phy (chip);principal component analysis;quantum fluctuation;radio frequency;sensor	Shuyu Shi;Stephan Sigg;Yusheng Ji	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504431	telecommunications	Mobile	20.957409587017327	75.62218350703027	41088

However, up to now, little work has been done in WSAN, especially in security issues. In this paper, we first discuss several challenges in security of WSAN. Aiming at these challenges, we propose our key establishment scheme for heterogeneous nodes in WSAN. In our scheme, authentication and key establishment can be finished with just one round-trip communication. Further more, our scheme is especially designed for heterogeneous architectures. Capability of resource-rich actors are fully used. Finally, our scheme and existing schemes for Ad Hoc Networks and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) are compared and analyzed.

1cc297119b4667cd89da37398be6d4013ce7e9aa	enhanced stability routing scheme against radio jamming based on ndl in multi-hop wireless networks		Most of the routing protocols for wireless networks have focused on finding a feasible route from a source to a destination. Routing Protocols in Multi-hop Wireless Networks (MHWNs) face more serious security and reliability challenges. Radio jamming attacks are especially harmful to the reliability of links, as they can effectively disrupt communication between any node pairs result in that links are continuously created and broken. Selecting a long lasting and steady-going route in multi-hop wireless network is a critical task. This paper studies the impact of jamming on the common protocols of wireless networks and presents an improved reliable AODV routing protocolbased on Neighbor Dependency Level(NDL)which named as RPBND protocol. The NDL of a node and its neighbor is divided into three ranks, that is, fully-dependent, half-dependent and independent level. Then, route selection ways for different NDL are presented, and different priorities of the neighbor nodes with different NDL to be selected as the next hop node are assigned. The performance of the stable routing protocol based on Neighbor Dependency Level (NDL) is demonstrated in simulation, and compared with the traditional Min-hop-based AODV routing algorithm and the improved Cost-based AODV routing algorithm. The simulation results show that the RPBND protocol has better data transmission stability.	algorithm;radio jamming;routing;simulation	Li Lou;Jian-Hua Fan;Yong-Yang Hu;Lingyun Xu	2017	2017 IEEE 14th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS)	10.1109/MASS.2017.115	computer network;hop (networking);wireless network;computer science;distributed computing;wireless;routing protocol;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing;data transmission;radio jamming	Mobile	4.84151161439929	83.26471193170347	41269
d20f3ff643f53041a3dba81da25372dc13e52dbe	enhancing the performance of indoor device-free passive localization		Device-free passive localization (DFPL) has been an emerging application with fast increasing development. Channel State Information- (CSI-) based DFPL is recently paid more attention to for fine-granularity and stability of CSI. However, lots of dead spots exist in the area of interest. And the accuracy of localization is not still completely satisfactory, especially for outside of the first Fresnel zone. In our paper, we put forward a new metric to estimate the sensitivity of a receiver to changes in the detecting area. In our experiment, we observe that the performance of DFPL can be raised when the receiver is placed at the location with high receiver sensitivity. Hence, we develop a new high-performance indoor device-free passive localization (HiDFPL), which employs a Bayesian a posteriori approach and possesses high receiver sensitivity. The experiment results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed scheme.

There has been some recent study using a model where sensors transmit using a directional antenna. This study has focused on the problem of finding an optimal transmission range so that there exists an orientation of the antennae at each sensor which creates a strongly connected communication network. This is known as the Antenna Orientation Problem for Strong Connectivity. In this paper we examine a similar problem: we wish to optimize not only the transmission range, but also the hop-stretch factor of the communication network (in relation to the omnidirectional model). We refer to this as the Antenna Orientation Problem with Constant Stretch Factor. We present approximations to this problem for antennae with angles π/2 ≤ φ ≤ 2π.

Although highly innovative and interesting solution to provide patient monitoring, such ad hoc networks rely on the co-operation of other patient monitoring devices as routers. The end-to-end delivery of messages carrying vital signs of patients will be negatively affected by un-cooperation and/or failure of routers. In this paper, we address how to overcome the uncooperation and failure of routers in patient monitoring. More specifically, network routing schemes are presented for delivery of messages from the source device to one of healthcare professionals using ad hoc wireless networks. The performance results show that the impact of un-cooperative nodes in wireless patient monitoring can be minimized by using broadcast and reliable routing schemes.

A promising solution is delay-tolerant networks, but these networks have inherent issues with routing. Popular mobile ad hoc routing protocols such as AODV and OSPF rely on the existence of an end-to-end path. These protocols first establish a path before traffic is sent. A delay-tolerant network, however, is characterized by intermittent connectivity and consequently for these types of networks, traditional routing protocols fail. This paper proposes an adaptive threshold routing algorithm that builds upon the threshold method proposed in [1]. An adaptive algorithm is an ideal approach for dynamic, challenged, network environments. The adaptive threshold method takes into account changes in the network structure and adjusts the algorithm parameters to optimize performance in terms of reducing network load, lowering the delivery rate of packets, and maximizing packet throughput. Experimental results show that as the network topology changes, the adaptive threshold method not only maintains a high throughput while lowering the network load, it also outperforms the threshold method by reducing the average packet delivery rate.	adaptive algorithm;delay-tolerant networking;end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);network packet;network topology;routing;throughput	Nicole Ng;Hwa Chang;Zhongjian Zou;Sai Tang	2011	2011 IEEE GLOBECOM Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162353	wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dsrflow;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;flooding;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	2.094435285815196	83.80185808263354	41426

A Ring-Oscillator-Based PUF (RO PUF) is one possible implementation of an sPUF. One disadvantage of RO PUFs is that they require one pair of ring oscillators per bit of output. Therefore, in order to collect enough output bits for a safe security level, a large number of ring oscillators is needed. Configurable PUFs may help solving this problem. In 2009, Maiti introduced a configurable RO PUF to improve RO PUF reliability, where each RO is implemented in one configurable logic block (CLB) by using lookup tables (LUTs) and dedicated multiplexers. In this paper we analyze Maiti's configurable RO PUFs and propose improvements to generate more output bits, by utilizing latches as well as the resource mentioned above. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved method outputs more bits than Maiti's configurable RO PUFs and the original RO PUFs, while using the same amount of area.	field-programmable gate array;hamming distance;logic block;lookup table;multiplexer;physical unclonable function;requirement;ring oscillator	Xin Xin;Jens-Peter Kaps;Kris Gaj	2011	2011 14th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design	10.1109/DSD.2011.88	embedded system;computer hardware;computer science;particle detector;field-programmable gate array	EDA	13.515607472852544	63.268247122914644	41458

As a consequence, design procedures for high speed networks, such as optic fiber based networks, must take propagation delay into account.

This paper is about modeling mobility in clustered networks, where nodes are concentrated into clusters of dense connectivity, and in between there exists sparse connectivity. The dense and sparse networks are extensively studied and modeled, but not much attention is paid to the clustered networks.  In the sparse and clustered networks, an inherently important aspect is the mobility model, both for the design and evaluation of routing protocols. We propose a new mobility model for clustered networks, called Heterogeneous Random Walk. This model is simple, mathematically tractable and most importantly it captures the phenomenon of emerging clusters, observed in real partitioned networks, in an elegant way. We provide a closed-form expression for the stationary distribution of node position and we give a recipe for the """"perfect simulation"""".  Moreover, based on the real mobility trace we provide strong evidence for the main macroscopic characteristics of clustered networks captured by the proposed mobility model. For the very first time in the literature we show evidence for the correlation between the spatial speed distribution and the cluster formation. We also present the results of the analysis of real cluster dynamics caused by nodes' mobility."""	apollonian network;cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;computer cluster;hoc (programming language);routing;simulation;sparse matrix;stationary process	Michal Piórkowski;Natasa Sarafijanovic-Djukic;Matthias Grossglauser	2008		10.1145/1374688.1374690	evolving networks;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;mobility model;statistics;computer network	Metrics	3.614155468047441	86.9269080696156	41553

The network topology is employed in an enterprise scenario. At hardware side, we have designed a slim Access Point (AP) with embedded OpenWRT Linux System and a ZigBee Dongle and integrated them in a Plug and Play (PnP) manner. The ZigBee dongle has a programmer-friendly software interface, namely, AT Command. At the scene of this enterprise scenario, there are a great deal of battery-supplied ZigBee nodes. The unnecessary energy consumption of these ZigBee nodes can be an issue that needs to be solved. This paper proposes an innovative energy consumption saving algorithm for ZigBee end-devices. This algorithm can be used to adjust the transmission power adaptively in order to obtain optimistic transmission current. The deciding factors are the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and Package Received Rate (PRR). Both factors are obtained from ZigBee Coordinator. Thereupon, the utility time of ZigBee nodes can be extended.	algorithm;dongle;embedded system;linux;network topology;openwrt;plug and play;production rule representation;programmer	Yitian Zhang;Kun Yang;Xiao Wang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing	10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.178	embedded system;algorithm design;wi-fi;neurfon;real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;heterogeneous network;computer science;wireless network;mathematical model;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;network topology;computer network	Mobile	9.999820903461403	80.41910328383067	41665

These nodes sense surrounding environments and deliver back collected data periodically or on-demand. The overall delay experienced in the delivery process is almost always proportional to the number of hops of data delivery paths. For time-critical applications, such delay is most desirable to be bounded. Most of existing works deploy additional relay nodes to shorten data delivery paths. In contrast, this paper introduces additional sinks such that each sensor can reach at least one sink in a bounded number of hops. Specifically, this paper formulates provisioned sink placement problem in senor networks composed by sensors of Heterogeneous wireless broadcast regions. Then the problem is proved to be NP-complete and subsequently one heuristic algorithm is presented to obtain approximate solutions.	approximation algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;np-completeness;probabilistic turing machine;relay;sensor;window of opportunity	Jian Wang;Fan Yang;Xiaoming Hu;Yan Liu	2011	2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019995	wireless sensor network;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	11.698172750295349	79.57762439997998	41776

The single-hop conception of typical LPWAN deployments, though simple and robust, overlooks the self-organization capabilities of network devices, suffers from lack of scalability in crowded scenarios, and pays little attention to energy consumption. Aimed to take the most out of devices' capabilities, the HARE protocol stack is proposed in this paper as a new LPWAN technology flexible enough to adopt uplink multi-hop communications when proving energetically more efficient. In this way, results from a real testbed show energy savings of up to 15% when using a multi-hop approach while keeping the same network reliability. System's self-organizing capability and resilience have been also validated after performing numerous iterations of the association mechanism and deliberately switching off network devices.	emergence;hop;internet of things;iteration;low sodium diet;low-power broadcasting;mental suffering;numerous;organizing (structure);protocol stack;scalability;self-organization;telecommunications link;testbed	Toni Adame;Sergio Barrachina-Muñoz;Boris Bellalta;Albert Bel	2018		10.3390/s18010115	simulation;telecommunications;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	16.73286508665321	84.37737491830704	41841

But there exist possible risks of sensor nodes being captured by adversaries and the transmissions in the underwater communication being illegally accessed. As a result, it is vital to take the security issue into account in such an underwater mobile sensor network. In this paper, our goal is to propose a key distribution scheme adequate for underwater mobile sensor networks. We adopt a mobility model to capture the movement of the sensors floating on the sea. Our key distribution scheme is designed to fit the characteristics of the sensors’ movement, and hence the connection and security can be improved in underwater sensor networks. Our scheme can also reduce redundant keys in the key distribution system. We also propose a secure routing method based on the Focused Beam Routing Protocol to adapt to our proposed iterative key distribution scheme. The simulation results show that our scheme possesses better performance, including better local connectivity, availability of path key, resilience and routing results.	key distribution;mad	Chuan-Gang Liu;Chih-Hung Chao;Chih-Wen Leou;Jung-Shian Li	2012	Comput.

We assume that each node in the network has a set of discrete levels of transmission power and nodes are relatively static. The problem is, given a set of nodes in the Euclidean plane and a multicast request, to construct a multicast tree rooted at the source and including all destinations such that the total energy cost of the transmitting nodes in the tree is minimized. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard and is unlikely to have an approximation algorithm with a logarithmic performance ratio. We then propose two algorithms, one is based on the Steiner tree method and the other is based on connected dominating set method. Both algorithms have guaranteed performance ratios and outperform the existing method.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;connected dominating set;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);ibm notes;information exchange;multicast;np-hardness;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;steiner tree problem;transmitter;tree decomposition	Deying Li;Xiao-Dong Hu;Xiaohua Jia	2005	Proceedings. 2005 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems, 2005.	10.1016/j.comcom.2007.09.003	wireless ad hoc network;multicast;telecommunications;steiner tree problem;protocol independent multicast;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;distributed computing;efficient energy use;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;approximation algorithm;algorithm;xcast;computer network	EDA	1.229288932121271	76.06399592547899	41970

The simulation models are built using discrete-driven simulation. SIMSCRIPT 11.5 is used to develop the simulation models. The performance metrics considered in this paper are the throughput and average packet delay. Results obtained show that the throughput declines as the normalized propagation delay increases. However, the Token Bus channel utilization is higher than that of Ethernet especially when the Token Bus is operating in the exhaustive service case. The Token Bus exhaustive service has better maximum throughput - normalized propagation delay, a, characteristics especially for large values of a. It is found that delay - throughput comparisons between Ethernet and Token Bus topologies are sensitive to the network parameters.

IFCT protocol employs two schedules to avoid transmission interference. The first schedule assigns different frame number to neighboring clusters so that neighboring clusters could collect their member's data during different frames, avoiding inter-cluster interference. The second schedule allocates different slots to cluster members and they sending their data to their respectively cluster heads during different slots to avoid intra-cluster interference. Simulation results show that IFCT performs better than HEED, which is a clustering protocol based on TDMA. In addition, IFCT is more practical than HEED which uses CDMA code to avoid inter-cluster interference for deploying large-scale wireless sensor networks.	interference (communication)	Hai-gang Gong;Ming Liu;Xiaomin Wang;Lijun Chen;Li Xie	2006		10.1007/11814856_22	communications protocol;code division multiple access;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;biological classification;computer science;operating system;wireless network;leader election;distributed computing;cluster analysis;computer security;sensor array;time division multiple access	Embedded	0.09621230764350383	75.35523411582308	42014

Recent evolution of wireless networks makes events flow from tiny sensor networks to Internet scale peer-to-peer systems among event broker grids. This new paradigm requires composition of events in heterogeneous network environments, where time synchronization and network conditions vary. Most extant approaches to define event correlation lack a formal mechanism to define complex temporal relationships among correlated events. Here, we introduce generic composite events semantics introducing interval-based semantics for event detection supporting resource-constrained environments. We precisely define complex timing constraints among correlated event instances. We discuss underlying time systems and outline real-time temporal event ordering.	event correlation;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);middleware;peer-to-peer;programming paradigm;publish–subscribe pattern;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Eiko Yoneki;Jean Bacon	2005	Third IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops	10.1109/PERCOMW.2005.27	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;complex event processing;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	DB	7.5902213802543494	75.70943503076701	42107

In duty-cycled scenarios, a sensor node can receive a message only in its active time slot, which makes it more difficult to design collision-free scheduling for broadcast operations. Recent studies in this area have focused on minimizing broadcast latency and guaranteeing that all nodes receive a broadcast message. This paper investigates the problem of Minimum Latency Broadcast Scheduling in Duty-Cycled (MLBSDC) WSNs. By using special geometric properties of independent sets of a broadcast tree, we reduce the number of transmissions, consequently reducing the possibility of collision. Allowing multiple transmissions in one working period, our proposed Latency Aware Broadcast Scheduling (LABS) scheme provides a latency-efficient broadcast schedule. Theoretical analysis proves that the scheme has the same approximation ratio and complexity as the previous best algorithm for the MLBSDC problem. Moreover, simulation shows that the new scheme achieves up to 34%, 37%, and 21% performance improvement over previous schemes, in terms of latency, number of transmissions, and energy consumption, respectively.	interrupt latency;scheduling (computing)	Duc Tai Le;Thang Le Duc;Vyacheslav V.

There are many research works on the development of a localization algorithm over three-dimensional (3D) space. Recently, the complexity-reduced 3D trilateration localization approach (COLA), simplifying the 3D computational overhead to 2D trilateration, was proposed. The method provides proper accuracy of location, but it has a high computational cost. Considering practical applications over resource constrained devices, it is necessary to strike a balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this paper, we present a novel 3D localization method based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values of four anchor nodes, which are deployed in the initial setup process. This method provides accurate location estimation results with a reduced computational cost and a smaller number of anchor nodes.	algorithm	Hwajeong Seo;Howon Kim	2012	J. Inform. and Commun.

However, there is a limitation that accurate ranging is not supported when the user altitude is low, because of geometrical and multipath effects. In this study, we investigated the application of the airborne relay-based positioning system (ARPS) to UAT, because the ARPS has the advantages of a ground-based and an airborne-based system and is well suited to the UAT frame. In a UAT-embedded ARPS, the reference stations transmit navigation signals in the ground segment and airborne relays transfer measured information in the automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) segment. To verify the feasibility of ARPS in UAT, we performed various simulations. The simulation results show that the ARPS can be operated in UAT to provide accurate positioning, although the mobility of airborne relays affects the accuracy of system.	acceptance testing;airborne ranger;automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast;embedded system;multipath propagation;positioning system;random access;relay;simulation;time of arrival;transceiver;transmitter	Kyu-Man Lee;Jaesung Lim;Sunju Choi	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427080	estimation;telecommunications;mathematical model;statistics;transceiver	Mobile	23.468866903683914	76.90815737270994	42207

The proposed communication framework incorporates the following two things: a new concept of wireless home network architecture and a new routing technique in an effort to improve wireless communication coverage and end-to-end seamless packet delivery respectively. First, the proposed wireless home network architecture based on the End-to-end Seamless multi-hop COnnectivity based on Dual-mode (ESCOD) integrates infrastructure and ad hoc modes in an IEEE 802.11-based wireless home network. Second, the Virtual Link Routing (VLR) technique, a kind of ad hoc routing protocols working on the layer 2.5, provides mobile nodes with end-to-end seamless connectivity and packet delivery. We compare the performance of VLR with two prominent on-demand routing protocols for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV), in the ESCOD-based wireless home network. Experiments show that our communication framework incorporating the VLR technique in the ESCOD-based wireless home network architecture yields efficient performance in terms of the low failure rate of packet transmission, fast packet transmission time, network throughput, and a wider coverage area of wireless home networks.

The interconnection between stages is a generalized shuffle pattern. We derive sufficient conditions for strictly nonblocking operation and suggest the potential for wide application of these networks by providing several special case results. q 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In our previous work, we showed that when the network lifetime is defined as the time for the first node failure due to battery depletion, the total transmit power is not the only measure of power-efficiency. We proved that either maximum transmit power or link longevity plays a crucial role in extending the network lifetime. In this paper, we compare the performance of four known power-efficient algorithms (and their variants) not only in terms of the total transmit power but also in terms of other performance measures such as static network lifetime, total receive and interference power, and maximum and average hop count which have direct impacts on physical, link, and MAC layers and on end-to-end network delay.	algorithm;depletion region;end-to-end principle;heuristic (computer science);interference (communication);multicast;relay;routing;simulation;spectral efficiency;transmitter;tree (data structure)	Intae Kang;Radha Poovendran	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258267	electromagnetic interference;routing;electrical efficiency;energy conservation;performance engineering;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;efficiency;node;network delay;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	8.985756233358229	85.51465571608301	42261
ae8d9c5a25360426f395e21d41e5bd7a7de09880	are proximity attacks a threat to the security of split manufacturing of integrated circuits?	pins;metals;routing;wires;place and route;foundries;split manufacturing;benchmark testing	Split manufacturing is a technique that allows manufacturing the transistor-level and lower metal layers of an IC at a high-end, untrusted foundry, while manufacturing only the higher metal layers at a smaller, trusted foundry. Using split manufacturing is only viable if the untrusted foundry cannot reverse engineer the higher metal layer connections (and thus the overall IC design) from the lower layers. This work studies the effectiveness of proximity attack as a key step to reverse engineer a design at the untrusted foundry. We propose and study different proximity attacks based on how a set of candidates are defined for each broken connection. The attacks use both placement and routing information along with factors which capture the router's behavior such as per-layer routing congestion. Our studies are based on designs having millions of nets routed across 9 metal layers and significant layer-by-layer wire size variation. Our results show that a common, Hamming Distance-based proximity attack seldom achieves a match rate over 5%. But our proposed attack yields a relatively-small list of candidates which often contains the correct match. Finally, we propose a procedure to artificially insert routing blockages in a design at a desired split level, without causing any area overhead, in order to trick the router to make proximity-based reverse engineering significantly more challenging.	hamming distance;integrated circuit design;network congestion;overhead (computing);place and route;reverse engineering;router (computing);routing;transistor	Jonathon Maga&#x00F1;a;Daohang Shi;Jackson Melchert;Azadeh Davoodi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1145/2966986.2967006	embedded system;benchmark;routing;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;place and route;forensic engineering;computer security;engineering drawing	EDA	12.768676577313768	61.61922157217884	42286

Recently, different Geographic Distance Routing (GEDIR) protocols have been suggested in the literature. These protocols focus on reducing the forwarding region towards destination to select the Next Hop Vehicles (NHV). Most of these protocols suffer from the problem of elevated one-hop link disconnection, high end-to-end delay and low throughput even at normal vehicle speed in high vehicle density environment. This paper proposes a Geographic Distance Routing protocol based on Segment vehicle, Link quality and Degree of connectivity (SLD-GEDIR). The protocol selects a reliable NHV using the criteria segment vehicles, one-hop link quality and degree of connectivity. The proposed protocol has been simulated in NS-2 and its performance has been compared with the state-of-the-art protocols: P-GEDIR, J-GEDIR and V-GEDIR. The empirical results clearly reveal that SLD-GEDIR has lower link disconnection and end-to-end delay, and higher throughput as compared to the state-of-the-art protocols. It should be noted that the performance of the proposed protocol is preserved irrespective of vehicle density and speed.	biologic preservation;drug vehicle;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;gene regulatory networks;geographic routing;geographical distance;hoc (programming language);hop;n-alanyl-leucyl-alanyl-leucyl-doxorubicin;psf1 replication protein, mouse;particle swarm optimization;protocols documentation;sld resolution;simulation;throughput	Omprakash Kaiwartya;Sushil Kumar;D.

Efficient communication among various departments helps in reducing the delay caused for the transportation. In this paper, a novel routing protocol is proposed for routing the information about containers to different departments in ports so as to decrease the delay in transportation and hence increase the efficiency of port management.#R##N#In the proposed work, a wireless network of all the departments in ports is formed, which have sensors acting as routers, radio frequency identification (RFID)-tagged containers as end devices and personal area network (PAN)  center. RFID readers read the information from RFID-tagged containers and pass information to the routers which in turn communicate with other routers for performing the tasks. For efficient communication to happen, a cluster-based routing algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm is analyzed in a simulation environment using network simulator and is found to have good performance in terms of delay and hop count when compared to the existing hierarchical tree routing protocol.	logistics;routing	J.

A new type of a decentralized clustering problem for networks is studied in this paper. The so called decentralized packet clustering (DPC) problem is to find for a set of packets that are send around in a network a clustering where the clustering has to be done by the routers without using neither much computational power nor a large amount of memory. Further, no direct information transfer between the routers is allowed. We investigate the behavior of a type of decentralized k-means algorithm $called DPClust - for the DPC problem. DPClust has also some similarities with ant based clustering algorithms. We investigate the clustering behavior DPClust for different cluster problems and for networks that consist of several subnetworks so that there is only a limited amount of packet exchange between the subnetworks. A dynamic situation where the packet exchange rates varies over time is also considered. The proposed DPC problem leads to further interesting research problems for network clustering.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);cluster analysis;computation;deferred procedure call;heuristic (computer science);international parallel and distributed processing symposium;k-means clustering;network packet;network topology;router (computing)	Daniel Merkle;Martin Middendorf;Alexander Scheidler	2004	18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 2004.

First, a fusion architecture is developed to make use of multiple observations from the different positioning algorithms and by employing this architecture, more than 20 percent reduction in the mean distance error is achieved. Additionally, a novel online training method is employed to estimate the covariance of the observations to achieve further improvement.	algorithm;experiment;location-based service;rss;spaces;teaching method	Lei Wang;Lawrence Wai-Choong Wong	2011	2011 8th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2011.6173619	telecommunications;computer science;maximum likelihood;statistics;computer network	Robotics	20.61020585432551	74.23168631099331	42554

Iterative TDOA method is used for its high accuracy and good robustness. Since the performance of iteration method depends highly on the initial estimation, the proposed method uses the location information from PM to estimate initial value. There is no need to change the hardware of MS. PM's results and other data such as received signal value, time delay are measured by using diagnostic monitoring (DM) software in real environment. The results show that proposed method can provide a better accuracy and outperforms a conventional PM algorithm.	algorithm;broadcast delay;global positioning system;iteration;multilateration;pattern matching;sentinel value	Dilshod Akbarov;Sunmi Kim;Yongwan Park;Gyuyoung Han	2007		10.1145/1378063.1378108	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;multilateration;pattern matching;pcell;iterative method;mobile station;fdoa;gpsone	Robotics	21.857413186019922	73.45767433742127	42565

The proposed algorithm prefers, to include to the CDS, a covered node that has the largest NSI value. A covered node is eligible for inclusion into the NSI-CDS if it has at least one uncovered neighbor node. Through extensive simulations, the author observes that the NSI-CDS is significantly stable (the tradeoff being a modest increase in the CDS Node Size) and its lifetime is about 2.5-3.5 times more than the lifetime of a maximum-density based CDS (MaxD-CDS) and 1.5-2 times more than the lifetime of an ID-based CDS.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. With flooding, a source node (or the starting node) initiates the broadcast of the Route Request (RREQ) packets and these packets are forwarded exactly once by every other node to their neighbor nodes. The targeted nodes of the route discovery (referred to as destination nodes for unicasting and receiver member nodes for multicasting) choose the best path traversed by these RREQ packets, depending on their route selection principles, and send a Route Reply (RREP) packet on the chosen path. Flooding increases the chances of discovering the optimal communication topology as the RREQ packets traverse through several routes and the destination can choose the best path among several choices. However, with flooding, the network incurs lot of control overhead in requiring each node to broadcast (even though it is done only once) the RREQ message to the neighborhood. The level of redundancy of retransmissions is such that every node in the network gets a copy of the broadcast message from each of its neighbors. Recent studies in the literature (e.g., Sinha et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2005; Sakai et al., 2008; Sheu et al., 2009; Bao & Garcia-LunaAceves, 2010) have demonstrated that a connected dominating set (CDS) of the underlying network can be used as a backbone to broadcast a message from one node to all the other nodes in the network. A CDS of a network graph is defined as the subset of the nodes in the network such that every node in the network is either in the CDS or is a neighbor of a node in the CDS. The message to be broadcast (such as a RREQ message) is forwarded only by the nodes that are part of the CDS and the nodes that are not in the CDS (referred to as the non-CDS nodes) merely receive the message from one or more neighboring CDS nodes that cover their nonCDS neighbors. The efficiency of broadcasting using a CDS lies in minimizing the number of redundant retransmissions and this depends on the number of nodes that are part of the CDS (referred to as CDS Node Size). By definition, all the nodes in the network could be considered as part of the CDS, in that case broadcasting through the CDS nodes is nothing but flooding. Hence, minimizing the CDS Node Size has been the primary objective of the algorithms proposed in this category so that we will have minimum number of redundant retransmissions. The CDS with the minimum number of nodes is referred to as a Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MCDS). Determining the MCDS for a network graph is an NP-complete problem (Cormen et al., 2001). Several heuristics have been proposed to closely approximate the optimal solution in polynomial time. The Maximum Density-based CDS (MaxD-CDS) algorithm (Meghanathan, 2006) studied in this paper is one such heuristic to minimize the CDS Node Size and is based on the strategy of preferring to include nodes that have the maximum number of uncovered neighbors as part of the CDS. In this paper, we show that aiming for the minimum number of nodes for the CDS in MANETs may not be a good strategy from a stability point of view. For a CDS to exist at any time instant, two conditions must hold: (i) The nodes that are part of the CDS must stay connected – i.e., reachable from one another directly or through one or more intermediate CDS nodes, and (ii) Each non-CDS node should have at least one CDS node as a neighbor node. In the case of a MCDS, like the MaxD-CDS studied in this paper, the CDS nodes are far away from each other as we have to cover the nonCDS nodes spanning over the entire network with minimum number of CDS nodes. Thus, there are fewer links among these MCDS nodes and these links are also vulnerable to break at any time as the physical distance between the two constituent end MCDS nodes of a link is likely to be quite close to the transmission range of the nodes. With mobility, two CDS nodes that share such a vulnerable link between them could move away from the transmission range of each other at any time. Similarly, the probability of a non-CDS node not having any of its neighbor nodes to be a MCDS node is also high as there are only few nodes that are part of the MCDS. Thus, a MCDS has to be frequently reconfigured due to failure in maintaining the above two conditions for its existence. Hence, even though broadcasting through a MCDS 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/node-stabilityindex/64226?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Communications and Social Science.

The geometric features of target vehicle and electric conductivity of the application scenarios affect the ray propagating path and path loss of ETC system. In this paper, we propose a propagation loss model for ETC system based on Ray-tracing and Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD). According to the car head appearance, we discuss the path losses for cab-over-engine and cab-behind-engine vehicles respectively. Moreover, the additional loss caused by windshield is discussed. Then, we develop a semi-practical simulation environment and an ETC wireless communication comprehensive test instrument. Finally, we analyze the effect of operating frequency, RSU antennas height, length of engine hood, and inclination angle of front windshield. In order to get a better identified performance, the OBU should be placed on the upper half of the front windshield. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the validity of the proposed path loss models.	clock rate;electronic toll collection;hood method;ray tracing (graphics);semiconductor industry;simulation;software propagation;uniform theory of diffraction	Bing Li;Qunqing Huan;Lei Zuo;Baiqiang Yin;Fengming Guo;Yigang He	2017	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine	10.1109/MITS.2017.2709880	toll;simulation;engineering;wireless;path loss;uniform theory of diffraction;windshield;diffraction;electronic toll collection;automotive engineering	Robotics	23.915679379905864	78.52629850964153	42638

The most important characteristic of vehicular networks is that they do not have a stable framework. The communication between vehicles mostly depends on the unexpected meeting. Some available data dissemination schemes, however, fail to utilize the peculiarities of vehicular networks. In this paper we propose a novel opportunistic auto-adaptive dissemination algorithm for VANETs. This algorithm takes into account the moving directions of vehicles, and it dynamically changes the number of message replicas to control the network load. It also devises rules how to inform the entering vehicles at the regional border. We evaluate our approach and the results show that our algorithm achieves a good delivery ratio with a smaller network load compared with Random Choice algorithm and Epidemic dissemination algorithm over a series of scenarios.	algorithm;hoc (programming language)	Niu Jianwen;Liu Chang;Ma Jian	2009	2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications	10.1109/NetCoM.2009.39	vehicular ad hoc network;frequency modulation;wireless ad hoc network;algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;dissemination;wireless;computer network	Visualization	4.425050659615841	85.49314538895777	42766

When an actor fails the inter-actor topology may get partitions into disjoint blocks and the application may be negatively impacted. Tolerating the actor failure and restoring the lost connectivity need to be performed while imposing the least overhead on the individual actors. In this paper a Least Distance Movement Recovery (LDMR) algorithm is proposed. LDMR is a distributed approach that exploits non cut-vertices actors in the recovery process. The idea is for a set of direct neighbours of the failed node to move toward the position of the failed node while its original position is replaced with the nearest non cut-vertex actor. The recovery process starts with the search phase where each neighbour broadcasts a message containing the failed node ID, neighbour node ID and, Time-To-Live (TTL). When a neighbour receives responses, it chooses the best candidate based on a certain criteria (e.g. distance). We compare our approach with Recovery through Inward Motion (RIM) which depends only on cascaded movements. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to validate the performance.	actor model;algorithm;biconnected component;direct inward dial;experiment;overhead (computing);simulation;time to live;transistor–transistor logic	Abdullah Alfadhly;Uthman A.

While the existing works have mostly focused on the collision avoidance among RFID-based nodes, in this work we study an orthogonal approach which focuses on how to optimally plan the movement of the reader so as to minimize the communication delay in the network. To solve this problem, we introduce both an optimal solution for the linear reader movement pattern and an approximation solution for the generic two-dimensional reader move pattern with a provable approximation ratio. In addition, we also provide a solution for guaranteeing the quality of communication while minimizing the communication delay. We verify our observations through testbed experiments and extensively evaluate our design by both emulations and large-scale simulations. The results show our design can effectively reduce communication delay in wireless rechargeable sensor networks when compared with baseline solutions.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);emulator;experiment;heuristic;inventory;low-power broadcasting;provable security;radio-frequency identification;rechargeable battery;sensor node;sensor web;simulation;testbed;wireless router	Yuanchao Shu;Peng Cheng;Yu Gu;Jiming Chen;Tian He	2014	2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990382	telecommunications;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	12.401780827309732	79.93579992520166	42792
f06352e92ba3055eb7c6abb3c07952a176feec71	design space exploration of distributed on-chip voltage regulation under stability constraint		Integrating multiple on-chip voltage regulators in a power delivery network (PDN) can offer promising improvements in both voltage regulation and power efficiency. However, the complex interactions between active regulators and the surrounding parasitic passive network create a large number of feedback loops and thus cause stability concern for the distributed regulation network. The recently emerged PDN design methodology based on the hybrid stability theory (HST) provides a unique opportunity for taming the complex PDN stability problem. However, the HST-based stability margin is unfamiliar to circuit designers, and therefore stability-constrained design intuitions are derivable. In this brief, our systematic analysis reveals unique design considerations which can significantly impact the system-level stability and performances. Within a large design space, a comprehensive set of design studies are conducted to shed light on the tradeoffs between the HST-based stability margin and other PDN design specifications such as the quiescent current consumption, maximum switching noise, and area overhead. Useful design insights like how regulator topology, passive decoupling capacitance, and the number of on-chip regulators may be optimized for improved tradeoffs between stability and system performance are discussed. These insights can aid circuit designers to make appropriate design choices at the beginning of the design process for improved system tradeoffs.	biasing;coupling (computer programming);design space exploration;feedback;interaction;overhead (computing);performance per watt;phase margin;voltage regulation;voltage regulator	Xin Zhan;Joseph Riad;Peng Li;Edgar S&#x00E1;nchez	2018	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2818079	voltage regulator;real-time computing;computer science;system on a chip;engineering design process;design space exploration;stability theory;biasing;voltage regulation;regulator	EDA	19.86646993404859	60.88767443404627	42803

In this kind of network, sensor nodes are scattered over a sensor field and they transmit information to a sink node. In this paper, we first propose the design of a proxy functionality for the sink node, which will be responsible for exchanging information with other proxy nodes by means of a new Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication infrastructure implemented using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). This infrastructure will also facilitate the distributed processing of sensing data in order to perform path planning in a vehicular traffic control application. This approach will be able to distribute the computational tasks for route calculations over the different sink nodes in the network.

In this paper we propose a probabilistic, constraint-based approach robust to range measurement inaccuracies. The proposed approach proceeds in three phases: the first phase involves modeling the uncertainties of range measurements; in the second phase, a set of probabilistic constraints are computed and combined to produce initial position estimates; in the final phase, negative constraints are used to refine the initial estimates. We evaluated the proposed approach through simulations based on real-world measurements; the results are compared with two other localization schemes and the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The results show that, for inaccurate range measurements, the proposed probabilistic approach performs the best and close to the optimal bound.	internationalization and localization;rss;robustness (computer science);simulation	Rong Peng;Mihail L.

While transmission energy can be controlled at each node, reception energy is outside the control of the nodes because they usually do not know the arrival time of their packets and they cannot avoid overhearing packets directed to the other nodes in range. Energy-aware MAC protocols apply duty-cycling which keeps the radio module off for most of the time and wakes it up periodically, but they suffer from overhearing which has been addressed so far either by means of preambles or by means of separate wake-up channels. This paper proposes a complementary approach which exploits the hardware frame filtering capabilities provided by state-of-the-art radio transceivers. Extensive experiments performed on VirtualSense motes show that hardware frame filtering saves more than 50% of the energy spent in the reception of non-intended packets.	duty cycle;experiment;interrupt;mathematical optimization;network packet;network switch;population;ti-nspire series;time of arrival;transceiver;unicast	Emanuele Lattanzi;Alessandro Bogliolo	2014	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2014.060725	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	10.159516737429142	83.97317556394256	43126

In our scheme, LET is constructed using the remaining available energy in each node. Two routing algorithms are framed based on LET: one with centralized sink node called LETCSN and the other with centralized sink node and secondary sink nodes called LETSSN. sensor nodes are deployed in some fixed patterns. A mathematical model is devised to understand the effect of node deployment pattern on improving network lifetime. Both proposed routing algorithms are evaluated with seven different deployment patterns, simulated in ns-2 and are compared with the existing classic algorithms based on the number of data packets, throughput, network lifetime, and data packet’s average network lifetime product. Our evaluation and simulation results show that LETSSN maximizes the network lifetime for all node-deployment patterns taken into consideration.	algorithm;centralized computing;experiment;mathematical model;network packet;pegasus;performance;randomness;routing;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Kalpana Murugan;Al-Sakib Khan Pathan	2016	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-015-0079-5	energy;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;tree;node;software deployment;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.729645981664081	80.8274418991811	43343

a7e1bf05ab07707194af14669ef712723c2cdf77	lte uplink interference mitigation features		Due to the proliferation of wireless technologies over the last decade, the demand for spectrum access has grown exponentially. The Department of Defense (DoD) faces increasing pressure to free up spectrum for auction to the commercial wireless industry. The recent Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) 3 auction introduced a transition approach in which the commercial Long Term Evolution (LTE) service providers could access the spectrum incrementally - with DoD coordination - as DoD transitions its systems out of the band. DoD has a responsibility to maximize spectrum access to the LTE carriers while protecting mission use of existing systems in the band. As such, the DoD has been investigating creative means to coexist with commercial LTE systems during the transition. This paper describes the testing and evaluation of various innovative LTE interference mitigation techniques that can be enabled to allow DoD to coexist more readily with commercial LTE systems. The primary techniques include LTE uplink spectrum notching/blanking for traffic channels and control channels and LTE carrier aggregation (CA) configurations. The implementation methods that different equipment vendors use to achieve these techniques are distinct from one another and proprietary, adding complexity to the evaluation. This paper provides an overview of the testing and key findings of the investigation. The results include the shape of the power spectrum for different types of notching, the practical amount of spectrum that could be made available by different CA configurations, and the application of these techniques to sharing spectrum with federal government systems.

Quality management is therefore a complicated issue and the need to identify the degree of coding degradations in terms of coding and/or transmission errors or system failures is becoming an important criterion for the evaluation of the quality of the MPEG streams. A theoretical decoder (T-STD) defines the verification process based on the proper fill level of an MPEG decoder buffers whose size is defined by the standards in order to obtain an evaluation of the MPEG stream quality. This paper describes a new embedded and programmable solution capable of analysing MPEG streams in real time. The proposed hardware architecture provides a real time continuous buffer analysis of the MPEG stream components and is composed of several modules allowing for simultaneous modeling of the various buffers of the T-STD components (video, audio or system). Real time errors flags are generated when the buffers filling level becomes illegal (overflow, empty buffer, transfer delay, etc.). The architecture has been modeled, validated and simulated using the SystemC and VHDL languages in combination with real MPEG DVB-T streams. A VHDL synthesisable model of our architecture allows an implementation on an field-programmable gate array circuit based on Altera APEX20K1000. The hardware implementation of this configurable T-STD allows a data rate of 232 Mbps and requires only 9738 logical cells and 4,7 kB memory.	data rate units;embedded system;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;formal proof;identifier;mpeg program stream;mpeg transport stream;mpeg-1;mpeg-2;moving picture experts group;programmable logic device;real-time clock;real-time computing;std bus;simulation;standard-definition television;streaming media;systemc;vhdl	Camel Tanougast;Michael Janiaut;Yves Berviller;Hassan Rabah;Serge Weber;Ahmed Bouridane	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2009254	embedded system;quality management;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;hardware architecture;field-programmable gate array	EDA	-1.2554553876289407	63.32690865641323	43542

To improve the situation, this study presents a new position-based protocol. The new protocol uses control packets to collect approaching-the-junction information and, based on the information, lets moving vehicles adapt their routing paths dynamically when arriving at a junction. Compared with existing protocols which pre-store massive routing paths in a vehicle, the protocol can accurately relay packets to the destination by significantly reduced control packets. Transmission efficiency is therefore enhanced. Performance evaluation exhibits that the proposed protocol is suitable for practice in highly topology-changing vehicle-to-vehicle environments because it can accurately select targets for packet relay at less routing and storage cost.	hoc (programming language);routing	Po-Jen Chuang;Tzu-Lun Huang	2015	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2014.0699	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.169498281343685	83.98232590199846	43606

In contrast to previous papers which considered competitive algorithms for packet scheduling, we consider the packet routing problem (output port selection in a node). We model the node routing problem as follows: a node has an arbitrary number of input ports and an arbitrary number of output queues. At each time unit, an arbitrary number of new packets may arrive, each packet is associated with a subset of the output ports (which correspond to the next edges on the allowed paths for the packet). Each output queue transmits packets in some arbitrary manner. Arrival and transmission are arbitrary and controlled by an adversary. The node routing algorithm has to route each packet to one of the allowed output ports, without exceeding the size of the queues. The goal is to maximize the number of the transmitted packets. In this paper, we show that all non-refusal algorithms are 2-competitive. Our main result is an almost optimal e e−1 ≈ 1.58-competitive algorithm, for a large enough queue size. For packets with arbitrary values (allowing preemption) we present a 2-competitive algorithm for any queue size.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;network packet;packet switching;preemption (computing);routing;scheduling (computing);throughput	Yossi Azar;Yoel Chaiutin	2006		10.1007/11672142_49	routing;real-time computing;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;preemption;packet switch;scheduling;queue;packet switching	Theory	-3.4077221561448403	72.95227428326258	43639

Therefore, it is essential to establish a communication network that can operate when there is no power or infrastructure. In this paper, we focus on Satellite/Solar-powered Mesh Integrated Networks (SMIN), which are composed of a communication satellite, Earth Stations (ESs) and solar-powered Mesh Routers (MRs). A SMIN can connect to external networks via satellite and provide communication services in a large area through the wireless mesh network (WMN). To maximize the amount of communication traffic from the WMN, we aim to optimize the number of ESs and its deployment. When the number of ESs increases, the hop count between a MR and its closest ES decreases, thus resulting in an improved connectivity in the route. However, since the ESs share the bandwidth of satellite, allocated bandwidth to each ES decreases as the number of ESs increases. Therefore, we aim to optimize the number and deployment pattern of ESs. Additionally, we validate the amount of aggregated traffic that can be sent to the satellite through numerical analysis.	access network;bandwidth (signal processing);communications satellite;loss function;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;numerical analysis;optimization problem;software deployment;telecommunications network;throughput;wireless mesh network	Shin Alexandre Koseki;Hiroki Nishiyama;Nei Kato;Byeongpyo Jeong;Morio Toyoshima	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248425	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;telecommunications;mesh networking;shared mesh;order one network protocol;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-4.101646625821296	84.68317599127927	43773

We also identify the primary challenges that need to be addressed when using multiple-gateway associations, and propose solutions to handle these challenges.	fairness measure;hercules graphics card;internet backbone;mesh networking;mobile device;wireless mesh network	Sriram Lakshmanan;Raghupathy Sivakumar;Karthikeyan Sundaresan	2006	2006 2nd IEEE Workshop on Wireless Mesh Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2008.07.005	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;shared mesh;order one network protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-2.846190159456099	85.0531364425058	43777
ce8f1e43291725b5ab2cbc5d9e27eeb76e7fce25	broadcasting messages in the internet of vehicles		Vehicular networks are receiving more and more attention from researchers and practitioners. In this context, it is particularly interesting to study realistic scenarios where vehicles are connected among themselves, or with other nodes. Think, for instance, of cooperating interconnecting objects forming an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to collectively decide on maneuvers. Such connected autonomous vehicles would certainly require fast but also reliable group communications. Broadcast in wireless networks would be useful in this scenario if a tradeoff between reliable message delivery and low overhead can be solved. To this aim, we evaluate the performance of probabilistic flooding schemes and propose a heuristic-based solution that seems promising in fitting the IoV's needs.		Armir Bujari;Claudio E.

In split manufacturing, a design house (with a low-end, in-house, trusted foundry) fabricates the Front End Of Line (FEOL) layers (transistors and lower metal layers) in advanced technology nodes at an untrusted high-end foundry. The Back End Of Line (BEOL) layers (higher metal layers) are then fabricated at the design house's trusted low-end foundry. Split manufacturing is considered secure (prevents reverse engineering and IC piracy) as it hides the BEOL connections from an attacker in the FEOL foundry. We show that an attacker in the FEOL foundry can exploit the heuristics used in typical floorplanning, placement, and routing tools to bypass the security afforded by straightforward split manufacturing. We developed an attack where an attacker in the FEOL foundry can connect 96% of the missing BEOL connections correctly. To overcome this security vulnerability in split manufacturing, we developed a fault analysis-based defense. This defense improves the security of split manufacturing by deceiving the FEOL attacker into making wrong connections.	back end of line;floorplan (microelectronics);front end of line;heuristic (computer science);integrated circuit;outsourcing;place and route;reverse engineering;routing;semiconductor device fabrication;transistor;vulnerability (computing)	Jeyavijayan Rajendran;Ozgur Sinanoglu;Ramesh Karri	2013	2013 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)			EDA	12.719278758548226	61.66273277051272	43816

To prolong the lifetime of MANETs, one is forced to attain the tradeoff of minimizing the energy consumption and load balancing. In MANETs, energy waste resulting from retransmission due to high frame error rate (FER) of wireless channel is significant. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol termed error-aware candidate set routing protocol (ECSRP). ECSRP chooses a route in a candidate subset in the route cache in which all the nodes have enough residual battery power. This approach avoids overusing certain routes. If multiple routes exist in the candidate set, ECSRP employs a metric achieving the tradeoff between energy-efficiency and load balancing to select the optimal route. It also takes channel condition into consideration by incorporating packet loss probability in the computation of energy consumption. This helps to reduce the number of retransmissions and save energy. We evaluate the performance of ECSRP under the Gilbert error model. Simulation results demonstrate that ECSRP outperforms the representative protocol conditional min-max battery cost routing (CMMBCR) protocol in terms of total energy consumption and load balancing.	computation;gilbert cell;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);multistage interconnection networks;network packet;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation;transmitter	Liansheng Tan;Peng Yang;Sammy Chan	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317903	wireless routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.308270780199553	82.94819405211396	43927

WLAN fingerprinting is a compelling technique because it builds upon existing infrastructure and client hardware available in off-the-shelf mobile devices. We evaluate different methods for WLAN fingerprint classification with a focus on on-device localization. The main scientific contribution of this approach is that any Android based device can localize itself (without any server being able to determine the current location) using existing WLAN infrastructure (no additional access points have to be installed, the firmware of existing access points doesn't have to be changed). This approach was chosen to make indoor localization feasible in non-academic use cases. With a functional implementation and a simple procedure for collecting WLAN fingerprints, we currently achieve an accuracy of 4m in 90% of all cases with a mean error of only 2.2m when the same device is used for training and testing. Next steps are calibration between different mobile devices, post-processing in terms of movement, and automatic downloading of the required WLAN fingerprint databases on a global scale.	android;database;download;fingerprint (computing);firmware;mobile app;mobile device;server (computing);video post-processing;wireless access point	Peter Riedl;René Mayrhofer	2012	2012 32nd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops	10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.26	embedded system;fingerprint;computer science;database;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	19.177528858776657	72.43228368256437	43961

Modern MANET routing techniques can swamp the limited bandwidth of ground-based tactical networks while legacy techniques are inefficient. In this paper, we expand on our previous work using a cross-layered approach and propose a new technique for Multicast Enhanced Opportunistic Routing (MEOR). MEOR makes per-packet forwarding decisions based only on pre-set domain knowledge, information from lower layers, and information encoded in individual packets. Because this technique does not build or maintain any topology state, it has no network layer overhead. MEOR has been simulated in Qualnet and compared to Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF), classic flooding, and local broadcast in large and small tactical scenarios. MEOR was found superior in terms of packet delivery rates and overhead.	data domain;defense in depth (computing);multicast;network packet;overhead (computing);routing	David Kidston;Minghui Shi	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415705	policy-based routing;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;multicast;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;protocol independent multicast;engineering;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;ip forwarding;distributed computing;packet forwarding;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;geographic routing;xcast;computer network	Mobile	1.8584863360640702	84.65547144216683	43972

However, existing QoS routing algorithms are not very efficient and effective at finding such path. Moreover, few works focus on two or more QoS constraints. In this paper, we propose an effective fully polynomial approximation scheme (FPAS) for multiconstrainted path optimal problem based on the technique of auxiliary graph construction. By employing the nonlinear definition of the path constraint and limited iteration of the FPAS itself, our FPAS can not only achieve the complexity reduction but generate a preferable path as well. We further analyze the Markov properties of the entire network and obtain some key parameters to reflect the routing characteristic. We experiment with different scale of random networks and compare our FPAS against previous well known studies. Our results show that FPAS can find path with lower complexity and better quality.	algorithm;database server;flow network;iteration;markov chain;markov property;nonlinear system;polynomial;polynomial-time approximation scheme;precomputation;quality of service;reduction (complexity);requirement;routing;software deployment;time complexity;type of service	Jun Huang;Xiaohong Huang;Yan Ma	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683581	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quality of service;computer science;graph theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	-4.162874515660784	81.99410631300013	43983
3005304b1c86d5005e1977c57064fc2741c300ef	adaptive fault-tolerant routing in 2d mesh with cracky rectangular model	mathematics	This paper mainly focuses on routing in two-dimensional mesh networks. We propose a novel faulty block model, which is cracky rectangular block, for fault-tolerant adaptive routing. All the faulty nodes and faulty links are surrounded in this type of block, which is a convex structure, in order to avoid routing livelock. Additionally, the model constructs the interior spanning forest for each block in order to keep in touch with the nodes inside of each block. The procedure for block construction is dynamically and totally distributed. The construction algorithm is simple and ease of implementation. And this is a fully adaptive block which will dynamically adjust its scale in accordance with the situation of networks, either the fault emergence or the fault recovery, without shutdown of the system. Based on this model, we also develop a distributed fault-tolerant routing algorithm. Then we give the formal proof for this algorithm to guarantee that messages will always reach their destinations if and only if the destination nodes keep connecting with these mesh networks. So the new model and routing algorithm maximize the availability of the nodes in networks. This is a noticeable overall improvement of fault tolerability of the system.	routing	Yang Yi;Meirun Chen;Hao Li;Lian Li	2014	J.

Several methods from recent advancements are compared for their capability to correctly build the multivariate distribution for profiling. Attack performance shows greater than 98% success rate with as few as 100 training and test traces. In 8 out of 9 test cases examined, linear regression attacks using the coefficient of determination R, adjusted coefficient of determination 2 a R and correlation power analysis (CPA) performed better than or equal to the original stochastic attack and attack using the symmetry metric. Our new method using 2 a R is proven to suppress unimportant variables and enhance important ones better than other methods. It is successful when the microcontrollers and data collection hardware differ between training and test phases and is found to be more effective in noisy environments than CPA.	byte;coefficient of determination;encryption;experiment;information leakage;key (cryptography);microcontroller;profiling (computer programming);signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;test case;tracing (software);visual intercept	Hiren J.

Effective support for real-time as well as high throughput applications requires a TDMAbased approach. However, multihop TDMA implementations in wireless have been few and far-between, and for good reasons. These present significant issues in terms of time synchronization, TDMA schedule dissemination, multichannel support, routing integration, spatial reuse and so on. And achieving these efficiently, in the face of wireless channel losses presents a formidable challenge. In this work, we present an implementation of LiT MAC, a full-fledged multihop TDMA MAC, on commodity WiFi platforms. We undertake extensive evaluations using microbenchmarks as well as application level performance, using outdoor as well as indoor testbeds. We also present an integration of LiT MAC with various routing metrics, and a routing stability study of recently proposed routing metrics (ROMA, SLIQ). Our results show that we can achieve μs granularity time synchronization across several hops, and TDMA slot size as small as 2 ms. These imply low control overheads. Experiments over several days, on our nine-node outdoor testbed shows that LiT MAC's soft-state-based approach is effective in robust operation even in the presence of significant external interference.	byte;catastrophic interference;etx (form factor);experiment;interference (communication);mpeg multichannel;maxima and minima;mesh networking;packet delay variation;persistence (computer science);real-time clock;representation oligonucleotide microarray analysis;requirement;routing;soft state;sparse matrix;spatial multiplexing;surround sound;testbed;throughput;uncompressed video;wireless mesh network	Vishal Sevani;Bhaskaran Raman;Piyush Joshi	2014	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.251	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-0.7569780886953091	87.32714303600743	44076

In this paper we present a framework to develop an insight into the characteristics of push-pull protocols. The performance of push-pull protocols is critically dependent on the timeout settings used to trigger failure recovery mechanisms. We perform a study of how to choose optimal timeouts to achieve best performance and use these timeouts to simulate and compare various push-pull protocols. Our starting point is a recently proposed SPIN-based protocol, called shortest-path minded SPIN (SPMS), in which meta-data negotiations take place prior to data exchange in order to minimize the number of data transmissions, thereby improving in both energy and delay compared to SPIN. We propose a redesign of SPMS, called SPMS-Rec, which reduces the energy expended in the event of failures by requiring intermediate relay nodes to try alternate routes. Our simulation results show that SPMS-Rec outperforms SPMS, and thus SPIN, yielding energy savings while reducing the delay when multiple nodes fail along a route. We further propose a modification to SPMS-Rec through request suppression which helps in reducing redundant data transmissions.	relay;spin;shortest path problem;simulation;timeout (computing);zero suppression	Ravish Khosla;Xuan Zhong;Gunjan Khanna;Saurabh Bagchi;Edward Ij.

The main aim of the research work is finding the optimum number of input server connections while minimizing the number of rejected requests according to a specific maximum number of expected calls in a specific time-interval, i.e. at peak-hour. With the results obtained we wish to model and optimize the planning and the dimensioning of the processing server as well as reduce the costs of this, since hiring an input line actually presents quite a substantial cost. Therefore it is necessary to first determine how many input connections are needed to serve a certain quota of users at a specific moment by using the methods of statistical modeling. On the basis of obtained results we can then assess whether a certain segment has too many or not enough input connections. The objective of the presented multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) simulator is to raise the level and the quality of service and at the same time lower the costs of hiring input connections. This paper presents the key segments composing the call and server system (ordinary, lamer and dummy caller model, statistical Gaussian curve of calls distribution, mechanisms of accepting and rejecting calls, management of input connections capacity, random call triggering, etc.). The above-mentioned segments represent the models and the sub-models of the simulator. They have been derived using the methods of statistical modeling. The optimum solution can be found manually or automatically using the method of automation of simulation runs and incrementing/decrementing the parameter of the number of input connections into the system. Searching the optimum number of input connections manually is an entirely empirical method, where the user manually changes the mentioned parameter, and is looking for a scenario in which the result of the simulator regarding the number of rejected calls is minimal. With an automatic search the simulator automatically generates the number of runs with incrementing and decrementing the mentioned parameter in each, and thus automatically finds the optimum solution. This paper also presents an automatic analysis of simulation runs and a statistical final report, which includes a conclusion on the results obtained in different scenarios.	algorithm;chi;dummy variable (statistics);mimo;mathematical optimization;neuron;quality of service;server (computing);simulation;statistical model;television;universal turing machine	Sasa Klampfer;Bojan Kotnik;Janja Svecko;Zdenko Mezgec;Joze Mohorko;Amor Chowdhury	2011	Simulation	10.1177/0037549710392936	normal distribution;planning;input/output;statistical model;simulation;systems modeling;reduction;transaction processing;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;automation;empirical research;dimensioning;service quality;statistics		4.176988266339135	66.69285727988024	44134

We considered all-optical rearrangeable permutation routing for Clos networks. The signal in the optical switch with the same wavelength will cause the crosstalk problem, so our proposed algorithm is to rearrange the same wavelength signals, so that no duplicate wavelength in any single middle switch. To avoid wavelength crosstalk, we use wavelength domain approach, and then to solve blocking condition by space domain approach.	algorithm;blocking (computing);clos network;crosstalk;multistage amplifier;multistage interconnection networks;network switch;optical switch;random permutation;routing	Ming-Jye Lee;Chi-Chang Chen;Chien-Ning Yeh	2008	Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)	10.1109/ITNG.2008.148	computer science;distributed computing;optical switch;information technology;computer network	EDA	-1.2862503710099742	71.36559136104032	44140

In such conditions Non-Line-of-Sight links which support the traffic from many Small Cells will be common. However, the authors have tested that current under-6 GHz wireless backhaul solutions performance is in some circumstances poor, in particular in the case Non-Line-of-Sight propagation or when the link is interfered by other users operating in the same band. This paper highlights the need of improving the physical and medium access control layers of the wireless backhaul interfaces, and properly tuning the interference detection and channel selection procedures, in order meet telecom industry reliability and quality of service demands.	backhaul (telecommunications)	Luis Cucala Garcia;Pedro Olmos Gonzalez	2013		10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583370	telecommunications;wireless network;computer network	HCI	24.461927514057276	84.97011196127019	44145

The trade-off in these protocols is the control packet overhead and the retransmission cost due to collision without it. In this paper we evaluate the collision probability of a CSMA/CA MAC protocol in an unsaturated situation as a function of nodes' sampling and transmission rates. We provide an accurate and comprehensive analytical model in which a finite number of nodes exist. We assume an ideal channel condition, independent collision probability of packets as well as infrequent communication between sensor nodes. We will demonstrate that the collision probability changes from 0 to 0.22 as the sampling rate changes from 0 to 0.94Mbps. Moreover, we will demonstrate that collision only begins after the sampling rate reaches 0.31Mbps, which implies that for a sampling rate below this threshold, the control overhead can be avoided by altogether avoiding the collision avoidance mechanism.	access control;network packet;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);sampling (signal processing)	Qian Dong;Waltenegus Dargie	2010		10.1145/1774088.1774247	collision domain;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.5259084823105	84.90777457351972	44235

Group multicasting is a generalization of multicasting whereby every member of a group is allowed to multicast messages to other members that belong to the same group. The routing problem in this case involves the construction of a set of low cost multicast trees with bandwidth requirements, one for each member of the group for multicasting messages to other members of the group. In this paper, we examine this routing problem with an additional requirement that member nodes are allowed to join and leave the multicasting group anytime during a session. We call this problem, the dynamic group multicast routing problem (DGMRP). In this paper, we proposed three heuristic algorithms to generate a set of low cost multicast trees with dynamic group membership. Results from our empirical study shows that the one of the proposed algorithms, called Maximum bandwidth bottleneck path selection algorithm (MBBPS), achieves better utilization of bandwidth resources as compared with the other two algorithms which are based on a greedy approach. In addition MBBPS performs better in terms of cost when the bandwidth is not sufficient in the network.

Mobility, dynamic links and some other influential parameters in this self-configurable network have made routing more difficult in contrast with static networks. Ant Colony optimization with a similar structure to MANET is a biological inspired algorithm that has led to many Ant Routing Algorithm (ARA) in MANET during 10 recent years. However each ARA is created for a specific condition or improving specific parameter. In this paper we propose an intelligent algorithm that in each condition selects an appropriate ARA. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is significantly better over exiting ARA for routing in MANET.	algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;application release automation;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;quality of service;routing;simulation	Gholamhasan Sajedy Abkenar;Mohammad Shokouhifar;Abbas SajediAbkenar	2011	2011 Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Telecommunication Systems and Networks (ANTS)	10.1109/ANTS.2011.6163665	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Robotics	5.850399626667851	82.58069000464266	44273

Usually, a verification approach operates in three steps: it divides the network into verification areas, triggers an anomaly detection algorithm for those areas, and finally generates CM undo requests for the abnormally performing ones. Those requests set CM parameters to a previous stable state. However, the successful completion of this process can be quite challenging, since there are factors that might negatively impact its outcome. For instance, if a temporal degradation occurs during the optimization of a cell, a verification mechanism may wrongly assume that it is anomalous, and interrupt the optimization process. Furthermore, a verification strategy experiences difficulties when it faces verification collisions, i.e., conflicting undo requests that cannot be simultaneously deployed. At first, it has to determine whether the collision is a false positive one. Then, it has to resolve it by finding out which requests have the highest probability of restoring the network performance. In addition, it needs to consider the time that is given for rolling back CM changes. In this paper, we contribute to the area of SON verification by providing a solution that addresses those problems. Our approach makes use of constraint optimization techniques to resolve collisions as well as find the appropriate order for deploying undo requests. In addition, we use a minimum spanning tree-based clustering technique to eliminate false positive collisions.

In this architecture, all nodes are classified into stationary nodes and mobile nodes according to the functionality of each node. Mobile nodes are usually battery-powered, and therefore need low-power operation. In order to improve power consumption of mobile nodes, effective handover sequence based on MAC broadcast and transmission power control based on LQ (link quality) are employed. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed architecture, communication time and power consumption of mobile nodes can be reduced by 1.2 seconds and 42.8%, respectively.	letter-quality printer;low-power broadcasting;mobile device;stationary process	Kenji Watanabe;Masanao Ise;Takao Onoye;Hiroaki Niwamoto;Ikuo Keshi	2007	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2007.339513	embedded system;broadcast communication network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;efficient energy use;computer network	Mobile	11.725533870505842	86.03649262605914	44348
5de031635d27ddcfa2588fd8293eafdf07b25ab5	a hybrid adaptive dissemination solution based on geographic distance for vehicular ad hoc networks		Increasing amount of vehicles are being equipped with embedded sensors, processing and wireless communication capabilities. This has opened a myriad of possibilities for varying applications on safety, public collaboration and participation. Message dissemination is one of the many fundamental services in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). For this purpose, in this paper we describe HADD, a hybrid adaptive dissemination protocol based on geographic distance. Contrary to other existing approaches that focus exclusively on always-connected networks, it is designed to operate under any kind of road traffic condition. We propose a new geographic-based broadcast suppression strategy to broadcast the message waiting in the local buffer queue to other vehicles. Finally, HADD employs a rate control scheme that sets the pace at which messages must be transmitted according to the perceived network data traffic, thus avoiding channel overloading. Hence, HADD adapts not only to the varying road traffic condition, but also to the perceived wireless channel quality. When compared to two related and well-accepted protocols under Manhattan grid scenarios, we show that, overall, HADD is more reliable and efficient in terms of message delivery.	hoc (programming language)	Qi Fu;Anhua Chen;Yunxia Jiang;Zhigang Chen;Yankai Song	2017		10.1007/978-981-10-6893-5_22	vehicular ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;computer network;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless;ad hoc wireless distribution service;computer science;wireless ad hoc network;communication channel	Mobile	5.052612636322348	87.42095645494976	44353

In wireless networks, the channels are often subject to random variations that limit the reliability of communications between any two radios. Geographic transmission strategies can improve the performance in such networks by allowing any of a transmitter’s neighbors that successfully receive a transmission and are in the direction of the packet’s destination to forward the packet to the destination. However, requiring all of the radios in a network to keep their receivers on to receive geographic transmissions will significantly shorten the network lifetime by depleting the energy of the radios in the network. In this work, we investigate an optimal strategy for deciding which neighbors of a transmitter should activate to try to recover a transmission. We find a solution to this problem by solving for a related measure in a constrained optimization problem. We present results that compare the performances of the optimal approach, our previous suboptimal efforts, and a conventional approach.	activation function;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;performance;transmitter	Murali Rao;Tathagata D.

How to keep caching consistency efficiently is a very important issue. In this paper, a dynamic tree-based consistency scheme of cooperative caching, called DTCS, is proposed to address this issue. The nodes in MANET that host cooperative caches are organized into a ring with chord as group management protocol. A virtual binary tree, called chord tree, can be computed from the ring and then be adjusted into a temporary updating tree according to the location and routing information of the MANET nodes when an updating data item appears. The updated data item can be transmitted along the updating tree from the source nodes to the nodes hosting cooperative caches. The updating tree is released once the updated data item has been transmitted so that it is not necessary to keep the tree all time in nodes. The chord ring is not affected by the dynamic topology due to the moving of nodes, and the updated tree may decreases mismatch with the physical topology. The effect of nodes density, network scale, nodes' mobility, updating data size, signal propagating distance and number of cooperative nodes are analyzed in the simulation experiment. The simulation results also demonstrate the scheme outperforms the Gossip-based multicast protocol for consistency of cooperative caching with less workload, higher success rate of updating and less updating time.	binary tree;cache (computing);data item;experiment;gossip protocol;hoc (programming language);link/cut tree;multicast;overhead (computing);requirement;routing;simulation;tree (data structure);uniform driver interface	Gaogang Xie;Zhenyu Li;Jianing Chen;Yifen Wei;Valérie Issarny;Alberto Conte	2007	Third IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob 2007)	10.1109/WIMOB.2007.28	real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	2.9088593540420917	81.51368238243643	44555

Natural phenomena tend to match wireless sensor network (WSN) responses closely. Such synchronization is vital for the proper coordination of power cycles for energy conservation. A large number of fireflies employ the principle of pulse-coupled oscillators for light flash emission to attract mating partners. With respect to WSNs, the nodes are generally unable to afford packet transmission and reception simultaneously, thus preventing complete network synchronization. This paper presents a literature overview concerning the impact of the deafness problem on clock synchronization in a WSN. Data transmission based on synchronization can also be ensured through the optimization of energy usage periodic data capturing in a WSN. This study serves as a useful information source of clock synchronization to assist WSN researchers and novices in obtaining a better understanding of the impact of the deafness problem on clock synchronization and to enable them to promote effective designs and systems that address this problem.	automatic identification and data capture;clock synchronization;information source;mathematical optimization;network packet;power cycling;spontaneous order	Zeyad Ghaleb Al-Mekhlafi;Zurina Mohd Hanapi;Mohamed Othman;Zuriati Zukarnain;Fazirulhisyam Hashim;Ahmed M.

The protocol analyzed in this paper is based on an existing protocol which can schedule unicast and multicast traffic. The packet distance, determined by the Euclidean distance of session length and the group size of a multicast distance is compared with the multicast distance to select the most appropriate scheduling method for multicast packets. Further comparisons on channel utilization and packet delay show that the session length affects the channel dominance significantly and the group size determines the range of multicast distance such that the performances will remain the same. In addition, multicast traffic with larger mean session length or mean group size will make some specific scheduling strategies fail to achieve optimal performance. If the multicast distance is properly chosen, performance tradeoffs can be made under multicasting environments with large session length or large group size.	multicast;profiling (computer programming);unicast;wavelength-division multiplexing	Wen-Yu Tseng;Chuan-Ching Sue;Sy-Yen Kuo	1999		10.1109/ISCC.1999.780769	communications protocol;link state packet;intelligent network;protocol;multicast;ip multicast;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;size of groups, organizations, and communities;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;euclidean distance;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;scheduling;broadcasting;packet switching;xcast;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network;multicast address;unicast	Metrics	0.5899444882216709	86.1474218280049	44678

It prolongs the life expectancy and improves the quality of life by enabling remote health monitoring. Despite many advantages, it may result and exacerbates various extant health issues especially in the context of mobile multimedia. Due to high data rate of mobile multimedia applications, heat generated from sensor devices is considerably high and results in thermal dissipation. The thermal impact of sensors on human body has largely been a neglected topic. The paper rigorously analyzes the specific absorption rate (SAR) impact on human body. Moreover, the paper largely contributes by comprehensively evaluating SAR impact under various circumstances and dependency factors.

9622186419b9a0fb97eae97dc0f59410c0dd7d48	nroar: near real-time opportunistic spectrum access and management in cloud-based database-driven cognitive radio networks		Cognitive radio network with spectrum sensing to find idle channels and access them opportunistically is regarded as an emerging technology to deal with spectrum scarcity caused by exclusive licensing to primary systems. Simulation-based studies loose practical relevance due to assumptions and usage of simple models for defining transmission regions, multi-path propagation, and traffic intensity. In this paper, we present an experimental study for near real-time spectrum sensing and opportunistic spectrum access in database-driven cognitive radio networks (nROAR) using national instrument USRP devices in wide-band regime. We present numerical results for evaluating spectrum sensing using adaptive threshold-based joint energy and bandwidth detection. Furthermore, we evaluate the dynamic spectrum access using database-driven quorum-based rendezvous for opportunistic access for admitted unlicensed secondary users in diverse wireless bands. The proposed nROAR architecture addresses challenges related to providing spectrum access which require fast processing of a large number of spectrum-sensing measurements across diverse wireless bands, geography, and time.	cloud computing;cognitive radio;cyber-physical system;experiment;geolocation;labview;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;relevance;simulation;software propagation;universal software radio peripheral	Danda B.

As the degree of mobility increases, the wireless network would suffer more link errors. Ad hoc routing protocols that use broadcast to discover routes may become inefficient due to frequent failures of intermediate connections in an end-to-end communication. When an intermediate link breaks, it is beneficial to discover a new route locally without resorting to an end-to-end route discovery. Based on the concept of localizing the route request query, we propose an efficient approach to repair error links quickly. The approach can apply to the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. As an enhancement to AODV, the proposed approach leads to two routing protocols, called AODV-LRQ and AODV-LRT, which are aimed to efficiently repair the link errors. To evaluate the effects of the route repair, we define a factor, called bonus gain, as the ratio between the throughput increment to the routing overhead increment. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can get high bonus gain, that is, it can maintain the throughput as well as reduce the routing overheads.	algorithm;distance-vector routing protocol;end-to-end principle;experiment;hoc (programming language);internationalization and localization;kosterlitz–thouless transition;lr parser;long-running transaction;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput;transistor–transistor logic	Michael Pan;Sheng-Yan Chuang;Sheng-De Wang	2005	11th Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing (PRDC'05)	10.1109/PRDC.2005.38	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;route poisoning;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile computing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.3623607106896407	83.389329601841	44853

In this paper, we propose an extension of IAMCTD (Improved Adaptive Mobility of Courier nodes in Threshold-optimized DBR protocol for UWSNs) that focuses on enhancing network reliability and throughput for critical-range based applications. Our scheme avoids control overhead that was present in IAMCTD for implementing changes in depth threshold. The movement pattern of courier nodes along with reducing communication burden on nodes increases throughput as well. Additionally, stability period is improved and node density per round remains comparatively high improving the overall network reliability. Based on the comprehensive simulations using MATLAB, we observe that our scheme improves the performance in terms of throughput and stability period. Moreover, comparatively higher network density per round is maintained and end-to-end delay is stabilized throughout the network lifetime.	throughput	Amara Umar;M. A. Hasnat;M. Behzad;I.

This paper proposes distributed algorithm that improves the network coverage and connectivity, performing controlled reorganization of mobile sensor nodes (C2 algorithm). The algorithm initially organizes the network in a clustered topology, assuming hexagonal grid structure. The Cluster Heads are positioned in the centres of hexagonal cells designed according the nodes transmission range. The C2 reorganizes the sensor nodes between the adjacent hexagonal cells and equally distributes them within the cells, thus improving the network coverage and providing more uniform energy utilization. The algorithm chooses the optimal nodes to perform the movements, maintaining the connectivity between the sensor nodes and minimizing the energy that the nodes consume for their movement. The simulation results show the benefits of the proposed algorithm implementation for coverage and connectivity improvement in a homogeneous WSN.	sensor	Aleksandra Mateska;Liljana Gavrilovska	2011			computer network	Robotics	8.597317144449894	80.0839346861263	44965

Security and trustworthy of routing in this field, however, needs to be considerably researched. In this paper, a novel trust establishment algorithm is proposed, designed, and implemented specifically for opportunistic routing protocols which benefits from direct interactions between wireless nodes. The proposed trust model benefits from a novel watchdog mechanism considering not only forwarding behaviour of nodes but also the quality of links between them. Furthermore, three different metrics for next hop selection is introduced enabling nodes to select their next hop forwarders more sophisticatedly using quality of links, geographical location of nodes, and their trust level. Extensive simulation results represent that proposed model can significantly improve the performance of network communications when malicious nodes try to collapse the system.	algorithm;interaction;link-state routing protocol;location (geography);malware;network packet;simulation;trust management (information system);watchdog timer	Mahmood Salehi;Azzedine Boukerche;Amir Darehshoorzadeh;Abdelhamid Mammeri	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1010-4	wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;wireless network;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;trustworthy computing;computer security;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	4.302306648103738	84.10083364747102	44966
2a4b884c8a1651b7b1973433f104c1537ffa7c03	investigating low level protocols for wireless body sensor networks		The rapid development of medical sensors has increased the interest in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications where physiological data from the human body and its environment is gathered, monitored, and analyzed to take the proper measures. In WBANs, it is essential to design MAC protocols that ensure adequate Quality of Service (QoS) such as low delay and high scalability. This paper investigates Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols used in WBAN, and compares their performance in a high traffic environment. Such scenario can be induced in case of emergency for example, where physiological data collected from all sensors on human body should be sent simultaneously to take appropriate action. This study can also be extended to cover collaborative WBAN systems where information from different bodies is sent simultaneously leading to high traffic. OPNET simulations are performed to compare the delay and scalability performance of the different MAC protocols under the same experimental conditions and to draw conclusions about the best protocol to be used in a high traffic environment.	access control;quality of service;scalability;sensor;simulation	Nadine Boudargham;Jacques Bou Abdo;Jacques Demerjian;Christophe Guyeux;Abdallah Makhoul	2016	2016 IEEE/ACS 13th International Conference of Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2016.7945736	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	10.5411192013473	85.35228090931054	45032

However, introduction of on-chip wireless links lowers the overall reliability of the data communication fabric. In this paper we propose a unified Error Control Coding (ECC) mechanism which can be effectively used to restore the reliability of a Wireless NoC (WiNoC). We demonstrate that with carefully designed ECC schemes in the WiNoC it is possible to achieve high gains in performance due to the wireless links while maintaining comparable reliability as that of a traditional wire line NoC.	electrical connection;error detection and correction;multi-core processor;network on a chip;serial experiments lain;wireless router	Amlan Ganguly;Partha Pratim Pande;Benjamin Belzer;Alireza Nojeh	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems	10.1109/DFT.2011.24	chip;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;reliability;network on a chip;computer network	Embedded	1.7343441353696383	64.40664212361773	45100

The forwarding of messages takes place via any nodes that are encountered, and therefore the measurement of message passing efficiency between nodes becomes challenging if a number of different protocols are to be compared and evaluated. Prior work has identified an evaluation framework that addresses this challenge. This article describes the construction of a simulation tool to assist the assessment of efficiency in opportunistic networks, and by way of an exemplar case study, a set of experimental results are discussed and evaluated. From this we conclude that Spray and Focus may be the way forward in this case.	end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);message passing;simulation	Anthony Smith;Stuart Berry	2012	2012 Third International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies	10.1109/EIDWT.2012.45	telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	2.568309266745981	86.30624306868904	45102

In this paper, we propose a bandwidth routing protocol for quality-of-service (QoS) support in a multihop mobile network. The QoS routing feature is important for a mobile network to interconnect wired networks with QoS support (e.g., ATM, Internet, etc.). The QoS routing protocol can also work in a stand-alone multihop mobile network for real-time applications. Our QoS routing protocol contains end-to-end bandwidth calculation and bandwidth allocation. Under such a routing protocol, the source (or the ATM gateway) is informed of the bandwidth and QoS available to any destination in the mobile network. This knowledge enables the establishment of QoS connections within the mobile network and the efficient support of real-time applications. In addition, it enables more efficient call admission control. In the case of ATM interconnection, the bandwidth information can be used to carry out intelligent handoff between ATM gateways and/or to extend the ATM virtual circuit (VC) service to the mobile network with possible renegotiation of QoS parameters at the gateway. We examine the system performance in various QoS traffic flows and mobility environments via simulation. Simulation results suggest distinct performance advantages of our protocol that calculates the bandwidth information. It is particularly useful in call admission control. Furthermore, “standby” routing enhances the performance in the mobile environment. Simulation experiments show this improvement.	atm turbo;emergence;end-to-end principle;experiment;hoc (programming language);interconnection;quality of service;real-time clock;routing;simulation;sleep mode;virtual circuit	Chun-Hung Richard Lin;Jain-Shing Liu	1999	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.779924	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile qos;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;wireless network;distributed computing;computer performance;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	-1.719605793971521	88.22591074503818	45140

The PISync algorithm is based on an adaptive proportional–integral controller. It applies a proportional feedback (P) and an integral feedback (I) on the local measured synchronization errors to compensate the differences between the clock offsets and the clock speeds. We present practical flooding-based and fully distributed protocol implementations of the PISync algorithm, and we provide theoretical analysis to highlight the benefits of this approach in terms of improved steady-state error and scalability as compared with existing synchronization algorithms. We show through theoretical analysis, real-world experiments, and simulations that PISync protocols have better or comparable performance over existing protocols in the WSN literature in terms of rate of convergence and steady-state error with the additional advantages of requiring minimal CPU overhead, memory allocation, and code footprint independent of network size and topology, and of employing blind communication.	algorithm;central processing unit;clock synchronization;experiment;overhead (computing);rate of convergence;scalability;simulation;steady state;theory	Kas&#x0131;m Sinan Y&#x0131;ld&#x0131;r&#x0131;m;Ruggero Carli;Luca Schenato	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2017.2692720	clock synchronization;wireless sensor network;control theory;scalability;real-time computing;synchronization;data synchronization;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;self-clocking signal;distributed computing;computer science	Embedded	14.586966196086358	83.43796313149466	45165

b3284fd0e6d05c609a659369ba84ba239e3b8e37	a unified approach of simultaneous state estimation and anomalous node detection in distributed wireless sensor networks		SummaryrnDetection of anomalous node in distributed wireless sensor networks is extremely important for powerful inference and network reliability. In this paper, we propose a powerful linear statistical model for estimating the state values of the sensor nodes longitudinally, and the estimated state values are used for detecting the anomalous nodes. Our proposed approach is powerful because it considers the effect of the nearest neighbors on the current state values and then detects the anomalous nodes based on the estimated state values. Our method can estimate the missing state values of the sensor nodes, which are kept in sleep mode for energy conservation. We also propose an alternative Bayesian model that is computationally faster for state estimation and anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the proposed model is investigated through extensive simulation studies, and the usefulness of our algorithm is numerically assessed. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to that of the traditional approaches through simulation studies. The proposed model can be effectively used in security surveillance, pattern recognition, habitat monitoring, etc.		Aditi Chatterjee;Palaniandavar Venkateswaran;Debaprasad Mukherjee	2017	Int. J.

VANETs exhibit dynamic topology and intermittent connectivity due to high vehicle mobility. These distinguished features declare a challenging question: how to detect on the fly vehicular networks such that we can explore mobility-assisted message dissemination and topology control in VANETs. As being closely related to network dynamics, vehicle mobility could be explored to uncover network structure. In this paper, we have observed that mobility of vehicle, rather than being random, shows \emph{temporal locality} (i.e., frequently visiting several communities like home and office), and \emph{spatial locality} (i.e., velocity constrained by road layout and nearby vehicles). We first examine temporal locality using a campus trace, then measure temporal locality similarity between two vehicles based on the relative entropy of their location preferences. By further incorporating spatial locality similarity, we introduce a new metric, namely \emph{dual locality ratio} (DLR), which represents the mobility correlation of vehicles. Simulation results show that DLR can effectively identify dynamic vehicular network structures. We also demonstrate applications of DLR for improving performances of data forwarding and clustering in vehicle-to-vehicle networks.	cluster analysis;connected car;dynamic language runtime;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);kullback–leibler divergence;locality of reference;on the fly;operand forwarding;performance;principle of locality;simulation;temporal logic;topology control;vehicle-to-vehicle;velocity (software development)	Yujin Li;Ming Zhao;Wenye Wang	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134395	vehicle dynamics;telecommunications;network dynamics;through-silicon via;kullback–leibler divergence;computer security;network topology;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.297400559588331	84.55131763704853	45257

Since the overall performance of such distributed systems often depends on the efficiency of their communication networks, performance analysis of the interconnection networks for such distributed systems is paramount. In this paper, we develop an analytical model, under non-uniform traffic and in the presence of communication locality, for the m-port n-tree family interconnection networks commonly employed in large-scale cluster computing systems. We use the proposed model to study two widely used interconnection networks flow control mechanism namely the wormhole and store&forward. The proposed analytical model is validated through comprehensive simulation. The results of the simulation demonstrated that the proposed model exhibits a good degree of accuracy for various system organizations and under different working conditions.

It is essential to use road networks for prolonged time duration in an energy efficient manner. However, network life time increases in response of reducing the stability period (i.e. time required before first node dies).The stability period reduces due to the high energy variance of nodes. In this paper, we present a protocol named as clustering based energy efficient and communication protocol (CEECP) for multiple mix-zones over road networks, which is proposed to reduce the loop holes of prevailing clustering protocols. Additionally, we present a novel CEECP for chain scenario to connect with the road side units for gaining benefits of V2V as well as, V2I communication for Cooperative Traffic Information Systems. The stability period is responsible to preserve coverage properties of the network. It analysis that as the stability period increases, the trustworthiness of the network increases. Hence, it is indispensable to articulate a clustering protocol that shall be energy efficient, low energy variant and of high stability. It has been proved that our scheme outperforms SEECP and VBN as well as, includes its variants with respect to stability period and energy variance.	cluster analysis;communications protocol;computer science;cylinder-head-sector;internet;load balancing (computing);numerical analysis;simulation;wireless access point	Qasim Ali Arain;Muhammad Aslam Uqaili;Zhongliang Deng;Imran Memon;Jichao Jiao;Muhammad Akram Shaikh;Asma Zubedi;Aisha Ashraf;Usman Ali Arain	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3900-x	computer network;computer science;trustworthiness;information system;communications protocol;efficient energy use;cluster analysis;location-based service	Mobile	5.929749990055067	86.98168948100215	45323

Sensor nodes periodically sense the random field and generate data, which is stored in the corresponding data queues. The EH source harnesses energy from ambient energy sources and the generated energy is stored in an energy buffer. Sensor nodes receive energy for data transmission from the EH source. The EH source has to efficiently share the stored energy among the nodes to minimize the long-run average delay in data transmission. We formulate the problem of energy sharing between the nodes in the framework of average cost infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). We develop efficient energy sharing algorithms, namely Q-learning algorithm with exploration mechanisms based on the ε-greedy method as well as upper confidence bound (UCB) . We extend these algorithms by incorporating state and action space aggregation to tackle state-action space explosion in the MDP. We also develop a cross entropy based method that incorporates policy parameterization to find near optimal energy sharing policies. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms yield energy sharing policies that outperform the heuristic greedy method.	approximation algorithm;basis function;cluster analysis;computational complexity theory;cross entropy;curse of dimensionality;exception handling;experiment;gradient;greedy algorithm;heuristic;markov chain;markov decision process;network performance;numerical linear algebra;prototype;q-learning;sensor;simulation;state space	Sindhu Padakandla;J.

Combining different types of measurement matrices and different numbers of measurements, we firstly investigate three different scenarios in which HSN is used for signal acquisition. In the first scenario, there are two different types of measurement matrices. One is Gaussian measurement and the other is Fourier measurement, and each sensor applies the same numbers of measurements. In the second scenario, all sensors use the same type of measurement matrices but the number of measurements are different with each other. The third scenario combines different types of measurement matrix and distinct numbers of measurements. Our simulation results show that in Scenario I, when the common sparsity is considerable, the DCS scheme can reduce the number of measurements. In Scenario II, the reconstruction situation becomes better with the increase of the number of measurements. In both Scenarios I and III, joint decoding that use different types of measurement matrices performs better than that of allGaussian measurement matrices, but it performs worse than that of all-Fourier measurement matrices. Therefore, DCS is a good compromise between reconstruction percentage and the number of measurements in HSN. & 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the high mobility, harsh, and intermittent wireless channels, the data download volume of individual vehicle per drive-thru is quite limited, as observed in real-world tests. This would severely restrict the service quality of upper layer applications, such as file download and video streaming. On addressing this issue, in this paper, we propose ChainCluster, a cooperative Drive-thru Internet scheme. ChainCluster selects appropriate vehicles to form a linear cluster on the highway. The cluster members then cooperatively download the same content file, with each member retrieving one portion of the file, from the roadside infrastructure. With cluster members consecutively driving through the roadside infrastructure, the download of a single vehicle is virtually extended to that of a tandem of vehicles, which accordingly enhances the probability of successful file download significantly. With a delicate linear cluster formation scheme proposed and applied, in this paper, we first develop an analytical framework to evaluate the data volume that can be downloaded using cooperative drive-thru. Using simulations, we then verify the performance of ChainCluster and show that our analysis can match the simulations well. Finally, we show that ChainCluster can outperform the typical studied clustering schemes and provide general guidance for cooperative content distribution in highway vehicular communications.	cluster analysis;digital distribution;download;simulation;streaming media	Haibo Zhou;Bo Liu;Tom H.

Although NoC is a good solution for long-distance communication, local buses are more efficient for short-distance connections. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network on chip (HNoC) fabric that uses local buses for nearest-neighbor communication and the standard NoC topology for global interconnection. Local buses carry all the nearest-neighbor traffic, reducing traffic on the global network, which results in increased throughput and reduced energy consumption.  Based on a communication probability density (CPD) function derived from Rent's rule, it is shown that in a 25-core chip multiprocessor, HNoC can remove up to 78% of the traffic from the global NoC topology, which results in 4.6x higher throughput and a 58% reduction in energy consumption compared to a conventional NoC topology.	collaborative product development;global network;interconnection;multi-core processor;multiprocessing;nearest-neighbor interpolation;network on a chip;network packet;rent's rule;throughput	Payman Zarkesh-Ha;George B.

The basic idea of our protocol is to let message be forwarded to the nodes moving toward or closer to destination. When nodes contact with each other, our approach will utilize the path of the node, node's moving direction and velocity to estimate the probability to reach the destination of the message. At the same time, we exploit network coding to transmit coded block instead of message fragment in order to avoid sending redundant replication. In this way, data transport is more reliable and more robust to packet losses or delays. From the results of simulation, we could see that our protocol has enhanced performance, especially for the bandwidth consumption compared to other protocols.	delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;linear network coding;mobile device;network packet;randomness;routing;simulation;velocity (software development)	Tzu-Chieh Tsai;Chieh-Cheng Chen	2012	2012 1st IEEE International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2012.6356967	wireless routing protocol;communications protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;linear network coding;neighbor discovery protocol;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;resource reservation protocol;computer science;wireless network;tunneling protocol;probability;distributed computing;routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;anti-replay;geographic routing;encoding;computer network	Mobile	3.0435478517511387	83.65184783917503	45555

In this paper, we propose Overlapping Clusters Algorithm (OCA) for mobile ad hoc networks. The goal of OCA is to achieve network reliability and load balancing. The algorithm consists of two discrete phases. The start-up phase takes battery and bandwidth capacity, transmission range, density, mobility, and buffer occupancy as input parameters to performs initial clustering for the entire network. The maintenance phase monitors the status of the network and keeps the network topology updated through local and global re-clustering. We compare the performance of OCA with Lowest ID, Highest Degree, WCA, and LCC algorithms in YAES simulator. The simulation results show that OCA outperforms all the compared algorithms in terms of network reliability and load distribution. The average numbers of global re-clusterings and reaffiliations were much lower in OCA than the other algorithms. However, OCA generates a larger number of clusters, which is expected considering that the nodes are allowed to be members of multiple clusters at the same time.	algorithm;cluster analysis;hoc (programming language);load balancing (computing);network topology;routing;simulation	Nevin Aydin;Farid Naït-Abdesselam;Volodymyr Pryyma;Damla Turgut	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683454	real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;load balancing;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	HPC	6.444256101926827	80.32228389939634	45608

In large-scale ubiquitous sensor networks, a huge number of sensor nodes are deployed over a wide area and long distances and multi-hop communication is required between nodes. So managing numerous ubiquitous sensor nodes directly is very complex and is not efficient. The management of large-scale ubiquitous sensor networks therefore must be autonomic with a minimum of human interference, and robust to changes in network states. The SNOWMAN is responsible for monitoring and controlling ubiquitous sensor networks based on policy-based management paradigm. It allows administrators to simplify and automate the management of ubiquitous sensor networks. It can also reduce the costs of managing sensor nodes and of the communication among them using a new hierarchical clustering algorithm.	algorithm;autonomic computing;autonomous robot;business logic;cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;interference (communication);netpbm format;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;sensor web	Jong-Eon Lee;Si-Ho Cha;Dae-Young Kim;Kuk-Hyun Cho	2006		10.1007/11807964_62	network management;sensor web;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;data mining;hierarchical clustering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;ubiquitous robot;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;ubiquitous computing;sensor array;computer network;intelligent sensor;visual sensor network	Mobile	-0.22480561732200205	74.4454375502035	45694

d0bc5362f00ec46ce277aa6b557381237948da6d	mitigation of the ground reflection effect in real-time locating systems based on wireless sensor networks by using artificial neural networks		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become much more relevant in recent years, mainly because they can be used in a wide diversity of applications. Real-time locating systems (RTLSs) are one of the most promising applications based on WSNs and represent a currently growing market. Specifically, WSNs are an ideal alternative to develop RTLSs aimed at indoor environments where existing global navigation satellite systems, such as the global positioning system, do not work correctly due to the blockage of the satellite signals. However, accuracy in indoor RTLSs is still a problem requiring novel solutions. One of the main challenges is to deal with the problems that arise from the effects of the propagation of radiofrequency waves, such as attenuation, diffraction, reflection and scattering. These effects can lead to other undesired problems, such as multipath. When the ground is responsible for wave reflections, multipath can be modeled as the ground reflection effect. This paper presents an innovative mathematical model for improving the accuracy of RTLSs, focusing on the mitigation of the ground reflection effect by using multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks.	approximation;artificial neural network;doppler effect;frequency band;global positioning system;mathematical model;memory-level parallelism;mesh networking;multilayer perceptron;multipath propagation;radio frequency;rayleigh fading;real-time locating system;reflection (computer graphics);satellite navigation;sensor;software propagation;time series	Juan Francisco de Paz;Dante I.

There has been numerous data collection scheduling algorithms, but they fail to consider the deep and complex relationship among network lifetime, sink aggregated information and sample cycle for wireless sensor networks. This paper gives the upper bound on the sample period under the given network topology. An optimal schedule algorithm focusing on aggregated information named OSFAI is proposed. In the schedule algorithm, the nodes in hotspots would hold on transmission and accumulate their data before sending them to sink at once. This could realize the dual goals of improving the network lifetime and increasing the amount of information aggregated to sink. We formulate the optimization problem as to achieve trade-off among sample cycle, sink aggregated information and network lifetime by controlling the sample cycle. The results of simulation on the random generated wireless sensor networks show that when choosing the optimized sample cycle, the sink aggregated information quantity can be increased by 30.5%, and the network lifetime can be increased by 27.78%.	algorithm;hotspot (wi-fi);mathematical optimization;network topology;optimization problem;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation	Jinhuan Zhang;Jun Long;Anfeng Liu;Guihu Zhao	2016	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2016.000032	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;schedule;computer network	Mobile	11.257767803750905	79.93771205437858	45914

Our mechanism uses as input parameters the vehicular density and the topological characteristics of the environment where the vehicles are located, in order to decide which dissemination scheme to use. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, which is able to support more efficient warning message dissemination in vehicular environments.	algorithm;hoc (programming language);simulation	Julio A.

This paper derives the position error bound (PEB), a fundamental limit for localization accuracy, by using information inequality. In particular, the authors consider all multipath propagation parameters, and hence our bound is tighter than those of previous work. To alleviate computation complexity, the authors put forth the notion of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) to characterize the localization accuracy. This approach also unifies the contributions from line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and a priori knowledge to the PEB in a consistent form. These results are applicable to ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) systems as a specific case.	computation;computational complexity theory;fisher information;geolocation;line-of-sight (missile);multipath propagation;propagation constant;social inequality;software propagation;unified extensible firmware interface;vii	Yuan Shen;Moe Z.

Although range-based approaches tend to be more accurate than range-free approaches, they are more sensitive to errors in distance measurement. Despite of the efforts on recovering sensors’ Euclidean coordinates from erroneous distance measurements, as will be illustrated in this paper, they are still prone to distance errors, particularly in an obstruction abundant environment. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for sensor localization based on Multiscale Radio Transmission Power(MRTP). It gradually increases the scale level of transmission power, and the distance is determined by the minimal scale of received signals. Unlike the range-based approaches, which treat each measured distance as an approximation of the true one, in our new approach, the measured distance serves as a constraint that limits the feasible location of sensors. Our simulations have shown that the MRTP-based approach is able to provide accurate and robust estimation of location, especially in an area abundant in obstructions, where most current approaches fail to perform well.	algorithm;approximation;cone;conic optimization;hoc (programming language);icdcs;linear algebra;multidimensional scaling;rss;robertson–seymour theorem;sensor;simulation;software propagation;stagefright (bug)	Wang Chen;Xiao Li;Rong Jin	2005		10.1007/11502593_7	robust statistics;internationalization and localization;computer science;calculus;mathematics;geometry;sensor array;statistics;observational error	Mobile	16.88730603155592	74.90971203791835	46021

Especially, due to the affluent spectrum resource, supports for non-safety relevant services, like inter-vehicle entertainments, are also under investigation. However, in the vehicular environments, the nodes can experience frequent link breakages due to the vehicle mobility characteristic. Thus, a reliable multi-hop routing protocols is definitely needed to overcome the performance degradation caused by it. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for non-safety applications, which is also referred as Movement-aware Alternative path Routing Protocol (MARP), a reactive unicast routing protocol that considers two factors such as vehicle movement and multi-path to determine the optimum reliable routing paths. In addition, we devote special attention to the random characteristic of the radio propagation model to provide a simulation with the desired level of realism. After realistic simulation studies, the performance of proposed MARP routing protocol outperforms the traditional VANETs routing by reducing the routing overhead and enhancing the stability of routing path.	elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing);routing;simulation;software propagation;unicast	Songnan Bai;Zequn Huang;Hanbyeog Cho;Jaeil Jung	2009		10.1145/1644993.1645061	vehicular ad hoc network;policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;spectrum;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;radio propagation;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network;unicast	Mobile	3.3466699425454953	85.7935945872468	46027

The algorithm could correct measurement errors every time nodes take measures.

The nature has been optimizing itself for billions of years and in many cases it simply introduces the most optimal approaches. On the other hand, the task of data collection and aggregation is critical in wireless sensor networks (WSN). The information packets should traverse the network towards the aggregating center i.e. sink node. The problem of finding the best path to route the data has been long under investigation. The authors propose a new method for collecting the data from sensor field based on a biological inspired method adopted from tubular network formation behavior of slime mold where biological organisms efficiently selforganize unreliable and dynamically changing topology, to compensate for the failure of individual components while not relying on explicit central coordination. They show that the emergent network exhibits a widely observed property in natural topologies called scale-free which explains a lot of inherent characteristics in living creatures. At the end the authors show that the data collection time for a biologically inspired network is shorter than uniform channel capacity scheduling.

Longer paths (non-optimal paths) disappear due to lack of nutrients. The best paths are those who are closer to food and can carry more food to connected parts of the organism. The parts of the super organism that poorly have access to food die and the remaining organism will be a super organism that covers all food locations. The resulted topology dynamically ensures that at any given time the graph consisting of food locations remains a connected graph thus maintaining a robust network that connects all the nodes in an optimum way. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold which, during the plasmodium phase of its life cycle, consists of a large multinuclear cell body that can span tens of centimeters in length. During the course of this phase, the organism will consume organic matter to sustain itself. Nutrients are transported over short distances through diffusion and over large distances through self-assembled channels or tubes that form a dynamic, hierarchical network throughout the cell body (Nakagaki, Kobayashi, Nishiura, & Ueda, 2004). The network forms an essential component of the pseudopodia, extensions of the cell that seek new food sources. During the plasmodium phase, the slime mold will assemble and disassemble these tubes to link new food sources into its network and sustain itself by distributing nutrients through the organism. Fitness requires that resources be discovered in the environment and distributed efficiently throughout the organism, so physarum polycephalum is an excellent biological system to study when designing artificial resource distribution networks (Ben-Jacob & Cohen, 1998). Experimental observations have shown that slime mold will connect nutrient sources into a variety of final configurations including Steiner minimal trees, minimum spanning trees and other more redundant structures (Nakagaki, Kobayashi, Nishiura, & Ueda, 2004). Often, the tubes of a slime mold will be arranged in a geometry that balances efficiency (keeping the total tube length short) and robustness (having multiple paths in case of a tube being severed). These observations are entirely consistent with an algorithm lacking complete global information. A variety of modeling approaches have been applied to understanding slime mold. While it can be said that any living system is complex by necessity, often specific processes are dominated by a small number of mechanisms. Considerable research has focused on observed behavioral manifestations including search for food, avoid danger, and determine the shortest paths through mazes under certain circumstances (Ben-Jacob & Cohen, 1998; Nakagaki, Yamada, & Toth, 2000). The searching behavior of pseudopodia has also been modeled and analyzed (Hofer & Maini, 1997). More recently, Tero et al have studied a tube flow model using Poiseuille flow coupled to an adaptation term (Tero, Kobayashi, & Nakagaki, 2007). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We first describe a mathematical model of slime mold’s tube network formation behavior using Singular Potential in the next section. The overview of the designed protocol is presented afterwards. Followed by an explanation of the protocol in details. Simulation results are then presented and discussed . We then conclude the paper. BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM MODEL Let’s consider an initial slime mold cell located at node i and some amount of food located at node j as seen in Figure 1. Table 1 summarizes the parameters associated with this model. The net nutrient flow from node i to node j will be proportional to the pressure difference of two nodes modeled as (1). If cell at node i has a neighbor set of N i , then the net nutrient flux at node i will be as (2):		Mahdy Saedy	2013	IJITN	10.4018/jitn.2013010102	simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;scale-free network;slime mold;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;event-driven programming;statistics;data collection	Theory	6.732039090156773	79.77391761053937	46113

Fault diagnosis is an important part of fault tolerance. An effective diagnosis tool helps network administrators clearly monitor, manage, and troubleshoot the performance of the network. However, the design of online fault diagnosis is crucial in WSNs since many faults can easily happen and propagate. Besides, fault diagnosis put extra burden on the sensor node and it will also consume extra resources of the sensor nodes. Thus, in order to guarantee the network quality of service, it is essential for WSNs to be able to diagnosis faults efficiently. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and efficient approach for fault diagnosis in WSN called (SMART). SMART is a layer independent fault diagnosis service for WSNs. The presented service focuses on diagnosis two types of failures that are likely to happen in WSN deployments which are the node failure due to energy depletion, and the link failure due to poor connectivity with neighbors. From the design view, SMART provides to the application many tunable parameters that make it suitable for various deployment needs: energy-robustness-detection latency tradeoffs, tolerable packet loss, reports frequency etc. Simulation results prove that SMART is resource efficient while providing satisfactory detection and diagnosis accuracy.	depletion region;fault tolerance;network packet;quality of service;smart;sensor node;simulation;software deployment	Dima Hamdan;Oum-El-Kheir Aktouf;Ioannis Parissis;Bachar El Hassan;Abbas Hijazi;Bassam Moslem	2012	2012 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/CyberC.2012.72	embedded system;fault tolerance;real-time computing;energy;wireless sensor network;quality of service;computer science;energy level;particle detector;computer network	Robotics	8.347554219934395	76.67019810299324	46205

In this context the currently dominant cellular (a combination of metropolitan, local, and personal area networksVMANs, LANs, and PANs, respectively), as well as the emerging mobile ad hoc network (MANET) architectures constitute the two major contenders for the role of systemic paradigm, which would facilitate the realization of ubiquitous wireless networking. The corresponding literature offers an extensive body of theoretical as well as experimental work [1]–[3] advocating the potential advantages of either of the two aforementioned approaches. Against this background, we would like to maintain that in order to achieve the required level of integration, performance and efficiency, the future telecommunications technology may have to infer cues from the structural characteristics of the human society itself. Correspondingly, in this paper we would like to consider some of the relevant aspects of the societal constitution, which may hold crucial clues to identifying the promising avenues towards further technological advancement. More specifically, in this paper we explore the principle of heterogeneous wireless networking, constituted by the fusion of classic cellular and ad hoc network topologies. Specifically, we would like to maintain, that the heterogeneous network inherits the vital complementary characteristics of both aforementioned architectures, and thus has the potential of attaining the levels of performance and efficiency required by the future wireless communications.	hoc (programming language);network topology;pervasive informatics;point of view (computer hardware company);programming paradigm	Jos Akhtman;Lajos Hanzo Hanzo	2010	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037213	local area network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	16.52210449511757	84.59582317048117	46243

Power balance technologies such as wave dynamic differential logic (WDDL) aim to balance the power by introducing differential logic. However, different routing length leads to different capacitance of wire, and this hampers the strength of the power balance countermeasure. In this paper, we further balance the power of differential signals by manipulating the lower level primitives and placement constraints on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We choose Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the encryption algorithm and apply Hamming weight model to demonstrate the amount of leakage for different implementations. Results show that our method not only efficiently mitigates the side-channel leakage but also saves FPGA logic block resources and dynamic power consumption.	algorithm;cryptography;differential signaling;embedded system;encryption;field-programmable gate array;hamming weight;logic block;routing;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;window function	Xin Fang;Pei Luo;Yunsi Fei;Miriam Leeser	2015	2015 IEEE 26th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)	10.1109/ASAP.2015.7245724	embedded system;real-time computing;macrocell array;logic gate;programmable logic array;computer science;cryptography;operating system;programmable logic device;correlation	EDA	12.400320085767635	63.043768407136966	46264

In this paper, we propose a multihop vehicle-to-infrastructure routing protocol named Vertex-Based Predictive Greedy Routing (VPGR), which predicts a sequence of valid vertices (or junctions) from a source vehicle to fixed infrastructure (or a roadside unit) in the area of interest and, then, forwards data to the fixed infrastructure through the sequence of vertices in urban environments. The well known predictive directional greedy routing mechanism is used for data forwarding in VPGR. The proposed VPGR leverages the geographic position, velocity, direction and acceleration of vehicles for both the calculation of a sequence of valid vertices and the predictive directional greedy routing. Simulation results show significant performance improvement compared to conventional routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and routing overhead.		Raj K.

a112255a8c77bf039ec3dcae64df1a996b461105	united channel assignments in residential environments		"""Residential wireless networks have grown rapidly in the past decade. Meanwhile, dense deployments and autonomous managements of home Access Points (APs) greatly increase channel congestion levels and degrade the user experience. To address such problems, this paper proposes an architecture in residential environments called Wi-Fi Union (WU), where home APs can voluntarily join WU and become """"member APs"""". WU helps member APs decrease their congestion levels by assigning channels in a coordinated manner with incentive considerations. First, we propose congestion level metric normalized airtime which can be passively and independently measured by member APs. Normalized airtime is further used to classify APs into heavily congested APs and lightly congested APs. A tabu search based channel assignment algorithm is presented which can decrease the congestion level of heavily congested member APs, and guarantee lightly congested member APs to be still lightly congested. Extensive NS-3 simulations driven by actual Wi-Fi data show that the united channel assignments has a 1.5 times throughput than that in the default setting on average."""	airtime;algorithm;autonomous robot;categorization;hotspot (wi-fi);network congestion;packet analyzer;server (computing);simulation;tabu search;throughput;user experience;windows update;wireless access point	Yaodong Zhang;Chunxiao Jiang;Yue Wang;Jian Yuan;Jiannong Cao	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417495	communications protocol;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;computer security;server;measurement;computer network	Mobile	4.283673621833482	88.29460646177063	46485

Network feedback is combined with self-synchronizing communication schedules to achieve synchrony in the network interfaces (NIs). Based on this synchrony, the network can be scheduled to provide predictable performance without special network QoS hardware. We describe the key element of the FM-QoS approach, feedback-based synchronization (FBS), which exploits network feedback to synchronize senders. We use Petri nets to characterize the set of self-synchronizing communication schedules for which FBS is effective and to describe the resulting synchronization overhead as a function of the clock drift across the network nodes. Analytic modeling suggests that for clocks of quality 300 ppm (such as found in the Myrinet NI), a synchronization overhead less than 1% of the total communication traffic is achievable --- significantly better than previous software-based schemes and comparable to hardware-intensive approaches such as virtual circuits (e.g. ATM).We have built a prototype of FBS for Myricom s Myrinet network (a 1.28 Gbps cluster network) which demonstrates the viability of the approach by sharing network resources with predictable performance. The prototype, which implements the local node schedule in software, achieves predictable latencies of 23 µs for a single-switch, 8-node network and 2 KB packets. In comparison, the best-effort scheme achieves 104 µs for the same network without FBS. While this ratio of over four to one already demonstrates the viability of the approach, it includes nearly 10 µs of overhead due to the software implementation. For hardware implementations of local node scheduling, and for networks with cascaded switches, these ratios should be much larger factors.	fm broadcasting;quality of service;real-time transcription	Kay Connelly;Andrew A.

3196671093a158b4b921a29532c2f43c712ef2c7	qtsac: an energy-efficient mac protocol for delay minimization in wireless sensor networks		Millions of sensors are deployed to monitor the smart grid. They consume huge amounts of energy in the communication infrastructure. Therefore, the establishment of an energy-efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for sensor nodes is challenging and urgently needed. The Quorum-based MAC protocol independently and adaptively schedules nodes’ wake-up times and decreases idle listening and collisions, thereby increasing the network throughput and extending the network lifetime. A novel Quorum time slot adaptive condensing (QTSAC)-based MAC protocol is proposed for achieving delay minimization and energy efficiency for the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Compared to previous protocols, the QTSAC-based MAC protocol has two main novelties: 1) It selects more Quorum time slots (QTSs) than previous protocols in the area that is far from the sink according to the energy consumption in WSNs to decrease the network latency and 2) It allocates QTSs only when data are transmitted to further decrease the network latency. Theoretical analyses and experimental results indicate that the QTSAS protocol can greatly improve network performance compared with existing Quorum-based MAC protocols. For intermediate-scale wireless sensor networks, the method that is proposed in this paper can enhance the energy efficiency by 24.64%–82.75%, prolong the network lifetime by 58%–27.31%, and lower the network latency by 3.59%–29.23%.	access control;grid computing;network performance;sensor;throughput	Yuxin Liu;Kaoru Ota;Kuan Zhang;Ming Ma;Naixue N.

e3b4eb8dbe0a4506c0c3549e048f1962b4e5d3fb	energy efficient modified leach protocol for iot application		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have a wide range of applications in various fields. One of the most recent emerging applications are in the world of Internet of Things (IoT), which allows inter-connection of different objects or devices through the Internet. However, limited battery power is the major concern of WSNs as compared to mobile ad-hoc network, which affects the longevity of the network. Hence, a lot of research has been focused on to minimise the energy consumption of the WSNs. Designing of a hierarchical clustering algorithm is one of the numerous approaches to minimise the energy of the WSNs. In this study, the existing low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) clustering protocol is modified by introducing a threshold limit for cluster head selection with simultaneously switching the power level between the nodes. The proposed modified LEACH protocol outperforms as compared to the existing LEACH protocol with 67% rise in throughput and extending the number of alive nodes to 1750 rounds which can be used to enhance the WSN lifetime. When compared with other energy efficient protocols, it is found that the proposed algorithm performs better in terms of stability period and network lifetime in different scenarios of area, energy and node density.

In order to save network resources, it is desirable to dispatch a small number of mobile agents to get a high probability of finding the destination (probability of success). Therefore, it is not only necessary but also important to analyze the searching activity and the population growth of mobile agents for improving the performance in agent-driven networks. Yet currently there is a lack of such analysis. In this paper, we present a new mobile agent-based routing model for describing the behavior of mobile agents for network routing. Then we analyze both the probability of success and the population growth of mobile agents running in the network. The theoretical results show that the probability of success and the number of mobile agents can be controlled by adjusting relevant parameters according various network characteristics. Our results reveal new theoretical insights into the statistical behaviors of mobile agents and provide useful tools for effectively managing mobile agents in large networks.	agent-based model;dynamic dispatch;mobile agent;routing	Wenyu Qu;Hong Shen;John Sum	2004			policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;mobile agent;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	AI	2.460955255330033	84.825740598285	46578
cdab0cd1eac474e031b9f8544e8a6677ccce04d6	the interpose puf: secure puf design against state-of-the-art machine learning attacks		The design of a strong silicon Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) with a rigorous security argument that is also lightweight and reliable has been the fundamental problem in PUF research, since its introduction in 2002. Becker’s reliability based CMA-ES attack in CHES 2015 showed that as of yet, no silicon PUF design can solve this fundamental problem. This is due to the attacker’s access to repeated measurements (this gives reliability information) of Challenge Response Pairs (CRPs). We are the first to provide a detailed analysis of when the reliability based CMA-ES attack is successful and when it is not applicable. We introduce the Interpose PUF (IPUF) design and show by using reduction type of arguments that the IPUF design is secure against all known machine learning (ML) attacks that use CRPs (but no side channel information). We provide simulations and confirm these by experimenting with an FPGA implementation of the IPUF. The IPUF design solves the fundamental open problem for strong silicon PUFs with respect to all state-of-the-art ML attacks.	cma-es;challenge–response authentication;donald becker;experiment;field-programmable gate array;machine learning;physical unclonable function;side-channel attack;simulation	Phuong Ha Nguyen;Durga Prasad Sahoo;Chenglu Jin;Kaleel Mahmood;Ulrich Rührmair;Marten van Dijk	2018	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Security	13.654472575202803	64.47647667188961	46617

The LOC is based on the assumption that if approximate location of the destination node is known, then overall message delivery and cost can be improved. Efficient message delivery with low communication cost is a major challenge in current opportunistic networks. In these networks, nodes do not have prior knowledge of their recipients, and message forwarding can be achieved by selecting suitable forwarder based on some forwarding criteria, as compared to its ancestor mobile ad hoc networks. #R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Design/methodology/approach#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#– In this paper, the authors tested LOC in two sets of mobility models, synthetic movement model and real mobility data sets.

In this paper, we use techniques from discrepancy theory that accurately represent the uncovered area using just a few discrete points, to make sure that every point in the network is covered by at least k sensors, where k is calculated based on user reliability requirements. Our technique is fully distributed, deploying a low number of sensors, and minimizes the communication costs. Our experiments demonstrate that our technique is highly effective in achieving a reliable restoration of a given sensor network area.	algorithm;circuit restoration;computation;disaster recovery;discrepancy function;experiment;requirement;sensor;simulation	Yannis Drougas;Vana Kalogeraki	2007	2007 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370262	wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;disaster recovery;computer network;visual sensor network	Embedded	12.368978424768322	76.82196372382747	46634

Software defined radio technology has been fueling this evolution and as result, responsibilities and utilization of military radios along with the military network sizes have been increasing. As the complexity of ad-hoc networking radios continue to increase, the distributed protocols designed to manage the networking requirements, such as medium access control and routing, are becoming more complex and harder to analyze than they have ever been. In this paper, we present an embedded radio software emulation platform that we have developed to facilitate distributed algorithm design for military ad-hoc networks This platform enables the development and testing of distributed network protocols through emulation of the embedded software implementing these protocols. Distributed networking protocols used by the radios are emulated using the radio software's native operating system, Wind River VxWorks, which is virtualized by using Wind River Hypervisor to run on a personal computer. The remaining parts of the radio software, physical layer properties, air interface of the radio, and all networking scenario details (e.g., terrain, mobility, and user generated traffic) are implemented in OPNET, through co-simulation. Performing design, evaluation, and debugging of distributed network algorithms on this platform will significantly reduce the amount of time spent on field tests, which can require hundreds of radios and last for months for each enhanced or modified version of the algorithms.	access control;algorithm design;co-simulation;communications protocol;computer multitasking;debugging;distributed algorithm;distributed networking;embedded software;embedded system;emulator;handheld game console;hoc (programming language);hypervisor;operating system;personal computer;radio software;requirement;routing;simulation;software bug;vxworks	Tolga Numanoglu;Baris Karadeniz;Furuzan Atay Onat;Ahmet Ertugrul Kolagasioglu	2012	MILCOM 2012 - 2012 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415674	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;computer network	Networks	5.320548232637218	71.81063594242102	46708

To overcome this challenge will require the DNOs to use active network management techniques, which are already prevalent in the transmission network, in order to constantly monitor and coordinate these generators, whilst ensuring that the bidirectional flows they engender on the network are safe. Therefore, this thesis presents novel decentralised message passing algorithms that coordinate generators in acyclic electricity distribution networks, such that the costs (in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions) of the entire network are minimised; a technique commonly referred to as optimal dispatch. In more detail, we cast the optimal dispatch problem as a decentralised agent-based coordination problem and formalise it as a distributed constraint optimisation problem (DCOP). We show how this DCOP can be decomposed as a factor graph and solved in a decentralised manner using algorithms based on the generalised distributive law; in particular the max-sum algorithm. We go on to show that max-sum applied näıvely in this setting performs a large number of redundant computations. To address this issue, we present both a discrete and a continuous novel decentralised message passing algorithm that outperforms max-sum by pruning much of the search space. Our discrete version is applicable to network settings that are entirely composed of discrete generators (such as wind turbines or solar panels), and when the constraints of the electricity network have been discretised. Our continuous version can be applied to a wider range of network settings containing multiple types of generators, without the need to discretise the electricity distribution network constraints. We empirically evaluate our algorithms, using two large real electricity distribution network topologies, and show that they outperform max-sum (in terms of computational time and total size of messages sent).

Although recent crowdsourcing based work has started to address the issue, incentives are still lacking for wide user adoption. Thus the progress to ubiquitous localization remains slow. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages environmental physical features such as store logos or wall posters. A user uses a smartphone to obtain relative position measurements to such static reference points for the system to triangulate the user location. We study the principle of such localization, determine the suitable sensor, and devise guidelines for the user to choose reference points for better accuracy. To enable fast deployment, we propose a lightweight site survey method for service providers to quickly estimate the coordinates of reference points. We incorporate and enhance image matching algorithms with a heuristic technique to automatically identify chosen reference points at high accuracy. Extensive experiments have shown that the prototype achieves 4-5m accuracy at 80-percentile, comparable to the industry state-of-the-art, while covering a 150×75m mall and 300×200m train station requires a one time investment of only 2-3 man-hours from service providers.	algorithm;antivirus software;crowdsourcing;experiment;heuristic;image registration;prototype;radio frequency;smartphone;software deployment	Yang Tian;Ruipeng Gao;Kaigui Bian;Fan Ye;Tao Wang;Yizhou Wang;Xiaoming Li	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847924	embedded system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	19.085378120032292	72.68236052542281	46778

It achieves low connection-establishment delay, and under certain conditions, low overall cost compared to the current PCS location management protocol (i.e., IS-41). It also effectively avoids the shortcomings of IS-41, namely, centralized location management and triangular routing. Another feature of the protocol is its ability to recover from loss or corruption of the location information carried by the mobile host. For larger networks, this paper proposes two approaches to reduce the overhead of the distributed location management scheme. Further, we formally prove that our location management scheme maintains the correct location information of every subscriber in the system.	centralized computing;fault tolerance;overhead (computing);telecommunications network;triangular routing	Karunaharan Ratnam;Sampath Rangarajan;Anton T.

The algorithms presented herein rely on range measurements between pairs of nodes and the a priori coordinates of sparsely located anchor nodes. Clusters of nodes surrounding anchor nodes cooperatively establish confident position estimates through assumptions, checks, and iterative refinements. Once established, these positions are propagated to more distant nodes, allowing the entire network to create an accurate map of itself. Major obstacles include overcoming inaccuracies in range measurements as great as %50%, as well as the development of initial guesses for node locations in clusters with few or no anchor nodes. Solutions to these problems are presented and discussed, using position error as the primary metric. Algorithms are compared according to position error, scalability, and communication and computational requirements. Early simulations yield average position errors of 5% in the presence of both range and initial position inaccuracies.	algorithm;evolving networks;hoc (programming language);iterative method;node (computer science);requirement;scalability;simulation	Chris Savarese;Jan M.

3b989d4c8346f0a83fead375dbcbd4fd0467f51b	optimal design and deployment of wireless lans based on evolutionary genetic strategy		This paper presents a design and deployment tool for wireless local area networks (WLAN) based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. The problem for optimal WLAN deployment has been addressed using an evolutionary genetic strategy. The algorithm starts with an initial population of nodes defined within a map and tries to search the best location for access points (AP). The flexibility of the algorithm allows improving the distribution of APs based on the analysis of the RF signal loss by distance and obstacles as criteria. This algorithm has been fully integrated within a previous tool called WiFiSim, which allows to study various parameters and design problems in the PHY and MAC layers of the OSI model (e.g., the hidden node problem, throughput, channel utilization, frame collisions, delays, and jitter). This enables engineers to have a complete tool for the study, design and deployment of customized Wi-Fi networks.	algorithm;design tool;mathematical optimization;osi model;optimal design;phy (chip);radio frequency;software deployment;throughput;wireless access point	Tomás de Jesús Mateo Sanguino;Francisco Alfredo Márquez	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40162-1_31	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;distributed computing	Mobile	-2.2662620526086554	80.90046234798459	46873

Each wafer to be manufactured is processed by two semiconductor foundries, combining the front-end capabilities of an advanced but untrusted semiconductor foundry with the back-end capabilities a trusted semiconductor foundry. Since the security of split fabrication relates directly to a front-end foundry's ability to interpret the partial circuit designs it receives, metrics are needed to evaluate the obfuscation of these designs as well as circuit design techniques to alter these metrics. This paper quantitatively examines several “front-end” obfuscation techniques and metrics inspired by information theory, and evaluates their impact on design effort, area, and performance penalties.	circuit design;information theory;semiconductor fabrication plant	Meenatchi Jagasivamani;Peter Gadfort;Michel Sika;Michael Bajura;Michael Fritze	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)	10.1109/HST.2014.6855560	network synthesis filters;entropy;electronic engineering;logic gate;engineering;electrical engineering;manufacturing;measurement;manufacturing engineering	Arch	13.026637373830404	63.30085707792188	46892

For data reduction in a network, in-network data aggregation methods and collaborative compression methods were reported. However, the in-network data aggregation methods typically lead to time delay while performing data aggregation and compression, whereas the current collaborative methods primarily consider data redundancy between two sensors, not among multiple sensors. This paper proposes a new collaborative data reduction method to remove the redundancy existing in the data coming from mutiple sensors as well as from a single sensor. Our method uses a tree-based data propagation model to characterize the collaboration structure among multiple sensors. Our method also separates the data aggregation process from the collaboration process in order to relieve the time-delay problem during aggregation processes. Thus, the time-delay is occured only during the periodic collaboration phase but not during the real-time data transmission. Our experimental results show that our method can reduce data transmission more effectively than the in-network aggregation without losing important information and without causing delay in aggregation.	broadcast delay;data aggregation;data redundancy;experiment;fault detection and isolation;nonlinear system;principal component analysis;real-time data;sensor;software propagation;user space;wireless router	Chiwoo Park;Yu Ding;Eunshin Byon	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2008.4626429	computer science;data mining;computer security;computer network	DB	10.995871127081772	74.35158861017246	46923

Our approach is based on a joint duty-cycle optimization and transmission power control. By simultaneously adapting both parameters, the node can maximize the number of transmitted packets while respecting the limited and time-varying amount of available energy. We obtain a high-packet delivery by using an original predictive transmission power control that can efficiently adapt the transmission power to the wireless channel conditions. To accurately model the wireless channel and the node communication hardware, a waveform-level radio frequency simulator has been developed. Simulation results show 6.5 times improvement in energy efficiency and a packet reception ratio which is 9 times more efficient than a recently published technique. A 15% increase in energy efficiency, with respect to a fixed transmission power configuration, has also been observed. Finally, the global power management strategy has been validated on a real wireless sensor networks platform. Experimental results are very similar to those obtained in simulations, and thus confirm the efficiency of our power management approach.	duty cycle;energy drift;experiment;mathematical optimization;modulation;network packet;power management;production rule representation;radio frequency;simulation;transceiver;waveform	Andrea Castagnetti;Alain Pegatoquet;Trong Nhan Le;Michel Auguin	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2014.2306327	embedded system;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;power control;computer science;engineering;radio resource management;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	12.97448394110857	83.24511891692985	46945

However, little effort has been made to carefully study the energy cost metrics upon which the design of various energy efficient algorithms is based. More specifically, most existing energy consumption models only considered energy cost of exchanging data packets, although common wireless protocols also need control packets (e.g., ACK) for reliable data transmissions. Without considering the energy cost of exchanging control packets, these existing models tend to underestimate the actual energy consumption, and thus leading to suboptimal energy efficient designs. In this paper, we develop energy consumption models that take into account energy consumption due to data packets, control packets and retransmission. We verify by simulations that our models match the actual energy consumption much better than existing models. In addition, we show that a minimum energy routing protocol based on an accurate model of ours performs much better than those based on existing models	acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;hoc (programming language);network packet;retransmission (data networks);routing;simulation	Jinhua Zhu;Chunming Qiao;Xin Wang	2006	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2006.04566	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.3630708321511955	82.72000851360522	47071

We show that continuous routing with suitable value of r is feasible by giving a probabilistic routing algorithm that guarantees an 0 (n) completion time for any given permutation with overwhelming probability. The proof relies heavily on a probabilistic batch routing algorithm that has an 0 (n) completion time-an improvement over Valiant's classical 2-phase probabilistic routing algorithm when routing n permutations at the same time.	algorithm;routing	Yukon Chang;Janos Simon	1986		10.1145/10590.10614	routing table;routing;static routing;discrete mathematics;dsrflow;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;mathematics;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;algorithm;routing information protocol	Theory	0.1492744318991406	70.81196539341991	47095

The proposed scheme is based on minimising the average consumed energy for every active sensor when data is transmitted.

Sleep Scheduling (SS) mechanism is an efficient method to manage energy of each node and is capable to prolong the lifetime of the entire network. In this paper a Software-defined Network (SDN) based Sleep Scheduling algorithm SDN-ECCKN is proposed to manage the energy of the network. EC-CKN is adopted as the fundamental algorithm when implementing our algorithm. In the proposed SDN-ECCKN algorithm, every computation is completed in the controller rather than the sensors themselves and there is no broadcasting between each two nodes, which are the main features of the traditional EC-CKN technique. The results of our SDN-ECCKN show its advantages in energy management, such as network lifetime, the number of live nodes and the number of solo nodes in the network. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2456f3202c9fdb7dd6664111da0b3ac5884dec90	dynamic deployment of uav-enabled floating access points for serving hot zones		Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have manifold applications and profound research potential. They can fairly act as access points serving users by forming a mesh network in the air. In disaster hit areas or battlefields, providing communication through infrastructure is impossible due to either time constraints or impracticable ground conditions. The UAVs can be dynamically deployed in such scenarios, forming a mesh network and thereby providing wireless coverage to the users. In this paper, we develop an algorithm, UAVs' Dynamic Positions Rearrangement (UDPR), based on the dynamic demands of the Hot Zones which strives to maximize the total coverage area by all the deployed UAVs hence, serving maximum number of users. Our algorithm caters to the dynamic changes in user load requirements for which the UAVs fly in flock to cover the Hot Zones, at the same time minimize the dead zones. UDPR ensures improved performance of the network by selecting UAVs based on minimum movement and maximum remaining battery life. In our algorithm, we compare two distance traveling approaches while rearranging UAVs: the Juxtapositioning approach (attaining closest possible position) and the Hot Center positioning approach (attaining the Hot Center's position). The Hot Center represents the epicenter of the area corresponding to the overload of spectrum demand in the Hot Zone. The simulation results show that the proposed Hot Center Positioning approach outperforms the primitive Juxtapositioning approach by covering more area (serving more number of users) and at the same time keeping more number of UAVs active.	aerial photography;algorithm;flock;global positioning system;hardiness zone;hot coffee mod;mesh networking;requirement;simulation;software deployment;unmanned aerial vehicle;wireless access point	Amar Nath Patra;Shamik Sengupta	2017	2017 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)	10.23919/SPECTS.2017.8046766	computer network;real-time computing;computer science;software deployment;mesh networking;mobile telephony	Embedded	13.217807785896989	80.06899615390749	47224

Moreover, mobile devices may not be willing to forward data items to other devices due to the limited resources. Hence, effective data dissemination schemes need to be designed to encourage nodes to collaboratively share data. We propose a Multi-Receiver Incentive-Based Dissemination (MuRIS) scheme that allows nodes to cooperatively deliver information of interest to one another via chosen paths utilizing few transmissions. Our scheme exploits local historical paths and users' interests information maintained by each node. In addition, the charge and rewarding functions incorporated within our scheme stimulate cooperation among nodes such that the nodes have no incentive to launch edge insertion attacks. Furthermore, our charge and rewarding functions are designed such that the chosen delivery paths mimic efficient multicast tree that results in fewer delivery hops. Extensive simulation studies using real human contact-based mobility traces show that our scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of delivery ratio and transmission efficiency.	centrality;mobile device;multicast;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;simulation;store and forward;tracing (software)	Yan Wang;Mooi Choo Chuah;Yingying Chen	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130670	wireless ad hoc network;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;information management;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	0.23915457080872024	78.60467182999346	47230

Through their GNSS receiver, peers obtain pseudorange estimates from satellites while they use their wireless interface both to communicate with each other and to obtain terrestrial range estimates. The proposed algorithm is an extended version of the distributed-weighted multidimensional scaling (dwMDS) [1] algorithm to be compatible with the hybrid P2P scenario where unknown peers infer their own positions by fusing both GNSS pseudorange and terrestrial range estimates. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid dwMDS (hdwMDS) algorithm out-performs the cooperative version of the least squares algorithm. Moreover, they show the related benefits in term of positioning performance in a cooperative scenario in comparison to a non cooperative one based on GNSS-only positioning.	algorithm;image scaling;least squares;multidimensional scaling;peer-to-peer;pseudorange;satellite navigation;simulation;terrestrial television	Francesco Sottile;Maurizio A.

It enables the capability of intelligent transportation systems to support safety and infotainment services for vehicles and people on travel. Dissemination in VANETs typically relies on the intelligent election of selected vehicles to act as relay nodes (RNs), which is a critical element that serves to avoid broadcasting storm issues. This paper presents an analytical model for evaluating the performance of a class of distributed beaconless dissemination protocols in a linear VANET (e.g., a highway). NS-2-based simulations are employed to validate the model. The results are used to gain insight into the spurious forwarding problem, which accompanies the use of timer-based VANET networking protocols. We characterize the impact of this phenomenon on the achievable level of the system's broadcast throughput capacity rate. Resolution approaches are proposed and analyzed.	communications protocol;critical graph;hoc (programming language);interaction;message passing;monte carlo method;relay;simulation;throughput;timer	Andrea Baiocchi;Pierpaolo Salvo;Francesca Cuomo;Izhak Rubin	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2422753	vehicular ad hoc network;communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;dissemination;computer network	Mobile	4.184723554356845	87.55937243007651	47270

These mobile nodes can either act as mobile relays or mobile sinks. To investigate the performance of these two options and the trade-offs associated with these two options, we first consider a finite network. We then compute the lifetime for different routing algorithms for three cases (i) when the network is all static (ii) when there is one mobile sink and (iii) when there is one mobile relay. We find that using the mobile node as a sink results in the maximum improvement in lifetime. We contend however that in hostile terrains, it might not always be possible for the sink to be mobile. We then investigate the performance of a large dense network with one mobile relay and show that the improvement in network lifetime over an all static network is upper bounded by a factor of four. Also, the proof implies that the mobile relay needs to stay only within a two hop radius of the sink. We then construct a joint mobility and routing algorithm which comes close to the upper bound. However this algorithm requires all the nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile node. We then proposed an alternative algorithm, which achieves the same performance, but requires only a limited number of nodes in the network to be aware of the location of the mobile. We finally compare the performance of the mobile relay and mobile sink and show that for a densely deployed sensor field of radius R hops, we require O(R) mobile relays to achieve the same performance as the mobile sink.	algorithm;relay;routing	Wei Wang;Vikram Srinivasan;Kee Chaing Chua	2005		10.1145/1080829.1080858	embedded system;mobile ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;small cell;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	7.549530734582889	80.21941469846155	47358

In this work, we evaluate network performance and reliability in the case where several PANs are forced to share the same channel. Based on extensive simulations, we show that inter-network interaction may lead to long periods of disruption, even when the average network performance is very good and the channel is only lightly loaded. We demonstrate that this is mostly due to lack of coordination between networks, rather than limitations of duty cycle or memory.	denial-of-service attack;duty cycle;hypothalamic area, lateral;mobile health;network performance;simulation	Laura Marie Feeney;Viktoria Fodor	2016		10.1145/2944921.2944923	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	17.232777130358542	84.06476384665866	47388

Few proposals can be found in the open literature that deal with the design problem; moreover, they do not take into account all the parameters that have an impact on the outcome of the design and they assume the existence of a physical topology where the location and the characteristics of nodes (e.g., number of channels, number of radios) are fixed. In this paper, we define a generalized model for the WMNs design problem that takes into account all the parameters that have a significant impact on the network (interference, multi-channel, transmission power, etc.), the requirements of providers (expected amount of traffic/users), the constraints of the physical environment (potential locations of wireless routers, e.g., poles, and gateways, e.g., data centers), etc. The objective is to minimize the cost of the network and its operations while satisfying the requirements.

However, with this manner sensors do not ensure full coverage of the Region Of Interest(ROI). So, new problems are emerging in the network such as the existence of uncovered areas (coverage holes) or areas covered by more than one sensor (redundant sensors). Consequently, it is important to pass through a post-deployment phase after a random deployment to improve the area coverage. In this phase, robots are used to carry redundant sensors to fulfill the holes. In this paper, we propose two solutions to deal the problem of sensors relocation. The first one is Simple Relocation Method (SRM) in WSRN. The preliminary phase is a random distribution of the sensors in a bounded and unknown ROI. Once the determination of holes and redundant sensors is completed, the robots move in ROI to relocate nearest (from local information) redundant sensors from their current positions in the nearest hole to increase the coverage. In this proposal, the robots do not explore all area unlike to the most of solutions proposed for relocation. The second solution is the Clustering Relocation Method (CRM) and it is an improvement of the first. In CRM, we added the clustering principle, to minimize the number of messages circulating in the network. Simulation results show the effectiveness of these solutions in terms of relocation time and messages sent.	cluster analysis;region of interest;relocation (computing);robot;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Nadia Belguerche;Mahfoud Benchaïba	2016	2016 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)	10.1109/ISNCC.2016.7746107	embedded system;simulation;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security	Embedded	10.766612586511961	77.47068237482631	47483

In this paper, we propose the interrogation-based relay routing for ad hoc satellite networks, where the satellites interrogate each other to learn more about network topology and nodal capacity to make intelligent routing decisions. Simulations have been conducted to study the effects of buffer space, satellite density, and orbital patterns on the throughput of ad hoc satellite networks using interrogation-based relay routing.	computer simulation;distributed computing;hoc (programming language);information system;molecular orbital;network topology;relay;routing;sparse matrix;throughput	Chien-Chung Shen;Girish Borkar;Sundaram Rajagopalan;Chaiporn Jaikaeo	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1189163	vehicular ad hoc network;policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	0.7913555495654607	81.80112018185008	47502

While lower threshold voltages increase leakage, lower supply voltages and smaller nodal capacitances reduce energy consumption but increase soft errors rates. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of soft error rates on low-power cache design. First, we study the effect of circuit level techniques, used to reduce the leakage energy consumption, on soft error rates. Our results using custom designs show that many of these approaches may increase the soft error rates as compared to a standard 6T SRAM. We also validate the effects of voltage scaling on soft error rate by performing accelerated tests on off-the-shelf SRAM-based chips using a neutron beam source. Next, we study the impact of cache decay and drowsy cache, which are two commonly used architectural-level leakage reduction approaches, on the cache reliability. Our results indicate that the leakage optimization techniques change the reliability of cache memory. More importantly, we demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between optimizing for leakage power and improving the immunity to soft error. We also study the impact of error correcting codes on soft error rates. Based on this study, we propose an adaptive error correcting scheme to reduce the leakage energy consumption and improve reliability.	cpu cache;cache (computing);cache coherence;code;cross section (geometry);dynamic voltage scaling;error detection and correction;ieee-488;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;memory cell (binary);microwave;optimizing compiler;reactor (software);simulation;soft error;spectral leakage;static random-access memory;test data;very-large-scale integration;vii	Vijay Degalahal;Lin Li;Narayanan Vijaykrishnan;Mahmut T.

In order to support applications requiring dedicated bandwidth or bounded delay, it provides a reservation-based scheme named Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS). However, the GTS scheme presents some drawbacks, such as inefficient bandwidth utilization and support to a maximum of only seven devices. This paper presents eLPRT (enhanced Low Power Real Time), a new reservation-based MAC protocol that introduces several performance enhancing features in comparison to the GTS scheme. This MAC protocol builds on top of LPRT (Low Power Real Time) and includes various mechanisms designed to increase data transmission reliability against channel errors, improve bandwidth utilization and increase the number of supported devices. A motion capture system based on inertial and magnetic sensors has been used to validate the protocol. The effectiveness of the performance enhancements introduced by each of the new features is demonstrated through the provision of both simulation and experimental results.	access control;global telecommunications system;motion capture;name;simulation;sensor (device)	José A.

e86805c98ad5d8d2e201ad95e2efa3108ff1151d	gttpm - an efficient deadlock-free multicast wormhold algorithm for communication in 2d torus multicomputers		ABSTRACT Multicomputer systems are the popular architectures for achieving high computing power in various scientific and engineering applications. The torus topology is important in multicomputer design because of its many features. This paper presents an efficient algorithm, GTTPM, that implements multicast communication to find a deadlock-free wormhole routing in two-dimensional torus networks. The introduced algorithm is designed such that can send messages to any number of destinations within two start-up communication phases without any restrictions in the number of rows or columns in a network; hence the name General Torus Two-Phase Multicast (GTTPM) algorithm. An efficient routing function is designed and used as a basis for the presented algorithm. Simulation studies on different torus networks are demonstrated to compare the performance of GTTPM with a previous algorithm.

030f9ca4d41446a280d02a71e2cf46fe4c1d2030	on the communication complexity of perfectly secure message transmission in directed networks	information theoretic security	In this paper, we re-visit the problem of perfectly secure message transmission (PSMT) in a directed network under the presence of a threshold adaptive Byzantine adversary, having unbounded computing power. Desmedt et.al [5] have given the characterization for three or more phase PSMT protocols over directed networks. Recently, Patra et. al. [15] have given the characterization of two phase PSMT over directed networks. Even though the issue of tradeoff between phase complexity and communication complexity of PSMT protocols has been resolved in undirected networks, nothing is known in the literature regarding directed networks. In this paper, we completely settle down this issue. Specifically, we derive the lower bounds on communication complexity of (a) two phase PSMT protocols and (b) three or more phase PSMT protocols in directed networks. Moreover, we show that our lower bounds are asymptotically tight, by designing communication optimal PSMT protocols in directed networks, which are first of their kind. We re-visit the problem of perfectly reliable message transmission (PRMT) as well. Any PRMT protocol that sends a message containing ` field elements, has a trivial lower bound of Ω(`) (field elements) on its communication complexity. Thus any PRMT protocol that sends a message of ` field elements by communicating O(`) field elements, is referred as communication optimal PRMT or PRMT with constant factor overhead. Here, we characterize the class of directed networks over which communication optimal PRMT or PRMT with constant factor overhead is possible. Moreover, we design a communication optimal PRMT over a directed network that satisfies the conditions stated in our characterization. Our communication optimal PRMT/PSMT protocols employ several new techniques based on coding theory, which are of independent interest.	adversary (cryptography);byzantine fault tolerance;coding theory;communication complexity;directed graph;emoticon;graph (discrete mathematics);overhead (computing)	Arpita Patra;Ashish Choudhury;C.

Since the nodes are likely to be power constrained, they will be reluctant to cooperate and use their limited power resources for forwarding packets for others. We propose an on-demand routing protocol that enforces cooperation by requiring nodes to forward so as to earn credits to pay for self transmissions. We also incorporate a forwarding rule that increases self transmissions in the cooperative environment. Simulation results show that, compared to pure AODV-like and pure reward-based on-demand routing, our proposed approach significantly extends the network's lifetime so that more data can be transmitted and carried during this period.	hoc (programming language);network packet;routing;simulation;transmitter	Wesley Chee-Wah Tan;Sanjay K.

In a unit graph, two nodes can communicate if and only if the distance between them is no more than the transmission radius, which is the same for each node. A localized routing algorithm that guarantees delivery in connected unit graphs has been described recently. Also, several power, cost and power-cost aware metrics and localized loop-free routing algorithms for wireless networks based on the exact power needed for transmission between two nodes, and/or remaining battery power at nodes were proposed. However, these algorithms did not guarantee the delivery of a message in connected unit graphs. This paper proposes such localized routing algorithms, aimed at minimizing total power for routing a message, or maximizing the total number of routing tasks that a network can perform before a partition. The algorithms are combinations of known greedy power and/or cost aware localized routing algorithms and an algorithm that guarantees delivery. A shortcut procedure is introduced in later algorithm to enhance its performance. The efficiency of proposed algorithms is verified experimentally by comparing their power savings, and the number of routing tasks a network can perform before a node loses all its energy, with the corresponding shortest weighted path algorithms, and localized algorithms that use fixed transmission power at each node. Significant energy savings (which depend mainly on network density and maximum transmission radius) are obtained.	cost efficiency;experiment;greedy algorithm;keyboard shortcut;network packet;routing	Ivan Stojmenovic;Susanta Datta	2002		10.1109/ISCC.2002.1021654	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;graph theory;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.892726556597652	80.17690564577401	47727

On chip communicating systems are vulnerable to permanent network faults and transient faults which might essentially affect the performance of the system. Targeting at fault tolerance solution for cores with faults in Network on Chip (NoC), this paper proposes an energy efficient fault tolerant NoC architecture using spare core. The proposed strategy comprises of finding smallest rectangular region to place the given application using a heuristic technique, and mapping vertices within the selected region, and selecting a region which results maximum overall performance and minimum communication energy. Spare core is placed within a region and connected to the vertices. Many application core graphs are used to evaluate the proposed technique. The simulation outcomes of many fault injection tests indicate that the proposed technique results in performance enhancement while also saving communication energy.	algorithm;digital video recorder;embedded system;fault injection;fault tolerance;heuristic;multi-core processor;network access device;network on a chip;routing;simulation;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	B.

Playing an important role in rescuing victims, the communication system in the disaster area is usually destroyed. The mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) can replace the original system. MANET can be deployed in the form of peer-to-peer (P2P) approach or infrastructure-based (IB) approach. However, both approaches still have limited flexibility and reliability. Our hybrid approach overcomes the limitations by combining advantages of P2P approach and those of IB approach. The hybrid approach allows victims to directly communicate to rescuers in the disaster area. Since victims need immediate helps from rescuers, appropriate destinations must be selected. Our design of hybrid approach allows victims to quickly send messages to the nearest rescuers without compromising the traffic to a base station. The experiment shows that our hybrid approach provides more than 98% of packet delivery ratio to rescuers.	algorithm;disaster recovery;hoc (programming language);mesh networking;multitier architecture;network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;router (computing);single-board computer	Tanapat Ruengsatra;Kulit Na Nakorn;Krerk Piromsopa;Kultida Rojviboonchai	2015	2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)	10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176220	vehicular ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;routing protocol;computer security;disaster recovery;computer network	SE	2.649976005781167	85.07805738656232	47755

A typical scenario from an intensive care unit, with data from three vital sign sensors, is used as an example for both hardware and software simulations. Results show that data throughput in such biomedical networks is greatly depended on packet size while competing for channel access.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of a large number of randomly deployed sensors with unattended batteries and constrained device capabilities. For non-uniform and resource-sensitive WSNs multicast protocols also have taken an overlay approach. The protocols establish a cost-optimal structure, a Steiner tree, among destinations as an overlay structure and exploit geographic routing for unicasting. However, such concentration on the Steiner tree structure may paradoxically burden the irregular and resource-constrained WSNs with heavy loads for heuristic structure construction and fault-tolerant maintenance. In addition, it leads to frequent tree reconstruction, thus it could harm data multicast transmission seriously. Regarding these problems, we consider a proxy district per a destination for overlay tree formation to prevent structural dynamic alteration and support local state management. This district-based overlay multicast might be able to keep the stateless advantages of traditional overlay multicast. By overhead analysis and various computational simulations, we prove that our proposal provides robust and efficient multicast transmission.	computer simulation;cost efficiency;fault tolerance;geographic routing;heuristic;local variable;multicast;overhead (computing);overlay network;randomness;scalability;sensor;simulation;soft state;state management;stateless protocol;steiner tree problem;structural dynamics;tree structure;unicast	Soochang Park;Noël Crespi;Seungmin Oh;Sang Ha Kim	2013	2013 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications	10.1109/NCA.2013.44	fault tolerance;multicast;overlay network;wireless sensor network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;mbone;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer security;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Networks	5.003283278879874	78.99260948068957	47829

The objective is to minimize the total routing cost, which only depends on positions. The grid-based directional routing consists of two stages: equally spaced grid points compute their routing directions and each node uses the routing direction of the closest grid point as guidance to determine its next forwarding node. This paper mainly describes two approaches for the first stage, based on Dijkstra's method and the fast marching method. Our simulation results reveal that the routing directions derived by the fast marching method work better for determining the minimum cost paths.	approximation;dijkstra's algorithm;fm broadcasting;fast marching method;gadm;gradient;numerical analysis;routing;simulation	Jing-Ya Li;Ren-Song Ko	2014	The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)	10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799680	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;wireless sensor network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Robotics	5.41851376933798	81.0003418641118	47832

In our previous work, we proposed two broadcast schemes, fuzzy logic-based broadcast (FLB) and bandwidth-efficient fuzzy logic-assisted broadcast (BEFLAB). FLB offers high level of reachability where BEFLAB is more bandwidth efficient. While high reachability is a challenge in sparse networks, bandwidth efficiency is needed in dense networks. The goal of this paper is to propose an intelligent hybrid adaptive broadcast (IHAB) scheme that combines the strength of FLB and BEFLAB. In order to design a bandwidth efficient VANET broadcast scheme with high level of reachability, a receiver vehicle determines its number of common neighbors with the transmitting neighbors and treat it as the potential transmit density (PDT). If PDT exceeds a threshold (dense network) the receiver vehicle will use BEFLAB method to decide whether to rebroadcast, otherwise (sparse network)FLB will be used. Ns-3 simulations have been developed to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed system in terms of reachability, the average number of rebroadcasts per covered node, and bytes sent per covered node. The proposed protocol performed well compared to FLB, BEFLAB, DTM, DADCQ, SLAB, and CSBD. Overall, IHAB is shown to have higher reachability level than BEFLAB and better bandwidth efficiency than FLB.	byte;fuzzy logic;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);php development tools;reachability;simulation;software propagation;sparse matrix;spectral efficiency;transmitter	Elnaz Limouchi;Imad Mahgoub	2016	2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777895	fuzzy logic;communications protocol;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;computer security;broadcasting;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	4.782453536354858	86.61565791689094	47952

Considering the high accuracy feature of error correction, this paper provides a novel sensor positioning algorithm named ECL (An extended centroid localization algorithm based on error correction), which greatly improves the positioning accuracy. By analyzing the probability distribution of measurement error, the mathematical expression of measurement error based on two-point positioning scheme is given. Then the high-accuracy positioning is completed until the estimated coordinates based on three-point positioning have been corrected. In addition, the proposed ECL algorithm uses some sensors, which have known locations, participating in the second localization, and further improving centroid localization algorithm for reliability and practicality. Simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy and validity of the proposed algorithm all outperform conventional methods with acceptable complexity.	algorithm;error detection and correction;sensor;simulation	Weixiao Meng;Dekun Zhang;Yuxin Wang;Cheng Li	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036848	embedded system;algorithm design;wireless sensor network;global positioning system;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;accuracy and precision;statistics;observational error	Robotics	16.50029947759095	74.98461743354179	48151
a38a4a6762d64ad5feea8e081c7c73664f842a6b	network under limited mobile sensors: new techniques for weighted target coverage and sensor connectivity		In mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), each sensor has the ability not only to sense and transmit data but also to move to some specific location. Because the movement of sensors consumes much more power than that in sensing and communication, the problem of scheduling mobile sensors to cover all targets and maintain network connectivity such that the total movement distance of mobile sensors is minimized has received a great deal of attention. However, in reality, due to a limited budget or numerous targets, mobile sensors may be not enough to cover all targets or form a connected network. Therefore, targets must be weighted by their importance. The more important a target, the higher the weight of the target. A more general problem for target coverage and network connectivity, termed the Maximum Weighted Target Coverage and Sensor Connectivity with Limited Mobile Sensors (MWTCSCLMS) problem, is studied. In this paper, an approximation algorithm, termed the weighted-maximum-coverage-based algorithm (WMCBA), is proposed for the subproblem of the MWTCSCLMS problem. Based on the WMCBA, the Steiner-tree-based algorithm (STBA) is proposed for the MWTCSCLMS problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the STBA provides better performance than the other methods.	approximation algorithm;mobile phone;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;steiner tree problem	Ngoc-Tu Nguyen;Bing-Hong Liu;Shih-Yuan Wang	2017	2017 IEEE 42nd Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2017.52	computer network;wireless sensor network;np-complete;approximation algorithm;scheduling (computing);computer science;mobile computing;mobile telephony;distributed computing;schedule;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	12.424714523116965	78.62184358181669	48161
b3584e64ab88fc713605310f9628f04b7cbb2f6b	small wearable antenna with folded ground for body-centric wireless communications		The miniaturization of electronic devices is leading to the creation of body-centric wireless communications, in which wireless devices are attached to human body. However, the human body environment is often uninviting for wireless signals owing to the mutual influence between the human body and wireless devicesu0027 antennas, namely wearable antennas. Therefore, wearable antennas need to be carefully designed. In this paper, a small wearable antenna with folded ground at 2.4GHz is proposed. The folded ground has two effects: one is to improve efficiency and the other is to enhance bandwidth. When the antenna is very close to human body, it has an efficiency of 50.7% and a wide operation bandwidth of 130MHz.

However, there are a great many fixed routing systems in use on actual networks because they are simple. In fixed routing, a principal issue is which method should be used for switching to alternate routes in cases where damage to links or nodes blocks off primary routes. In the majority of cases, routing is changed by switching the links over which the packets are sent (called outgoing links). However, the methods have not yet been perfected-ping pong, looping, and other erroneous-routing phenomena arise occasionally. This paper presents a distributed algorithm to solve these problems. An algorithm will be given for restoring the original routes after recovery from damage. Finally, it will be proved that erroneous routing will not arise even when multiple chains of operations based on the algorithms presented are in progress at the same time.	distributed algorithm;routing	Hiroto Kawahara	1996	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/scj.4690270301	routing table;routing domain;distributed algorithm;routing;static routing;dsrflow;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;artificial intelligence;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;administrative distance;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;geographic routing;algorithm;routing information protocol	Networks	-3.923020844123962	74.46089641174243	48216
ae3bc469f120ce5aadb1a5d02e389b5d52adae1f	gossiping along the path: a direction-biased routing scheme for wireless ad hoc networks		Like any communication networks, Wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs) require routing to support many applications such as data aggregation and over-the- air firmware update. Traditional route discovery in WANETs floods request all over the network causing broadcast storm that will heavily consume the precious power resources on nodes. To respond, gossip routing is proposed to reduce the number of messages. In recent years, several algorithms have been developed to improve its efficiency using location information. However, they only make use of distance but not directional information which is much cheaper to acquire in WANETs. In this paper, we develop an approach to improve location- aided routing by making use of directional information, with and without distance information. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms existing gossip routing algorithms, including location-aided ones, on random and deployed WSNs. When only general direction information of nodes is given, performances of our algorithms only drop slightly. Hoping this approach can also benefit other types of routing tasks, we also migrate the spirit of this algorithm onto opportunistic routing and show improved performance than existing location-aided opportunistic routing.	algorithm;broadcast radiation;data aggregation;firmware;gossip protocol;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;patch (computing);performance;routing;scalability;telecommunications network	Yaowei Yan;Nghi Huu Tran;Forrest Sheng Bao	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417867	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;estimation;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;wireless sensor network;global positioning system;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;storm;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.917868268774703	81.88743658221124	48275

QDR-WideIO achieves latency of 13 cycles for read and 8 cycles for write with density of 288Mb with core operating at 1500 MHz.

Such systems permit interprocessor communication in the presence of faulty components in the network. The interconnection network considered is a delta network augmented with an extra switching stage in front. When the first and last stages are fault-free, the extra-stage delta networks continue to provide full access in the presence of all single and many multiple faults in switching elements of the intermediate stages. In this paper, we use graph-theoretic techniques to study the problem of routing permutations in extra-stage delta networks when faults are present in the network. We first formulate the problem of performing an arbitrary permutation on the fault-free network as a vertex-coloring problem and later extend this to networks with noncritical faults. Although the general problem of realizing a permutation in the minimum number of passes is intractable, classes of permutations with some regularity can be routed optimally.

WMIs can allow coverage over large areas with low setup and maintenance overheads. However, WMIs may be susceptible to loss of network connectivity caused by node damage or energy depletion. The end-to-end reachability is essential for the WMI to provide network service to users. This paper studies the problem of network self-recovery to sustain reachability in a WMI network by utilizing autonomous mobile base stations (MBSs). It is assumed that MBS is able to move to and pause or stop at positions in the network area. An MBS could be a self-driving robotic vehicle, or vehicle driven directly or remotely by a human. The proposed MBS approach, MBS-Fit, is a distributed and packet-interaction-based mechanism that allows MBS to automatically construct new routes, assess, and adaptively respond to the fitness of pause positions, such that MBS can provide links to recover the disconnected WMIs. We adopt packet-level evaluation to study the automatic interactions of MBS with the static WMI objects. In particular, the network reachability is measured by the amount of packets successfully delivered from users to the gateway through the WMI. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MBS-Fit approach achieves up to 30% improvement of network reachability in terms of successfully packet delivery compared with the conventional MBS. MBS-Fit mechanism also enables up to 80% improvement in terms of number of packets forwarded at MBS.	autonomous robot;depletion region;end-to-end principle;hop;interaction;internet access;network packet;reachability;simulation;smart city;wireless router	Rui Teng;Huan-Bang Li;Ryu Miura	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2523539	maintenance engineering;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	2.7097976405896165	84.66677978326472	48441

First, because of the large-scale features of sensor node network, this paper proposes a large-scale monitoring network area clustering optimization strategy. Second, based on the characteristics of regular changes in the sensed data in large-scale monitoring networks, this paper proposes a strategy for acquiring sensor data based on an adaptive frequency conversion. The OFS optimization strategy can prolong network lifetime, reduce the transmission bandwidth resources, and reduce average energy consumption of the cluster head and network energy consumption.

19ae857007e5e2b60661f1586718b8f88d7c17e1	smartag: error correction in cache tag array by exploiting address locality		Soft errors in on-chip caches are the major cause of processors failure. Partitioning the cache into data and tag arrays, recent reports show that the vulnerability of the latter is as high as or even higher than that of the former. Although Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are widely used to protect the data array, their overheads are not affordable in the tag array and its protection is conventionally limited to parity code. In this paper, we propose Similarity-Managed Robust Tag (SMARTag) technique to provide the error correction capability in parity-protected tags. SMARTag exploits the inherent similarity between the upper parts of the tags in a cache set to share these parts between addresses and ECCs. Using SMARTag, the cache access time is intact since the ECC part is bypassed in normal cache operation and no extra memory is required since ECCs are stored in available tag space. The simulation results show that SMARTag is capable of correcting more than 98% of errors in the tag array, on average, and its energy consumption, area, and performance overhead is less than 0.2%.	access time;cpu cache;central processing unit;design automation and test in europe;error detection and correction;locality of reference;multi-core processor;overhead (computing);parity bit;qr code;simulation	Seyedeh Golsana Ghaemi;Iman Ahmadpour;Mehdi Ardebili;Hamed Farbeh	2018	2018 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)	10.23919/DATE.2018.8467758	real-time computing;access time;system on a chip;parallel computing;cache;computer science;error detection and correction;parity (mathematics);exploit;overhead (business);array data type	Arch	7.03629774795969	60.839485753242805	48563

Ubiquitous adoption of connectivity in between different kinds of sensors, wearable devices, and other low-power equipment raises an importance of the energy-efficient wireless communications. In LTE/LTE-A, the discontinuous reception mechanism (DRX) aims at power saving of user equipment (UE) devices. In this paper, we present an analysis of DRX, which is novel in two dimensions. First, our analytical approach is different from existing ones due to the use of Markov chain instead of the semi-Markov ones. Secondly, along with the generic traffic models, we also analyze the efficiency of DRX for military training application systems, what has not been done before. We suggest few practical recommendations regarding the DRX parameters tuning also.	compaq lte;discontinuous reception;low-power broadcasting;markov chain;performance evaluation;performance tuning;semiconductor industry;sensor;wake-on-lan;wearable technology	Hawar Ramazanali;Alexey V.

We model the battery as a server with finite service capacity and data packets as customers to be served. With an intent to exploit the recharging capability of the battery when left idle, we allow the battery to go on intentional vacations during which the battery can recharge itself. The recharge thus built up can effectively increase the number of customers served (in other words, battery life can be extended). Such improved battery life performance would, however, come at the expense of increased packet delay performance. We quantify the battery life gain versus delay performance trade-off in this approach through analysis and simulations. By considering a continuous recharge model of the battery, we derive expressions for the number of customers served and the mean delay for an queueing system without and with server vacations. We show that allowing intentional vacations during busy periods helps to increase battery life, and that this approach can be beneficial when applied on traffic of delay-tolerant applications. We also propose a packet delay constrained power saving algorithm that will exploit the recharge phenomenon when packet delay constraints are imposed.	algorithm;mobile device;network packet;power management;profiling (computer programming);queueing theory;rechargeable battery;server (computing);simulation	Balakrishna J.

Such systems are referred to as 'X-by-wire' systems, where X refers to the specific type of system that is being controlled. The requirements for the multiplexed control network in X-by-wire systems demand the use of fast, safe, fault-tolerant, in-vehicle control networks. Research has established the time-triggered architecture as the most suitable approach for X-by-wire applications. In the time-triggered architecture, all activity of message exchange is synchronized to a global timebase and all nodes in the network perform their tasks based on a message schedule, which is strictly synchronized to this global timebase. A number of different types of control network protocols are emerging, based on the time-triggered architecture. The industry will soon decide on which of these networks will become the de-facto standards for X-by-wire applications. Other future network protocols will also find use in the automotive systems and there will be a need to communicate control message data across different types of time-triggered networks, with different specifications and protocols; realizing the need for a new type of real-time gateway for time-triggered control networks. Such a gateway concept is proposed in this paper and its design architecture is described at an early prototype level. A FPGA based digital IC is developed to demonstrate the concept. The prototype has been evaluated and the results are presented to show the deterministic real-time behaviour of the gateway. Four types of state-of-the-art time-triggered networks are supported in the prototype design, i.e., FlexRay, Byteflight, TTP/C and TTCAN. The core gateway architecture has been adopted from state-of-the-art packet switching techniques as used in ATM networks. Special purpose Network Host Processors (NHP) implement the protocol conversion routines to convert frames from network to gateway core format and vice versa.

In such scenarios, it is very important to use efficient service discovery algorithms adapt dynamically network changes. In this paper, we present a two level hierarchy for efficient service discovery. First, Proximal Neighborhood Discovery is prerequisite for service discovery followed by Optimal Service Discovery (OSD) which is based on the set of peers that a node should choose in order to utilize its requirements, instead of implementing all its required services itself. We present OSD algorithm, as a new approach in searching for the efficient service providers to obtain required services. We implement the proposed scheme in nesC and perform simulations using the interference-model in TOSSIM. The results show appreciable improvements over conventional approaches.	algorithm;feasible region;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;nesc;object storage;particle swarm optimization;programming language;randomness;requirement;robustness (computer science);sensor;service discovery;shape optimization;simulation;terminate (software);tinyos;ubiquitous computing	Ayon Chakraborty;Kaushik Lahiri;Subhajit Mandal;Deepankar Patra;Mrinal K.

For reliability, retransmission scheme was adopted. The main idea of the proposed method is that network node does take care of error recovery by retransmission instead of a sender or receivers by which conventional methods have been done. Consequently terminal mobility can be dealt with more simple. This paper shows that the proposed method has much better pe r f o rm an c e comp ared wi th ex i s t i n g meth ods th rou gh s i mu la t i on . group members. The second is reliability that is to guarantee error-free in the sending data at all receivers. There are two classified techniques for reliability. One is feedback-less scheme, which adds to the multicast data, some redundant information so that receivers could correct the erroneous data using the redundant information. The other is feedback (reception state report) scheme; retransmission which sends again the same data to the erroneous receivers. Our concern is on feedback approach for complete (high) reliability. The third is high scalability, which is to be able to deal with extremely many mobile receivers with connection to networks, is essential to the service. The last is terminal mobility that is to guarantee the continuation of service session for moving receivers. There are already several scalable and reliable multicast protocols with retransmission for reliability. They address the scheme to avoid implosion problem, which is caused by swamping on a sender with feedback messages from all receivers, in order to obtain scalability. SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast) [4] proposes the random delay feedback scheme with multicast to reduce the implosion on the sender. A receiver suppresses its feedback after its random time passed if another receiver responds the same feedback. A successful receiver retransmits the data for erroneous MTs. PGM (Pretty Good Multicast) [5], LGMP (Local Group Multicast Protocol) [6], RMTP (Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol) [7] [8] and MESH protocol [9] employ local group (LG) concept to avoid the implosion and aim at shorter delay on recovery. In these methods a multicast group is divided into several LGs for local recovery. The main difference exists on the way to define LG and determine local controller (LC) of the group for the recovery. In PGM, error-free receiver volunteers to become LC. Hence LCs dynamically changes. On the other hand, LGMP, RMTP and MESH adopt fixed LC scheme. That is, LC is pre-defined depending on the multicast service type and network topology. MESH protocol [9] is targeted on the specific application of time-constrained data streams. Therefore, high reliability could not be gained since it protects delay-sensitive stream against errors. As shown so far, the conventional methods can provide scalable and reliable multicast system. However, no consideration for mobile environment in these existing methods causes following the problems. For example, the low capacity of the wireless link between network and LC does not always lead to efficient recovery. The movement of LC could make local recovery complex. Consequently, these conventional methods do not have aspect to meet the described requirements. This paper provides a new method of scalable and reliable multicast system not only for fixed networks, but also for mobile networks. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II shows the conventional approach and discusses its characteristics. Section III presents the new method in detail. In the Section IV, the evaluation of the new method is shown through comparing to conventional methods by computer simulation. Finally, Section V describes the concluding remarks. 2 Conventional Approach and New Approach Regarding the existing method, we categorized existing methods into two types of approach with respect to who does take care of recovery. 2.1 Conventional approach (1) Sender-Based approach (SB) A sender performs retransmission with Nack (error report) or/and Ack (error-free report) feedback scheme. In SB approach, the sender repeats retransmission in multicast until all members get multicasting data correctly. This approach includes typical point-to-point reliable protocols (TCP, HDLC etc.) and early multicasting protocol. This approach causes implosion problem with the number of member increased. And the bandwidth for feedback is required over the whole network, i.e., resource consuming problem issues. (2) Receiver-Based Approach (RB) This approach employs local group concept. In this approach, recovery is carried out by a receiver which represents its LG instead of sender. LC (Local Controller) is predefined. It can avoid implosion problem thanks to local management of feedback and recovery. Recent most efforts, SRM, PGM, LGMP, RMTP and MESH that I cited in section1, belong to this approach. As already explained, the problem for mobile network is that the low capacity and instable quality of the wireless link and the low performance of LC make local recovery inefficient. Other is that the movement of LC could cause terminal mobility difficult. 2.2 New approach (3) Network-Based Approach (NB) The new approach also adopts local group concept. In this approach, it is a network node that takes care of recovery instead of a sender or receivers. The node forms LG dynamically to execute local recovery. Therefore, it is not difficult for the network to track the movement of MT with usage of terminal mobility function of mobile network. As a result, it is expected to solve the problems that conventional approach issues as explained previously, and to satisfy the four requirements that described in section1. The next section explains the new method including how to decide the network node as LC in the next section. 3 New Method 3.1 Network architecture We assume mobile network with IP-based which is constructed by router as network node. The network consists of several subnetworks in Figure1(a). Each subnetwork is connected by Border Router (BR) which keeps temporarily relaying data frames for recovery, or manages local group address and so on for management of subnetwork. Figure1(b) illustrates an example of subnetwork near MT. In this Figure, router3 and router5, which are LCs for local group1 and local group2, respectively, request and download recovery data from BR for its own group.	acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;border gateway protocol;care-of address;categorization;computer simulation;continuation;document structure description;download;feedback;linear algebra;multicast;naive bayes classifier;network architecture;network congestion;network topology;point-to-point protocol;requirement;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);sandy bridge;scalability;secure remove;subnetwork;system reference manual	Masato Hayashi;Christian Bonnet	2001		10.1007/3-540-47734-9_4	computer simulation;receiver;cellular network;multicast;simulation;mobile telephony;reliable multicast;telecommunications;receptor;computer science;operating system;pragmatic general multicast;simulation modeling;reliability;mobile computing;telecommunications network;statistics;computer network	Web+IR	-3.1584000042048728	76.9936806741159	48705

Sensors near the sinks have to participate in relaying data on behalf of other sensors and thus will deplete their energy very quickly, resulting in network partitioning and limitation of the network lifetime. The solution that we propose in this paper is to use mobile sinks that change their location when the nearby sensors’ energy becomes low. In this way the sensors located near sinks change over time. In deciding a new location, a sink searches for zones with richer sensor energy. First, we study the improvement in network lifetime when sinks move on a predetermined path, along the perimeter of a hexagonal tiling. Two cases are considered for data gathering when sinks stop in the hexagon’s corners and when the sinks stop on multiple locations on the hexagon perimeter. This study shows an improvement of up to 4.86 times in network lifetime. Second, we design a distributed and localized algorithm used by the sinks to decide their next movement location such that the virtual backbone formed by the sinks remains interconnected at all times. Two extensions of the distributed algorithm, coverage requirement and limitation of the time-delivery requirement, are also addressed. Simulation results are presented to verify our approaches. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At present, several systems are proposed mainly relying on 802.11g/n standards which offer adequate bandwidth for HD video contents. However, the rapid revolution in wireless communication in past years has increased the demand of radio spectrum to fulfill the requirements of wireless applications, leading to spectrum overcrowding. The licensed-free ISM band is now overexploited and experiences serious coexistence issues. However, the transition from analog to digital TV is in progress worldwide and digital switchover plans have driven a thorough review of TV spectrum exploitation. Huge debates are taking place within the wireless world about the possible exploitation of the unused portion of the TV spectrum. Within this framework, this paper proposes a multi-vision system working on the TV band for the short-range indoor transmission of HDTV contents. The proposed system relies on geo-location databases for the TV band, it is based on the OFDM core technology and it is compliant with the DVB-T/T2 standard for HDTV. The authors investigated the feasibility of the system whereas preserving the integrity of incumbent services: computer simulations have been supported by hardware implementations on USRP2 SDR board for test-bed measures and transmission in real conditions.	analog-to-digital converter;coexist (image);computer simulation;database;digital video broadcasting;etsi satellite digital radio;geolocation;requirement;sfiaplus;switchover;testbed	Mauro Fadda;Maurizio Murroni;Vlad Popescu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2012.2201559	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;interference;wireless	Networks	21.852918232008168	84.01304789242106	48869

For this reason, it is imperative to mitigate these risks by developing counterfeit IC detection techniques, especially at the chip level. In this paper, a novel counterfeit IC detection method is proposed. It is based on the measurement of intrinsic light emission from CMOS ICs that is a strong function of the device threshold voltage (Vt) for a given technology. In contrast to currently available counterfeit IC detection techniques, the proposed method measures IC degradation after it has been used for a long time and does not require a reference IC to provide a baseline signature. A differential technique is used to detect different levels of degradation inside the same chip in order to determine if it is counterfeit. Experimental results presented in this paper show that emission can be effectively used to detect degradation, thus making this technique a very effective way to detect counterfeit ICs.	baseline (configuration management);cmos;elegant degradation;imperative programming;integrated circuit	Peilin Song;Franco Stellari;Alan J.

Next, we present our TSC identification technique based on the correlation between the key and the covert physical side channels used by attackers.

Smart (directional) antennas can enhance the functionalities of RSs by forming one or multiple beams only towards intended receivers. In this paper, we focus on the topology control approach for efficient communications in wireless relay networks with smart antennas. This approach precomputes an antenna pattern for each node such that an efficient network topology can be formed for future communications. The corresponding optimization problem is formally defined as the Beam Selection Problem (BSP). First, we present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to provide optimal solutions. Then we present a Linear Programming (LP) rounding-based algorithm for the BSP and show it has a constant factor approximation ratio. We also present a simple and fast greedy algorithm to solve the problem. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithms provide close-to-optimal performance.	approximation algorithm;greedy algorithm;integer programming;internet relay chat;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network topology;optimization problem;radiation pattern;rounding;selection algorithm;simulation;smart antenna;topology control	Brendan M Mumey;Jian Tang;Yun Xing;Richard S.

The large-scale earthquake and tsunami affected many exchange office buildings and facilities. Further damage to services was caused due to the depletion of batteries associated with the prolonged disruption of the commercial power supply. The tremendous disaster caused service disruption to the communications infrastructure; in the case of NTT's facilities, approximately 1.5 million circuits for fixed lines and 4900 mobile base stations stopped working due to direct damage by the earthquake and/or tsunami or subsequent blackouts. However, more than 90 percent of the affected exchange offices and mobile base station equipment was restored by the end of March through an all-out effort by over 11,000 people. Even by the end of April, in areas where customers currently reside, service restoration has mostly been completed except for some areas experiencing construction difficulties, including damaged roads which made it difficult for workers to approach the site. In parallel with the restoration effort, a disaster emergency message service for voice, mobile, and the Internet was quickly provided in order to permit safety confirmation. The NTT Group installed temporary public telephones and Internet access environments, and also lent mobile phones, satellite mobile phones, and tablets free of charge to the affected people and government agencies. Since communication services are vital in modern society, we are making every effort to implement better countermeasures with future disasters in mind.	circuit restoration;denial-of-service attack;depletion region;internet access;mobile phone;power supply	Mitsuyoshi Kobayashi	2014	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766080	the internet;telecommunications;computer science;telecommunications equipment;law;computer security	Mobile	3.33419582984137	71.86403581275009	49231

Although end-to-end connectivity may not be available between two nodes, DTN routing protocols take advantage of temporal paths created in the network as nodes encounter their neighbors and exchange messages they have been asked to forward. Since there are no guarantees that a route will ever be available, many current DTN routing protocols apply epidemicstyle techniques [9], leveraging the fact that an increased number of copies of a particular message in the network should improve the probability that the message will reach its intended destination. However, such techniques come at a high price in terms of network resources, resulting in the rapid deletion of buffer space and energy on resource-limited devices, the rapid depletion of available bandwidth, and the potential to greatly increase end-to-end delay.	delay-tolerant networking;denial-of-service attack;depletion region;end-to-end principle;routing;store and forward	Samuel C.

The proposed STM takes into account the characteristics of the operating environment and performs estimation of the transmitter parameters, i.e. its location, antenna diagram, antenna azimuth, transmit power, as well the parameters of the propagation model to obtain the best match between the available measurements and the predicted signal levels. We compare STM to several most often considered existing methods using different numbers of randomly distributed measurements, which could in practice be obtained in a participatory-like manner. The performance evaluation of the methods is performed in terms of averaged root mean square error (RMSE) and 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated between the constructed RF-REMs and the reference RF-REM, as well as in terms of false alarm zone ratio (FAZR) and correct detection zone ratio (CDZR1). The analysis shows the robustness of the STM to various spatial distributions of measurements and its fast convergence and low residual root mean square error compared to the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, the inverse distance square weighted method (IDW2), the Kriging method, and the location estimation-based method (LIvE).	diagram;interval arithmetic;investigative data warehouse;kriging;location-based service;mean squared error;operating environment;performance evaluation;radio frequency;randomness;reflection mapping;self-tuning;software propagation;software transactional memory;transmitter	Marko Pesko;Tomaz Javornik;Luka Vidmar;Andrej Kosir;Mitja Stular;Mihael Mohorcic	2015	EURASIP J.

First, Bluelayer uses a designated root to construct a tree-shaped subnet and propagates an integer variable k1 called counter limit as well as a constant k in its downstream direction to determine new roots. Then each new root asks its upstream master to start a return connection procedure to convert he tree-shaped subnet into a web-shaped subnet for its immediate upstream root. At the same time, each new root repeats the same procedure as the root to build its own subnet until the whole scatternet is formed. Simulation results show that Bluelayer achieves good network scalability and generates an efficient scatternet configuration for various sizes of Bluetooth ad hoc network. key words: Bluetooth, ad hoc network, scatternet formation, network scalability	algorithm;bluetooth;downstream (software development);hoc (programming language);scalability;simulation;subnetwork	Chih-Min Yu;Chia-Chi Huang	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.9.2873	embedded system;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	-3.4979469564264383	76.18115976781615	49450

However, traditional techniques treat data management as an isolated process on only selected individual nodes. In this article, we propose an aggressive data reduction architecture, which is based on error control within sensor segments and integrates three parallel dynamic control mechanisms. We demonstrate that this architecture not only achieves energy savings but also guarantees the data accuracy specified by the application. Furthermore, based on this architecture, we propose two implementations. The experimental results show that both implementations can raise the energy savings while keeping the error at an predefined and acceptable level. We observed that, compared with the basic implementation, the enhancement implementation achieves a relatively higher data accuracy. Moreover, the enhancement implementation is more suitable for the harsh environmental monitoring applications. Further, when both implementations achieve the same accuracy, the enhancement implementation saves more energy. Extensive experiments on realistic historical soil temperature data confirm the efficacy and efficiency of two implementations.	control system;error detection and correction;experiment;scheduling (computing);sensor node	Shiwen Zhang;Qingquan Zhang;Sheng Xiao;Ting Zhu;Yu Gu;Yaping Lin	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1145/2786755	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;artificial neural network	Mobile	9.412156716148187	76.74761793968105	49528

However, all these protocols are likely to fail if the transmission ranges of the mobile hosts vary due to natural or man-made obstacles or weather conditions. These protocols may fail because in routing either some connections are not considered which effectively results in disconnecting the network, or the use of some connections causes livelocks. In this paper, we describe a robust routing protocol that tolerates up to roughly 40% of variation in the transmission ranges of the mobile hosts. More precisely, our protocol guarantees message delivery in a connected adhoc network whenever the ratio of the maximum transmission range to the minimum transmission range is at most √2.	control theory;geographic routing;hoc (programming language)	Lali Barrière;Pierre Fraigniaud;Lata Narayanan	2001		10.1145/381448.381451	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;geography;telecommunications;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile wireless sensor network;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.6209987525626284	83.5218799494493	49584

The proposed data management scheme rules out the selection of hotspot sensors, the sensors located closer to the base stations, as the intermediate sensors to avoid the dying of these sensors. In each data transmission, the scheme selects one of the neighborhood sensors having minimal Euclidean distance and maximum energy-level as the intermediate node from the neighboring set, without repeating the selection. The proposed data management scheme manages the data collection by utilizing two scheduling algorithms; as soon as possible (ASAP) and as late as possible (ALAP). As a measure of performance, the simulation results of the data management scheme have been compared with that of minimum connected dominating set algorithm (MCDS). The simulation results demonstrate that the data management scheme outperforms with respect to consume less energy; moreover, it can be observed that the scheme finishes an overall short waiting time of the selected sensors compared to the direct transmission in transmitting the data to the base station. The robustness of the proposed scheme is tested by varying the network sizes and varying the sensing radii.

Previously developed multi-hop models select the sensor nodes nearer to the base station as intermediate hops and because of their repeated usage, these sensors ran out of energy. We have proposed a data management scheme, which employs an energy constrained algorithm to analyze the residual energy of each sensor and selects between direct and multi-hop transmission based on their energy level at the time of transmissions. The sensors with high energy levels are directly transmitting the collected data to the base stations, while the sensors with low energy level are using a two-hop transmission to reach the base station. To avoid the dying of sensors nearer to the base stations, and also dying of sensor nodes due to heavy communications, our algorithm avoids the selection of the neighborhood nodes more than once. The neighboring node with minimal Euclidean distance and maximum energy level at the time of forwarding is selected as an intermediate node for transmission. We have utilized two basic scheduling algorithms ASAP and ALAP in combination with the energy constrained algorithm to manage the data transmission to the base stations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme in combination with the scheduling algorithms performed better compared to the direct transmission in transmitting the data in an energy balanced manner. We have also carried out a set of experiments to compare the performance of our scheme with a standard MCDS approach. The simulation results show that our approach performs better than MCDS approach with 8% reduced energy consumption in transmitting the data to the base station. The rest of the paper is organized into six sections. First we examine the related work. The next section describes the problem formulation, and explain the proposed data management scheme. Then, we discuss the overview of scheduling algorithms. The details of the experimental results are discussed, and finally we conclude our work. RELATED WORK The limited energy resource possessed by the tiny sensor nodes in WSN leads to many proposals by various researchers to minimize the energy consumption during the sensor’s operation. Each sensor actively performs the sensing, computing and communication operations periodically and each operation consumes energy. Our data management scheme focuses on energy savings in communication, as it drains more energy from the battery. Many of the recent papers considered single-hop communication as a communication scheme in transmitting the data to the base station and suggested energy minimization schemes to extend the life time of the sensor network (Prabhakar, 2001; Singh & Prasanna, 2003). An energy balanced algorithm for sorting in wireless sensor networks was proposed by Singh and Prasanna (2003). They resolved the unbalance in the energy consumption of a single-hop network by searching for a node with maximum residual energy. Yu and Prasanna (2003) considered an epoch-based scenario with a latency constraint for packet transmission and they presented an off-line algorithm and on-line protocol to balance the energy dissipation in multi-hop packet transmission. A comparison of multi-hop schemes with different objectives in short range communications has been done by Ergen and Varaiya (2005). In which, one multi-hop routing scheme tried to maximize the life time of sensor nodes and the second one tried to minimize the total energy consumption. They considered the communication energy (transmission and reception) and the circuit energy spent in transmission for both the schemes. In another research work, the authors (Efthymiou, Nikoletseas, & Rolim, 2004) proposed an energy balanced algorithm for data transmission, which was suitable for event-driven and slice based networks. Bhattacharjee and Das (2007) presented a greedy algorithm for distributed data gather16 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/management-scheme-datacollection-within/66049?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

dffb9208975906fc9868829bd0a0198eb9ef76b0	the accuracy improvement using wlan for indoor positioning system		At present, the theory and algorithm of wireless indoor positioning systems have been widely researched. Some applications of these systems have been successfully used such as inventory management. Nevertheless, positioning using radio signals indoor is subject to multipath propagation and other causes. Therefore, how to determine the location accurately has been recognized as a difficult task. This paper focuses on one of the positioning methods called received signal strength indication(RSSI) in a Wireless Local Area Network(WLAN). To improve the positioning accuracy, we proposed a scheme which to estimate the distance between access point(AP) and mobile station(MS) using the average of pilot signal strength in frequency domain. We then propose another scheme to estimate the position of the MS based on the estimated distances. At last, the simulations results show that the proposed schemes has a higher degree accuracy compared with the conventional methods.	algorithm;indoor positioning system;inventory;multipath propagation;simulation;software propagation	Ye Tian;Wenjian Wang;Chang-Jun Ahn;Tatsuya Omori;Ken-ya Hashimoto	2015	2015 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2015.7432818	embedded system;electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;hybrid positioning system	Mobile	20.949132995473047	74.82827516411447	49844

Vehicles broadcast status messages periodically containing status information such as velocity, position, etc. The information can be used for road safety and collected by Internet of Things (IoT) elements for traffic management. The mobility of the vehicles will impact the reliability of vehicular communications, which leads to performance degradation especially in high density and highly dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a rate control algorithm based on the widely recognized car following model proposed by Wiedemann, which considers the movement interaction effect of vehicles and the driver's behavior. The car following process is common in high density situations and autonomous vehicles. We analyze the oscillation of vehicle's speed in car following process and derive the theoretical lower bound of message broadcast interval. The proposed algorithm can reduce redundant messages and meet the requirements of vehicle location accuracy. The rate control algorithm is evaluated using the network simulator ns-3 and the microscopic vehicle traffic simulator VISSIM.	algorithm;autonomous robot;elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);internet of things;network packet;redundancy (engineering);requirement;simulation;velocity (software development);vissim	Zhongyi Shen;Xin Zhang;Shiyuan Wang;Dacheng Yang	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8376976	vehicular ad hoc network;real-time computing;vissim;computer network;network simulation;intelligent transportation system;algorithm;computer science;internet of things	Robotics	5.173408530186501	87.49167952653035	49876

The proposed codes are systematic odd-weight-column SEC-DED-SBD codes providing also the correction of any odd number of erroneous bits per byte, where a byte represents a cluster of b bits of the codeword that are fed by the same memory chip or card. These codes are useful for practical applications to enhance the reliability and the data integrity of byte-organized computer memory systems against transient, intermittent, and permanent failures. In particular they represent a good tradeoff between the overhead in terms of additional check bits and the reliability improvement, due to the capability to correct at least 50% of the multiple errors per byte. >		Luca Penzo;Donatella Sciuto;Cristina Silvano	1995	IEEE Trans.

A streaming computation is a network of compute nodes connected by unidirectional FIFO channels. When these computations are mapped onto real parallel platforms, however, some computations, especially ones in which some nodes act as filters, can deadlock the system due to finite buffering on channels. In this paper, we focus on streaming computations which contain a commonly used structure called split-join. Based on our previous work, we propose two correct deadlock-avoidance algorithms, named the Propagating Algorithm and the Non-propagating Algorithm. Our evaluation of two representative applications, biological sequence alignment and random number generation, shows that the Non-propagating Algorithm has very small communication overhead. For systems with large buffers or a low filtering ratio, the communication overhead of the Non-propagating Algorithm is negligible.	algorithm;blast;computation;deadlock;fifo (computing and electronics);high-throughput computing;model of computation;overhead (computing);parallel computing;parallel programming model;programming paradigm;random number generation;requirement;sequence alignment;streaming media;throughput	Peng Li;Kunal Agrawal;Jeremy Buhler;Roger D.

Then such a multiple QoS constrained route could be searched in polynomial time.

The novel adaptive NoC router provides the inter-neuron connectivity for EMBRACE, maintaining router communication and avoiding dropped router packets by adapting to router traffic congestion. The router also adapts to NoC traffic congestion or broken NoC connections (faults) by reconfiguring the routing topology to select an alternative route. Performance, power and area analysis of the proposed adaptive router using Synopsys Design Compiler (for TSMC 90nm CMOS technology) indicates a router throughput of 3.2Gbps on each of 5 available router channels, low router power consumption (1.716mW) and small router area (0.056mm). Router adaptive behaviour in the presence of applied real-time traffic congestion has been demonstrated on a Virtex II Pro Xilinx FPGA for a 4x2 router array.

Though packet timeliness is a key attribute, Network-on-Chip designs rarely consider timeliness as a parameter mostly due to the impracticality of utilising time stamping which relay on the notion of a global time. In this paper, we introduce a low overhead approach where packets carry a slack value, which would notify the router of the latency the packet can suffer without any adverse effects. This would enable routers to service late packets (even lower priority ones) by trading the expendable time associated with the high priority packets hence improving overall quality of service. Utilising a Hardware Description Language coded prototype, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique and quantify the associated hardware overhead.	hardware description language;network on a chip;network packet;overhead (computing);prototype;quality of service;relay;router (computing);slack variable	Bharath Sudev;Leandro Soares Indrusiak;James Harbin	2015	2015 IEEE 13th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2015.7281739	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Arch	0.5730075212149529	64.01783243317911	49993

The main performance parameter is the steady state proportion of generated queries that fail to be answered on time. Using an infinite transmission range model, we first provide an approximation for this parameter that is insensitive to the size of the network. Subsequently, we approximate the proportion of failed queries when the transmission range is limited and show that this proportion converges to its infinite range counterpart as the sensor transmission range tends to infinity. The analytical approximations are shown to be remarkably accurate when compared with benchmark values obtained using a commercial network simulator.	approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;benchmark (computing);performance evaluation;simulation;steady state;theory	Guvenc Degirmenci;Jeffrey P.

A downside of this is the fact that local storage at one node cannot accommodate the vast amount of data contained in the network. In this paper, we present SharedState, a scheme for storage, replication, and distribution of common-interest data in wireless networks of resource-constrained devices (e.g. sensor nodes or embedded devices). SharedState works under the assumption that individual nodes would greatly benefit from having access to the wealth of information in the network, but are unable to store it locally at once. SharedState strives to make data available to every node by providing local access to a subset of the whole collection of data items in the network at any moment in time and ensuring that this subset is updated periodically. This is accomplished by probabilistic propagation and replication of data items, ensuring the availability and persistence of information in the face of changing network conditions. We evaluate the performance of SharedState by studying the effectiveness with which nodes can gather information from the network. In addition, we optimize the bandwidth usage of our proposed solution by minimizing unnecessary communication based on feedback from the local neighborhood.	bandwidth (signal processing);embedded system;feedback;function overloading;hoc (programming language);persistence (computer science);probabilistic automaton;replication (computing);scalability;software propagation;thread-local storage	Daniela Gavidia;Maarten van Steen	2008	2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660060	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;statistics;computer network	Mobile	4.069404514673811	79.02794061573817	50017

Consequently, they suffer from disadvantages associated with localization, which is often costly, error prone, and in some cases even infeasible. Tracking mobile nodes in a topological coordinate domain is proposed as an alternative to that in geographic coordinate domain. Topological coordinates (TCs), the basis of recent developments in Topology Preserving Maps (TPMs), are derived from hop distances from each node to a small subset of nodes. A technique is presented to reduce the distortion closer to the edges of principal component based TPMs, thereby enhancing its accuracy, which in turn facilitates accurate mobility tracking. Topological Coordinate based Tracking and Prediction (TCTP) algorithm is proposed for tracking and predicting the position of mobile nodes in the TC domain. Simulation results presented show that tracking and detecting performance of TCTP is competitive with geographic coordinate based algorithms despite the fact that it relies only on hop distances to a subset of nodes.	algorithm;broadcast delay;cognitive dimensions of notations;distortion;geographic coordinate system;geographical distance;global positioning system;internationalization and localization;principal component analysis;sensor;simulation	Yi Jiang;Dulanjalie C.

In the last decade, random network coding (RNC) has been shown to support content distribution efficiently in such dynamic environments. Our goal is designing a method for continuously providing location-dependent information generated by vehicles to other vehicles being driven near the birthplace of a data item with short delays and low data delivery traffic using VANETs. So far, we have proposed a scheme called R2D2V (RNC-based Regional Data Distribution on VANETs), a rapid and reliable data dissemination method using random network coding in such a situation. R2D2V can achieve a high data delivery ratio for vehicles driving near the birthplace of the information with low data delivery traffic and short delays when the vehicle density is high. However, this scheme cannot achieve a high delivery ratio for vehicles newly coming to the birthplace of the information after the information has been generated. In this paper, we propose new schemes to mitigate the drawback of R2D2V. Our new schemes distribute a data item encoded by RNC to all vehicles driving near the birthplace of the data item by controlling the probability of sending the data in accordance with the elapsed time from data generation, vehicle's moving direction and vehicle's current location. The simulation results show that our proposed schemes can achieve a high delivery ratio for vehicles newly coming near the birthplace of the information with shorter delays and less delivery traffic than R2D2V.	data item;digital distribution;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;random graph;relay;simulation	Naruhiro Kusumine;Susumu Ishihara	2012	2012 IEEE 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2012.114	vehicular ad hoc network;data modeling;linear network coding;telecommunications;data model;computer science;network dynamics;probability;storm;computer security;dissemination;statistics;computer network	Mobile	4.706338365198272	86.23071554925578	50037

Almost all of these routing protocols considered energy efficiency as the ultimate objective in order to maximize the whole network lifetime. However, the introduction of video and imaging sensors has posed additional challenges. Transmission of video and imaging data requires both energy and QoS aware routing in order to ensure efficient usage of the sensors and effective access to the gathered measurements. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware QoS routing protocol for sensor networks which can also run efficiently with best-effort traffic. The protocol finds a least-cost, delay-constrained path for realtime data in terms of link cost that captures nodes’ energy reserve, transmission energy, error rate and other communication parameters. Moreover, the throughput for non-real-time data is maximized by adjusting the service rate for both real-time and non-real-time data at the sensor nodes. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for different metrics.	best-effort delivery;data rate units;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;network packet;quality of service;queueing theory;real-time clock;real-time data;requirement;routing;sensor web;simulation;throughput;uncompressed video	Kemal Akkaya;Mohamed F.

However, some additional fault detection tasks will make so busy the manager node to be failed more quickly. Moreover, at the first beginning period most sensor networks are working normally without any dead nodes and the probing work are actually ineffective. Thus it is important to study the problems of electing the probe stations and probing frequency. This paper presents a probability-based fault detection algorithm to elect sensor nodes as probe stations by considering the probability distribution of sensor nodes and the fault distribution information (accord with Pareto principle) of sensor networks. The dynamic adjusting rule for probing frequency is also proposed in this paper. The simulation demonstrated that the algorithm and the rule can prolong the lifetime of sensor network only sacrificing very few fault detected rate. The Pareto principle that a small number of clusters contain most of the faults has also been demonstrated, and this principle has been applied to electing probing stations. The results obtained in this paper provide useful guideline to fault management in wireless sensor networks.	algorithm;fault detection and isolation;pareto efficiency;simulation	Rimao Huang;Xuesong Qiu;Lin-li Ye	2010	2010 International Conference on Network and Service Management	10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691304	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;decision support system;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	8.657604973731118	76.82866866456091	50120

Different researching issues have been extensively developed: power consumption, MAC protocols, self-organizing network algorithms, data-aggregation schemes, routing protocols, QoS management, etc. Due to the constraints on data processing and power consumption, the use of artificial intelligence has been historically discarded. However, in some special scenarios the features of neural networks are appropriate to develop complex tasks such as path discovery. In this paper, we explore and compare the performance of two very well known routing paradigms, directed diffusion and Energy-Aware Routing, with our routing algorithm, named SIR, which has the novelty of being based on the introduction of neural networks in every sensor node. Extensive simulations over our wireless sensor network simulator, OLIMPO, have been carried out to study the efficiency of the introduction of neural networks. A comparison of the results obtained with every routing protocol is analyzed.

Although efficiency and stability are not compatible in a general context, we identify interesting subclasses of problems where an efficient and stable network exists: the uniform interval model, the uniform circle model, and the communication favorable domain. We also investigate the consequence of allowing agents to relocate their positions. For certain networks, relocation-proofness is equivalent to stability.	relocation (computing);telecommunications network	Sunghoon Hong;Youngsub Chun	2010	Social Choice and Welfare	10.1007/s00355-009-0409-1	economics;network formation;wireless	AI	1.0161289670325404	77.66194358129708	50126

We propose a three-phase centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms have better performance than that of existing results.	cds isis;centralized computing;cognitive radio;connected dominating set;distributed algorithm;internet backbone;self-stabilization;stochastic process;time complexity	Jiguo Yu;Wenchao Li;Xiuzhen Cheng;Mohammed Atiquzzaman;Hua Wang;Li Feng	2015	2015 International Conference on Identification, Information, and Knowledge in the Internet of Things (IIKI)	10.1007/s00779-016-0944-6	distributed algorithm;cognitive radio;cognitive network;computer science;radio resource management;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	7.444067784313937	78.7162563674598	50140

Particularly in routing, researchers were concerned with the problems of using topology control to achieve power efficient routes, as well as finding alternate routes to extend the lifetime of the network. Current schemes though, fail in one or more of the following areas: 1) provide solutions that treat both the aforementioned problems, 2) provide distributed algorithms, 3) account for the overhead of the algorithms 4) compare the results with theoretically computed optimums, 5) account for the effect of the MAC layer. We propose and evaluate a unicast routing algorithm that exploits the ability of the nodes to transmit at multiple power levels. It can find the optimal power-efficient route between two nodes, with less energy and time overheads than the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm, as well as use alternate routes to extend the total lifetime of the network, up to 87% of the theoretical optimum lifetime, taking into account all overheads. Furthermore, we address many practical considerations in the context of sensor networks. We built our case around three main pillars: i) a distributed algorithm, ii) extensive evaluation of the overhead of the algorithm, and iii) account for the effect of the MAC layer.	bellman–ford algorithm;distributed algorithm;overhead (computing);routing;topology control;unicast	Athanassios Boulis;Mani B.

In this paper, we focus on using several small UAVs collaboratively to provide extended reach to an online video monitoring system for inspection of industrial installations. We make use of 802.11 radios on low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf UAVs, set up a time-division multiple access overlay protocol to avoid mutual interference, and enable high channel utilization in multihop networks. In particular, we provide a model for the quality of the UAV-to-UAV link, in terms of packet delivery ratio as a function of distance, packet size, and orientation, based on an extensive measurement campaign. We show that this platform is not omnidirectional in the horizontal plane and that UAV-to-UAV communication ceases around 75 m. Concerning the operation in a multihop mode to allow extending the network, the paper derives the optimal number of hops that maximize the end-to-end throughput, as well as the corresponding hop lengths. We validate our mathematical model with extensive experimental measurements transmitting payloads up to 200 m (over 802.11 g at 54 MBps).	aerial photography;data rate units;end-to-end principle;file spanning;interference (communication);mathematical model;network packet;television antenna;throughput;transmitter;unmanned aerial vehicle;video clip	Luis Ramos Pinto;André Moreira;Luis Fernando de Almeida;Anthony Rowe	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2668439	wireless ad hoc network;embedded system;throughput;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;spread spectrum;computer security;computer network	Mobile	19.389229534091953	77.78036490026167	50279
312019fbb779347b5077abc0da791c422c7fadd2	indoor localization by fusing a group of fingerprints based on random forests		Indoor localization is becoming critical to empower Internet of Things for various applications, such as asset tracking, autonomous parking, virtual reality, context awareness, condition monitoring, geolocation, smart manufacturing, as well as smart cities. It is well known that indoor localization based on some single fingerprints is rather susceptible to the changing environment. The efficiency of building single fingerprints from one localization system is also low. Recently, we first proposed a group of fingerprints (GOOF) based localization to improve the efficiency of building fingerprints, and then proposed an efficient fusion algorithm, namely, multiple classifiers multiple samples (MUCUS), to improve the accuracy of localization. However, the main drawbacks of MUCUS are the low localization efficiency and low accuracy when all classifiers show poor performance simultaneously. In this paper, based on the aforementioned GOOF, we propose a sliding window aided mode-based (SWIM) fusion algorithm to balance the localization accuracy and efficiency. SWIM first adopts windowing and sliding techniques to improve the localization efficiency, and then obtains a more accurate estimate by minimizing the entropy of multiple classifiers or multiple samples. This can guarantee our estimator to be robust to changing environment and larger noise level. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms through simulations and real experimental data via two universal software radio peripheral platforms.	adaboost;algorithm;artificial neural network;computer simulation;convolutional neural network;crowdsourcing;fingerprint;line-of-sight (missile);machine learning;multipath propagation;online and offline;radio frequency;random forest;software propagation;support vector machine;universal software radio peripheral	Xiansheng Guo;Nirwan Ansari;Huiyong Li	2018	IEEE Internet of Things Journal		computer science;distributed computing;simulation;sliding window protocol;condition monitoring;random forest;universal software radio peripheral;location awareness;fingerprint;geolocation;artificial intelligence;context awareness;pattern recognition	Mobile	20.155342573518404	75.26743447180966	50299

In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithms partition the group members into clusters in the lower layer, seeking an optimal core (root) to guarantee the minimum routing delay for each cluster and building a shared tree within each cluster to minimize the number of links used. In the upper layer, a shared tree is then constructed using our algorithms to implement the inter-cluster routing. The extended simulation results indicate that the application layer multicast that is constructed by our algorithms is efficient in terms of routing delay and link utilizations as compared with other well-known existing multicast solutions.	mesh networking;multicast	Weijia Jia;Wanqing Tu;Jie Wu	2005		10.1007/11534310_59	routing;multicast;overlay network;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;mobile computing;xcast;computer network	ML	-3.9209566126353956	76.3296977625267	50373

In the dawn of WSNs, data delivery techniques considered only static data sinks. However, static sink approaches place a considerable burden on sensor nodes surrounding the sinks in terms of traffic and energy consumption. Eventually, data dissemination techniques for WSNs with mobile sinks have been proposed to alleviate the traffic issues of static sink approaches and improve network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new data dissemination strategy that combines a simple but efficient sleep schedule technique with a trail generation mechanism. Simulation results show that the proposed E-TRAIL protocol significantly improves network lifetime while maintaining similar data delivery success performance when compared to the selected approaches.	network packet;simulation;wake-on-lan	Richard Werner Nelem Pazzi;Dipu Zhang;Azzedine Boukerche;Lynda Mokdad	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963002	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Embedded	6.940957841046327	80.89919193099418	50447

One promising approach is the use of relay nodes in wireless ad-hoc networks which require special routing protocols to provide a transparent communication network to the user. This work tests and compares four different existing ad-hoc routing protocol implementations with respect to aspects of mobile robot teleoperation. The reactive routing protocols ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR), the proactive optimized link state routing (OLSR) and B.A.T.M.A.N. are used in test scenarios to command a mobile robot via an ad-hoc network of several communication relay nodes. For all four ad-hoc routing protocols, the route reestablishing behavior is observed. In particular the packet loss and the duration of route reestablishing during test runs with real hardware in an outdoor environment are analyzed.	ansi escape code;distance-vector routing protocol;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;mobile robot;network packet;network topology;optimized link state routing protocol;relay;source routing;telecommunications network	Florian Zeiger;Nikolaus Kraemer;Klaus Schilling	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543270	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;routing domain;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;computer network	Robotics	1.6064668775856596	86.55238328350657	50509

In the escaping model, this paper reforms the AHP method by defining three tiers for escaping allocation, feeding emergency information, geographical information and resource information into allocation standard. This model can provide solutions which are simple and can be easily executed, helpful to schedule in the emergency response. Simulation tests are also run in this paper.

This protocol is designed for gathering information about rescues effectively in a big earthquake. For the longevity of networks, terminals are connected to each other in linear form in our protocol, which makes the communication loads among terminals relatively equal. In order to decrease frequency of packet sending, our protocol introduces virtual terminals, in which two neighbouring terminals activate alternatively. Experimental results show that our protocol needs less packets and that the average life time of terminals is longer than other protocols.

1cebe1aab1d21d3a1b2b3016ac4ea88065d5ee34	adaptive learning based active noise cancellation		Synchronous audio system is a broadcasting system that speakers from different locations can play the same source simultaneously. In addition to the synchronous playback, the system also can be used to cancel the sound of another speaker. However, the time synchronization accuracy requirement of the active noise cancellation is very high, and general time synchronization protocols can not reach the demand. Therefore, we propose an adaptive learning based active noise cancellation method, which can improve the synchronization rate between speakers to achieve effective active noise cancellation. In order to improve the accuracy of the synchronization, we use WSN (i.e. wireless sensor network) synchronization protocols and the genetic algorithm to learn and adjust parameters for the noise cancellation. Besides, adaptive learning based active noise cancellation does not require high accuracy microphones and dedicated chips, and its scope of applications is not limited to the handset. We also introduce an use case and make a comprehensive discussion.	genetic algorithm;microphone	Yu Zhang;Jiangtao Wen;Yuxing Han	2018		10.1145/3195588.3195591	wireless sensor network;real-time computing;active noise control;synchronization;handset;adaptive learning;broadcasting;computer science	Mobile	15.868631363816347	70.52317631113259	50670

4e8dbe22ebbd7518fed1be44a761c416e508f431	rrdvcr: real-time reliable data delivery based on virtual coordinating routing for wireless sensor networks		Real-time industrial application requires routing protocol that guarantees data delivery with reliable, efficient and low end-to-end delay. Existing Routing(THVR) [13] is based velocity of Two-Hop Velocity and protocol relates two-hop velocity to delay to select the next forwarding node, that has overhead of exchanging control packets, and depleting the available energy in nodes. We propose a Real-Time Reliable Data delivery based on Virtual Coordinates Routing (RRDVCR) algorithm, based on the number of hops to the destination rather than geographic distance. Selection of forwarding node is based on packet progress offered by two-hops, link quality and available energy at the forwarding nodes. All these metric are co-related by dynamic co-relation factor. The proposed protocol uses selective acknowledgment scheme that results in lower overhead and energy consumption. Simulation results shows that there is about 22% and 9.5% decrease in energy consumption compared to SPEED [8] and THVR [13] respectively, 16% and 38% increase in packet delivery compared to THVR [13] and SPEED [8] respectively, and overhead is reduced by 50%.	acknowledgment index;algorithm;end-to-end encryption;geographical distance;hop;network packet;overhead (computing);real-time transcription;routing;simulation;velocity (software development)	Venkatesh;Chanchal Singh Sengar;Kuppanna Rajuk Venugopal;S.

The BFs are used in numerous applications, for example, in communications and networking. There is also ongoing research to extend and enhance BFs and to use them in new scenarios. Reliability is becoming a challenge for advanced electronic circuits as the number of errors due to manufacturing variations, radiation, and reduced noise margins increase as technology scales. In this brief, it is shown that BFs can be used to detect and correct errors in their associated data set. This allows a synergetic reuse of existing BFs to also detect and correct errors. This is illustrated through an example of a counting BF used for IP traffic classification. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively correct single errors in the associated set. The proposed scheme can be of interest in practical designs to effectively mitigate errors with a reduced overhead in terms of circuit area and power.	bit error rate;bloom filter;brainfuck;cost efficiency;dedicated hosting service;electronic circuit;error detection and correction;hamming code;memory protection;noise margin;overhead (computing);parity bit;soft error;synergetics (fuller);synergetics (haken);synergy;traffic classification	Pedro Reviriego;Salvatore Pontarelli;Juan Antonio Maestro;Marco Ottavi	2015	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2311234	real-time computing;error detection and correction;soft error;computer science;theoretical computer science;reliability;very-large-scale integration;statistics	HPC	8.772010873755857	60.58950016160122	50809

The method was motivated by certain routing requirements of an initial design of the Blue Gene supercomputer at IBM Research. The machine is organized as a three-dimensional mesh containing many thousands of nodes and the routing method should tolerate a few percent of the nodes being faulty. There has been much work on routing methods for meshes that route messages around faults or regions of faults. The new method is to declare certain nonfaulty nodes to be """"lambs."""" A lamb is used for routing but not processing, so a lamb is neither the source nor the destination of a message. The lambs are chosen so that every """"survivor node,"""" a node that is neither faulty nor a lamb, can reach every survivor node by at most two rounds of dimension-ordered (such as e-cube) routing. An algorithm for finding a set of lambs is presented. The results of simulations on 2D and 3D meshes of various sizes with various numbers of random node faults are given. For example, on a 32 /spl times/ 32 /spl times/ 32 3D mesh with 3 percent random faults and using at most two rounds of e-cube routing for each message, the average number of lambs is less than 68, which is less than 7 percent of the number 983 of faults and less than 0.21 percent of the number 32,768 of nodes."""	3d computer graphics;algorithm;blue gene;fault (technology);fault tolerance;ibm research;parallel computing;requirement;routing;simulation;supercomputer;time formatting and storage bugs;wormhole switching	C.

Most of future smart meters will use Powerline Communication (PLC) technology in addition to one or more wireless interfaces to tackle the physical constraints and failure of the PLC network. When a smart meter is connected using two different technologies, choosing the best relay node and the best link to transmit the message is a key decision to provide a good quality of service and increase the reliability of the communication network.

Amongst those, Bluetooth has been widely known for its low-power consumption, small maintenance cost, as well as its wide-spread amongst the commodity devices. Understanding the properties of such wireless signal definitely aids the tracking system design. However, little research has been done to understand the properties of Bluetooth wireless signal amongst the current Bluetooth-based tracking systems. In this chapter, the most important Bluetooth properties related to indoor localisation are experimentally investigated from a statistical perspective.

However, they did not consider the transition between contexts and instead handled each context individually. In other words, they neglected the relationship between contexts, which can be perceived during the transition of contexts, and instead determined the context using only the value output from a sensor. As a result, although the contexts inferred during the transition are meaningless, the service consumes unnecessary power trying to be aware of these contexts. Individual context awareness for Indoor/Outdoor contexts is a representative example of this. The Indoor/Outdoor contexts should not be inferred concurrently. However, the existing services infer each context independently, so they cannot prevent power wastage when two contexts are inferred at once. For this, there is a need to consider the contexts that could simultaneously occur during context transition in order to increase the power efficiency of a context-aware service. To this end, we propose a low-power sensing model capable of considering context transition for a location-based service. In our method, we generate a context-aware model capable of considering context transition based on the activity of sensors and identify the unstable state in which context-aware services do not infer the context and therefore drain the power inefficiently. Then, by adapting the freezing method proposed in this paper to the UNSTABLE state, we block the activation of the sensors to improve the power efficiency until certain conditions are satisfied. On applying our method to context-aware services for Indoor/Outdoor contexts, we were able to improve the power efficiency by 60% in the UNSTABLE state.	location-based service	Jae-Hyeon Park;Deok-Ki Kim;Dusan Baek;Jung-Won Lee	2017	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-017-2803-4	machine learning;real-time computing;artificial intelligence;computer science;location-based service;electrical efficiency;simulation;context awareness	HCI	17.193220694912096	68.39101881231213	51057

We consider the problem of minimizing the congestion in wireless optical (FSO) backbone networks by placing controllable relay nodes. We propose algorithms for placement of relays in the network under node interface constraints. The interfaces at each backbone node are limited, thus limiting the number of neighbors a node can have. We come up with algorithms to formulate the problem as a constrained knapsack problem, and propose algorithms to solve it. We use the mathematical technique of rollout to achieve better performance than the heuristics. We show by simulations that our algorithms significantly outperform some greedy algorithms, and a small number of relay nodes (when placed using our algorithms) can lead to a significant reduction in the congestion in the network	greedy algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hoc (programming language);internet backbone;knapsack problem;network congestion;relay;simulation	Abhishek Kashyap;Fangting Sun;Mark A.

Although the theoretical bandwidth limit is easy to determine loosely, there have been no systematic ways to arrive at a tight upper-bound. One contribution of this paper is a formula for deriving a tight upper-bound on the throughput of low-complexity wireless interfaces transmitting packets of a fixed size. It takes into account not only the software execution times on the nodes but also other communication protocols that must be bridged by the base station. The proposed upper-bound, which we believe is the tightest, represents the maximum amount of bandwidth utilization that can be achieved in practice. It can also serve as a means of comparing protocols built on different platforms. Another contribution is a streamlined schedule-based protocol, called RIPE-MAC, which achieves at least 83% of the upper-bound, significantly higher than previously achieved throughput. The proposed protocol needs no clock synchronization and incurs no further complexity on sensor nodes. In the proposed protocol, synchronization and schedule updates are reduced to a single pull message.	clock synchronization;communications protocol;embedded system;mathematical optimization;microcontroller;operating system;program optimization;protocol stack;system configuration;throughput;transceiver;transmitter	Vahid Salmani;Pai H.

However, SPMIPv6 is dependent on a single and central Local Mobility Anchor (LMA), and thus, it inherited most of the problems observed in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol, including long handoff latency, non-optimized communication path, and bottleneck issues. In addition, SPMIPv6 extends the single point of failure to include both the authentication and network information. This study presents an enhanced architecture for SPMIPv6 called Clustered SPMIPv6 (CSPMIPv6) to overcome the problems above. In the proposed architecture, the Mobility Access Gateways (MAGs) are grouped into clusters, each with a distinguished cluster Head MAG (HMAG). The HMAG is mainly designed to reduce the load on LMA by performing intra-cluster handoff signaling and providing an optimized path for data communications. The proposed architecture is evaluated analytically, and the numerical results show that the proposed CSPMIPv6 outperforms both SPMIPv6 and PMIPv6 protocols in terms of LMA load, local handoff delay, and transmission cost performance metrics.	algorithm;authentication;computer cluster;load balancing (computing);network packet;numerical analysis;proxy mobile ipv6;random number generation;reliability engineering;scalability;scheduling (computing);single point of failure	Adnan J.

One such physical layer device discrimination technique, known as RF-DNA fingerprinting, has successfully demonstrated serial number device discrimination. This work extends the RF-DNA fingerprinting state-of-the-art by investigating the impact the existence of carrier frequency offset or the lack thereof has on RF-DNA fingerprint based device discrimination performance. A comparative assessment was conducted using various cases in which carrier frequency offset values were: 1) removed, 2) unique, 3) random, and 4) combinations thereof. This assessment included the use of RF-DNA fingerprints extracted from collected IEEE 802.11a WiFi preambles in which carrier frequency offset values were present. This work shows that RF-DNA fingerprints associated with devices whose preambles contained carrier frequency offset values which were unique, when compared to the values associated with the other devices, resulted in that device being easily discriminated from the others.	bit-level parallelism;carrier frequency offset;dna barcoding;dna microarray;dna profiling;fingerprint (computing);network security;radio frequency	Charles G.

Most existing clustering protocols periodically form clusters and statically assign cluster heads (CHs) and thus are not energy efficient. Every non-CH node of these protocols sends data to the CH in every time slot of a frame allocated to them using the time division multiple access scheme, which is an energy-consuming process. Moreover, these protocols do not provide any fault tolerance mechanism. Considering these limitations, we have proposed an efficient fault-tolerant and energy-efficient clustering protocol for a wireless sensor network. The performance of the proposed protocol was tested by means of a simulation and compared against the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy and dynamic static clustering protocols. Simulation results showed that the fault-tolerant and energy-efficient clustering protocol has better performance than both the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy and dynamic static clustering protocols in terms of energy efficiency and reliability.

67b75a925e7fbc9a1410d39351ffe9aadc45d90b	lips: link prediction as a service for data aggregation applications	ar model;link quality prediction;prediction error minimization;state space model	A central component of the design of wireless sensor networks is reliable and efficient transmission of data from source to destination. However, this remains a challenging problem because of the dynamic nature of wireless links, such as interference, diffusion, and path fading. When the link quality gets worse, packets will get lost even with retransmissions and acknowledgments when internal queues become full. For example, in a well-known study to monitor volcano behavior (Werner-Allen et al., 2006), the measured data yield of nodes ranges from 20% to 80%. To address this challenge brought by unreliable links, in this paper, we propose the idea of LIPS, or Link Prediction as a Service. Specifically, we argue that it is beneficial for applications to be aware of link layer variations, so that they can take into account the future link quality estimates based on past measurements. In particular, we present a novel state space based approach for the link quality prediction, and demonstrate that it is possible to integrate this model into operating system interfaces, so that higher layer data aggregation protocols can directly exploit these interfaces to improve their performance. Our intensive evaluation indicates the state space based approach is accurate, stable and lightweight comparing to other strategies such as the autoregressive model (Liu and Cerpa, 2010). We carry out experiments based on the commonly used sensor node hardware including both link layer and operating system measurements. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such wide-ranging applications requiring WSNs, make them candi dates for intense research. Wireless sensor network consists of a sensor, a radio transceiver or other wireless communication device, a small micro controller and an energy source normally a battery. WSN are deployed in remote areas where recharging of battery might not be possible. So all the operations(sensing and transmitting data) involving battery must be energy efficient, so as to increase the network lifetime. Base station is supposed to be connected with a constant power source and its energy is not considered for calculating network lifetime. Lifetime of a WSN is defined as the time until which the first sensor node runs out of energy. Base station acts as the central object whose task is to collect all the information and process it for further actions. It also helps the network to organize itself. We can reduce power consumption in several ways(1) by using better query processing approach at architecture level (2) by reducing the amount of communication that needs to be done between sensor nodes and its parent node (3) by also reducing the calculation done at the node.For reducing the amount of communication we use ARIMA model.	automation;autoregressive integrated moving average;database;microcontroller;sensor node;transceiver;transmitter;tree (data structure)	Saumay Pushp	2010	CoRR		autoregressive integrated moving average;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;data mining;efficient energy use;mean absolute error;statistics;data transmission;data collection	Mobile	10.21792877337426	76.14459363930018	51662

To address this problem, we propose to use a novel improved semi-supervised manifold alignment approach by integrating the execution characteristic function to reduce both the number of reference points (RPs) and sampling time involved in the radio map construction. Specifically, the radio map is constructed from a small number of calibrated fingerprints and a batch of user traces, which are sporadically collected in the target environment. The user traces enable to compensate for the effort of reducing the calibration cost as well as improving the effectiveness of radio map. In addition, the cubic spline interpolation approach is applied to enrich the radio map with the limited number of RPs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach is capable of not only reducing the effort of fingerprints calibration remarkably, but also guaranteeing the high localization accuracy.	characteristic function (convex analysis);cubic hermite spline;cubic function;experiment;fingerprint;manifold alignment;rss;sampling (signal processing);semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;sparse matrix;spline interpolation;supervised learning;tracing (software);ubiquitous computing	Mu Zhou;Yunxia Tang;Zengshan Tian;Xiaolong Geng	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2678603	calibration;simulation;manifold;telecommunications;interpolation;computer science;operating system;machine learning;data mining;statistics	Visualization	18.487058545610825	73.18101395990325	51721

Individual errors on the CAN bus might be correlated in arbitrary way, the proposed algorithm will cover this. It is based on a previous work on reliability analysis that has been restricted to uncorrelated bit errors. To extend this approach we first introduce a suitable error model to describe arbitrary correlations between bit errors. As a key novelty we present an extended analysis procedure that takes this error model into account. This new approach will be utilized to determine the effects of burst errors and to demonstrate the necessity of appropriate error models for reliability analysis.	algorithm;bit error rate;burst error;can bus;embedded system;hidden markov model;markov chain;mathematical model;real-time clock;reliability engineering;requirement;simulation;working set	Maurice Sebastian;Philip Axer;Rolf Ernst	2011	2011 IEEE 17th Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing	10.1109/PRDC.2011.19	reliability engineering;fault tolerance;real-time computing;computer science;hidden markov model;statistics	Embedded	9.73746069291762	62.05799100434993	51746

NTP is the most common protocol for time synchronization in the Internet. Many aspects that define the quality of timekeeping are analyzed, as well as topological characteristics of the network. The results are compared to previous characterizations of the NTP network, showing the evolution of clock synchronization in the last fifteen years.	clock signal;clock synchronization;internet topology;robot	Cristina D.

The improvement of multiple nodes localisation accuracy is required when the transmitted powers of anchor nodes are not known. In this paper, we propose a novel localisation refinement method to improve the positioning accuracy for wireless sensor nodes. In the proposed method, we employ linear estimator to estimate the source positions along with the transmitted powers, and then use an addition of source position to improve the nodes positioning accuracy. Furthermore, we obtain the corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bound. It is also shown that, the mean square error decreases as path loss exponent value increases with the proposed method, which is obtained by using perfect knowledge of the path loss exponent.

Those features make data lost easily as well as broadcasting inefficient and unreliable. Moreover, efficiency and reliability is conflicting each other. Hence it is hard to achieve both at a time with just one scheme. In this paper, we present the scheme to improve the reliability and efficiency of the broadcast protocol in mobile ad hoc network. This scheme, unlike flooding which keeps reliability by sending excessive redundant packets, improves delivery rate with minimum overhead without degrading efficiency.	broadcast domain;hoc (programming language);overhead (computing)	Song Yean Cho;Jin Hyun Sin;Byung In Mun	2003		10.1109/LCN.2003.1243140	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;broadcast radiation;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;dynamic circuit network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;geocast;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	2.0329344797669764	83.44392527072888	51900

At a low level, these are influenced by the link layer performance between two nodes. The lack of accurate sensor network specific radio models, and the limited experimental data on actual link behaviour warrant additional investigation in this area. We present the results from extensive experiments, exploring several factors that are relevant for the link layer performance. These include (i) the effect of interference from simultaneous transmissions, which has not been looked into before, (ii) the degree of symmetry in the links between nodes, and (iii) the use of calibrated RSSI measurements. Finally, we present some guidelines on how to use the results for effective protocol design.	algorithm;amplitude-shift keying;communications protocol;data aggregation;dipole antenna;embedded system;experiment;interference (communication);modulation;prototype;reflection (computer graphics);routing;signal-to-noise ratio	Niels Reijers;Gertjan P.

a325cdd314ef67d70abe4329215b2766309550c6	energy optimization algorithm based on data density correlation in wireless sensor network		It’s importance to send the typical data from sampled data to the sink node in wireless sensor network. Compared with actual data, the representative data are always imprecise. Moreover, the energy consumption is huge. In order to minimize the energy consumption and improve the data accuracy, this paper presents the data fusion model PCCDNCD (correlation degree base on the Pearson correlation coefficient, the distance factor and the number of neighbor nodes, PCCDNCD). The correlation degree formula which can characterize the node from three aspects and classify nodes into three types precisely, is based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, the distance of nodes and the number of neighboring nodes. Nodes are classified into typical、ordinary and isolated nodes. In addition, the typical and isolated nodes are responsible for transferring data, while ordinary nodes are not required. The results show that the typical data achieved by the PCCDNCD method have higher degree of accuracy than the data from PCC (the Pearson correlation coefficient, PCC) and DDCD (the data density correlation degree, DDCD) methods. Meanwhile PCCDNCD algorithm has a low energy consumption.	algorithm	Wanyuan Jiang;Peng Li;He Xu;Huqing Nie	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61566-0_54	wireless sensor network;distributed computing;computer network;pearson product-moment correlation coefficient;sink (computing);computer science;energy consumption;algorithm;sensor fusion;mobile wireless sensor network;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;brooks–iyengar algorithm	Mobile	10.3179403878965	76.86618361943624	52078

Often, these two functions are at odds with one another and compete for these resources. Applications for wireless technology are growing rapidly, and RF convergence is already presenting itself as a requirement for both users as consumer and military system requirements evolve. The broad solution space to this complex problem encompasses cooperation or codesigning of systems with both sensing and communications functions. By jointly considering the systems during the design phase, rather than perpetuating a notion of mutual interference, both system’s performance can be improved. We provide a point of departure for future researchers that will be required to solve this problem by presenting the applications, topologies, levels of system integration, the current state of the art, and outlines of future information-centric systems.	feasible region;interference (communication);rf modulator;radar;radio frequency;requirement;system integration;system requirements;technological convergence	Bryan Paul;Alex R.

In this article, we discuss the impact of faults on this kind of devices. We have analyzed conventional passive RFID tags from different vendors operating in the High Frequency (HF) and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) band. First, we consider faults that have been enforced globally affecting the entire RFID chip. We have induced faults caused by temporarily antenna tearing, electromagnetic interferences, and optical inductions. Second, we consider faults that have been caused locally using a focused laser beam. Our experiments have led us to the result that RFID tags are exceedingly vulnerable to faults during the writing of data that is stored into the internal memory. We show that it is possible to prevent the writing of this data as well as to allow the writing of faulty values. In both cases, tags confirm the operation to be successful. We conclude that fault analysis poses a serious threat in this context and has to be considered if cryptographic primitives are embedded into low-cost RFID tags.	computer data storage;countermeasure (computer);cryptographic primitive;cryptography;embedded system;experiment;fault injection;lemke's algorithm;power supply;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;random-access memory;run time (program lifecycle phase);rust;software deployment;ultra high frequency	Michael Hutter;Jörn-Marc Schmidt;Thomas Plos	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-85053-3_23	radio-frequency identification;telecommunications;computer science;computer security	Security	10.908889007212297	63.010146065603855	52296

In theory, a base station (BS) needs to collect M measurements from the network with N sensors, then applies CS to obtain precisely all N sensor readings. In clustered networks, a cluster-head (CH) collects data from non-CH sensors in its cluster, adds all received and its own data then send the combined measurement to the BS. We further analyze the clustered network with the measurement matrix created by clustering methods, and formulate the total power consumption. Finally, we suggest the optimal number of clusters for the networks consume the least power in practice.	apollonian network;cluster analysis;compressed sensing;computer cluster;computer engineering;discrete cosine transform;electrical engineering;k-means clustering;sensor;simulation;sparse matrix	Minh Tuan Nguyen;Keith A.

Such cross-connects will require wavelength interchangers, devices that have the ability to change the wavelength of a signal along its route. Due to the expected high cost of wavelength interchangers, an important design goal for WDM cross-connects is to use as few wavelength interchangers as possible. We describe a family of k × k WDM cross-connects that are strictly nonblocking in terms of both paths and wavelengths yet require only 2k 1 wavelength interchangers and prove that this is optimal for such strictly non-blocking WDM cross-connects. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n A wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) crossconnect is a directed network of fibers connected to various optical components tha t allow for connecting a set of input fibers to a set of output fibers. Each fiber in the network can support some fixed number, say n, of wavelength channels. That is, at any time there can be up to n signals along a fiber each using a distinct wavelength. We consider only wavelength interchanging WDM crossconnects meaning that we allow for the connection of a wavelength channel on an input fiber to a (possibly) different wavelength channel on an output fiber. Of course, this implies tha t within the cross-connect there must be devices tha t can switch an incoming wavelength channel onto any (possibly) different wavelength channel on an outgoing fiber. Such devices are called wavelength interchangers [SB99]. The other type of component found in a cross-connect is called an optical switch or sometimes a wavelength selective cross-connect. An optical switch has an arbitrary number of fibers into and out of it and any wavelength channel on any incoming fiber can be switched to the same wavelength channel on any outgoing fiber (assuming the wavelength channel is not already being used). The use of optical switches with Labora tory for Compute r Science, Cambridge, MA 02139. This work was done dur ing a summer internship at Bell Labs /Lucent Technologies.

Email: gtw@research.bell-labs.com. two incoming and two outgoing fibers in the design of W D M cross-connects has been studied [DMR+99]. The problem of satisfying a request for a connection in a WDM cross-connect has two aspects to it. First a route must be found in the cross-connect from the requested input fiber to the requested output fiber. Secondly, for each fiber in the route, an unused wavelength channel must be assigned so that (1) on the input and output fibers the wavelength channels assigned are the requested ones and (2) the wavelength channels assigned on any two consecutive fibers in the route must be the same unless there is a wavelength interchanger connecting the fibers. A number of cross-connects have recently been described and their non-blocking properties analyzed [WMDZ99]. Most of those described in [WMDZ99] are rearrangeably non-blocking meaning that requests for new connections may require changing the paths and/or the wavelength channels of already configured connections. In a WDM cross-connect, disrupting connections in order to create new connections is undesirable since this requires buffering the connections being rearranged, creating a costly problem [SB99]. One of the designs in [WMDZ99] has the more desirable property of being strictly non-blocking (meaning that it can always handle new requests for connections without disturbing those already in place) but it requires k log k wavelength interchangers for a cross-connect with k input and output fibers. Since the dominating cost of a cross-connect is generally agreed to be the cost of the wavelength interchangers, our goal will be to study the problem of minimizing the number of wavelength interchangers needed for a strictly non-blocking cross-connect. In particular, we show that such k × k cross-connects can be designed using only 2 k 1 wavelength interchangers and that this is optimal. 2 N o n b l o c k i n g p r o p e r t i e s In this section we review the definitions of various non-blocking properties for cross-connects. We begin by considering the standard definitions given for the case where there is only one (wavelength) channel available. These are sometimes called space domain cross-connects. There is a vast literature on the problem of space domain cross-connect design.

Furthermore, it is applied to the line in a large temporary disaster are expected to FSO. In addition, FSO can be applied as a fiber backup when the disaster occurred. However, since the light beam has high directivity in free space link, the shock and vibration due to environmental changes, will lead to large misalignment between the transmitting and receiving antennas. Therefore, their impact on the stability of the FSO communication system should be investigated. In this paper, we describe the results of the basic measurement data obtained at the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in March 2011. We investigate the impact of the earthquake on the tracking system technology for FSO that we have developed. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of the proposed error correction for reducing the impact of earthquakes on the communication link.	backup;error detection and correction;line level;next-generation network;optical fiber;tracking system;transceiver;transmitter	Mitsuji Matsumoto;Kaito Osawa;Sho Hotta;Kazuhiko Wakamori	2015	2015 International Conference on Optical Network Design and Modeling (ONDM)	10.1109/ONDM.2015.7127304	telecommunications;optical fiber;tracking;adaptive optics	Robotics	24.281326633382026	81.923864745367	52350

Sufficient and necessary deadlock-freeness conditions have been proposed and used to build deadlock-free wormhole networks. But none of these works provide an efficient way to verify if a given network is deadlock-free. The present article proposes a new sufficient and necessary condition associated with a polynomial algorithm to check if a given network is deadlock-free. This new algorithm identifies {\em escape paths} from channels that are involved in circular dependencies. Identifying escape paths can be easily done by studying strongly connected components of the dependency graph instead of studying individually each cycle. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a tool for automatic detection of deadlocks in wormhole networks (ODI). ODI has been used to establish the deadlock-freeness of complex realistic networks and networks with defective routers.	algorithm;circular dependency;deadlock;polynomial;router (computing);strongly connected component	Sami Taktak;Emmanuelle Encrenaz-Tiphène;Jean Lou Desbarbieux	2010	2010 18th Euromicro Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-based Processing	10.1109/PDP.2010.19	system on a chip;dependency graph;routing;parallel computing;wormhole;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;deadlock;distributed computing;strongly connected component;network topology;polynomial;computer network	HPC	0.4372176113881628	68.11422214140447	52364

Existing works on event aggregation consider either latency constraint or aggregation function, but not both. A solution jointly considering the two issues will be desirable. Moreover, existing works only consider optimal aggregation for single high-level event type, but many applications are composed of multiple types of high-level events. This paper studies the problem of aggregating multiple high-level events in WSNs with different latency constraints and aggregation functions. We first propose an event aggregation algorithm considering the two issues for single high-level event, and then extend it for multiple high-level events. The simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches and saves significant amount of energy (up to 35% in our system).	aggregate function;algorithm;high- and low-level;selection algorithm;simulation	Weiping Zhu;Jiannong Cao;Yi Xu;Vaskar Raychoudhury	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962930	algorithm design;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	EDA	8.887151941275082	77.18414040233873	52367
3875eee01cd350a607159a55b2fdf25c40a5f67c	parallel architecture coding: link failure-recovery mechanism (pac: lf-rm)		Parallel network coding is a new communication paradigm that takes advantage of the broadcast using characteristics of network coding for parallel architectures. Network coding has recently developed as an innovative paradigm for optimization problems for high-scale communication between several nodes of these architectures. In previous work, a decentralized approach by optimizing parallel communication with the use of network coding has been proposed. In the present paper, the chance of communication failure is evaluated and an efficient solution (PAC: LF–RM) for such situations is proposed. It is shown that since communication failure may occur and is not avoidable so to overcome such failure and the data loss, buffering at an alternate degree of network nodes will reduce this stipulation. This paper explores the combination of network coding and node buffering for handling communication failure situation in the 2D Mesh network and results are presented for various cases of communication failures.

Given the criticality of such applications, maintaining a dependable operation of the network is a fundamental objective. However, the resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes and the ad hoc formation of the network, often coupled with an unattended deployment, pose non-conventional challenges and motivate the need for special techniques for dependable design and management of WSN. In this article, we highlight the potential of careful positioning of the base station (BS), which acts as a sink node for the collected data, as a viable means for increasing the dependability of WSN. We categorize published work on optimal positioning of BS in WSN. Referring to such work as static positioning, we further introduce dynamic schemes that reposition the BS during the network operation. We show that dynamic BS positioning can be very effective in optimizing the network functional and non-functional performance objectives and in coping with dynamic changes in the environment and available network resources	categorization;criticality matrix;dependability;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);sensor;software deployment	Kemal Akkaya;Mohamed F.

5e2c96b98652b3ef250774ff5ce241fd500e4015	energy aware routing for internet of things with heterogeneous devices		This paper focuses on the impact of intelligent topology formation and routing on resilient mesh topologies consisting of heterogeneous devices in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We consider a Bluetooth network comprising of low-power short-range devices that are heterogeneous in terms of energy source (e.g. the mains or coin-cell). In the first step, a resilient mesh topology is created by taking into account device characteristics such as energy sources and parameters related to neighbors. The Bluetooth devices negotiate master and slave roles, and form piconets which are then connected through multiple bridge nodes thus forming a scatternet. An energy aware algorithm is proposed to select the routing paths for packet forwarding between connected devices. The performance of topology and routing is evaluated through simulations in a large indoor office scenario based on realistic channel models and propagation characteristics. Results show that intelligent topology formation, in conjunction with the proposed energy aware routing algorithm leads to a significant gain (more than 100%) in terms of network lifetime, when compared to the baseline approaches.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);bluetooth;centrality;internet of things;load balancing (computing);low-power broadcasting;mesh networking;network packet;network performance;response surface methodology;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;software propagation	Dudu Ok;Furqan Ahmed;Piergiuseppe Di Marco;Roman Chirikov;Cicek Cavdar	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292757	mains electricity;computer network;scatternet;mesh networking;network topology;packet forwarding;computer science;bluetooth;internet of things;communication channel	Mobile	7.108772836734076	82.39111644632517	52573

One of the most commonly employed technique consists in turning on and of the power of the radio unit to reduce the power consumption. In this paper we exploit the modelling power of Interacting Markovian agent to evaluate the performance of four different on-off strategies. A Markovian agent (MA) is an entity whose behaviour is described by a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) and that is able to interact with other MA's by sending and receiving messages. A perceived message may induce a state transition in an MA according to a perception function than can depend on the geographical location of the MA's, on the message routing strategy and on the transmission property of the medium. We represent each sensor by an MA and we show how MA's can interact to produce the collective behaviour of the sensor network.	interaction;location (geography);markov chain;on-off keying;power management;routing;state transition table	Marco Gribaudo;Davide Cerotti;Andrea Bobbio	2008	2008 Sixth Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)	10.1109/PERCOM.2008.100	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network	Robotics	4.787880327794624	74.6860803545714	52617

Therefore, this paper develops an enhanced virtual backoff algorithm to route the packets to the queue based on the delay, as well as an ant colony optimisation algorithm for selecting the best nodes from the available nodes. The node counters are maintained for each node to calculate the success rate, and a sleep schedule is introduced to reduce the energy consumption and to improve the lifetime of the network.

Service orientation is a promising candidate for allowing mobile nodes to share their functionalities as services. Unfortunately,  typical characteristics of MANETs like their ever-changing topology and limited resources have a dramatic negative effect  on service availability and accessibility. The Service Distribution Protocol (SDP) [1] for MANETs introduces a service replication/hibernation  approach to increase the service availability in MANETs. Based on the service popularity at any given time, the protocol provides  a MANETs’ architecture independent mechanism which ensures higher service availability and accessibility. In this paper, SDP  is presented and applied in a restrictive environment with more constraints than those of [1,2]. By elaborating an extensive  detailed simulation, a set of measurements and performance criteria are examined in order to highlight the efficiency of SDP.

In applications using breadcrumb solutions, there are often many users working together, and this creates a well-known body shadowing effect (BSE). In this article, we first measure the characteristics of body shadowing for 2.4GHz sensor nodes. Our empirical results show that the body shadowing effect leads to severe packet loss and consequently very poor real-time performance. Then we develop a novel Intentional Forwarding solution. This solution accurately detects the shadowing mode and enables selected neighbors to forward data packets. Experimental results from a fully implemented testbed demonstrate that Intentional Forwarding is able to improve the end-to-end average packet delivery ratio (PDR) from 58% to 93% and worst-case PDR from 45% to 85%, and is able to meet soft real-time requirements even under severe body shadowing problems.	best, worst and average case;biological systems engineering;breadcrumb (navigation);design review (u.s. government);end-to-end encryption;mass effect trilogy;mission critical;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time data;requirement;testbed	Hengchang Liu;Pan Hui;Zhiheng Xie;Jingyuan Li;David J.

In this paper, we explore the use of varying transmission powers to increase the performance of a wireless localization system. To this extent, we have designed a robot positioning system based on wireless motes. Our motes use an inexpensive, low-power sub-1-GHz system-on-chip (CC1110) working in the 433-MHz ISM band. Our localization algorithm is based on a particle filter and infers the robot position by: (1) comparing the power received with the expected one; and (2) integrating the robot displacement. We demonstrate that the use of transmitters that vary their transmission power over time improves the performance of the wireless positioning system significantly, with respect to a system that uses fixed power transmitters. This opens the door for applications where the robot can localize itself actively by requesting the transmitters to change their power in real time.	algorithm;dbm;displacement mapping;global positioning system;implicit shape model;indolent systemic mastocytosis;low-power broadcasting;mobile robot;particle filter;performance;power (psychology);propagation constant;psychologic displacement;robot (device);robotic mapping;robotics;sensor node;software design;system on a chip;transmitter device component;wireless technology	Adrián Canedo-Rodriguez;Jose Manuel Rodriguez;Víctor Alvarez-Santos;Roberto Iglesias;Carlos V.

The transmission of video packets over multiple paths in a wireless sensor network improves the aggregate data rate of the network and minimizes the traffic load handled by each node. However, due to the lossy behavior of the wireless channel the aggregate transmission rate cannot always support the requested video source data rate. In such cases a packet scheduling algorithm is applied that can selectively drop combinations of video packets prior to transmission to adapt the source requirements to the channel capacity. The scheduling algorithm selects the less important video packets to drop using a recursive distortion prediction model. This model predicts accurately the resulting video distortion in case of isolated errors, burst of errors and errors separated by a lag. Two scheduling algorithms are proposed in this paper. The Baseline scheme is a simplified scheduler that can only decide upon which packet can be dropped prior to transmission based on the packet's impact on the video distortion. This algorithm is compared against the Power aware packet scheduling that is an extension of the Baseline capable of estimating the power that will be consumed by each node in every available path depending on its traffic load, during the transmission. The proposed Power aware packet scheduling is able to identify the available paths connecting the video source to the receiver and schedule the packet transmission among the selected paths according to the perceived video QoS (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio--PSNR) and the energy efficiency of the participating wireless video sensor nodes, by dropping packets if necessary based on the distortion prediction model. The simulation results indicate that the proposed Power aware video packet scheduling can achieve energy efficiency in the wireless multimedia sensor network by minimizing the power dissipation across all nodes, while the perceived video quality is kept to very high levels even at extreme network conditions (many sensor nodes dropped due to power consumption and high background noise in the channel).	multipath propagation	Ilias Politis;Michail Tsagkaropoulos;Tasos Dagiuklas;Stavros A.

The attached hosts/routers are required to transmit data as multicasting in most multimedia applications. In order to provide an ecient data routing, routers must provide multicast capability. In this paper, a new cooling schedule in Hop®eld neural network with annealing strategy is proposed to calculate the shortest path (SP) tree for multicast open shortest path ®rst (MOSPF) protocol. The SP tree in multicast is built on demand and is rooted at the source node. To facilitate the hardware implementation, the annealed Hop®eld neural network could be a good candidate to deal with SP problems in packet switching computer networks. In addition, it is proved that the proposed new cooling schedule is more suitable in all range of ®xed temperature than the other demonstrated cooling schedules in the experimental results.

To this we add two constraints the possibility of sensor failure and the fact that each sensor must tradeoff its own resource consumption with overall network objectives. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of data-centric information routing in sensor networks under all the above constraints. Unlike existing techniques, we use game theory to model intelligent sensors thereby making our approach sensor-centric. Sensors behave as rational players in an N-player routing game, where they tradeoff individual communication and other costs with network wide benefits. The outcome of the sensor behavior is a sequence of communication link establishments, resulting in routing paths from reporting to querying sensors. We show that the optimal routing architecture is the Nash equilibrium of the N-player routing game and that computing the optimal paths (which maximizes payoffs of the individual sensors) is NP -Hard with and without data-aggregation. We develop a game-theoretic metric called path weakness to measure the qualitative performance of different routing mechanisms. This sensor-centric concept which is based on the contribution of individual sensors to the overall routing objective is used to define the Quality of Routing (QoR) paths. Simulation results are used to compare the QoR of different routing paths derived using various energy-constrained routing algorithms.	algorithm;dynamic data;game theory;media redundancy protocol;nash equilibrium;programming paradigm;routing;sensor;shortest path problem;simulation	Rajgopal Kannan;Sudipta Sarangi;S.

Although recently proposed hybrid Networks-on-chip (NoCs), which implement both electrical and optical links, improve power efficiency, they often fail to combine these two interconnect technologies efficiently and suffer from considerable laser power overheads caused by high-bandwidth optical links. We argue that these overheads can be avoided by inserting a higher quantity of low-bandwidth optical links in a topology, as this yields lower optical loss and in turn laser power. Moreover, when optimally combined with electrical links for short distances, this can be done without trading off latency. We present the effectiveness of this concept with Lego, our hybrid, mesh-based NoC that provides high power efficiency by utilizing electrical links for local traffic, and low-bandwidth optical links for long distances. Electrical links are placed systematically to outweigh the serialization delay introduced by the optical links, simplify router microarchitecture, and allow to save optical resources. Our routing algorithm always chooses the link that offers the lowest latency and energy. Compared to state-of-the-art proposals, Lego increases throughput-per-watt by at least 40%, and lowers latency by 35% on average for synthetic traffic. On SPLASH-2/PARSEC workloads, Lego improves power efficiency by at least 37% (up to 3.5x).	algorithm;dhrystone;electrical connection;interrupt latency;low-power broadcasting;microarchitecture;network on a chip;performance per watt;router (computing);routing;serialization;system on a chip;throughput	Sebastian Werner;Javier Navaridas;Mikel Luján	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)	10.1109/HPCA.2017.23	parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;bandwidth;computer network	Arch	3.32725378374858	62.92914307963761	52893

The refresh rate quantifies how often the function can be re-computed with new data at sensor nodes. Giridhar and Kumar (2005) considered deterministic function computation for two important classes of functions (type-threshold and type-sensitive functions) and showed that for networks with high degree (random planar geometric graph with n nodes and average degree Theta(log n)), type- threshold functions (e.g. max) are easy to compute (refresh rate of Theta(1/log(n))), and type-sensitive functions (e.g. average) can be computed only at a rate Theta(1/log(n)). In this paper, we first show that type-threshold functions can be computed at an optimal refresh rate of Theta(1) over networks with finite degree. However, the computation of type-sensitive function do not become uniformly faster as the graph degree becomes smaller. We demonstrate that while some type-sensitive functions (such as computing parity) are not hard to compute in finite degree graphs (we can achieve a refresh rate proportional to (1/d), where d is the maximum graph degree), there exist type-sensitive functions (e.g., computing the average to one-bit precision) in this class that cannot be deterministically computed faster than Theta(1/log n) even for finite degree graphs. However, by relaxing the requirements to allow probabilistic guarantees, computing the average can be achieved at a refresh rate of Theta(1) over any graph with bounded degree and a refresh rate of Theta(1/ log log n) for random planar networks. Further, for random planar networks operating over an AWGN channel with signal power path-loss, we show that even refresh rates of Theta(1) can be achieved with vanishing distortion when the power path- loss exponent is strictly less than 4. Thus, relaxing deterministic computation guarantees to probabilistic requirements enables sizea	additive white gaussian noise;computation;degree (graph theory);deterministic automaton;distortion;existential quantification;geometric graph theory;refresh rate;requirement	Sundar Subramanian;Piyush Gupta;Sanjay Shakkottai	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	10.1109/ISIT.2007.4557216	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;wireless sensor network;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Theory	14.340676388107594	79.01657259931162	52925

We investigate TPC in multi-hop and single-hop WSNs using typical Telosb platform parameters, which are IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliant. We provide a more detailed description of a new approach to testing TPC in multi-hop networks at the physical layer, and provide energy consumption performance results via simulation and a numerical model. Our results indicate that sending packets using a short-range multi-hop path, instead of a single-hop, does not necessarily save energy as suggested by some researchers (Zhao and Leonidas, in Wireless Sensor Networks: An Information Processing Approach, 2004; Kai et al., in 6th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications Proceedings, pp. 675–679, 2006; Monks et al., in 26th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks, 2001. Proceedings. LCN 2001, pp. 550–559, 2001). Moreover, transmitting in single-hop networks at lower transmission power levels, while still maintaining reliable connectivity, reduced energy consumption by up to 23 %. Both the radiation and electronic components of the energy consumption are charM.

Furthermore, we show that both packet collisions and delays affect the performance of WSNs that have an increased number of hops. Since the use of TPC in star topology/cellular networks transmission can save energy, we recommend cluster based (hybrid) or similar topology over completely multi-hop topology.	computer simulation;electronic component;email;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;information processing;lecture notes in computer science;mathematical optimization;network packet;numerical analysis;sensor node;star network;transmitter;virtual channel	Mahir Meghji;Daryoush Habibi	2014	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-013-9837-4	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Embedded	8.071688274414704	83.37718764686963	53099

Both the nodes in the network and the jammer are capable of switching frequencies. Existing literature mostly thrive on mechanisms with a mutually pre-decided hopping-sequence or on random frequency-hopping techniques. However, these mechanisms often fall short in the context of energy-constrained WSNs. We propose a frequency-hopping strategy based on the optimal decision rule. The proposed solution takes into account the individual decision profiles of all the concerned nodes, and finally, makes the decision for the welfare of the overall network. The objective is to find an optimal frequency hopping rule to obtain the maximum throughput. We observe that the packet delivery ratio of the network improves by approximately 30% after the application of the optimal decision rule for frequency-hopping. The overall network energy consumption is also improved by approximately 53% by the application of the proposed solution approach, as observed from the results.	frequency-hopping spread spectrum;logic programming;radio jamming	Prasenjit Bhavathankar;Subhadeep Sarkar;Sudip Misra	2017	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2017.03.009	computer science;computer network;distributed computing;wireless sensor network;throughput;rule-based system;energy consumption;optimal decision;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;network packet	Mobile	11.429632439112842	82.56582211033692	53126
6d15d50f54cd4e7acb6651e16eb37de200364eb4	experimental evaluation of routing schemes for intermittently connected wireless mobile networks	resource utilization;performance evaluation;quality metrics;dtn;routing schemes	Several routing schemes have been proposed for intermittently connected wireless mobile networks. The effectiveness of these routing schemes is mostly evaluated using the metrics: messages delivered, message traffic and delay suffered by delivered messages. These metrics provide very limited evaluation of routing schemes. Even very simple and well known attributes like time and space complexity of routing schemes were not measured for evaluating the quality and applicability of routing schemes. Therefore, many significant aspects such as, resource utilization, efficiency in terms of space and time, quality of service parameters and security aspect etc. of routing schemes get overlooked. In this paper, we present the results of experimental evaluation, through simulation, of routing schemes for intermittently connected wireless mobile networks such as Delay Tolerant Network. We evaluated four routing schemes, based on different principles, namely First contact, Epidemic, Spray and wait and Dynamic Social Grouping, on parameters, such as, resource utilization, efficiency, performance and security. We found Spray and wait routing scheme performed better than others, both in terms of resource utilization and efficiency (time and space).	routing	Shri Rahul Johari;Neelima Gupta;Sandhya Aneja	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-3109-4	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;in situ resource utilization;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;metrics;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.7001676129027887	85.25152084282409	53186

With the emergence of the Smart Grid Automated Meter Infrastructure (AMI), an international PLC standards gap was identified requiring new technology to serve market needs for higher bitrates and increased robustness [1]. This paper provides a brief history of PLC technology alternatives and the emergence of NB OFDM PLC solutions that fill this “standards gap”. We discuss power line channel impairments (e.g., noise, impedance) that we have measured on power grids and in dwellings such as in high rise buildings [2]. These studies have influenced emerging international NB OFDM PLC standards [3] [4] and existing NB OFDM PLC solutions [5] [6]. An important topic beyond NB PLC standardization is defining how the new modems coexist with legacy PLC modems operating in the same frequency band. SGIP PAP-15 [6] has done considerable work coordinating PLC coexistence requirements with IEEE P1901.2, ITU-T G.990x standards development; and PRIME and G3-PLC Alliances. Semiconductor's role is then to provide a hardware and software platform to realize a robust communications solution that can be deployed around the world. So then another important topic addressed is computational complexity. We roughly estimate modem computations as a function of signal bandwidth. This analysis shows that NB OFDM PLC standards can be implemented in software using a simple microprocessor; and in addition the same hardware platform can be used to implement the various standards.	bandwidth (signal processing);characteristic impedance;coexist (image);computation;computational complexity theory;emergence;frequency band;microprocessor;modem;naive bayes classifier;power-line communication;requirement;semiconductor	Donald Shaver;David H.

c2b7702158d82e6c2a6adf60a72ffc3a2be5df2d	an energy efficient distributed approach-based agent migration scheme for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks	wsn;agent migration protocol;data aggregation;mobile agent	The use of mobile agents for collaborative processing in wireless sensor network has gained considerable attention. This is when mobile agents are used for data aggregation to exploit redundant and correlated data. The efficiency of agent-based data aggregation depends on the agent migration scheme. However, in general, most of the proposed schemes are centralized approach-based schemes where the sink node determines the migration paths for the agents before dispatching them in the sensor network. The main limitations with such schemes are that they need global network topology information for deriving the migration paths of the agents, which incurs additional communication overhead, since each node has a very limited communication range. In addition, a centralized approach does not provide fault tolerant and adaptive migration paths. In order to solve such problems, we have proposed a distributed approach-based scheme for determining the migration path of the agents where at each hop, the local information is used to decide the migration of the agents. In addition, we also propose a local repair mechanism for dealing with the faulty nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs better than existing schemes in the presence of faulty nodes within the networks, and manages to report the aggregated data to the sink faster.	agent-based model;centralized computing;data aggregation;distributed algorithm;experiment;fault tolerance;file spanning;global network;mobile agent;network topology;overhead (computing);response time (technology);simulation;spanning tree	Govind P.

In this paper, we focus more closely on the use of source coding, i.e. encoding is done only at the source, as an alternative to network coding to facilitate content distribution under such limited bandwidth configuration. We observe analytically and experimentally that, in this specific case, with appropriately chosen expansion factors, source coding can have comparable performance to network coding in terms of distribution time, yet consuming much less computational resources than the latter approach does.	computation;computational resource;data compression;digital distribution;experiment;linear network coding;norm (social);peer-to-peer;program lifecycle phase	Khanh Nguyen;Hidenori Nakazato	2011	2011 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference - GLOBECOM 2011	10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133781	linear network coding;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;logical topology;source code	Metrics	-2.7113125349956473	86.43207626997973	53279

A strong error correction mechanism can be used to tolerate the increasing memory cell failure rate as supply voltage is reduced. However, strong error correction often incurs a high latency relative to the on-chip memory access time. We propose correction prediction where a fast mechanism predicts the result of strong error correction to hide the long latency of correction. Subsequent pipeline stages execute using the predicted values while the long latency strong error correction attempts to verify the correctness of the predicted values in parallel. We present a simple correction prediction implementation, CP, which uses a fast, but weak error correction mechanism as the correction predictor. Our evaluations for a 32KB 4-way set associative SRAM L1 cache show that the proposed implementation, CP, reduces the average cache access latency by 38%-52% compared to using a strong error correction scheme alone. This reduces the energy of a 2-issue in-order core by 16%-21%.	access time;cas latency;cpu cache;correctness (computer science);dynamic voltage scaling;elegant degradation;error detection and correction;failure rate;image scaling;kerrison predictor;memory cell (binary);static random-access memory;system on a chip;voltage regulator	Henry Duwe;Xun Jian;Rakesh Kumar	2015	2015 IEEE 21st International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)	10.1109/HPCA.2015.7056055	parallel computing;real-time computing;soft error;computer hardware;computer science	Arch	7.546957684631093	61.286121021871374	53287

However, routing benefits considerably if one can take advantage of knowledge concerning node mobility. This paper addresses this problem with a generic algorithm based on the use of a high-dimensional Euclidean space, that we call MobySpace, constructed upon nodes’ mobility patterns. We provide here an analysis and a large scale evaluation of this routing scheme in the context of ambient networking by replaying real mobility traces. The specific MobySpace evaluated is based on the frequency of visits of nodes to each possible location. We show that routing based on MobySpace can achieve good performance compared to that of a number of standard algorithms, especially for nodes that are present in the network a large portion of the time. We determine that the degree of homogeneity of node mobility patterns has a high impact on routing. And finally, we study the ability of nodes to learn their own mobility patterns.	algorithm;ambient network;delay-tolerant networking;generic programming;routing;sed;tracing (software)	Jeremie Leguay;Timur Friedman;Vania Conan	2006	Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2006.299	wireless routing protocol;routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;real-time computing;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;delay-tolerant networking;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobility model;triangular routing;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	2.4816223968037323	84.65197100858542	53386

A recent protocol for ad hoc communication, the BATMAN protocol, is dependent on minimal infrastructure, in the form of mesh nodes that are used as access points, or nodes acting as an intermediary in a multi-hop connection. While BATMAN works well in a scenario in which there is a multihop path from senders to receivers at all times, it will drop the packets in intermittently-connected networks. Moreover, although implementation on a device is essential as a proof of concept, performing large scale evaluations requires a simulation platform in which variations in the operating environment can be studied. This paper is about adding the store-and-forward mechanism to the routing component in BATMAN nodes, to overcome intermittent connectivity through mobility. We describe an extension of the protocol, SF-BATMAN, that has been implemented in an interoperable manner with BATMAN, i.e. with no added signaling, and no change of basic BATMAN settings. We have implemented SF-BATMAN in a packet level simulator (NS3), and demonstrated its performance in a scenario that consists of two regions of connectivity: a well-connected mesh network and a set of sparser subnetworks. We show that the added capability enhances the performance of BATMAN, through an increase of the delivery ratio by 20% with a lower overhead, while it exhibits a similar latency in comparable network scenarios.	approximation algorithm;batman;delay-tolerant networking;embedded system;hoc (programming language);interoperability;mesh networking;network packet;operating environment;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;store and forward;unreachable memory;wireless access point	Laurent Delosières;Simin Nadjm-Tehrani	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops	10.1109/PerComW.2012.6197608	mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	1.2878334847156512	84.44685093439365	53446

The design approach consists of two parts which aim at minimizing the global probability of detection error. First, an application-specific node clustering algorithm is performed. Based on the generated topology a resource allocation scheme adapted to distributed detection is carried out. It is based on both, information from the network topology and individual sensor detection quality. Numerical results indicate significant performance gains for sensor networks with realistic resource constraints.	algorithm;cluster analysis;detection theory;network topology;ultra-wideband	Daniel Bielefeld;Gernot Fabeck;Rudolf Mathar	2009	2009 IEEE 70th Vehicular Technology Conference Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2009.5379086	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;brooks–iyengar algorithm;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Embedded	15.481228083694502	79.20487261075938	53462

This development will enable cost-effective continuous monitoring of patients in hospitals and other healthcare centers. It is anticipated that a large number of medical body area networks (MBANs) will soon operate in unlicensed frequency bands, a fact that will create a coexistence problem with legacy medical equipment. This situation is particularly challenging in small indoor areas like intensive care units (ICUs) and operating rooms (ORs). Electromagnetic interference (EMI) from wireless devices can disrupt the performance of non-communication electronic medical equipment located in ICUs and ORs. Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology that can ease the coexistence of the aforementioned systems. In this work we present an EMI-aware CR protocol for e-health applications. This protocol protects noncommunication medical equipment from harmful interference while maintaining low outage probability for wireless communication devices and MBANs. We propose the use of an additional emergency channel in a different frequency band for control/data transmission, which exploits indoor propagation conditions to lower the outage probability. Performance evaluation of the proposed protocol through numerical simulations with realistic indoor propagation conditions is presented.	catastrophic interference;coexist (image);cognitive radio;downtime;emi;frequency band;interference (communication);numerical analysis;performance evaluation;sensor;simulation;software propagation;transceiver;wearable computer;wearable technology	Raúl Chávez-Santiago;Dainius Jankunas;Vladislav V.

For this application, the goal is to minimize the amount of information that the sensor nodes have to exchange in order to achieve a certain source localization accuracy. We show that this goal can be achieved more efficiently when """"application-specific"""" quantizers are used. Our proposed quantizer design algorithm uses a cost function that takes into account the distance between the actual source position and the position estimated based on quantized data. We also propose a distributed encoding algorithm that is applied after quantization and achieves rate savings by merging quantization bins without any degradation of localization performance. The merging technique in the encoding algorithm exploits the fact that certain combinations of quantization bins at each node cannot occur because the corresponding spatial regions have an empty intersection. We apply these algorithms to a system where an acoustic sensor model is employed for localization. For this case, we introduce the Equally Distance-divided Quantizer (EDQ), designed so that quantizer partitions correspond to a uniform partitioning in terms of distance. Our simulations show the improved performance of our quantizer over traditional quantizer designs. In addition, they show rate savings (32.8%, 5 nodes, 4 bits per node) when our novel bin-merging algorithms are used. Our results also show that an optimized bit allocation leads to significant improvements in localization performance with respect to a bit allocation that uses the same number of bits for each node."""	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;elegant degradation;experiment;internationalization and localization;loss function;quantization (signal processing);sensor;simulation	Yoon Hak Kim;Antonio Ortega	2005	IPSN 2005.

34bb24fb01242ba6dc532a561a0de35df7e2a7b8	a comprehensive fault-tolerant framework for wireless sensor networks	spare cluster head;clustering;fault tolerance;cluster head;wireless sensor networks	In the last decade, wireless sensor networks WSNs have increasingly gained the attention of researchers. Depending on the applications of WSNs, the sensor nodes are usually dispersed in harsh environments, which are prone to different types of faults. Hence, fault tolerance seems as an essential characteristic that should be considered in the architecture level of these networks. On the other hand, WSNs are battery-powered so that there is a trade-off between preserving the energy and meeting the quality of service requirements of the network. In this paper, we target these challenges through proposing a fault-tolerant scheme FTS for clustered sensor networks. First, all the nodes are grouped into some clusters, and then the FTS alongside the main operation of the network, that is, data acquisition, is performed by the cluster heads. The main idea of the FTS is to efficiently use different kinds of the redundancy, including the hardware, time, and space. We validate the FTS through simulation and probabilistic analysis. While the reliability is significantly improved, we show that a clustered WSN consumes about 5-19% more energy in order to perform the FTS.

Attackers can create false reports and transmit the reports to the networks. These false reports can lead not only false alarms, but also the depletion of limited energy resources. In order to filter out such false reports during the forwarding process, Ye et al. proposed the statistical en-route filtering (SEF). Several research efforts to enhance the efficiency of SEF have been made. Especially, the path selection method proposed by Sun et al. can improve the detection power of SEF by considering the information on the filtering keys of and distances of upstream paths. However, such selection mechanism could lead to favored paths in heavy traffic, which would result in unbalanced energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a path renewal method to provide load balancing for sensor networks in terms of energy consumption. In our method, a node renews its upstream path to save energy resources if the remaining energy of and the communication traffic of the node exceed some threshold values. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of balanced energy consumption and filtering power by providing simulation results.	algorithm;biological science disciplines;depletion region;directed graph;distance;equilibrium;evaluation function;filter (signal processing);implosive therapy;load balancing (computing);node - plant part;sensor node;simulation;spectral edge frequency;unbalanced circuit	Jin Myoung Kim;Youngshin Han;Hae Young Lee;Tae Ho Cho	2011		10.3390/s110201396	computer simulation;embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;pathfinding;load balancing;distributed computing;computer security	Mobile	7.50509543281344	77.96982960132513	53699

These satellites mainly offer wideband channels that can also be transmitted via small ground stations because of the high transponder amplification. These options are used, for example, in a computer link-up experiment with the OTS satellites in which the European nuclear research centres are participating (Satellite Transmission Experiments Linking Laboratories: Stella). During the last decade, the trend in data processing has been to develop decentralized systems. Numerous studies and experiments have been carried out with data-transmission networks, and new systems configurations for computers and databanks have been developed. These systems have been designed to be widely distributed and accessible to a large number of users. Although the terrestrial transmission network in Europe operates to very rigorous standards, the effectiveness of computer link systems has been impaired by the discrepancy between the datarates and transmission qualities supplied on computer lines and by long-distance data t~ansmission. The introduction of new terrestrial transmission systems has improved the situation considerably, but the conditions necessary to provide an effective computer link are still, in many cases, not fulfilled. Data transmission via satellite offers an alternative, because transmission channels can be implemented whose datarates and transmission qualities correspond to those of transmission lines within computers. It is then possible to exchange large datafiles between computers and to carry out effective remote data processing. Work in this area is being sponsored by the European Community, which gives financial assistance to study and experimentation in, for example, the fields of standardization and transportable languages. However, as users' requirements vary widely, and, in some cases, are not very clear, work only progresses slowly.	communications satellite;computer;discrepancy function;experiment;requirement;stella;terrestrial television;transmission (bittorrent client);transmission line	Horst Fröhlich;Gerhard Bommas	1981	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(81)90125-0	telecommunications;computer science;data transmission	Security	22.694050593420304	81.35123785082065	53706

Researchers have proposed a variety of approaches to optimize existing protocols exploiting link correlation. Most existing works directly measure link correlation using packet-level transmissions and receptions. Measurement alone is insufficient because it lacks predictive power and scalability. In this paper, we present CorModel, a model for predicting link correlation in low-power wireless networks. Based on the underlying causes of link correlation, we explore four easily measurable parameters for our modeling. Besides PHY-layer parameters that previous studies have explored, we find that network-layer parameters can also have significant impact on link correlation. We validate our model and illustrate its usefulness by integrating it into existing protocols for more accurate correlation estimation. Experimental results show that our model can significantly increase the accuracy of wireless link estimation, resulting in better protocol performance.	computation;low-power broadcasting;network packet;phy (chip);routing;scalability	Zhiwei Zhao;Wei Dong;Gaoyang Guan;Jiajun Bu;Tao Gu;Chun Chen	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218471	link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	9.823045473872375	88.37423002100299	53720

The recursive dual-net is based on a recursive dual-construction of a base network. A $\bm{k}$-level dual-construction for $\bm{k≫0}$ creates a network containing $\bm{(2n_0)^{2^k}/2}$ nodes with node-degree $\bm{d_0+k}$, where $\bm{n_0}$ and $\bm{d_0}$ are the number of nodes and the node-degree of the base network, respectively. The recursive dual-net is node and edge symmetric and can contain huge number of nodes with small node-degree and short diameter. Disjoint-paths routing and fault-tolerant routing are fundamental and critical issues for the performance of an interconnection network. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for disjoint-paths and fault-tolerant routings on the recursive dual-net.	algorithm;computer;fault tolerance;interconnection;parallel computing;recursion (computer science);routing	Yamin Li;Shietung Peng;Wanming Chu	2009	2009 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies	10.1142/S0129054111008532	routing;static routing;real-time computing;computer science;multipath routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	HPC	0.014483689918968746	68.81842053938195	53724

The system does not require enumeration of nodes nor control messages, the only input to the control coming from the physical medium occupation. In addition to communication protocols, this technique can be used as inexpensive and efficient density estimation of physical entities in highly dynamic scenarios. Stability conditions are proposed by means of a rigorous theoretical investigation. We prove that our algorithm ensures stability even with unknown and time--varying network topologies. We show that good channel exploitation levels can be assured as well by suitably tuning the control parameters. A digital algorithm for practical implementation is proposed. The results are supported by simulation experiments.	algorithm;communications protocol;control theory;distributed control system;entity;experiment;network topology;node (computer science);protocol stack;simulation;transmitter	Franco Blanchini;Daniele De Caneva;Pier Luca Montessoro;Davide Pierattoni	2010	Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference	10.1145/2240166.2240179	communications protocol;fault tolerance;replication;real-time computing;decentralised system;lyapunov function;computer science;artificial intelligence;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	2.890924872818528	74.1440996234085	53762
095b05530b1d2869847b2d2565bc3d4ec169db2b	a comprehensive study of optimization algorithm for wireless coverage in indoor area	school of engineering sciences	Coverage optimization using minimum number of transmitters is critical to service providers and vendors that need to control the coverage as well as the huge costs involved. In this regards, an existing coverage algorithm for determining the minimum number of transmitting antennas as well as their appropriate locations to provide the optimized wireless coverage for indoor environment is studied in this paper. The algorithm uses ray-tracing to predict the signal distribution from the transmitter to the sampling points (receivers) and genetic algorithm to determine the minimum number of transmitters and their corresponding locations to achieve the optimum wireless coverage. The complexity and performance of the algorithm are also analyzed and it is found that it has exponentially increasing complexity of 2n and the change of computation time is greater with small change of the number of receiving points. Moreover, under the multi-transmitter scenario (real case), the accuracy achieved by fading, coverage ability, and signal to noise ratio is in the range of 96–99 %.

Recently, they gained popularity as a viable solution for wireless power transmission. Interesting to notice that data communication capability is required as well, mainly for coordinating the transfer process. In this paper, the authors address the use of chirp signaling over inductively coupled links for both time dissemination and data communications. Such an approach extends field of applications, including data acquisition and instrumentation that are used in industrial automation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified with extensive simulations and using a proof-of-concept prototype. Despite the prototype simplicity, jitter on the synchronizing reference signal is in the order of few microseconds and the bit error rate, over a short distance, is negligible.	automation;bit error rate;cell signaling;chirp;computer simulation;data acquisition;electronic component;inductive coupling;modulation;prototype;radar;time of arrival;x.690	Alessio De Angelis;Paolo Carbone;Emiliano Sisinni;Alessandra Flammini	2017	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2698838	telecommunications	Mobile	21.576746063994218	78.89962090710127	53791

Recently, Multi-Static Primary Surveillance Radar (MSPSR) has been expected to be used as primary surveillance radar alternative. MSPSR classified into passive bistatic radar uses not only conventional radar signal but also other communication signals. Among them, Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting (DTTB) is the most expected radio waves because it has high transmitted power. We have started the feasibility study of MSPSR using DTTB signal. Our system concept is to use original characteristics of DTTB. Since Japanese DTTB employs OFDM and guard interval, delayed signals caused by obstacles can be separated. In this paper, we discuss the positional estimation of obstacles and aircraft. This leads to the validation of the proposed method. Firstly, Japanese DTTB signal types of ISDB-T is introduced. Then, the principle of positional estimation is discussed. Positional estimation is started from detection of delayed signals, and positions are determined by bistatic ranging. Finally, delay profiles and bistatic ranging are shown in experimental results. Those results indicate that our proposed system concept would be useful for estimating obstacle and aircraft positions.	isdb;radio wave;terrestrial television	Junichi Honda;Takuya Otsuyama	2016	2016 IEEE 30th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2016.149	telecommunications;computer science;passive radar;multiplexing	EDA	23.52416529607833	76.82114376830216	53803

Obviously, the higher the scrubbing frequency is, the higher the system reliability is. However, it may take a few hours for a scanning process to check the whole disk. In other words, the scrubbing process may result in a downtime or a lower system performance. Furthermore, the scrubbing process consumes energy. In order to reduce the impact of disk scrubbing on disk performance and energy consumption, system designers choose to scan the disk in a low frequency, which results in a lower reliability. Additionally, conventional disk scrubbing schemes assume that the disk failure rate is constant, while the recent researches[2][6] show the disk failure rate is more complex. In this paper, we present a novel scrubbing scheme to solve the above challenges. In the scheme, an optimum scrubbing cycle is decided by keeping a balance between data loss cost, scrubbing cost, and disk failure rate. Our research shows that the scrubbing scheme is applicable for storage with low-capacity disk and inexpensive data.	data scrubbing;downtime;failure rate;memory scrubbing	Junping Liu;Ke Zhou;Liping Pang;Zhikun Wang;Yuhui Deng;Dan Feng	2009	2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC	10.1109/NCM.2009.26	probability distribution;embedded system;real-time computing;cost-effectiveness analysis;time–frequency analysis;computer hardware;computer science;failure rate;mathematical model;reliability;computer performance;low frequency;statistics;raid;systems design	OS	7.166475861168558	63.2732756329286	53814

This model has been deeply examined in the study group since the motive for this much interest is that networked computer system paradigms require a coordinator such as leader. In spite of its importance, there is only a few study that has been contributed to this coordinator election model in an ad hoc distributed system. Mobile distributed computing systems are more inclined to faults than traditional computer systems. To build an election protocol in such a mobile computing environment is not trivial. Because it is difficult task to choose a unique process from a group of mobile processes as a coordinator in spite of failures or disconnections of mobile processes. In this paper, we present an election protocol in mobile ad hoc distributed systems and we discuss some simulation results.	algorithm;computer;consensus (computer science);distributed computing;finite-state machine;hoc (programming language);leader election;mobile agent;mobile computing;mutual exclusion;network topology;semantic network;simulation	Sung-Hoon Park;Su-Chang Yoo;Bokyoung Kim	2018	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-018-2258-0	computer science;distributed computing;fault tolerance;mutual exclusion;spite;leader election;mobile computing;broadcasting;consensus	Mobile	2.5713899092680372	76.97264329300579	53816

With the arrival of new ITS applications based on multiple wireless link transmissions, however, the introduction of new mechanisms is essential to share the time domain between single-hop periodic broadcast (safety messages) and multi-hop transmission. Because the scarce 10 MHz-band is going to be used as one communication channel in Japan, a highly reliable medium access control (MAC) scheme is required to handle both safety and multi-hop messages. We propose the multi-hop transmission scheme compatible with single-hop periodic broadcast. In our solution, each terminal that transmits a multi-hop packet first starts a slot reservation procedure to avoid packet collisions with safety messages and thus maintain as high a delivery rate as possible. Then, the transmitting nodes use the D-TDMA structure to check the reception of the multi-hop packet at the relay side. If any failure is detected, the packet is retransmitted as soon as possible. Concerning the routing algorithm, we assume that messages are routed to the destination along the road having the best vehicular traffic and that the road information is provided by D-TDMA. Computer simulations were conducted for an urban environment in which vehicles are moving. The simulation results show that our scheme maintains the delivery rate of safety messages and can recover multi-hop packets in the case of transmission failure.	access control;algorithm;autonomous robot;channel (communications);computer simulation;design review (u.s. government);greedy perimeter stateless routing in wireless networks;network packet;relay;retransmission (data networks);transistor–transistor logic;transmitter;vehicle-to-vehicle	Kenji Ito;Mathieu Lenoble;Noriyoshi Suzuki	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2011.6117133	computer simulation;broadcast radiation;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer security;time division multiple access;computer network;channel	Mobile	6.124969225008534	88.32476252294877	53858

The goal is to preserve the logical adjacency between active nodes by means of a routing algorithm which delivers messages successfully to their destinations. Two phase routing strategies are introduced that route messages first to their destination FTBB, and then to the destination nodes within the destination FTBB. This strategy may be applied to a variety of architectures including binary hypercubes and 3-D tori. In the presence of f faults in these systems. It is shown that the worst case length of the message route is max( sigma +f, (K+1) sigma )+M, where sigma is the shortest path in the absence of faults, and M and K are the numbers of primary nodes and spare nodes in a FTBB, respectively. The average routing overhead is much lower than the worst case overhead. >	multiprocessing;routing	M. Sultan Alam;Rami G.

9b2afe6d1167ae4d3441df371e9ed34e724f6fb6	meet an fantastic sibyl: a powerful model in cognitive radio networks		Dynamic spectrum access is challenging, since an individual secondary user usually just has limited sensing abilities. One key insight is that primary user emergence forecasting among secondary users can help to make the most of the inherent association structure in both time and space, it also enables users to obtain more informed spectrum opportunities. Therefore, primary user presence forecasting is vital to cognitive radio networks (CRNs). With this insight, an auto regressive enhanced primary user emergence reasoning (AR-PUER) model for the occurrence of primary user prediction is derived in this paper. The proposed method combines linear prediction and primary user emergence reasoning. Historical samples are selected to train the AR-PUER model in order to capture the current distinction pattern of primary user. The training samples of the primary user emergence reasoning (PUER) model are combined with the recent samples of auto regressive (AR) model tracking recent parallel. Our scheme does not require the knowledge of the signal or of the noise power. Furthermore, the proposed model in this paper is blind in the detection that it does not require information about the channel. To verify the performance of the proposed model, we apply it to the data during the past two months, and then compare it with other method. The simulation results demonstrate that the AR-PUER model is effective and generates the most accurate forecasting of primary user occasion in several cases. Besides, it also performs much better than the commonly used energy detector, which usually suffers from the noise uncertainty problem.	cognitive radio	Wei Yang;Xiaojun Jing;Hai Huang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-76207-4_2	cognitive radio;machine learning;linear prediction;noise power;detector;autoregressive model;communication channel;artificial intelligence;computer science	AI	19.530163002409722	87.66103127434518	53875

Researchers have proposed many routing protocols that adapt to the temporary connections of DTNs. One classification of routing protocols makes use of historical information to predict future contact patterns for any pair of nodes. However, most existing protocols focus on the probability of a path from the source to the destination without considering the information in a packet which includes the source, destination, size, TTL (Time-To-Live) and limited resources such as available buffer size and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new prediction-based routing algorithm that takes into account packet information under the conditions of limited transmission opportunities. The goal of this protocol is to increase the overall delivery ratio through scheduling packets at each node. Meanwhile, this protocol may sacrifice some messages' delivery delay time to some extent. Extensive simulation results with real traces show that our protocol with packet scheduling has better performance than the pure probabilistic routing algorithms in term of delivery ratio. Our protocol's performance advantage is more obvious for nodes with higher packet intensity and shorter TTL in packets.	contact graph;greedy algorithm;matching (graph theory);network packet;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;time to live;tracing (software);transistor–transistor logic	Guoliang Liu;Janani Krishnamani;Rajshekhar Sunderraman;Yingshu Li	2013	2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742793	wireless routing protocol;routing table;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;source routing;real-time computing;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distance-vector routing protocol;probability;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Mobile	3.716561010810091	84.36423334008012	53894

Instead of modifying globally optimal shortest path routing algorithms, we propose two new algorithms that are designed to match the characterisitics of wireless physical channels in a network with dynamic ad hoc topology and mobile users. Motivated by practical constraints, we design LORA to be simple to implement at each node, requiring very low computational load and a small amount of memory, and can provide fast rerouting under distributed control when nodes or links fail. The first algorithm, LORAl, is designed for networks with slowly moving users, using a new random graphical model and randomized algorithms. The second algorithm, LORAB, is designed for fast moving users, building upon LORAl with an additional mobility diversity feature. Various properties of the algorithms are tested by simulations. Analytic results bound the performances of LORA.

An H-WSN consists of hexagonal clusters in which the distance between any two cluster heads is √3 × R, where R is the radius of a hexagonal cluster. A trade-off exists in pipelined forwarding for an H-WSN; i.e., reducing pipeline length can decrease data forwarding delay, but it will adversely increase the number of clusters, which consequently increases the total collecting time of a mobile sink. This paper therefore proposes a scheme to dynamically adjust the pipeline lengths and to periodically switch pipeline directions such that the overall throughput is increased and the energy consumption is balanced among all cluster heads.	graphics pipeline;operand forwarding;throughput	Tsang-Ling Sheu;Yao-Yuan Shang	2012	2012 18th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICON)	10.1002/wcm.2312	real-time computing;energy homeostasis;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	8.470111125142763	80.83470313260268	54143

The simulation results presented prove the correctness and effectiveness of the analysis, which is important to provide a framework for parameters setting in AoA based PLSK.	angle of arrival;correctness (computer science);key (cryptography);key generation;operability;simulation	Yida Wang;Xinrong Guan;Yueming Cai	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2016.7752524	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	EDA	23.78402291862627	71.0299864117297	54150

In this paper, we investigate the use of polymorphic gates as a new mechanism for implementing a unique chip ID in systems already containing some polymorphic gates. The proposed solution exploits the fact that switching time of polymorphic gates (controlled by  V dd  ) is slightly different even for neighboring gates on the same die because of fabrication variations. We applied a partial reconfiguration in order to generate 48-bit IDs on the reconfigurable polymorphic REPOMO32 chip that we have developed in our previous research. We achieved 94.44% stable bits which is reasonably close to existing approaches.

However, most of these approaches require a costly training step to build a Wi-Fi's map for each location. ISIL has been proposed as the first Wi-Fi-based technique that is training-free, in which the localization can be done instantly at any location without the need of training. However, due to its simplicity, ISIL does not provide adequate accuracy. In this paper, we proposed CGSIL, another training-free localization that is two times more accurate than ISIL by utilizing collaborative filtering and geographic clustering on the location information.	cluster analysis;collaborative filtering;ieee john von neumann medal;internationalization and localization;mobile device;observable;search engine optimization	Thong M.

Many commercial MCS platforms have arisen, enabling various novel applications. As crowd workers can be unreliable, a critical issue of these platforms is quality control. Many task assignment approaches have been proposed to increase the quality of crowd sourced tasks by matching workers and tasks in a bipartite graph. However, they fail to apply to MCS platforms where tasks are bound with locations. This paper considers the quality-aware online task assignment problem with location-based tasks. The goal is to optimize tasks' overall quality by assigning appropriate sets of tasks to workers in an online manner. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic quality measurement model and a hitchhiking model to characterize workers' behavior. Then we design a polynomial-time online assignment algorithm and prove that the proposed algorithm approximates the offline optimal solution with a competitive ratio of 10/7. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.	activity selection problem;assignment problem;competitive analysis (online algorithm);computation;crowdsourcing;online algorithm;online and offline;polynomial;programming paradigm;simulation;time complexity	Xin Miao;Kebin Liu;Lei Chen;Yunhao Liu	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2015.40	algorithm design;real-time computing;simulation;mobile telephony;computer science;machine learning;bismuth;reliability;database;distributed computing;silicon;crowdsourcing;approximation algorithm;statistics;computer network	EDA	13.541653875182678	70.95738412777028	54311

However, one major challenge in implementing multivariates in embedded systems is that the key size can be prohibitively large for applications with stringent resource constraints such as low-cost smart cards, sensor networks (e.g., Berkeley motes), and radio-frequency identification (RFID). In this paper, we investigate strategies for shortening the key of a multivariate PKC. We apply these strategies to the Tame Transformation Signatures (TTS) as an example and quantify the improvement in key size and running speed, both theoretically and via implementation. We also investigate ways to save die space and energy consumption in hardware, reporting on our ASIC implementation of TTS on a TSMC 0.25μm process. Even without any key shortening, the current consumption of TTS is only 21 μA for computing a signature, using 22,000 gate equivalents and 16,000 100-kHz cycles (160 ms). With circulant-matrix key shortening, the numbers go down to 17,000 gates and 4,400 cycles (44 ms). We therefore conclude: besides representing a future-proofing investment against the emerging quantum computers, multivariates can be immediately useful in niches.	application-specific integrated circuit;circulant matrix;computer;cryptosystem;electronic signature;embedded system;gate equivalent;key size;netware file system;pkc (conference);public-key cryptography;quantum computing;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;smart card;tame	Bo-Yin Yang;Chen-Mou Cheng;Bor-rong Chen;Jiun-Ming Chen	2006		10.1007/11734666_7	embedded system;smart card;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;computer security;ubiquitous computing;algorithm	Security	9.570010567851353	65.88192411051597	54376

It uses chase packets to improve the route request process. In Blocking-ERS, most of the time the fulfilled route request manages to escape from the chase packet with the help of mobility. So its success rate in the catching process is low due to the immature discard of chase packets. We are proposing an improved algorithm named Blocking-ERS-Plus to overcome this deficiency in Blocking-ERS by allowing chase packets be broadcasted until the catching is insured to maximise the success rate. We provide detailed performance evaluation using simulation modelling and compare Blocking-ERS-Plus with both Blocking-ERS and AODV. Our findings show that Blocking-ERS-Plus outperforms both BlockingERS and AODV by reducing end-to-end delay due to the reduction in network congestion and by improving route request latency, routing overhead, and packet loss due to the higher success rate in the catching process which has positive impact on the network performance.	algorithm;angular defect;blocking (computing);chase (algorithm);default route;end-to-end principle;network congestion;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;routing;simulation	Mznah Al-Rodhaan;Lewis M.

Specifically, due to the high propagation delay of acoustic signals in UWSNs, referred as spatial-temporal uncertainty, current terrestrial MAC schemes do not work well in UWSNs. Hence, we consider spatial-temporal uncertainty in the design of an energy-efficient TDMA-based MAC protocol for UWSNs. We first translate the TDMA-based scheduling problem in UWSNs into a special vertex-coloring problem in the context of a spatial-temporal conflict graph (ST-CG) that describes explicitly the conflict delays among transmission links. With the help of the ST-CG, we propose two novel heuristic approaches: 1) the traffic-based one-step trial approach (TOTA) to solve the coloring problem in a centralized fashion; and for scalability, 2) the distributed traffic-based one-step trial approach (DTOTA) to assign the data schedule for tree-based routing structures in a distributed manner. In addition, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is derived to obtain a theoretical bound for the TDMA-based scheduling problem in UWSNs. Finally, a comprehensive performance study is presented, showing that both TOTA and DTOTA guarantee collision-free transmission. They thus outperform existing MAC schemes such as S-MAC, ECDiG, and T-Lohi in terms of network throughput and energy consumption.	acoustic cryptanalysis;centralized computing;graph coloring;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;propagation delay;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);sensor;serializability;software propagation;terrestrial television;throughput	Chih-Cheng Hsu;Ming-Shing Kuo;Cheng-Fu Chou;Kate Ching-Ju Lin	2013	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2012.2220155	real-time computing;integer programming;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;distributed computing;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	8.375628639131085	87.76995511147014	54421

However, with growing levels of integration, the traditional NoCs suffer from high latency and energy dissipation in on-chip data transfer due to conventional multihop metal/dielectric-based interconnects. Three-dimensional integration, on-chip photonics, RF, and wireless links have been proposed as radical low-power and low-latency alternatives to the conventional planar wire-based designs. Wireless NoCs with Carbon NanoTube (CNT) antennas are shown to outperform traditional wire-based NoCs significantly in achievable data rate and energy dissipation. However, such emerging and transformative technologies will be prone to high levels of failures due to various issues related to manufacturing challenges and integration. On the other hand, several naturally occurring complex networks such as colonies of microbes and the World Wide Web are known to be inherently robust against high rates of failures and harsh environments. This article advocates adoption of such complex network-based architectures to minimize the effect of wireless link failures on the performance of the NoC. Through cycle-accurate simulations it is shown that the wireless NoC architectures inspired by natural complex networks perform better than their conventional wired counterparts even in the presence of high degrees of link failures. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed wireless NoC architecture by incorporating both uniform and application-specific traffic patterns.	complex network;data rate units;electrical connection;interconnection;low-power broadcasting;multi-core processor;network on a chip;programming paradigm;radio frequency;scalability;simulation;world wide web	Paul Wettin;Anuroop Vidapalapati;Amlan Ganguly;Partha Pratim Pande	2013	JETC	10.1145/2491676	multi-core processor;embedded system;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;carbon nanotube;computer science;engineering;nanotechnology;network operations center	Mobile	2.771714446030507	61.34191192651853	54485

The new link cache effectively utilizes the memory by caching the routes in adjacent list type of data structures. It selects the shortest hop and least congested path, which in turn reduce the control packets, route request packets, route reply packets and increase the data packets forwarded by the nodes. To solve the DSR route maintenance problem during high mobility, source transparent route maintenance method is introduced in this paper.

However, as the traffic burden rises, the nodes turn into soaked and drop previously stored messages that reduce the delivery ratio and increase end-to-end delay. Hereby it is vital to compute the accurate quality value of nodes. In this paper, we have proposed a Contact Quality Based Forwarding strategy (CQBFS) for city-based environments where nodes are heterogeneous, resources are scarce and traffic density is high. The activity of a node is measured in terms of its ability to transmit the carried message and drop magnitude. Moreover, an effective quality impact based buffer management policy has been used to control the impact of message drop on network throughput. The proposed CQBFS outperforms PRoPHET, Epidemic, Maxprop and TTL based routing protocols in terms of message transmissions, delivery probability, message drop, end-to-end delay and Hop count average under the real time traces Sassy and Helsinki city.	delay-tolerant networking	Qaisar Ayub;Sulma Rashid;M.

Apparently the STA-MAP association mechanism and the backhaul routing impact the available bandwidth that can be allocated to each STA. In this paper, we formulate a joint optimization problem of STA-MAP association, backhaul routing and bandwidth allocation. Our rigorous framework maximizes the network throughput while guaranteeing network-wide fairness among STAs, taking into account the bandwidth constraints of both access and backhaul links, as well as the wireless interference. We then develop approximation algorithms for efficiently solving the joint optimization problem. A method to decouple topology construction and bandwidth allocation is proposed to simplify the optimization problem under integral association and single- path routing, which is NP hard in the original formulation. We also use the clique approximation to alleviate the complexity for constructing the wireless interference constraints. Furthermore a scheduling algorithm is proposed, which coordinates channel access to provide bandwidth guarantee and can recover certain performance loss due to the clique approximation. Our evaluation demonstrates that constructing a good logical topology can improve throughput while enhancing fairness, and our algorithms can achieve performance close to the optimal solution to the joint association, routing and bandwidth allocation problem.	approximation algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);coupling (computer programming);fairness measure;interference (communication);internet access;logical topology;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maximal set;mesh networking;multipath routing;multistage interconnection networks;multitier architecture;optimization problem;scheduling (computing);throughput;wireless access point;wireless mesh network	Lin Luo;Dipankar Raychaudhuri;Hang Liu;Mingquan Wu;Dekai Li	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.122	switched mesh;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;distributed computing;scheduling;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	-4.378743749814647	83.22875939385295	54606

The photonic links in the PNoC comprise laser sources, optical ring resonators, passive waveguides, and photodetectors. Reliable link operation requires laser sources and ring resonators to have matching optical frequencies. However, inherent thermal sensitivity of photonic devices and manufacturing process variations can lead to a frequency mismatch. To avoid this mismatch, micro-heaters are used for thermal trimming and tuning, which can dissipate a significant amount of power. This paper proposes a novel FreqAlign workload allocation policy, accompanying an adaptive frequency tuning (AFT) policy, that is capable of reducing thermal tuning power of PNoC. FreqAlign uses thread allocation and thread migration to control temperature for matching the optical frequencies of ring resonators in each photonic link. The AFT policy reduces the remaining optical frequency difference among ring resonators and corresponding on-chip laser sources by hardware tuning methods. We use a full modeling stack of a PNoC that includes a performance simulator, a power simulator, and a thermal simulator with a temperature-dependent laser source power model to design and evaluate our proposed policies. Our experimental results demonstrate that FreqAlign reduces the resonant frequency gradient between ring resonators by 50%–60% when compared to existing workload allocation policies. Coupled with AFT, FreqAlign reduces localized thermal tuning power by 19.28 W on average, and is capable of saving up to 34.57 W when running realistic loads in a 256-core system without any performance degradation.	adaptive grammar;align (company);automatic frequency control;elegant degradation;gradient;integrated circuit layout;logical topology;manycore processor;multi-core processor;network on a chip;performance tuning;process migration;resonance;simulation	Jos&#x00E9; L.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the efficient multicast data delivery in vehicle networks, based on the trajectories of vehicles in the multicast group. Due to the privacy concern, we assume only a central server knows the trajectory of each vehicle and the estimated current location of the vehicle. Therefore, after receiving a request of multicast data delivery from a source vehicle, the central server has to figure out how the data has to be delivered to the moving vehicles in the multicast group. For each target vehicle in the multicast group, multiple packet-and-vehicle rendezvous points are computed as a set of relay nodes to temporarily hold the data, considering the vehicle's trajectory. This set of rendezvous points can be considered an Anycast set for the target vehicle. We have formulated the multicast data delivery as the data delivery to the anycast sets of the multicast group vehicles. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is shown that our design provides an efficient multicast for moving vehicles under a variety of vehicular traffic conditions. Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have become one of key components in Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) [1–5]. This is because VANET can support the in situ delivery of data messages for emergency information dissemination (e.g., accidents and driving hazards), real-time traffic estimation for trip planning, and mobile Internet services. Espectially, for the driving safety (e.g., collision warning message delivery), VANET is more prompt and reliable than cellular networks (e.g., 3G and 4G-LTE) having an additional delay due to data relay via base stations. Also, to support various road network services with cellular networks while servicing the data and voice traffic generated by cellular phones and smartphones, the service providers of the cellular networks will have to spend significant expenses for the infrastructure expansion and service maintenance due to those additional road network services. Based on these observations, VANET is considered worthy of specialized wireless networks for road network services. For a varity of road network services for the driving safety and efficiency, VANET can leverage the wireless communications for up-to-date data sharing among vehicles having common …	algorithm;anycast;compaq lte;cyber-physical system;global positioning system;internet privacy;mobile phone;multicast;network packet;quality of service;real-time transcription;relay;server (computing);simulation;smartphone;software deployment;source routing;steiner tree problem;throughput;tower mounted amplifier;web service;web traffic	Jae Hoon Jeong;Tian He;David Hung-Chang Du	2013	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2013.05.002	anycast;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer security;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	1.9188500549226197	88.25688361610788	54753

Protocols used in terrestrial sensor networks cannot be directly applied in the underwater world. High-bit error rate and large propagation delay make the design of transport protocols especially awkward. ARQ-based reliable transport schemes are not appropriate in underwater environments due to large propagation delay, low communication bandwidth, and high error probability. Thus, we focus on redundancy-based transport schemes in this paper. We first investigate three schemes that employ redundancy mechanisms at the bit and/or packet level to increase the reliability in a direct link scenario. Then, we show that the broadcast property of the underwater channel allows us to extend those schemes to a case with node cooperative communication. Based on our analysis, an adaptive redundancy transport protocol (ARRTP) for underwater sensor networks is proposed. We suggest an architecture for implementation. For two kinds of topologies, namely, regular and random, we show that ARRTP presents a better transmission success probability and energy efficiency tradeoff for singleand multihop transmissions. We also offer an integrated case study to show that ARRTP is not only supplying reliability but also has some positive effect in guiding the deployment of underwater sensor nodes.

Typically, these networks use L2 or L3 meshing mechanisms to route user traffic along a unique path out of the mesh. Their designs are driven by coverage and wireless capacity concerns, with wired backhaul links assumed to be high capacity. In this work we consider networks in which the wireless mesh links have comparable data-rates to the wired backhaul and ask how users can achieve high data-rates in practice. For these networks, we develop an opportunistic backhaul aggregation technique based on MPTCP and demonstrate it on Linux gateways.	backhaul (telecommunications);internet access;internetworking;linux;serial experiments lain;social network aggregation;wireless mesh network	Thanh-Hieu Nong;Ricky Wong;Wahab Almuhtadi;Jordan Melzer	2014	2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785428	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;switched mesh;service set;wi-fi;wireless wan;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;mesh networking;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;wireless lan controller;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;municipal wireless network;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	-2.061908554616056	85.09314207409781	54822

We focus on the problem of jointly optimizing the energy allocation of the energy beacon to different sensors and the data transmission powers of the sensors in order to minimize the field reconstruction error at the sink. In contrast to the standard ideal linear energy harvesting (EH) model, we consider practical non-linear EH models. We investigate this problem under two different frameworks: i) an optimization approach where the energy beacon knows the utility function of the nodes, channel state information and the energy harvesting characteristics of the devices; hence optimal power allocation strategies can be designed using an optimization problem and ii) a learning approach where the energy beacon decides on its strategies adaptively with battery level information and feedback on the utility function. Our results illustrate that deep reinforcement learning approach can obtain the same error levels with the optimization approach and provides a promising alternative to the optimization framework.	channel state information;exponential hierarchy;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;reinforcement learning;sensor;utility	Ayça Özçelikkale;Mehmet Koseoglu;Mani Srivastava	2018	2018 IEEE 19th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2018.8445968	wireless sensor network;mathematical optimization;channel state information;data transmission;sink (computing);reinforcement learning;energy harvesting;control engineering;data modeling;optimization problem;computer science	Robotics	15.300072026382132	82.0428717239848	54891

Existing protocols for a spatiotemporal variant of the multicast protocol called a """"mobicast"""" were designed to support a forwarding zone that moves at a constant velocity, vrarr, through sensornets. The spatiotemporal characteristic of a mobicast is to forward a mobicast message to all sensor nodes that are present at time t in some geographic zone (called the forwarding zone), Z, where both the location and shape of the forwarding zone are a function of time over some interval (t start , t end ). Mobicast routing protocols aim to provide reliable and just-in-time message delivery for mobile sink nodes. The new HVE-mobicast routing protocol is a cluster-based VE-mobicast routing protocol. The message delivery of nodes in the forwarding zone of the HVE-mobicast routing protocol is transmitted by two phase: cluster-to-cluster and cluster-to-node phases. In the cluster-to-cluster phase, the cluster-head and relay nodes are distributively notified to wake them up. In the cluster-to-node phase, all member nodes are then notified to wake up by cluster-head nodes according to the estimated arrival time of the delivery zone. The key contribution of the HVE-mobicast routing protocol is that it is more power efficient. This effect is mainly achieved by improving the predicted accuracy, especially by considering different moving speeds and directions. Finally, simulation results illustrate performance enhancements in message overhead, power consumption, and predicted accuracy, compared to existing mobicast routing protocols"""		Yuh-Shyan Chen;Yi-Jiun Liao	2006		10.1109/WCNC.2006.1683553	wireless routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;distance-vector routing protocol;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.956039154476695	80.81671512356655	54913

Previously, many flooding schemes have been studied with the intention of curtailing the problems of severe redundancies, contention, and collisions in traditional implementations. A recent approach with relatively high efficiency is 1HI by Liu et al., which uses only 1-hop neighbor The scheme achieves local optimality in terms of the number of retransmission nodes with time complexity Θ(n log n), where n is the number of neighbors of a node; however, this method tends to make many redundant transmissions. In this paper, we present a novel flooding algorithm, 2HBI (2-hop backward information), that efficiently reduces the number of retransmission nodes and solves the broadcast storm problem in ad hoc networks using our proposed concept, 2-hop backward information. The most significant feature of the proposed algorithm is that it does not require any extra communication overhead other than the exchange of 1-hop HELLO messages but maintains high deliverability. Comprehensive computer simulations show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces redundant transmissions in 1HI and in pure flooding, up to 38% and 91%, respectively ; accordingly it alleviates contention and collisions in networks.

In this paper we present a systematic benchmarking methodology that is focused on gaining finegrained insight about the relative contributions of the individual phases of the fingerprinting-based localization algorithms to their overall performance. To this end, we decompose the localization algorithms in common phases (collection of raw measurements, creation of fingerprints, pattern matching and post-processing) and systematically asses the performance of different procedures that can be applied in each of these phases. We illustrate the application of the proposed methodology using a comprehensive experimental case-study of 3 WiFi fingerprinting algorithms with 4 raw RSSI collection procedures, 3 fingerprint creation and pattern matching procedures, 4 different post-processing procedures in 3 testbeds and 4 evaluation scenarios, resulting in 36 individual experiments. The results demonstrate that in the evaluated scenarios, a lower number of WiFi APs and rather simple fingerprint creation and pattern matching can achieve better performance in terms of location accuracy than more sophisticated alternatives. The results also show that postprocessing steps like k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) procedure are indeed effective in reducing the localization error variability and extremes, thus increasing the stability of the location estimation.	altran praxis;black box;computation;computational complexity theory;deployment environment;experiment;fingerprint (computing);heart rate variability;hoc (programming language);k-nearest neighbors algorithm;pattern matching;scope (computer science);spatial variability;testbed;video post-processing;vii	Filip Lemic;Arash Behboodi;Vlado Handziski;Adam Wolisz	2014	2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275503	real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;theoretical computer science	Mobile	18.719912892094317	74.07669313330064	54987

Human- or animal-borne wireless devices can be used to detect the joining or leaving of group members, even in infrastructure-less scenarios. In this work, we apply wireless sensor networks devices to this problem that has hitherto received little attention. We analyze three points of the solution space. At one extreme, group membership information is proactively and collectively maintained by each node in the group. At the other extreme, the dissemination of group membership updates is triggered reactively by relying on a lower-level neighbor discovery protocol. In the middle lies a solution borrowing ideas from the two extremes.

An SRAM cell requires a minimum critical supply voltage (DRV) above which it preserves the stored-bit reliably. Due to process-variations, the intra-chip DRV exhibits variation with a distribution having a diminishing tail. In order to minimize leakage power while preserving data reliably, existing low-power design methods use a worst-case standby supply voltage. This worst-case voltage is larger than the highest DRV among all cells in an SRAM. In contrast, the approach uses aggressive voltage reduction and counters the ensuing unreliability by an error-control code based memory architecture. Using this approach, we explore fundamental trade-offs between power reduction and redundancy present in the SRAM. The authors establish fundamental bounds on the power reduction in terms of the DRV-distribution using techniques from information theory and algebraic coding theory. For an experimental test-chip DRV-distribution in the 90nm CMOS technology, the authors show that 49% power reduction with respect to (w.r.t.) the worst-case is a fundamental lower bound while 40% power reduction w.r.t. the worst-case is achievable by using a practical algebraic coding scheme. The authors also study the power reduction as a function of the block-length for low-latency codes since most applications using SRAM are latency constrained. The authors propose a reliable low-power memory architecture based on the Hamming code for the next test-chip implementation with a predicted power reduction of 33% while accounting for coding overheads	best, worst and average case;cmos;cell (microprocessor);coding theory;hamming code;information theory;low-power broadcasting;random access;spectral leakage;static random-access memory	Animesh Kumar;Huifang Qin;Prakash Ishwar;Jan M.

A tree-topology WSN system with 192 EndDevices and a star-topology WSN system with 80 EndDevices are implemented and evaluated in terms of both functions and performance. Test results show that the success rate of data communication is over 99%. Both theoretical analysis and realistic measurement results show that the EndDevices have a lifetime long enough for the application of supply chain monitoring. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by this line of research, we conduct an in-depth structural analysis of large ad hoc networks derived by placing nodes randomly as well as by placing them in realistic urban environments, a scenario that is rapidly gaining interest (K. Jain, et al, 2003). We use structural analysis in two illustrative settings. First, we use it to study the performance of network protocols. Our results indicate that structural analysis of interference graphs that model ad hoc networks can yield a good first order prediction of the overall protocol performance. Second, we study the robustness of a network to random node and edge failures. This study is important in the context of ad hoc networks wherein one expects nodes/edges to fail due various natural or system dependent reasons. The experimental results presented in this paper show the following: (i) structural properties of ad hoc networks depend crucially on the spatial distribution of the nodes. (ii) Structural properties of the network significantly affect the performance of protocols. (iii) Graph theoretic measures can provide good first order insights into the network protocol performance. (iv) The measures are also useful in characterizing the robustness of such networks.	apollonian network;communications protocol;end-to-end principle;graph theory;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);randomness;robustness (computer science);robustness of complex networks;simulation;structural analysis;telecommunications network	Christopher L.

The current generation of vehicles has embedded computers, GPS receivers, and number of sensors, where as the next generation of these vehicles will potentially have short-range wireless network interface. The target of ITS (Intelligent transport system) is to increase safety of passenger by exchanging warning messages between vehicles, this can be done by offering on-board network applications which is a challenge for the scientific community. In addition to safety applications, other telemetric services could improve traffic efficiency environment preservation, comfort and provide a reliable journey. Since VANET (Vehicular Adhoc Network) is composed of vehicles equipped with short range wireless communication capabilities. The performance of vehicles can be affected by high mobility pattern of the vehicle, speed of vehicle, transmission range, network breakup, traffic density and number of vehicles in the route. This paper describes the effect of the wireless transmission range on the lifetime improvement of the routing path in VANET, simulation result obtained helps to select the appropriate transmission range for increasing the lifetime of the routing path.	computer;embedded system;global positioning system;network interface;next-generation network;on-board data handling;routing;semantic network;sensor;simulation;unicast	Sanjay S.

The areas nearer the data sink experience higher data traffic and will run out of energy sooner. Circular-layer geometry takes into account the radial data traffic towards the data sink. We may construct an algorithm to divide the network into equal-area circular-layers, which are analogous to the square design in geographical adaptive fidelity (GAF). However, the circular-layer geometry alone has not taken into account the uneven data traffic. This paper proposes a circular-layer algorithm that schedules the sensors into active and sleep states in such a way as to evenly distribute the power consumption throughout the sensor networks. We divide the network into circular layers with the data sink at the center. The algorithm equalizes the lifetime time of all layers so that the nodes near the data sink will not run out of energy sooner. Energy is also wasted in reactive routing where the sensors flood the network with omni-directional route discovery messages to find a suitable route towards the data sink. This algorithm reduces such flooding by directing the route request messages towards the data sink, resulting in more energy saving. The circular-layer geometry alone is serving to save energy. In addition, balancing the power consumption throughout the network yields an additional lifetime extension of 21% in our simulation results of a four-layer scenario	algorithm;radial (radio);routing;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation	Dali Wei;Anthony Chan;Kevin V.

They provide a repeatable way to emulate an over-the-air channel in the laboratory. As the size and bandwidth of a radio network grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to implement emulators due to the computation and bandwidth complexity. This paper presents an architecture and work-flow to design and implement high-bandwidth, real-time channel emulators using Software-Defined Radios (SDR), and openly available Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and software libraries. The paper details the steps taken to construct the “Colosseum” testbed, the world's largest channel emulator, built using this architecture. Colosseum is used as a case study to demonstrate the flexibility of this architecture that allows designers to build custom channel emulators based on their specific RF bandwidth, antenna count, channel fidelity and hardware reuuirements.	computation;etsi satellite digital radio;field-programmable gate array;library (computing);open-source software;radio frequency;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;systems architecture;terminal emulator;testbed	Ashish Chaudhari;Martin Oberkönig	2018	2018 13th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)	10.1109/ReCoSoC.2018.8449390	real-time computing;field-programmable gate array;computer hardware;wireless;radio frequency;scalability;emulation;testbed;communication channel;bandwidth (signal processing);computer science	Arch	6.625175387872081	69.78460071390859	55308

In the case of multiple senders having traffic for a given receiver, such beacons form points where collisions are likely to happen. In this paper, we present altruistic backoff (AB), a novel collision avoidance mechanism that aims to avoid collisions before the transmission of a beacon. As a result of an early backoff, senders spend less time in idle listening waiting for a beacon, thus saving significant amounts of energy. We present an implementation of AB for Texas Instruments' eZ430-rf2500 sensor nodes and we evaluate its performance with simulations and experiments.

In this technology, the phenomena known as the tag collision problem is becoming increasingly important, since it leads to a wastage of bandwidth, energy, and an increase in identification delay. There- fore, anti-collision protocols are required to mitigate collisions. Tree based protocols constitute one of the two main types of Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) anti-collision protocols. Inside this group, Collision Tree (CT) protocol constitutes a representa- tive strategy, since some other strategies are based on it. The focus of this work is to design and evaluate with VHDL the CT tag's chip design in order to extract the number of clock cycles required by the reader to identify a set of tags. A stability analysis is also per- formed.

To achieve this, it introduces new modifications to the PHY and MAC layers. A dynamic Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism is introduced at the MAC layer. RAW splits the access for different devices into small chunks of time. Using the RAW mechanism, we propose a novel Delay and Energy Aware RAW Formation (DEARF) scheme to support delay sensitive devices along with other delay tolerant devices. We exploit this to introduce four new RAWs. These new RAWs help split the access into contention free for delay sensitive devices and contention based for other devices. For scheduling resources between these devices, we give the DEARF resource allocation and evaluate the scheme with help of simulations. Devices suffer a higher delay but, at high loads, devices using the proposed scheme are able to save 30% energy per packet and upto 330% energy per device. Packet delivery ratio is 100% at low loads and 90% at high loads as compared to 95% and 27% given by the traditional access. Other delay tolerant devices save upto 16% on energy per packet transmitted and 23% on delay at high loads.	8k resolution;algorithm;dynamic invocation interface;mike lesser;network packet;phy (chip);reliable messaging;scheduling (computing);simulation;viz: the computer game	Navroz Firoz Charania;Mukesh Kumar Giluka;Tamma Bheemarjuna Reddy;A.

Throughput preservation of the link speed through protocols to a higher layer application is a known problem in high-speed communication systems. The problem is being addressed with design methodologies that offer high speed data paths, using specialized hardware, and increased processing power, commonly in the form of embedded processors. In this paper, we present a case study for a high-speed Queue Manager for ATM systems. The manager enables high-speed data transfer to/from system memory and management of logical data structures (queues). Furthermore, it provides high-speed and importantly, scalability and re-usability, so that it can be used in a wide range of ATM systems, such as workstation adapters, switches, routers, etc. In this work, we provide contributions in two directions. We describe an approach to develop a high-speed, scalable and re-usable memory manager for ATM systems, and then we provide an architecture and implementations in harware as well as in software for embedded systems. The results indicate the cost/performance trade-off’s and system scalability and thus, enable designers to choose the implementation that meets their target system requirements well.	atm turbo;cpu cache;central processing unit;data structure;embedded system;gnu compiler collection;memory management;network switch;out-of-core algorithm;requirement;router (computing);scalability;schedule;synchronous optical networking;system requirements;throughput;usability;workstation	Dimitrios N.

603ce4a1dd704de213f28bf1e39e57033e9cf924	dcopolis: a framework for simulating and deploying distributed constraint reasoning algorithms	simulation;distributed constraint reasoning;middleware	The proliferation of mobile computers—such as laptops, personal digital assistants, and smart phones—has propelled distributed computing into mainstream society. Over the past decade these technologies have spurred interest in both decentralized multiagent systems and wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. Such networks, however, present many challenges to information sharing and coordination. Interference, obstacles, and other environmental effects conspire with powerand processing-limited hardware to impose a number of challenging networking characteristics. Messages are routinely lost or delayed, connections may be only sporadically available, and network transfer capacity is nowhere near that available on modern wired networks. It is therefore imperative to emphasize local decision making and autonomy over a centralized analogue, insofar as it is possible. The majority of such decentralized decision making can be seen as a fundamental problem of propagating and then solving systems of constraints, otherwise known as Distributed Constraint Reasoning (DCR). A large class of multiagent coordination and distributed resource allocation problems can be modeled through DCR. DCR has generated a lot of interest in the constraint programming community and a number of correct and complete algorithms have been developed to solve DCR optimization problems [6, 4, 7, 1]. Evaluating the performance of these algorithms under realistic scenarios is an important and active area of research [5, 2, 9], however, comparison is complicated	agent-based model;algorithm;autonomy;centralized computing;computer;constraint programming;distributed computing;distributed constraint optimization;hoc (programming language);imperative programming;interference (communication);laptop;mathematical optimization;mobile computing;multi-agent system;personal digital assistant;simulation;smartphone	Evan Sultanik;Robert N.

Simulation is the technique which is used for evaluation of wireless networks. WSN is Multi-hop Self-configuring and consists of sensor nodes. The movements of nodes are like the patterns which can be classified into different mobility models and each of them have been characterized by its own distinctive features and also plays an important role in the connectivity of these nodes. There is numerous number of Network Simulator’s available. Here we are using the NS2 simulation tool is used to find that which mobility model is best for real-life Scenarios. The simulator is a usage of Open System Interconnections (OSI) layers utilized in wireless simulation. In this paper, we analyze the realistic mobility models likewise entity models (Manhattan model and Gauss Markov model) and group mobility model (Reference Point Group Model) and Random Waypoint mobility model. The performance study of AWSN that uses Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) as the routing protocol. Network simulation uses Randomwaypoint in the mobility model.

It addresses the effects of jitter on MPEG-2 Transport streams for DVB-T. Lot of research on algorithms for IP and ATM networks has been carried out but the problem for terrestrial networks has not been sufficiently addressed. These algorithms require more CPU time and involve complex calculations which are difficult to implement in set top boxes due to the real time system constraints and cost considerations. A moving window FIR filter approach has been used in our module. This module is simulated in terrestrial and satellite environment and observed that it performs efficiently under high jittery conditions. This method was also implemented on a set top box SOC (system-on-chip) and it demonstrated high performance.	atm turbo;algorithm;central processing unit;clock recovery;dvb-s;digital video broadcasting;finite impulse response;mpeg-2;set-top box;system on a chip;terrestrial television	Monika Jain;P.

However, in a two-tiered cluster based WSN, cluster heads (CHs) consume more energy due to extra overload for receiving data from their member sensor nodes, aggregating them and transmitting that data to the base station (BS). Therefore, proper selection of CHs and optimal formation of clusters play a crucial role to conserve the energy of sensor nodes for prolonging the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient CH selection and energy balanced cluster formation algorithms, which are based on novel chemical reaction optimization technique (nCRO), we jointly called these algorithms as novel CRO based energy efficient clustering algorithms (nCRO-ECA). These algorithms are developed with efficient schemes of molecular structure encoding and potential energy functions. For the energy efficiency, we consider various parameters such as intra-cluster distance, sink distance and residual energy of sensor nodes in the CH selection phase. In the cluster formation phase, we consider various distance and energy parameters. The algorithm is tested extensively on various scenarios of WSNs by varying number of sensor nodes and CHs. The results are compared with original CRO based algorithm, namely CRO-ECA and some existing algorithms to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption, network lifetime, packets received by the BS and convergence rate.	algorithm;cluster analysis;mathematical optimization	P.

Recent research results have demonstrated that the previously suggested scheme of the joint network-coding-compressive-sensing can greatly improve the energy efficiency and the communication reliability of WSNs. In this paper, we propose a practical scheme, Non-Binary Joint Network-Coding Compressed-Sensing(NB-JNCCS), for energy-efficient multi-hop communication in cooperative WSNs. Specially, NB-JNCCS combines non-binary compressive sensing and random linear network coding through iterative joint decoding, which helps to fully exploit the compressibility and redundancy residing in both compressed sensing and network codes, respectively. Through both simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the proposed NB-JNCCS outperforms other compared schemes.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;code;compressed sensing;iterative method;linear network coding;naive bayes classifier;simulation	Xingcheng Liu;Kai Cao;Feng Han;Paul Cull	2017	22017 IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) and IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)	10.1109/CSE-EUC.2017.198	computer network;redundancy (engineering);wireless sensor network;linear network coding;compressed sensing;sparse matrix;distributed computing;efficient energy use;decoding methods;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Robotics	16.254168796227507	81.48917042846018	55788

Due to user mobility and/or the unrestricted switching on/off of the mobile devices, links are intermittently connected and end-to-end paths may not exist, causing routing a very challenging problem. Moreover, the limited wireless spectrum and device resources together with the rapidly growing number of portable devices and amount of transmitted data make routing even harder. To tackle these challenges, the routing algorithms must be scalable, distributed, and light-weighted. Nevertheless, existing approaches usually cannot simultaneously satisfy all these three requirements. In this paper, we propose two opportunistic routing algorithms for intermittently connected mobile P2P networks, which exploit the spatial locality, spatial regularity, and activity heterogeneity of human mobility to select relays. The first algorithm employs a depth-search approach to diffuse the data towards the destination. The second one adopts a depth-width-search approach in a sense that it diffuses the data not only towards the destination but also to other directions determined by the actively moving nodes (activists) to find better relays. We perform both theoretical analysis as well as a comparison based simulation study. Our results obtained from both the synthetic data and the real world traces reveal that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of delivery latency and delivery ratio.	download;end-to-end principle;locality of reference;mobile device;peer-to-peer;personal digital assistant;principle of locality;relay;requirement;routing;scalability;search algorithm;self-organization;simulation;synthetic data;tracing (software)	Shengling Wang;Min Liu;Xiuzhen Cheng;Zhongcheng Li;Jian-Hui Huang;Biao Chen	2013	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513033	policy-based routing;wireless routing protocol;algorithm design;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile search;mobile telephony;telecommunications;mobile database;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;operating system;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;triangular routing;mobile computing;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	1.8357544727169055	82.16240603949214	55789

Several works aimed to employ radio propagation models as alternative to fingerprinting but the different sources of inaccuracies in the generation of these models result in high localization errors. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization scheme that can be directly deployed and employed without building a full radio map of the indoor environment. The proposed scheme employs the information from a radio propagation simulator and limited number of calibration measurements to perform direct localization using manifold alignment. For moving users, we exploit the correlation of their reported observations to improve the localization accuracy. The online performance evaluation shows that our algorithm achieves localization errors in the order of 2.5 to 3 m with as low as 15% – 30 % of the complete fingerprinting load.	algorithm;fingerprint (computing);manifold alignment;performance evaluation;rss;software deployment;software propagation	Sameh Sorour;Yves Lostanlen;Shahrokh Valaee	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503130	simulation	Mobile	19.28624763176167	73.80954815716419	55804

In this work we investigate a Bayesian network approach that uses a combination of radio signal strength (RSS) to distance estimation along with angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. We characterize the resulting localization accuracy using data collected outdoors using different radios, indoor data, and simulated data. We show how the localization performance degrades in indoor environments and analyze the different sources of errors that cause this performance degradation as compared to outdoor settings. We found our network is quite sensitive to variations in the distance to signal strength, and the additional angle information had only a small impact on localization accuracy.	angle of arrival;bayesian network;elegant degradation;rss;radio wave;software deployment;telecommunications network	Eiman Elnahrawy;John-Austen Francisco;Richard P.

In cases where data do not need to be archived, centrally processed, or federated, in-network data processing is becoming more common. For this purpose, various platforms like DRAGON, Innet, and CJF were proposed. However, these platforms assume that all nodes in the network are the same, i.e. the network is homogeneous. As Moore's law still applies, nodes are becoming smaller, more powerful, and more energy efficient each year; which will continue for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we can expect that as sensor networks are extended and updated, hardware heterogeneity will soon be common in networks - the same trend as can be seen in cloud computing infrastructures. This heterogeneity introduces new challenges in terms of choosing an in-network data processing node, as not only its location, but also its capabilities, must be considered. This paper introduces a new methodology to tackle this challenge, comprising three new algorithms - Request, Traverse, and Mixed - for efficiently locating an in-network data processing node, while taking into account not only position within the network but also hardware capabilities. The proposed algorithms are evaluated against a naïve approach and achieve up to 90% reduction in network traffic during long-term data processing, while spending a similar amount time in the discovery phase.	algorithm;archive;bounce message;cloud computing;computation;controlled grammar;cyber-physical system;federation (information technology);fragmentation (computing);internet of things;moore's law;naivety;network packet;network processor;network traffic control;semantic network;sensor;stream processing;traverse	Roman Kolcun;David E.

There are a number of features that are unique for 5G radio access compared to the previous generations such as a wide range of carrier frequencies and deployment options, diverse use cases with very different user requirements, small-size base stations, self-backhaul, massive MIMO, and large channel bandwidths. In this article, we propose a flexible physical layer for the NR to meet the 5G requirements. A symmetric physical layer design with OFDM is proposed for all link types, including uplink, downlink, device-to-device, and backhaul.

Therefore, researchers have persistently sought for optimization algorithms to reduce the control overhead and to increase bandwidth utilization efficiency, using mechanisms such as topology control and management, multi-rate adaptation etc. to cut down the energy expenditure in ad hoc networks. However, the energy conservation and network throughput improvement are handled separately in many cases. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that combines the multi-rate adaptation and clustering mechanisms so as to provide the optimal network throughput under very low control overhead. The framework incorporates two control mechanisms into the networking stack. The first mechanism is based on a novel clustering algorithm, called PATM (priority-based adaptive topology management), that constructs the backbone of the network topology for routing protocols. The second mechanism is a medium access control protocol, called RMAC (relay-based MAC), that provides high data transmission rates between adjacent backbone nodes. The efficiency of the unified framework is evaluated using theoretical analysis and extensive simulations with DSR (dynamic source routing) as the underlying routing protocol. We demonstrate that our solution not only significantly reduces the routing control overhead, but also substantially improves the network throughput.	ansi escape code;access control;algorithm;cluster analysis;control system;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;mathematical optimization;network topology;overhead (computing);protocol stack;relay;seamless3d;simulation;source routing;throughput;topology control;unified framework	Haixia Tan;Weilin Zeng;Lichun Bao;Tatsuya Suda	2005	WiMob'2005), IEEE International Conference on Wireless And Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications, 2005.	10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512899	wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;hierarchical routing;dsrflow;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	6.123983595073222	83.46917922973245	55991

This problem is made even more difficult in mobile ad hoc networks due to problems caused by contention, spatial reuse, and mobility. In this paper, we design a hop-by-hop multicast transport protocol, which pushes transport functionality into the core of the network. Although this requires per-flow state, a hop-by-hop approach simplifies congestion control, enables local recovery of lost packets, and provides low delay and efficient use of wireless capacity. We use a simulation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and compare its efficiency to application-layer multicast.	hoc (programming language);hop;hop-by-hop transport;multicast;network congestion;simulation;transport layer security	Manoj Pandey;Daniel Zappala	2008	2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660037	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;multicast;mobile ad hoc network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;pragmatic general multicast;geocast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;transport layer;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	1.0764974134404617	84.351732348643	56020

Using new techniques for the performance analysis we show that an original randomized four stage algorithm performs optimally: for all k 8, k-permutations are routed on the torus with k n=4+O((k nlog n) 1=2) routing steps and queue size k +o(k) with very high probability. We prove comparable results for routing in the cut-through mode: the same randomized algorithm routes packets consisting of k its each (k arbitrary), with k n=4 + 2 n + O(k (n log n) 1=2) routing steps, with very high probability. The practical importance of this work is enhanced even more by the fact that the distribution of the packets only needs to be approximately a k-permutation.	nl (complexity);profiling (computer programming);randomized algorithm;router (computing);routing;time complexity	Michael Kaufmann;Jop F.

The proposed approach adopts a swarm intelligence paradigm inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocks. The main idea is to 'guide' packets (birds) to form flocks and flow towards the sink (global attractor), whilst trying to avoid congestion regions (obstacles). The direction of motion of a packet flock is influenced by repulsion and attraction forces between packets, as well as the field of view and the artificial magnetic field in the direction of the artificial magnetic pole (sink). The proposed approach is simple to implement at the individual node, involving minimal information exchange. In addition, it displays global self-* properties and emergent behavior, achieved collectively without explicitly programming these properties into individual packets. Performance evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed Flock-based Congestion Control (Flock-CC) mechanism in dynamically balancing the offered load by effectively exploiting available network resources and moving packets to the sink. Furthermore, Flock-CC provides graceful performance degradation in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet loss, delay and energy tax under low, high and extreme traffic loads. In addition, the proposed approach achieves robustness against failing nodes, scalability in different network sizes and outperforms typical conventional approaches.	flocking (behavior);network congestion	Pavlos Antoniou;Andreas Pitsillides;Tim Blackwell;Andries Petrus Engelbrecht;Loizos Michael	2013	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2012.12.008	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;packet loss;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;computer network	Mobile	4.780540217764913	81.20592813840835	56116

It provides many advantages over classical omni-directional antenna, such as increased spatial reuse ratio and reduced energy consumption. In wireless sensor networks, location estimation is necessary for sensor nodes to provide meaningful information about their surrounding environment. Numerous localization schemes using anchor nodes equipped with low gain omni-directional antenna have been proposed. Since the omni-directional antenna radiate energy in all directions, wanted signal is easily interfered with wide range of environment noise, leading to big localization error. In contrast, a directional antenna concentrates its energy in a particular direction. The reduction in interference of surrounding sensor nodes increases localization accuracy. In this paper, we tackle the problems in estimating location of randomly deployed sensor nodes with a low gain omni-directional antenna. We propose a novel localization scheme using a mobile anchor node equipped with a directional antenna. Our localization scheme is verified by OPNET simulation software. The result shows that the proposed localization algorithm has higher accuracy and energy efficiency than other localization schemes.	algorithm;interference (communication);radiate;randomness;sensor;simulation software	Baoli Zhang;Fengqi Yu	2010	2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)	10.1109/HPCC.2010.93	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;directional antenna;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;statistics;computer network	Mobile	17.848309876436097	75.56222145219527	56121
8fdd25f0284c489629ed45fe82472cd7a8933d16	pure ddp-based cipher: architecture analysis, hardware implementation cost and performance up to 6.5 gbps	architecture analysis;hardware implementation	Using Data-Dependent (DD) Permutations (DDP) as main cryptographic primitive, a new 64-bit block cipher is presented, ten-round DDP-64. Since the sum of all outputs of the conventional DDP is a linear Boolean function, non-linear DDP-based operation F is used additionally in DDP-64. The DDP-64 is a pure DDP-based cipher, i. e. it uses only permutations and the XOR operation. The designed cipher uses very simple key scheduling that defines high performance, especially in the case of frequent key refreshing. A novel feature of DDP-64 is the use of the switchable operation preventing the weak keys. The offered high level security strength does not sacrifice the implementation performance of DDP-64. Design and hardware implementation architectures of this cipher are presented. The synthesis results for both Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) implementations prove that DDP-64 is very flexible and powerful new cipher, especially for high speed WLANs and WPANs. The achieved hardware performance up to 6.5 Gbps and the implementation area cost of DDP-64 are compared with other ciphers, used in security layers of wireless protocols (Bluetooth, WAP, OMA, UMTS and IEEE 802.11). From these comparisons, it is proven that DDP-64 is a flexible new cipher with better performance in most of the cases, suitable for wireless communications networks of present and future.	64-bit computing;application-specific integrated circuit;block cipher;bluetooth;clock rate;computation;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;data dependency;data rate units;data-directed programming;exclusive or;field-programmable gate array;high-level programming language;key schedule;microsoft outlook for mac;nonlinear system;oma;parallel computing;scheduling (computing);telecommunications network;throughput;weak key	Nikolay A.

ccc4eb7cfca5f18d06d189b4563226a98217773f	an ontology based approach for messages dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks		Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) is a special form of Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs). The continuous developments in wireless networks have paved the way for the adoption of wireless data exchange for onroad vehicles. The application of VANETs is considered as a key component within the envisioned Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). One of the primary applications of VANETs is to enhance the safety measures for the vehicles on-road. Information about vehicles, such as vehicle speed and location coordinates are passed among vehicles to improve their awareness of each other. In VANETs, vehicles are referred to as nodes within a network where each node can act as both; end devise and router. The current design of VANETs has been identified with several drawbacks, while obtaining high performance in multi-hop message dissemination being as one of the most prominent issues. This problem need a solution to improve VANET's performance, especially over networks with high node densities. In this paper, we propose an ontologybased approach for multi-hop message dissemination over VANETs as a solution that would address the above highlighted issue.	artificial intelligence;broadcast radiation;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network packet;router (computing)	Asma Bibi;Osama Rehman;Sohaib Ahmed	2018	EAI Endorsed Trans.

The recovery of the full map from partial measurements is formulated as an instance of a Dynamic Matrix Completion problem where we exploit the spatio-temporal correlations among the fingerprints.

The protocol considers the heterogeneity of end-hosts and tries to minimize the negative impact (data outage) of end-hosts' unannounced departures. For this purpose, it concentrates on end- hosts' reliability (lifetime for instance) and constructs a shared tree called ms-DDBMSST (multiple-source Degree and Delay Bounded Maximum Stability Spanning Tree) as an overlay network that involves all the participants of the application, in a distributed manner. For a given set of nodes where some of them are senders, ms-DDBMSST is a spanning tree where the receive path stability of the entire tree is maximized while satisfying the delay-from-source constraint and degree constraint for each node. We believe that this is the first approach that defines ms-DDBMSST construction problem and presents a distributed protocol for the purpose. Our performance evaluation is based on experiments in both simulated networks and PlanetLab that strongly shows the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed protocol.	downtime;experiment;file spanning;microsoft windows;multicast;overlay network;performance evaluation;planetlab;spanning tree	Thilmee M.

On the other side, simulation of MANET is really difficult and it is really important to properly design test and simulation scenario. There are various well known simulation environments over there, but this paper aims at OMNeT++[5].

Deficiencies as regards symmetry led to the subsequent formulation of biswapped networks which were later generalized to multiswapped networks so as to still enable optoelectronic implementation (as it happens, multiswapped networks also generalize previously studied hierarchical crossed cubes). Multiswapped networks of the form Msw(H ; G) are known to possess good (graphtheoretic) properties as regards their use as (optoelectronic) interconnection networks (in distributed-memory multiprocessors) and in relation to those of the component networks G and H . Combinatorially they provide a hierarchical mechanism to define new networks from existing networks (so that the properties of the new network can be controlled in terms of the constituent networks). In this paper we prove that if G and H are Hamiltonian networks then the multiswapped network Msw(H ; G) is also Hamiltonian. At the core of our proof is finding specially designed Hamiltonian cycles in 2-dimensional and heavily pruned 3-dimensional tori, irrespective of the actual networks G and H we happen to be working with. This lends credence to the role of tori as fundamental networks within the study of interconnection networks.	apollonian network;distributed memory;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);hamiltonian path;interconnection;olap cube;software deployment	Iain A.

These mobile Proximity Based Networks (PBNs) are Opportunistic Networks that enable devices to identify and communicate with each other without relying on any communication infrastructure. In addition, these networks are self organizing, highly dynamic and facilitate effective real-time communication. These characteristics render them very useful in a wide variety of complex scenarios such as vehicular communication, e-health, disaster networks, mobile social networks etc. In this work we employ the AllJoyn framework from Qualcomm which facilitates smooth discovery, attachment and data sharing between devices in close proximity. We develop Min-O-Mee, a Minutes-of-Meeting app prototype in the Android platform, utilizing the AllJoyn framework. Min-O-Mee allows one of the participants to create a minutes-of-meeting document which can be shared with and edited by the other participants in the meeting. The app harnesses the spatial proximity of participants in a meeting and enables seamless data exchange between them. This characteristic allows Min-O-Mee to share not just minutes-of-meeting, but any data that needs to be exchanged among the participants, making it a versatile app. Further, we extend the basic AllJoyn framework to enable multi-hop communication among the devices in the PBN. We devise a novel routing mechanism that is suited to a proximity centric wireless network as it facilitates data routing and delivery over several hops to devices that are at the fringe of the PBN.	algorithm;alljoyn;attachments;hoc (programming language);link-state routing protocol;location-based service;maxima and minima;min-max heap;mobile device;mobile social network;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);performance evaluation;prototype;real-time clock;routing;seamless3d;self-organization	Hatim Lokhandwala;Srikant Manas Kala;Tamma Bheemarjuna Reddy	2015	2015 International Conference on Computing and Network Communications (CoCoNet)	10.1109/CoCoNet.2015.7411252	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	1.6411897915351361	78.38618754237095	56339

e0b7f9f2ba5005db2c22e2f4e97cfa638a1b2aa2	a lightweight framework for prediction-based resource management in future wireless networks	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	The vast proliferation and widespread use of a variety of mobile devices in the heterogeneous networking environment necessitates the introduction of lightweight management mechanisms to ease the administration complexity and optimise the overall system performance. To this end, one key research problem is the design of novel functionalities in network nodes to enable their self-adaptation to varying operational conditions, e.g. their own resources saturation–and to the status of other neighbouring nodes, to assure stability and optimality in the resource management. In these terms, the introduction of advanced techniques for the load balancing of users’ requests in order to avoid the resources saturation is a fundamental objective. The latter addresses both the local node level as well as the cluster level of neighbouring nodes. In this article, an appropriate model for the management of computational system resources is proposed, enhanced with prediction schemes. An algorithmic framework is introduced for the proactive load balancing of user decision-making requests, assuming reconfigurable and autonomous mobile devices. The latter is based on the proposed metric of user satisfaction; such metric is a function of the network response time for serving the decision-making requests. An analytical model has been proposed to compute the predicted values of the user satisfaction, extending the prediction models by Andreolini. Acting on top of the typical load-balancing actions for handling the current resources saturations, the goal of this framework is to avoid the full utilisation of system resources in the near future. Afterwards, the introduced prediction-based load-balancing framework has initially been evaluated in a test-single node system and then applied in a case study system. The obtained results show the gains of the presented framework in terms of the number of dropped user requests. The introduction of prediction schemes enables to minimise the number of dropped user requests for both classes of mobile devices. It should be noted that the prediction framework optimises the failure rates for the autonomous mobile devices. This outcome indicates that the introduction of intelligence in the mobile devices eases their proactive management.	autonomous robot;computation;computer user satisfaction;delay-tolerant networking;load balancing (computing);mobile device;response time (technology)	Eleni Patouni;Damianos Kypriadis;Nancy Alonistioti	2012	EURASIP J.

To avoid such damages, it is necessary to effectively monitor the origin and development of sandstorms. To this end, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be deployed in the regions where sandstorms generally originate so that sensor nodes can collaboratively perform sandstorm monitoring and rapidly convey the observations to remote administration center. Despite the potential advantages, the deployment of WSNs in the vicinity of sandstorms faces many unique challenges, such as the temporally buried sensors and increased path loss during sandstorms. Consequently, the WSNs may experience frequent disconnections during the sandstorms. This further leads to dynamically changing topology. In this paper, a topology analysis of the WSNs for sandstorm monitoring is performed. Four types of channels a sensor can utilize during sandstorms are analyzed, which include air-to-air channel, air-to-sand channel, sand-to-air channel, and sand-to-sand channel. Based on the channel model solutions, a percolation-based connectivity analysis is performed. It is shown that if the sensors are buried in low depth, allowing sensor to use multiple types of channels improves network connectivity. Accordingly, much smaller sensor density is required compared to the case, where only terrestrial air channels are used. Through this topology analysis a WSN architecture can be deployed for very efficient sandstorm monitoring.	channel (communications);percolation;sensor;software deployment;temporal logic;terrestrial television	Pu Wang;Zhi Sun;Mehmet C.

Although such large-scale systems have regular organizations, scaling study on the network is not sufficient so far. This paper focuses on two-dimensional torus network with two typical routing algorithms, i.e., dimension-order and Duato's protocol, and presents steady and unsteady performance results. We introduce quantitative evaluation methodology and discuss scaling issues quantitatively. Evaluation results by our parallelized simulator reveal that any size of networks have similar performance features when the performance metrics are properly normalized. This paper gives a scaling view of the interconnection network for future huge-scale systems.	algorithm;emoticon;extrapolation;image scaling;interconnection;parallel computing;routing;simulation;supercomputer;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Takashi Yokota;Kanemitsu Ootsu;Takanobu Baba	2011	2011 IEEE Workshops of International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/WAINA.2011.37	routing;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-2.1158431309884738	67.06333709285188	56527

However, a common drawback of many gossip based protocols is the waste of energy in passing redundant information over the network. Thus gossip algorithms need to be re-engineered in order to be applicable for energy constrained networks. In this paper, we consider a scenario where each node in the network holds a piece of information (message) at the beginning, and the objective is to simultaneously disseminate all information (messages) among all nodes quickly and cheaply. To provide a practical solution to this problem for ad hoc and sensor networks, NBgossip algorithm is proposed, which is based on network coding and neighborhood gossip. In NBgossip, nodes do not simply forward messages they received, instead, the linear combinations of the messages are sent out. In addition, every node exchanges messages with its neighboring nodes only. Mathematical proof and simulation studies show that the proposed NBgossip terminates in the optimal O(n)-order rounds and outperforms the existing gossip based approaches in terms of energy incurred to spread all information.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;formal proof;gossip protocol;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;randomness;routing;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;terminate (software);with high probability	Feng Lu;Liang-Tien Chia;Kok-Leong Tay	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428609	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;gossip protocol;mobile ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.389623634724686	80.24765878553993	56537

Idle listening constitutes a major part of energy waste, and thus solutions such as duty cycling and the use of wake-up radios have been proposed to reduce idle listening and save energy. Compared to duty cycling, wake-up radios save more energy by reducing unnecessary wake-ups and collisions. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and potential benefits of using passive RFID as a wake-up radio. We first introduce a physical implementation of sensor nodes with passive RFID wake-up radios and measure their energy cost and wake-up probability. Then, we compare the performance of our RFID wake-up sensor nodes with duty cycling in a Data MULE scenario through simulations with realistic application parameters. The results show that using a passive RFID wake-up radio offers significant energy efficiency benefits at the expense of delay and the additional low-cost RFID hardware, making RFID wake-up radios beneficial for many delay-tolerant sensor network applications.	caffeine;data mule;duty cycle;passive optical network;radio-frequency identification;simulation;wake-on-lan	He Ba;Ilker Demirkol;Wendi B.

5fc2bab2f8b008a97f224d04448b86f3389e4cc8	routing in hybrid delay tolerant networks	overlay network;delay tolerant network;hybrid routing	Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) have emerged as communication paradigm for providing endto-end routing based on opportunistic forwarding, without the need for costly infrastructure. Nevertheless, empirical studies have shown that opportunistically integrating encountered infrastructure—e. g. Internet access via WiFi—into hybrid DTNs can significantly boost routing performance. However, designing hybrid DTNs is both complex and poorly understood. In this paper, we present the overlay-based Hybrid Routing System (HRS) which is—to the best of our knowledge—the first decentralized and collaborative routing approach for hybrid DTNs that does not rely on central servers. With HRS, a large class of existing DTN protocols can now benefit from nondeterministic infrastructure encounters. We characterize this class in an extensive analysis of existing DTN protocols, and exemplarily integrate three prominent representatives (Prophet, MaxProp, and Spray&Focus) into HRS. In an extensive simulation study we show that (1) routing towards the infrastructure in a first step is the dominating strategy for these protocols, and (2) HRS effectively bridges geographic distances via the Internet without heavy message replication. In summary, hybrid routing significantly boosts DTN performance as, e. g., only 30% of nodes with Internet access increase delivery probability by 250% for MaxProp in the considered setting.	categorization;cryptographically generated address;delay-tolerant networking;geographical distance;internet access;microsoft outlook for mac;programming paradigm;rapid;routing;simulation	Christoph P.

SUMMARY Wireless ad hoc networking is an important part of the next generation wireless network architecture. Based on the distance over which data is transmitted, wireless networks can be classified into wireless wide area networks (WWANs), wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), and wireless personal area networks (WPANs). Wireless personal area networks (WPANs) were originally designed to allow convenient interconnection of devices around an individual person or computer. Presently, the digital health care and wireless sensor networks are among the major applications. The first attempt to define a standard for WPANs dates back to Ericsson's Bluetooth project to enable communication between mobile phones using low–power and low–cost radio interfaces. Bluetooth is a promising short–range wireless communication technology with the characteristics of interference resilience and power efficiency both of which are desirable for wireless personal area networks or sensor networks. The new Intel Mote sensor devices have Bluetooth technology incorporated as the standard wireless communications interface. When using Bluetooth in applications where multi–hop routing is required, groups of Bluetooth piconets (one master and at most seven active slaves form a piconet) combine together to form a scatternet. However, most of the existing scatternet formation protocols are designed to facilitate communications between any two pairs of devices, regardless of the actual …	bluetooth;hoc (programming language);interconnection;interference (communication);mobile phone;network architecture;next-generation network;performance per watt;routing;sensor node	Xin Zhang	2006			vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless routing protocol;scatternet;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;mobile wireless sensor network;ant;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;computer network	Mobile	5.041288277127671	78.04375145618806	56674

This paper studies the sensor placement problem for ensuring network coverage. Instead of using the simplistic disk coverage model, we adopt our recently proposed confident information coverage model for field attribute monitoring applications. The sensor field is divided into grid cells each with equal area, and sensors can be only placed at the center of each grid cell. Our objective is to place the least number of sensors to provide confident information coverage for all the grid points. We first formulate the sensor placement problem as a constrained optimization problem and use the exhaustive search algorithm to find the optimal solution. To reduce computation complexity, we also propose two greedy algorithms to find the approximate solutions. The simulation results show that the performance of the two proposed algorithms is close to the optimal solution obtained by the exhaustive search algorithm yet with significantly reduced computation complexity.	approximation algorithm;brute-force search;computation;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);expectation–maximization algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;mathematical optimization;np-completeness;optimization problem;performance;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Jiajun Zhu;Bang Wang	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911802	mathematical optimization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;maximum coverage problem;computer science;machine learning;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer network	Mobile	12.662057501372935	79.04295683230845	56683

Also, constraint application protocol (CoAP) and Observe have been proposed for RESTful services to be provided. CoAP/Observe supports the use of caches/proxies and, for this reason, an observation request may resort to multiple client/server registration steps in order to get notifications. Here, we propose to plan the multiple registration steps, at proxies, of multiple observation requests in order to make proper aggregation/scheduling of notifications for transmission. This leads to less energy consumption and to an effective use of bandwidth, avoiding energy depletion of nodes, and increasing the network lifetime. Besides, mathematically formalizing the problem, a heuristic approach is developed and a discussion on how to incorporate algorithm's decision into the network is done. The proposed framework can be applied to multiple application domains (e.g., monitoring, machine to machine).	algorithm;application domain;bandwidth (signal processing);client–server model;constrained application protocol;depletion region;heuristic;internet;machine to machine;network topology;next-generation network;representational state transfer;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Noélia S.

The rack network can be distributed, with small packet switches embedded on each processor as part of a system-on-chip (SoC) design. Ingress/egress traffic is forwarded by SoCs that have direct uplinks to the data center. Such fabrics are not fully provisioned and the chosen topology and uplink placement impacts performance for different workloads. XFabric is a rack-scale network that reconfigures the topology and uplink placement using a circuit-switched physical layer over which SoCs perform packet switching. To satisfy tight power and space requirements in the rack, XFabric does not use a single large circuit switch, instead relying on a set of independent smaller circuit switches. This introduces partial reconfigurability, as some ports in the rack cannot be connected by a circuit. XFabric optimizes the physical topology and manages uplinks, efficiently coping with partial reconfigurability. It significantly outperforms static topologies and has a performance similar to fully reconfigurable fabrics. We demonstrate the benefits of XFabric using flow-based simulations and a prototype built with electrical crosspoint switch ASICs.	application-specific integrated circuit;circuit switching;computer;crossbar switch;data center;egress filtering;embedded system;network packet;network switch;network topology;packet switching;prototype;provisioning;reconfigurability;requirement;server (computing);simulation;system on a chip;telecommunications link	Sergey Legtchenko;Nicholas Chen;Daniel Cletheroe;Antony I.

c7704a74c9b06ae778bdc9b7ccbaa6ef0a3d55d0	opportunistic mac protocol for co-existence of m2m and wi-fi network		Internet-of-Things is expected to increase the number of connected devices to billions. The major share of these devices will not be user operated, rather they will be machines communicating with other machines without any human intervention. In M2M communication, the network access to such high density of M2M devices is real bottleneck because of limited spectrum. The unlicensed spectrum is affordable choice for M2M networks but presence of existing technologies like Wi-Fi makes network access even more difficult problem to address. We present a MAC protocol design for coexistence of M2M and WiFi network in which high density M2M nodes can be served along with WiFi traffic. The MAC protocol uses opportunistic medium access technique which utilizes WiFi white spaces to serve M2M traffic using a hybrid contention-transmission MAC scheme. The hybrid MAC is optimized to utilize the varying lengths of white spaces effectively. We also present the effect of such opportunistic M2M communication on existing Wi-Fi network in terms of throughput and delay performance of Wi-Fi traffic. We show that proposed protocol can serve large number of M2M devices without significant impact on Wi-Fi networks.	access network;coexist (image);communications protocol;m2m (eclipse);mathematical optimization;throughput;white spaces (radio)	Ajinkya Rajandekar;Biplab Sikdar	2018	2018 10th International Conference on Communication Systems & Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2018.8328178	spectrum management;throughput;computer network;white spaces;telecommunications link;access network;computer science;bottleneck	Mobile	21.548649988799916	88.14573857383941	56948

We highlight a situation in which control packets can be received properly but not data packets, as well as its effects on scatternet performance. Based on our analysis, we propose a cross-layer optimized routing protocol for Bluetooth (CORB), which outperforms AODV based routing protocols. CORB is a QoS-extended AODV routing protocol that is optimized for Bluetooth MAC. It has two unique characteristics. First, it uses a new load metric (LM) in QoS routing protocol instead of the number of hops as in conventional best effort routing. LM reflects nodes' link bandwidth with respect to Bluetooth nodes' role in the scatternet. This helps the CORB to bypass heavily the loaded nodes, and find routes with larger bandwidth. Second, LM and some MAC layer parameters are dynamically adjusted in response to the changes in radio conditions. These two characteristics of CORB contribute to its improved stability, and rapid response to changing radio conditions	best-effort delivery;bluetooth;elegant degradation;experiment;geographic coordinate system;interference (communication);network packet;race condition;routing;shattered world;simulation;testbed	Leping Huang;Hongyuan Chen;T.

5e5fcd9c554f038ea4553f7cfa1082e0c38dcc11	sd-puf: spliced digital physical unclonable function		Digital circuit physical unclonable function (PUF) has been attracting attentions for the merits of resilience to the environmental and operational variations that analog PUFs suffer from. Existing state-of-the-art digital circuit PUFs, however, are either hybrid of analog-digital circuits which are still under the shadow of vulnerability, or impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel highly nonlinear and secure digital PUF (D-PUF) and the spliced version SD-PUF. The fingerprints are extracted from intentionally induced very large-scale integration interconnect randomness during lithography process, as well as a post-silicon shuffling process. Strongly skewed CMOS latches are used to ensure the immunity against environmental and operational variations. Crucially, a highly nonlinear logic network is proposed to effectively spread and augment any subtle interconnect randomness, which also enables strong resilience against machine learning attacks. On top of it, the expandable architecture of the proposed logic network empowers a novel post-silicon shuffle-splice mechanism, where multiple randomly selected D-PUFs are spliced to be one SD-PUF, pushing the statistical security to a much higher level, while significantly reducing the mask cost per PUF device. It also decouples the trustworthy demands enforced to the foundries or other third party manufacturers. Our proposed PUFs demonstrate close to ideal performance in terms of statistical metrics, including 0 intra-Hamming distance. Various state-of-the-art machine learning models show prediction accuracies almost no better than random guesses when attacking to the proposed PUFs. We also mathematically prove the probability of existence of identical SD-PUF pair is significantly lower than that of D-PUF pair, e.g., such probability of an SD-PUF spliced by 30 D-PUFs is  ${2.3\times 10^{-22}}$ , which is 19 order magnitude lower than that of D-PUF. Benefited from the proposed shuffle-splice mechanism, the mask cost per SD-PUF is also reduced by  ${300\times }$  than that of D-PUF.	cmos;digital electronics;fingerprint;hamming distance;integrated circuit;linear logic;machine learning;nonlinear system;physical unclonable function;randomness;secure digital;splice (system call);very-large-scale integration	Jin Miao;Meng Li;Subhendu Roy;Yuzhe Ma;Bei Yu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2017.2740296	randomness;computer science;real-time computing;magnitude (mathematics);electronic circuit;architecture;digital electronics;physical unclonable function;cmos;shadow	EDA	13.893951716818883	63.70800664444426	57107
ec411466ae0d876769bd0f717f53d9cdd4f303c2	search in random media with lévy flights		Our work on the subject of search has been motivated by a variety of applications in engineering and technology, and it differs from the physicists’ motivation for such problems, e.g., or the motivation provided by biochemistry, and in theoretical biology . One of our reasons for a more fundamental approach to search comes from the area of traffic routing in wired networks where each end user may send out many search or Smart Packets to seek out paths for the traffic it needs to forward, so that the paths that are used will satisfy useful quality of service (QoS) properties such as minimising delay or packet loss. A similar question arises, with even more acuity, when the networks are ad-hoc and wireless, and the need to reduce uncertainty regarding possible paths is even greater. A distinct but related motivation for our work has been the search for network paths that avoid ongoing Cyberattacks. Another important motivation for our work comes from the field of explosive mine detection and removal on which one of us worked in the past, and in such circumstances it is sensible to see how the natural world deals with such challenges. The related fields of tactical operations, and emergency operations and management also raise many interesting problems related to the search for targets, objects such as landmines, and victims, as part of an organised response to an incident or an emergency.

The existing aggregation schemes usually compute every aggregation result in a continuous aggregation either by a complete aggregation procedure or by partial data update at each epoch. To further reduce the energy cost, we propose a sampling-based approach with time window based linear regression for approximate continuous aggregation. We analyze the approximation error of the aggregation results and discuss the determinations of parameters in our approach.

The protocol is based on time division multiple access (TDMA) principle and reduces energy consumption by avoiding overhearing, collision and idle listening. Nodes in TDMA-WSN build schedules based on information about their neighborhood to determine when they can transmit to their neighbors and when they should listen to the channel or sleep. TDMA-WSN proposes a novel resolution with three-d-hop neighborhood information to avoid collision caused by the two-hop collision-free principle used in some protocols. TDMA-WSN can accelerate passing message by arranging schedule based on routing information from the upper-layer. The simulation results indicate that TDMA-WSN outperforms contention-based protocols (e.g., S-MAC) and scheduling-based protocols (e.g., NAMA) with significant energy savings.	access control;message passing;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;tridiagonal matrix algorithm	Rong gang Bai;Yugui Qu;Yang Guo;Baohua Zhao	2007	The 2nd IEEE Asia-Pacific Service Computing Conference (APSCC 2007)	10.1109/APSCC.2007.25	ant colony optimization algorithms;real-time computing;computer science;job scheduler;operating system;distributed computing;grid computing;computer network	Mobile	8.693583066373375	81.70826852008649	57301

The main objective of these studies is to find a balance point between the accuracy of the scheme and its deployment/training cost. RSS-based schemes and in particular Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning (G-SSL) constitute a group of techniques which has low setup cost and good localization accuracy. In this paper, we analyze the G-SLL scheme and show that, despite its high performance, the G-SSL method (in its original format) is not a very accurate model for a localization problem. Based on this observation and to improve the accuracy of localization, we propose an alternative approach which incorporates our knowledge of wireless signal propagation into the label propagation mechanism. Experimental results are then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme compared to the original G-SSL.	algorithm;concatenation;location-based service;loss function;rss;ssl-explorer;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;software deployment;software propagation;supervised learning;vii	Vahid Pourahmadi;Shahrokh Valaee	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503132	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning	Vision	18.8672823138323	73.75988279573737	57320

The density of all the radio-connected IoT objects will place increasing pressure on the available limited spectrum resources. These radio-connected IoT objects will, in addition, often use different radio access technologies (RATs), making service advertising and discovery as well as coordination of radio resources extremely challenging, due to the potentially vast numbers of connected devices. These problems can be addressed both by using centralised co-ordination of radio resources and by distributed intelligent devices that actively manage their own radio resource usage. This paper addresses solutions for centralised co-ordination of the wireless connected IoT devices through a new approach which relies on a shared service-level platform to provide flexible radio spectrum usage. New algorithms for interference mitigation and device co-existence are described which use device management made possible by such a platform, and avoid potential conflicts across heterogeneous systems. Under the assumption that geographically co-located devices are all using a common service platform, the centralised algorithms proposed here have the potential for more efficient solutions than existing inter-RAT interference mitigation solutions. An implementation of our algorithms using the emerging ETSI M2M standard is outlined.	algorithm;centralisation;interference (communication);internet of things;the quality of life	Milos Tesanovic;Paul Bucknell;Hind Chebbo;Jumoke Ogunbekun	2012	2012 IEEE Globecom Workshops	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477843	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	21.730675641920996	86.90250265997925	57570

For the applications such as the environmental monitoring and event detection services, there will be a large amount of data generated in UW-ASNs. To reliably store and efficiently retrieve the generated data, data-centric storage which stores the same type of data in a specific region and facilitates data retrieval is regarded as an attractive solution. In this paper, we focus on the cross-layer design for the data transmissions of data-centric storage in UW-ASNs. In order to minimize the network transmission delay in a specific data-centric storage procedure, we introduce the spatial reuse concept into the cross-layer design, where multiple communication links are permitted to perform data transmission simultaneously with efficient interference management. Then, we propose a spatial reuse TDMA based cross-layer (SRC-TDMA) protocol by jointly taking data routing and resource scheduling into consideration. Simulation results verify that our proposed SRC-TDMA protocol can significantly reduce the network transmission delay compared with the traditional TDMA protocol and the interference graph based TDMA (IG-TDMA) protocol.	acoustic cryptanalysis;data retrieval;interference (communication);mega man network transmission;routing;sample rate conversion;scheduling (computing);simulation	Rongqing Zhang;Xilin Cheng;Xiang Cheng;Liuqing Yang	2015		10.1145/2831296.2831345	embedded system;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	8.358323505829318	84.73695785055158	57607

By making such a normalized comparison, we observe that end-to-end schemes are more effective than hop-by-hop schemes at reducing connection BER. We are also able to quantify the sensitivity of this relative advantage to various environmental parameters, including power budget size, geographic distance, the number of hops, and power distribution scheme.	end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;experiment;geographical distance;hop-by-hop transport;random access;simulation;x.690	Ghassen Ben Brahim;Bilal Khan;Ala I.

98fafa95a5db3a2b591c904d98b2e96468b6ccce	deterministic broadcasting in ad hoc radio networks	radio networks;deterministic;radio network;broadcasting;distributed	We consider the problem of distributed deterministic broadcasting in radio networks of unknown topology and size. The network is synchronous. If a node u can be reached from two nodes which send messages in the same round, none of the messages is received by u. Such messages block each other and node u either hears the noise of interference of messages, enabling it to detect a collision, or does not hear anything at all, depending on the model. We assume that nodes know neither the topology nor the size of the network, nor even their immediate neighborhood. The initial knowledge of every node is limited to its own label. Such networks are called ad hoc multi-hop networks. We study the time of deterministic broadcasting under this scenario. For the model without collision detection, we develop a linear-time broadcasting algorithm for symmetric graphs, which is optimal, and an algorithm for arbitrary n-node graphs, working in time $O(n^{11/6})$ . Next we show that broadcasting with acknowledgement is not possible in this model at all. For the model with collision detection, we develop efficient algorithms for broadcasting and for acknowledged broadcasting in strongly connected graphs.	algorithm;collision detection;hoc (programming language);image noise;interference (communication);strongly connected component;time complexity	Bogdan S.

SCA has emerged as a serious threat to many mathematically unbreakable cryptography systems. From an attacker's point of view, the difficulty of mounting SCA largely depends on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the side-channel information. It has been shown that SNR primarily depends on algorithmic and circuit-level implementation, measurement noise, as well as device thermal noise. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study on the effect of power delivery network (PDN) on SCA resistance. We note that the PDN plays a significant role in SNR of measured supply current. Furthermore, SCA resistance strongly depends on the operating frequency due to RLC structure of a power grid. In this paper, we analyze the effect of power grid on SCA and provide quantitative results to demonstrate the frequency-dependent SCA resistance due to PDN-induced noise. This property can potentially be exploited by an attacker to facilitate the attack by operating a device at favorable frequency points. On the other hand, from a designer's perspective, one can explore countermeasures to secure the device at all operating frequencies while minimizing the design overhead. Based on this observation, we propose a frequency-dependent noise-injection based compensation technique to efficiently protect against SCA. Simulation results using realistic PDN model as well as experimental measurements using FPGA test board validate the observations on role of PDN in SCA and the efficacy of the proposed compensation approach.	clock rate;countermeasure (computer);cryptography;field-programmable gate array;johnson–nyquist noise;overhead (computing);rlc circuit;side-channel attack;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Xinmu Wang;Wen Yueh;Debapriya Basu Roy;Seetharam Narasimhan;Yu Zheng;Saibal Mukhopadhyay;Debdeep Mukhopadhyay;Swarup Bhunia	2013	2013 50th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)	10.1145/2463209.2488830	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;cryptography;electrical engineering;operating system;computer security;computer network	EDA	13.218793604939924	63.70241001381411	57869

The expected advent of self-driving vehicles raises the question of how automated and connected vehicles can be used to improve throughput at intersections while keeping them safe. A spatio-temporal intersection protocol named the Ballroom Intersection Protocol (BRIP) [5] was recently proposed in the literature to address this situation. Under this protocol, automated vehicles arrive at and go through an intersection in a cooperative fashion with no vehicle needing to stop, while maximizing the intersection throughput. Though no vehicles run into one another under ideal environments with BRIP, vehicle accidents can occur when the self-driving vehicles have location errors. In this paper, we present a safe and practical intersection protocol named the Configurable Synchronous Intersection Protocol (CSIP) that is a more general and resilient version of BRIP. CSIP utilizes a certain inter-vehicle distance to meet safety requirements against GPS inaccuracy and control failure. In addition, the inter-vehicle distances under CSIP are much more acceptable to human passengers due to longer inter-vehicle distances that do not cause fear. With CSIP, the inter-vehicle distances can also be changed at each intersection to account for different traffic volumes and GPS inaccuracies. Our simulation results show that CSIP never leads to traffic accidents even when the system has typical location errors, and that CSIP increases the traffic throughput of the intersections compared to common signalized intersections.	autonomous robot;crash (computing);global positioning system;interaction;network congestion;requirement;simulation;throughput	Shunsuke Aoki;Ragunathan Rajkumar	2017	2017 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA)	10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046306	distributed computing;real-time computing;throughput;computer science;global positioning system;wireless;traffic congestion	Embedded	4.127200267775921	87.85893332203177	57897

However, placing small cells at the desired locations to offload as much traffic as possible from overlaying macro cells is a crucial task. In this regard, geo-location and user equipment positioning techniques help obtain spatial distributions of user locations and their respective traffic volumes. In this paper, we provide a tool capable of reducing errors that stem from spatial discretization of traffic data and that can autonomously detect hot spots given a certain threshold. Based on geo-located traffic in a 3G network in a dense urban city, we find that traffic in the area is approximately log-normally distributed and that the size of traffic hot spots are approximately Weibull distributed. Based on our statistical findings, we observe that utilizing 4 small cells per km2 covering 3.2% of the total area and around 34% of the total traffic volume is a very meaningful deployment strategy; however, deploying more small cells in larger hot zones becomes increasingly costly in terms of the ratio of area covered and traffic demand serviced.	discretization;geolocation;layer (electronics);location-based service;semantic network;software deployment;spatial analysis	Henrik Klessig;Vinay Suryaprakash;Oliver Blume;Albrecht J.

9ac4f125fdad0918c07502d316975601d8c66ff3	ctr: cluster based topological routing for disaster response networks		Large scale disasters require prompt rescue and relief operations to restrict further casualties. To carry out such operations, it is essential to have a communication infrastructure between survivors and responders, which is often impaired due to the disaster. Off-the-shelf wireless devices such as smartphones, PDAs and Laptops offer an effective solution towards the establishment of makeshift communication infrastructure. However, in the absence of bonafide power sources, it becomes imperative to judiciously utilize energy (battery power) of such devices such that the network is functional until primary infrastructure is restored. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Cluster based Topological Routing (CTR) that prolongs the longevity of the network by exploiting the natural gathering of survivors in shelter points. In particular, the clustering algorithm identifies such survivor groups combined with a data forwarding approach, to minimize the number of data transmissions yet guaranteeing the required packet delivery and network latency. Our extensive simulation study shows that CTR yields twice the network lifetime than existing routing approaches in disaster response networks, while ensuring comparable packet delivery and network latency.	algorithm;cluster analysis;emergence;fitness function;imperative programming;laptop;network packet;operand forwarding;personal digital assistant;routing;simulation;smartphone	Vijay Kumar Shah;Satyaki Roy;Simone Silvestri;Sajal K.

To reduce broadcast storm, we uses DPDP(Directional Partial Dominant Pruning) method, too. To control ACK implosion problem rising on reliable transmission based on ACK, in case of the number of nodes that required message reception is more than throughput, each nodes retransmit messages constant times without ACK which considering message transmission success probability through related antenna elements(Rmethod). Otherwise, the number of message reception nodes is less than throughput, each node verify message reception with ACK with these antenna elements(Amethod). In this paper, we suggest mixed R-/Amethod. This method not only can control the number of message transmitting nodes, can manage the number of ACK for each antenna elements. By simulations, we proved that our method provides higher transmission rate than legacy system, reduces broadcast messages and ACKs.	acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;bi-directional text;broadcast radiation;experiment;hoc (programming language);legacy system;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Ingu Han;Kee-Wook Rim;Jung-Hyun Lee	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10265-3_10	broadcasting;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;legacy system;computer network	Mobile	5.011967013738424	86.352438220409	57972

Unlike terrestrial networks, satellite networks face a unique set of challenges, such as signal fading and interference from multiple transmitters combined with long propagation delays. A well known challenge is that these unique characteristics can have an adverse impact on various protocols, making it necessary to study protocol behavior in satellite networks. The challenge of our research, and the focus of this paper, is to develop an architecture for a high-fidelity and scalable emulation testbed tailored for mobile satellite communications research. The testbed is designed to provide multi-beam, multi-satellite, TDMA, and mobility functionality. Our validation studies demonstrate that the testbed is capable of achieving delay, loss, and jitter that can be associated with a mobile satellite link.	backup;communications satellite;emulator;interference (communication);msat;scalability;software propagation;terrestrial television;testbed;transmitter	Roman Chertov;Daniel M.
