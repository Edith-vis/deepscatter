In our model, the dynamics of the entropy monitor are separated from the PD response of the patient by explicitly accounting for the model of the entropy monitor in the PD identification process. The monitor model was then excluded from the identified PD model for the patient. The PD model, thus, obtained is distinct from its traditional counterpart in that it reflects the PD response of a patient with the dynamic effects of the monitor included as a specific entity. System identification trials using SE data of 31 pediatric subjects show that the PD models derived from the proposed approach are an improvement on the traditional approach. For the Paedfusor pharmacokinetic (PK) model, population-averaged effect site equilibration rate constant ke0 was 5.4 and 3.0 for the proposed and traditional PD models ( p <; 0.001), respectively. For the Kataria PK model, population-averaged ke0 was 2.3 and 1.4 (p <; 0.01). This significant difference suggests that the effects of the monitor must be considered when searching for the intrinsic PD of a patient that is free from the bias induced by the monitor characteristics.	communication endpoint;exclusion;patients;pharmacodynamics;pharmacokinetic study;propofol;public-key cryptography;state entropy;system identification;little p little k ab:prthr:pt:ser/plas:ord	Sara Khosravi;Jin-Oh Hahn;Guy Albert Dumont;John Mark Ansermino	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2011.2179033	pharmacology;entropy;medicine;computer science;machine learning;predictive modelling;anesthesia;physics;surgery	SE	17.809100413852985	-83.7930038103042	16346
ce22753c4f07062c8ee3aa17594063b882514466	measuring impedance in congestive heart failure	dissertacao;engenharia electrotecnica electronica e informatica	The hospitalization of patients with Heart Failure represents an increasing burden for the healthcare system with more than 23 million worldwide suffering from this disease. In this paper we explore methods to detect fluid retention in the lungs by measuring the thoracic impedance, so that is possible to monitor Heart Failure patients, and physicians can early detect acute episodes. A small and portable device was developed to measure the thoracic impedance of the patient. From the measured thoracic impedance it can estimate the accumulation of fluid in the lungs. This device is a low cost, friendly to use equipment that can be operated by a big range of users: Moreover, it was designed for low power consumption with a rechargeable battery for portable use. The device empowers the patient to monitor his own body fluid at home, and a physician can follow him remotely. This procedure would help to drastically reduce the number of hospitalizations and, consequently, improve the quality of life of people diagnosed with Heart Failure.

The lifelog in this study includes several types of media data/information acquired from wearable multi sensors which capture video images, individual's body motions, biological information, location information, and so on. We propose an integrated technique to process the lifelog which is composed of both captured video (called lifelog images) and other sensed data. Our proposed technique is based on two models; i.e., the space-oriented model and the action-oriented model. By using the two modeling techniques, we can analyze the lifelog images to find representative images in video scenes using both the pictorial visual features and the individual's context information, and likewise represent the individual's life experiences in some semantic and structured ways for future efficient retrievals and exploitations. The resulting structured lifelog images were evaluated using the vision- based only approach and the proposed technique. Our proposed integrated technique exhibited better results.	image analysis;lifelog;sensor;wearable computer	Katsuhiro Takata;Jianhua Ma;Bernady O.

2d4d7379ea021fe9bcb57746b8542b2a0100e6ca	gait anomaly detection in dairy cattle		Cow lameness is a common welfare issue in the dairy industry that causes severe health and life quality issues to cows, including pain and a reduction in their life expectancy. The earlier a lame cow is detected, the earlier and more effectively it can be treated. A change in the gait of the cow is the earliest symptom of lameness. Currently, lame cows are detected by visual inspection performed by herdsmen, which is subjective and time consuming. We present an approach to automatically detect anomalies in the walking pattern of a cow as a possible indicator of lameness. The detection is done by a wearable motion sensor attached to a cow's hind left leg. Our approach builds an individual model of the usual walking pattern of a cow during the first minutes of use and detects deviations from this model afterwards. Results from a controlled experiment we conducted indicate that our approach can detect deviations in cows' gait with an accuracy of 91.1%. This information can be used by veterinarians to keep track of changes in the walking pattern of cows and to decide whether to treat a specific cow.	anomaly detection;motion detector;visual inspection;wearable computer	Juan Haladjian;Zardosht Hodaie;Stefan Nüske;Bernd Brügge	2017		10.1145/3152130.3152135	anomaly detection;physical medicine and rehabilitation;gait analysis;visual inspection;gait;dairy cattle;lameness;medicine	AI	10.213048272810099	-84.61047235301963	16513
1af46d95af6b137212a21bc054e8226fb8559b34	detecting mobility for monitoring patients with parkinson's disease at home using rssi in a wireless sensor network	unicast	e-Healthcare is a popular healthcare application of Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN). Today home monitoring of patients with movement disorders, monitoring of elderly for early fall detection are very popular applications. Our research focuses on one such important application of continuous, non-invasive, and wireless monitoring of the patients with Parkinson's disease, for preventing potential falls and injuries and recording the number of occurrences of Freezing of Gait (FoG) over single or multiple days. We propose a home based monitoring system which involves embedding of wireless sensors in the patient's vicinity, such as in his room. Analyzing the values of RSSI, which is the measure of received signal strength, from these sensor nodes we implement a robust patient's activity monitoring system for early fall determination. Multiple occurrences of FoG can also be monitored with our system, which is not possible to record at the doctor's clinic due to its relation with the degree of consciousness when a person is at the hospital. We also plan to derive different mobility patterns for a person during his/her day's activity and train the system accordingly. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

8d5b0c4489b8733b33b5d7c6af3c69e145f5af0c	joint learning of ultrasonic backscattering statistical physics and signal confidence primal for characterizing atherosclerotic plaques using intravascular ultrasound	tissue characterization;ultrasound signal confidence;machine learning;intravascular ultrasound;nakagami distribution	Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is a predominant imaging modality in interventional cardiology. It provides real-time cross-sectional images of arteries and assists clinicians to infer about atherosclerotic plaques composition. These plaques are heterogeneous in nature and constitute fibrous tissue, lipid deposits and calcifications. Each of these tissues backscatter ultrasonic pulses and are associated with a characteristic intensity in B-mode IVUS image. However, clinicians are challenged when colocated heterogeneous tissue backscatter mixed signals appearing as non-unique intensity patterns in B-mode IVUS image. Tissue characterization algorithms have been developed to assist clinicians to identify such heterogeneous tissues and assess plaque vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a novel technique coined as Stochastic Driven Histology (SDH) that is able to provide information about co-located heterogeneous tissues. It employs learning of tissue specific ultrasonic backscattering statistical physics and signal confidence primal from labeled data for predicting heterogeneous tissue composition in plaques. We employ a random forest for the purpose of learning such a primal using sparsely labeled and noisy samples. In clinical deployment, the posterior prediction of different lesions constituting the plaque is estimated. Folded cross-validation experiments have been performed with 53 plaques indicating high concurrence with traditional tissue histology. On the wider horizon, this framework enables learning of tissue-energy interaction statistical physics and can be leveraged for promising clinical applications requiring tissue characterization beyond the application demonstrated in this paper.	atherosclerosis;backscatter (email);body tissue;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;cardiology discipline;colocation centre;cross-sectional data;cross-validation (statistics);dental plaque;deploy;entity class - imaging modality;experiment;genetic heterogeneity;inference;intravascular ultrasound;modality (human–computer interaction);physiologic calcification;random forest;real-time transcription;senile plaques;synchronous optical networking;tracer;ultrasonics (sound);algorithm;triangulation	Debdoot Sheet;Athanasios Karamalis;Abouzar Eslami;Peter B.

In this study, we used a synergy-based control model to determine the effect of sensory feedback on kinematic synergies in the grasping hand. Ten subjects performed two types of grasps: one that included feedback (real) and one without feedback (memory-guided), at two different speeds (rapid and natural). Kinematic synergies were extracted from rapid real and rapid memory-guided grasps using principal component analysis. Synergies extracted from memory-guided grasps revealed greater preservation of natural inter-finger relationships than those found in corresponding synergies extracted from real grasps. Reconstruction of natural real and natural memory-guided grasps was used to test performance and generalizability of synergies. A temporal analysis of reconstruction patterns revealed the differing contribution of individual synergies in real grasps versus memory-guided grasps. Finally, the results showed that memory-guided synergies could not reconstruct real grasps as accurately as real synergies could reconstruct memory-guided grasps. These results demonstrate how visual and tactile feedback affects a closed-loop synergy-based motor control system.	biologic preservation;control system;extraction;feedforward neural network;principal component analysis;sensory feedback;synergy;grasp	Vrajeshri Patel;Martin K.

e99194d11af406a1d28fdcedadee38c6b8420b29	sfst: a robust framework for heart rate monitoring from photoplethysmography signals during physical activities	heart rate monitoring;ppg;spectral analysis;stft	As a non-invasive approach to monitor heart rate (HR), the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal provides a simple and accurate measurement in silence. However, difficulties are found when dealing with signals monitored during physical activities, because complex noise shares a very close frequency bin with HR. Traditional analogue filters can hardly derive HR in this situation. This paper is aimed to establish a joint framework for HR monitoring from PPG signals during physical activities. A combination of Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and spectral analysis was adopted as the principal part, with a medium filter as assisted. The time-frequency resolution in low frequency is enhanced by the size-fixed window function in STFT. Based on 12 datasets sampled at 25 Hz and recorded during different physical activities, the HR data derived via the proposed algorithm was analysed. The average absolute estimation error was 1.06 beats/min and the standard deviation was 0.69 beats/min. Compared with the true HR via ECG, the cross-correlation average was 0.9917 beats/min and the standard deviation was 0.0141 beats/min. Therefore, the proposed framework is proved reliable for HR monitoring from PPG during physical activities of high intensity. It can be applied to smart wearable devices for fitness tracking and health information tracking.		Dadi Zhao;Yu Sun;Suiren Wan;Feng Wang	2017	Biomed.

In this study, we devised a modified iterative kurtosis-based detector algorithm, in order to enhance the de-noising performance of BS signals, and an estimation algorithm of bowel motility based on the regression modeling of the jitter and shimmer of BS signals obtained by auscultation. The correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination and errors between the colon transit times measured by a conventional radiograph and the corresponding values estimated by our method were 0.987, 0.974 and 3.5 ± 3.3h, respectively. These results demonstrated that our method could be used as a complementary tool for the non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of bowel motility, instead of conventional radiography.	auscultation;coefficient of determination;colon classification;detectors;esophageal motility disorders;intestines;iterative method;radiography;respiratory sounds;algorithm	Keo-Sik Kim;Jeong-Hwan Seo;Sang-Hun Ryu;Min-Ho Kim;Chul-Gyu Song	2011	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2011.02.014	speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;regression analysis;statistics	ML	18.783413798683707	-87.87169633412634	17000

The algorithm consists of two methods: a separation algorithm based on second-order statistics that extracts the desired signal in one shot through the data, and a heart instantaneous frequency (HIF) estimator. The HIF algorithm is used to extract the mother heart rate which serves as reference to extract the fetal heart rate. We carried out simulations where the signals overlap in frequency and time, and showed that it worked e3ciently. c � 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Discarding blink-contaminated segments of EEG data would result in considerable information loss when interpreting and analyzing data. This study presents a simple method of blink filtering using a Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing filter and compares it to Independent Component Analysis (ICA), a widely accepted method of blink removal. The SG-based blink filtering method arose from the need for blink removal in EEG systems with a low number of channels and limited processing power, specifically reading from the forehead location where the blink disturbance is severe. Real and simulated data were investigated with respect to the method's performance. Using correlation and mutual information to measure performance, the results reveal that the SG-based method can effectively remove blink artifacts and produces results comparable to those obtained using ICA.	artifact (software development);binary golay code;blink;blinking;distortion;electroencephalography;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;morphologic artifacts;mutual information;smoothing (statistical technique);suicidegirls	Dyana Szibbo;An Luo;Thomas J.

This work is a first proof of concept of this kind of BMI as tool for rehabilitation after stroke. We designed an exercise to improve the control of selective movements of the pelvis in stroke survivors, increasing the ability to decouple the motion in the sagittal and frontal planes and decreasing compensatory adjustments at the shoulder girdle. A Kinect sensor recorded the movements of the subjects. Subjects played different games by controlling the vertical and horizontal motion of a cursor on a screen with respectively the lateral tilt and the ante/retroversion of their pelvis. We monitored also the degrees of freedom not directly involved in cursor control, thus subjects could complete the task only with a correct posture. Our preliminary results highlight significant improvement not only in cursor control, but also in the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) and in the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (5xSST).	body dysmorphic disorders;body position;brain–computer interface;cerebrovascular accident;coupling (computer programming);cursor (databases);kinect;lateral thinking;movement;pectoral girdle structure;poor posture;rehabilitation therapy;sagittal plane;survivors;hearing impairment	Susanna Summa;Camilla Pierella;Psiche Giannoni;A.

These features can be engineered or learned from data. Although the former approach was dominant in the past, feature learning has started to receive more attention from the MIR community in recent years. Recent results in feature learning indicate that simple algorithms such as K-means can be very effective, sometimes surpassing more complicated approaches based on restricted Boltzmann machines, autoencoders or sparse coding. Furthermore, there has been increased interest in multiscale representations of music audio recently. Such representations are more versatile because music audio exhibits structure on multiple timescales, which are relevant for different MIR tasks to varying degrees. We develop and compare three approaches to multiscale audio feature learning using the spherical K-means algorithm. We evaluate them in an automatic tagging task and a similarity metric learning task on the Magnatagatune dataset.	algorithm;feature learning;information retrieval;k-means clustering;mir (computer);neural coding;restricted boltzmann machine;sparse matrix;statistical classification	Sander Dieleman;Benjamin Schrauwen	2013			feature learning;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;k-means clustering	ML	-4.185988256669508	-87.19096169442099	17307

We now propose in this paper, an intelligent agent based technique for monitoring the health of patients and notifying the same to the concerned hospital personnel.

The mathematical basis of this method is the theory of support vector machine, a new paradigm of learning machine. The method consists of the following steps: signal preprocessing by digital filters, segmentation of the Holter recording into a series of heartbeats by wavelet technique, support vector approximation of each heartbeat with the use of Gaussian kernels, support vector classification of heartbeats. The learning sets for classification are prepared by physician. Hence, we offer a learning machine as a computer-aided tool for medical diagnosis. This tool is flexible and may be tailored to the interest of physicians by setting up the learning samples. The results shown in the paper prove that our method can classify pathologies observed not only in the QRS alterations but also in P (or F), S and T waves of electrocardiograms.

However, electric stimulation has some disadvantages. Electric stimulation of the median nerve triggers action potentials in all fiber populations of the nerve. Electric stimulation further creates artifacts and courses discomfort which is usually not well tolerated in the awake child. Therefore, the development of a more specific stimulation has constantly been a goal in recent years. There have been several approaches in the past to deliver somatic stimulation. However, all of them failed short in some aspects. In this study, a new type of somatosensory stimulator device was developed and compared against the gold standard of electric stimulation. The stimulation is achieved by repetitive tactile stimulation of the index finger using a blunt needle. In contrast to all previous approaches, we use a hydraulic system to move the needle up and downward. Given that water is very well suited to conduct pressure pulses it is possible to place the tactile stimulator device holding the needle close to the subject and the hydraulic driving system outside a critical area. Using a phantom, we showed that our stimulator is capable of delivering a stimulus precise on the submillisecond time scale. In addition, we test our stimulator on a healthy adult and compare the results against the electric stimulation. We can show the feasibility of measuring the electric responses of the peripheral nerve and while using MEG also the response of the primary somatosensory cortex. The tactile stimulation showed a more spatial focuses activation of the primary somatosensory cortex when compared against the electric stimulation. The proposed high-precision tactile stimulator will make it possible to analyze the somatosensory system noninvasively in children in the future.	action potentials;action potential;blunt (object);cns disorder;diploid cell;electric stimulation technique;electroconvulsive therapy;functional electrical stimulation;imaging phantom;index finger;magnetoencephalography;malaise;morphologic artifacts;new type;peripheral nerves;phantoms, imaging;population;precipitating factors;repetitive strain;somatosensory cortex;structure of median nerve;tissue fiber	Philip Julian Broser;Christoph Braun	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2212191	neuroscience;engineering;biological engineering;physics;surgery;magnetoencephalography	HCI	16.963541531996782	-82.93279347857863	17500
a3178f27392857d062f516dde7ef2483647995cb	pattern-based behavioural analysis on neurosurgical simulation data		This paper presents the results of an analytics-based study to determine key differences in junior resident level and expert level surgical skill when engaging with a neurosurgical simulator. Window-based time series discretization and sequential pattern analysis were used on positional data to identify frequent movement patterns and instrumentation techniques associated with each skill class. Cross-validation confirmed that a Bayesian classification model constructed using these patterns can be used to predict skill level with a high degree of confidence and accuracy on a small sample of neurosurgeons who engaged with the simulator. An analysis of movement speed also revealed that the junior residents exhibited a high degree of very slow and very fast movements, whereas the expert surgeons displayed a significantly more consistent technique of moderate-speed movements. Finally, the analysis was integrated within a cloud-based learning framework, helping to provide beneficial feedback on movement proficiency to resident surgeons in training. The presented work makes two key contributions to the field of machine learning in the medical field: the study 1) employs a low-level behaviour-based analysis of surgical technique, as opposed to highlevel summary metrics such as blood loss and average force, and 2) avoids the use of expert information on neurosurgical skill within the AI engine, and thus employs an analysis that is entirely uninformed.		scott. buffett	2018				ML	11.9657956810499	-90.54506295114211	17670

Thus, to study clues of encoding schemes of the peripheral auditory system, one has to separate refractory effects from the timing patterns. This can be achieved by defining a function called the recovery funetion that describes the refractory effects. The paper demonstrates that this recovery function is readily obtainable from two histograms, the interval histogram and the poststimulus time histogram. Once the recovery function is known, mfractory effects on the timing patterns can be easily removed.	acoustic cryptanalysis;auditory processing disorder;expert system;peripheral	Marion G.

Under conditions of challenging signal-to-noise ratio, high-dimensional data and small training sets, however, these methods may overfit to meaningless solutions. Examples are spatial filtering methods like Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) [1] and Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) [2]. It is difficult for the practitioner to tell apart meaningful from arbitrary, random components. We propose three approaches to probe the robustness of extracted oscillatory components and show their application to both, simulated and EEG data recorded during a visually cued hand motor reaction time task.	bootstrapping (compilers);electroencephalography phase synchronization;extraction;overfitting;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial anti-aliasing;supervised learning;tracer;spindle orientation checkpoint	Sebastián Castaño-Candamil;Andreas Meinel;Sven Dähne;Michael Tangermann	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319553	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;communication	Vision	14.940594100070422	-93.51329001825569	17819

Previous works have shown that hypoglycaemia causes changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. In this investigation, portable apparatus was developed to record the EEG, and a methodology was implemented, using digital signal processing and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to detect hypoglycaemia. Sixteen EEG recordings were made on eight subjects with diabetes (five male, three female), aged 35±13.5 years (mean ± SD), during the day, over periods of 5.7±2 min. Ten of these recordings (in seven subjects) included periods of normoglycaemia and spontaneous hypoglycaemia. The result of the off-line ANN classification for each of these ten recordings was an overall accuracy rate of 71.3%, sensitivity of 71.1% and specificity of 71.5%. In the classification using four recordings from a single subject, the accuracy was 80.6%, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 83.9%. In the classification using recordings from five different subjects to train the ANN, the obtained accuracy rate was 49.2%, with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 32.5%. The result of the classification in real time, for one subject, was an accuracy rate of 85.2%, with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 100%. In conclusion, the methodology proposed and implemented justifies further studies with the objective of constructing a hypoglycaemia detector system based on the processing and classification of the EEG.	artificial neural network;blood glucose;detectors;diabetes mellitus;digital signal processing;electroencephalography phase synchronization;hypoglycemia;maxima and minima;online and offline;physiological sexual disorders;sensitivity and specificity;spontaneous order;millimole	F.

These coefficients are comprised in a small cubic neighborhood located at the first octant of a 3D Fourier space (including the DC component). Since the affine transformation model comprises twelve parameters, the Fourier coefficients are fed into twelve NN during the learning stage, so that each NN yields the estimates of one of the registration parameters. Different sizes of subsets of Fourier coefficients were tested. The construction of the training set and the learning stage are fast requiring, respectively, 90 s and 2 to 24 s, depending on the number of input and hidden units of the NN. The mean absolute registration errors are of approximately 0.03 mm in translations and 0.05 deg in rotations (except for pitch), for the typical motion amplitudes encountered in FMRI studies. Results with an actual time series suggest that the proposed method is suited to the problem of prospective (in frame) FMRI registration, although brain activation must be simulated, and learned, by the NN.	artificial neural network;time series	Luis Freire;Ana Isabel Rodrigues Gouveia;Fernando M.

5ceb5a11277a65e41b111720c8fa42af7a77ada9	the helmet head restraint system: a viable solution for resting state fmri in awake monkeys		In monkey neuroimaging, head restraint is currently achieved via surgical implants. Eradicating such invasive head restraint from otherwise non-invasive monkey studies could represent a substantial progress in terms of Reduction and Refinement. Two non-invasive helmet-based methods are available but they are used exclusively by the pioneering research groups who designed them. In the absence of independent replication, they have had little impact in replacing the surgical implants. Here, we built a modified version of the helmet system proposed by Srihasam et al. (2010 NeuroImage, 51(1), 267-73) and tested it for resting state fMRI in awake monkeys. Extremely vulnerable to motion artifacts, resting state fMRI represents a decisive test for non-invasive head restraint systems. We compared two monkeys restrained with the helmet to one monkey with a surgically implanted head post using both a seed-based approach and an independent component analysis. Technically, the helmet system proved relatively easy to develop. Scientifically, although it allowed more extensive movements than the head post system, the helmet proved viable for resting state fMRI, in particular when combined with the independent component analysis that deals more effectively with movement-related noise than the seed-based approach. We also discuss the pros and cons of such device in light of the European Union new 2013 regulation on non-human primate research and its firm Reduction and Refinement requests.	basal ganglia diseases;brain implant;data quality;implants;independent component analysis;monkeys;morphologic artifacts;movement;neuroimaging;operative surgical procedures;physical restraint equipment (device);post–turing machine;primates;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;rest;resting state fmri	Fadila Hadj-Bouziane;Elisabetta Monfardini;Carole Guedj;Gislène Gardechaux;Clément Hynaux;Alessandro Farnè;Martine Meunier	2014	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.09.068	communication;surgery	AI	21.94834834031099	-81.69509796939238	18309

A novel embedded confusable system is proposed to generate an efficient phoneme-viseme mapping table which is constructed by phoneme grouping using Houtgast similarity approach based on the results of viseme similarity estimation using histogram distance, according to the concept of viseme visually ambiguous. The generated mapping table can simplify the mapping problem and promote viseme classification accuracy. The implemented real time speech-driven talking face system includes: 1) speech signal processing, including SNR-aware speech enhancement for noise reduction and ICA-based feature set extractions for robust acoustic feature vectors; 2) recognition network processing, HMM and MCSVM are combined as a recognition network approach for phoneme recognition and viseme classification, which HMM is good at dealing with sequential inputs, while MCSVM shows superior performance in classifying with good generalization properties, especially for limited samples. The phoneme-viseme mapping table is used for MCSVM to classify the observation sequence of HMM results, which the viseme class is belong to; 3) visual processing, arranges lip shape image of visemes in time sequence, and presents more authenticity using a dynamic alpha blending with different alpha value settings. Presented by the experiments, the used speech signal processing with noise speech comparing with clean speech, could gain 1.1 % (16.7 % to 15.6 %) and 4.8 % (30.4 % to 35.2 %) accuracy rate improvements in PER and WER, respectively. For viseme classification, the error rate is decreased from 19.22 % to 9.37 %. Last, we simulated a GSM communication between mobile phone and PC for visual quality rating and speech driven feeling using mean opinion score. Therefore, our method reduces the number of visemes and lip shape images by confusable sets and enables real-time operation.	acoustic cryptanalysis;alpha compositing;associative entity;computational complexity theory;display device;embedded system;experiment;hidden markov model;independent computing architecture;mobile phone;network processor;noise reduction;personal computer;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;smoothing;speech enhancement;speech processing;statistical classification;time series;word error rate	Po-Yi Shih;Anand Paul;Jhing-Fa Wang;Yi-Hung Chen	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1609-3	computer vision;speech recognition;confusion matrix;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	-0.2163696308820307	-88.49178508881099	18316

Falls cause a very high risk to the elderly's life. Accordingly, this paper's focus is on technology that would aid the elderly. These technologies include: Wearable- based, audio- based, and video-based fall detection systems. This paper surveys the literature regarding fall detection algorithms using those three branches and the various sensors they employ. Looking at wearable technology, the technology is cheap and accurate but inconvenient. Audio-based technology on the other hand is more convenient and is cheaper than video-based technology. However audio-based technology is hard to set up compared to video and wearable-based technologies. Video- based technology is accurate and easy to set up. At the moment, video-based technology is the most expensive compared to the other two, and it is also prone to occlusion. However as homes become smarter and prices for cameras continue to drop, it is expected that this technology will be the best of the three due to its versatility.	algorithm;hidden surface determination;sensor;wearable computer;wearable technology	Omar Mohamed;Ho-Jin Choi;Youssef Iraqi	2014	2014 6th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)	10.1109/NTMS.2014.6814018	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security	EDA	6.4629475507982415	-84.76613443319104	18471

The proposed designed system detects abnormal conditions in a patient and informs to the concerned medical personnel, without the intervention of even the patient himself. It processes the signals to detect any anomalies. If detected, it sends the data collected of the signal to the mobile phone of the concerned doctor in the form of messages by the use of GSM technology. At the doctor's end, the message received can be reconstructed back to the ECG waveform with the help of Java to Mobile Edition (J2ME) software.

This paper forges an explicit link between this measure and a corresponding spectral measure, which is also shown to provide discrimination between the two classes of data. The statistics of the estimator for swav(m) are obtained in the analytically simplest case, including expressions for its bias and variance. Numerical simulations are provided to support the theoretical analysis. We compare the bias, variance, and frequency resolution of WT and spectral measures, and conclude that the former appears more suited to our particular circumstances.	exponent bias;heart rate variability;humans;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simulation;stellar classification;wavelet transform	Conor Heneghan;Steven B.

Omitted factors include the influences of RR interval irregularity and the harmonics of 4:1 processes like respiration. Also missing is a test for statistical significance. The relevance of these factors has been tested in a database of 383 recordings from a large trial on chronic heart failure patients (the GISSI-HF study). This database consists of 12-lead 24-hour Holter recordings. Non-overlapping 128-beat segments were analyzed to obtain the average odd minus even beat difference of normal beat pairs. The database provided 284,755 such segments, each with at least 36 odd/even pairs of normal beats. Only lead V5 was evaluated for alternans. Of these, 27,932 distinct 128-beat segments exhibited an alternans amplitude > 20 microvolts in at least one 20ms part of the average STT window odd/even differences. After applying tests for RR irregularity/instability, statistical significance, subharmonics, RR alternans, and using wider windows, only 268 events remained. These data suggest that the moving average method previously described exhibits poor specificity without application of additional criteria.	24-hour clock;instability;interval arithmetic;microsoft windows;rapid refresh;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;sensor	David W.

43e6d40f954533e531f333b8642cb68d00e90c81	the analysis of vehicle sounds for recognition		Abstract   The problem of classifying vehicles on the basis of the acoustic waveform obtained from them has been approached by calculating various central moments of the short term power spectrum of a sample of the signal. It has been found that classification can be performed using two moment measurements, giving good results with vehicles operating under steady running conditions. With a burst of acceleration included in the sample, however, discrimination becomes much more difficult. In the moment space under consideration, it became evident that the movement of sample points with changes of engine speed was itself characteristic of the vehicle class, and this consideration amongst others suggested that the engine speed (or, in practice, the firing rate of the engine) was an important parameter that needs to be determined automatically.  The first attempt at finding the fundamental frequency of the waveform was based on autocorrelation, but this gave very unsatisfactory results. The technique of “cepstrum” analysis, however, is shown to give a reliable indication of the firing rate even when the engine sound is deeply embedded in noise. This is in contrast to results obtained by some earlier workers using this analysis in speech studies.		D. W. Thomas;Brian R.

EEG signals registered from Fp1 and Fp2 under different mental fatigue states were recorded and analyzed using Kolmogorov entropy (KE) and Kolmogorov complexity (KC) to investigate whether mental fatigue could be assessed using this measures. It was shown the value of KE or KC is strongly correlative with the mental fatigue state: the value of mean Kolmogorov entropy (KE) corresponding to a special mental state fluctuates within the special range; the values of KE decrease with working times prolonging; the values of KC decrease with mental fatigue increasing. It may be possible to differentiate different mental fatigue level according to the value of KE or KC.

It may also provide a basis for the study of effects of mental fatigue on central neural system.	electroencephalography;experiment;knowledge engineering;kolmogorov complexity;mental state;nonlinear dynamics	Lian-yi Zhang;Zhe Zhang;Chong-xun Zheng	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2008.505	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;statistics	Robotics	18.933353958553237	-85.5719811949342	18749

This signal reflects mechanical events of the heart contraction, including the opening and closure of mitral and aortic valves and maximal blood flow acceleration. Traditionally, SCG has been detected in a laboratory setting with the subject lying at rest in supine position. Aims of this study were 1) to investigate the feasibility of a SCG monitoring over the 24 hours in ambulant subjects, and 2) to calculate number and time distribution of the SCG estimates obtainable over the 24 hours. In 5 healthy subjects ECG, respiration, body accelerations and sternal SCG were recorded for 24 hours in a workday by a smart garment recently developed in our laboratory, the MagIC-SCG system. Each recording was split into a series of contiguous 5-s data segments and SCG was estimated in each segment where the magnitude of the acceleration vector was <;4 milli-g (this condition indicates that the subject was not moving). All the 24-h recordings were found of good quality and could be entirely analyzed. A large number of SCG estimates could be obtained over the 24 hours. In particular, more than 100 estimates per hour were available during the day; at night this rate was three times higher. Thus our study indicates that not only the 24h SCG monitoring in daily life is feasible but also that possible changes over time in SCG and its derived parameters may be tracked with an extreme temporal detail.	aortic valve structure;clothing;estimated;greater than;maximal set;milli;myocardial contraction;sternum;telling untruths;accelerometers;per hour	Marco Di Rienzo;Paolo Meriggi;Emanuele Vaini;Paolo Castiglioni;Francesco Rizzo	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347128	medicine;engineering;electrical engineering;hemodynamics;remote patient monitoring;biological engineering;physiology;accelerometer;surgery	SE	13.72005891570702	-85.89232442620388	19331

A measure to assess gait performance using accelerometers is step counting. The main problem with most step detection algorithms is the loss of accuracy at low speeds (<; 0.8 m/s) which limits their use in frail elderly populations. In this paper, a step detection algorithm was developed and validated using data from 10 healthy adults and 21 institutionalized seniors, predominantly frail older adults. Data were recorded using a single waist-worn triaxial accelerometer as each of the subjects performed one 10-m-walk trial. The algorithm demonstrated high mean sensitivity (99 ± 1%) for gait speeds between 0.2-1.5 m/s. False positives were evaluated with a series of motion activities performed by one subject. These activities simulate acceleration patterns similar to those generated near the body's center of mass while walking in terms of amplitude signal and periodicity. Cycling was the activity which led to a higher number of false positives. By applying template matching, we reduced by 73% the number of false positives in the cycling activity and eliminated all false positives in the rest of activities. Using K-means clustering, we obtained two different characteristic step patterns, one for normal and one for frail walking, where particular gait events related to limb impacts and muscle flexions were recognized. The proposed system can help to identify seniors at high risk of functional decline and monitor the progress of patients undergoing exercise therapy interventions.	chamaecyparis lawsoniana;clinical use template;cluster analysis;frail elderly;functional gastrointestinal disorders;gait disorders, neurologic;high risk acute leukemia;k-means clustering;meter per second;muscle;myalgia;ninety nine;patients;physical therapy exercises;population;quasiperiodicity;seniors' health;simulation;speed (motion);step detection;template matching;accelerometers;algorithm;statistical cluster	Cristina Soaz;Klaus Diepold	2016	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2480296	acceleration;text mining;simulation;computer science;engineering;sensor;physical therapy;communication;accelerometer;physics;foot	Visualization	14.662037183215357	-86.49189549824656	19398

The optimal selection of features, extracted from a MES and the reduction of dimensions is even more challenging. In the context of prosthetic control, dimensionality reduction means to retain MES information, that is important for class discrimination and to discard irrelevant data. Dimensionality reduction strategies are categorized into feature selection and feature projection methods according to their objective functions. In this contribution, we bring forward a statistical cluster analysis technique, which we call the """"Guilin Hills Selection Method"""". It combines selection plus projection and can be applied in the time- and in the frequency-domain. The goal is to control an electrically-powered upper-limb prostheses, the UniBw-Hand, with a minimum number of sensors and a low-power processor.

Recently, cardiac I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy has been used as tools to distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism. Thus, we performed this study to confirm significant clinical value of cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy for differential diagnosis between PD and PDD. Cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy was studied in 18 patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and 13 normal controls that were matched for age, disease duration, and severity of symptoms. The heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio) was calculated. The mean value of H/M ratio of PDD and PD was significantly lower than normal controls. However, there were no differences between PDD and PD groups. Although cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy did not distinguish PDD from PD, we wish to focus attention on sustained studies that are needed to differentiate other Lewy body disease from many dementia patients with PD features. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

14fc59167a81e5783208cece2e63c297973b11bc	to improve performance of entropy methods for analyzing physiological signals using a novel symbolic approach		So far, the common symbolic approaches cannot improve performance of complexity algorithms i.e., approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SmpEn) to distinguishing randomness and chaotic characteristics within electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, because the approaches not only reflect nonlinear properties within signals but also extract a lot of random component. Our study proposed an encoding symbolic approach (ESA) to keep the inherent nonlinear properties and reduce noise within physiological time series. For the symbolized artificial sequences by the ESA at 100, 500 and 5000 lengths, experiment results show that the values of ApEn and SmpEn, monotonically decrease respectively in order of Gau noise, mixed noise, Logistic map and periodic sequences, whereas values of the two algorithms for the symbolized sequences by the TSA and MSA exhibit fluctuation, indicating performance boost of ApEn and SmpEn on distinguishing randomness and nonlinear chaotic properties within time series with the help of ESA. The experiment results on the MIT/BIH cardiac interbeat interval databases showed the symbolized normal sinus rhythm interval time series by the ESA approach yielded the higher ApEn and SmpEn values than the symbolized congestive heart failure interval time series (p<0.01), and the results indicated that ESA is help to improve accuracies of the ApEn and SmpEn to measure the inherent chaotic properties of the time series.	algorithm;approximate entropy;bounding interval hierarchy;database;esa;interval arithmetic;logistic map;nonlinear system;quantum fluctuation;randomness;sample entropy;time series	Yatao Zhang;Shoushui Wei;Zhenshan Liu	2017	2017 10th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302237	time series;randomness;approximate entropy;artificial intelligence;interbeat interval;logistic map;pattern recognition;sample entropy;chaotic;computer science;nonlinear system	DB	20.564405808529198	-86.5416967768852	19555
128cae2360d8feb5291700017ad3d8a8e646a2f9	tennismaster: an imu-based online serve performance evaluation system	tennis;skill assessment;wearable device;activity recognition	Tennis sport has become more popular all over the world in recent years. While tennis lovers wish to improve their tennis skill set for better performance, unfortunately only few of them could be guided under professional training. Especially, serve is probably the most important skill in tennis skill set. In this paper, we present TennisMaster, an online diagnosis and feedback system, that aims at performing online assessment of tennis serve during the training process using IMU sensors. In particular, we propose a hierarchical evaluation approach based on the fusion of two IMU sensors mounted on the racket and shank of the player. In order to achieve online serve assessment, we first develop an online serve extraction algorithm to identify the serve segments and filter the non-serve events. Then we use Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to segment the serve process into eight stages. By extracting unique features on the basis of the serve segmentation, we build a regression model which outputs the score of a serve. We conduct experiments to collect 1,030 serves involving 12 subjects at various professional levels. Evaluation results show that our system achieves high accuracy of performance assessment for tennis serves.	algorithm;experiment;hidden markov model;markov chain;performance evaluation;racket;sensor	Disheng Yang;Jian Tang;Yang Huang;Chao Xu;Jinyang Li;Liang Hu;Guobin Shen;Chieh-Jan Mike Liang;Hengchang Liu	2017		10.1145/3041164.3041186	computer vision;simulation;engineering;multimedia	AI	0.1827961861861272	-83.01316185133058	19813

The goal of the challenge is to provide a common benchmark test set for individual multimodal information processing and to bring together the audio and video emotion recognition communities, to compare the relative merits of the two approaches to emotion recognition under well-defined and strictly comparable conditions, and establish to what extent fusion of the approaches is possible and beneficial. A second motivation is the need to advance emotion recognition systems to be able to deal with naturalistic behavior in large volumes of un-segmented, non-prototypical and non-preselected data as this is exactly the type of data that real systems have to face in the real world. Three emotion detection sub-challenges were addressed: emotion detection from audio, from video, or from audiovisual information. As benchmarking database the SEMAINE database of naturalistic dialogues was used. Emotion needed to be recognized in terms of positive/negative valence, and high and low activation (arousal), expectancy, and power. In total, 41 research teams registered for the challenge. The data turned out to be challenging indeed: The dataset consists of over 4 hours of audio and video recordings, 3,838 words uttered by the subject of interest, and over 1.3 million video frames in total, making it not only a challenge to detect more complex affective states, but also to deal with the sheer amount of data. Besides participation in the Challenge, papers were invited addressing in particular the differences between audio and video processing of emotive data, and the issues concerning combined audio-visual emotion recognition. We would like to particularly thank our sponsors – the Social Signal Processing Network (SSPNet), and the HUMAINE Association, all 22 members of the Technical Program Committee for their timely and insightful reviews of the submissions: Anton Batliner, Felix Burkhardt, Rama Chellappa, Mohamed Chetouani, Fernando De la Torre, Laurence Devillers, Julien Epps, Raul Fernandez, Hatice Gunes, Julia Hirschberg, Aleix Martinez, Marc Mehu, Marcello Mortillaro, Matti Pietikäinen, Ioannis Pitas, Peter Robinson, Stefan Steidl, Jianhua Tao, Mohan Trivedi, Matthew Turk, Alessandro Vinciarelli, and Stefanos Zafeiriou, and of course all participants.	alessandro vespignani;anton (computer);benchmark (computing);emotion recognition;frame (video);hirschberg's algorithm;information processing;julia;linear algebra;multimodal interaction;signal processing;test set;the turk;video processing	Björn W.

d319cd04a6d00a951fc5f16d8b9896643064b6df	non-invasive silent phoneme recognition using microwave signals		Besides the recognition of audible speech, there is currently an increasing interest in the recognition of silent speech, which has a range of novel applications. A major obstacle for a wide spread of silent-speech technology is the lack of measurement methods for speech movements that are convenient, non-invasive, portable, and robust at the same time. Therefore, as an alternative to established methods, we examined to what extent different phonemes can be discriminated from the electromagnetic transmission and reflection properties of the vocal tract. To this end, we attached two Vivaldi antennas on the cheek and below the chin of two subjects. While the subjects produced 25 phonemes in multiple phonetic contexts each, we measured the electromagnetic transmission spectra from one antenna to the other, and the reflection spectra for each antenna radar, in a frequency band from 2–12 GHz. Two classification methods k-nearest neighbors and linear discriminant analysis were trained to predict the phoneme identity from the spectral data. With linear discriminant analysis, cross-validated phoneme recognition rates of 93% and 85% were achieved for the two subjects. Although these results are speaker- and session-dependent, they suggest that electromagnetic transmission and reflection measurements of the vocal tract have great potential for future silent-speech interfaces.	bayesian network;data acquisition;deep belief network;frequency band;full scale;integrated circuit;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;linear discriminant analysis;mathematical optimization;microwave;packet analyzer;real-time data;refresh rate;sampling (signal processing);speech recognition;speech technology;tract (literature);vocabulary	Peter Birkholz;Simon Stone;Klaus Wolf;Dirk Plettemeier	2018	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2018.2865609	speech recognition;silent speech interface;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;frequency band;radar;vocal tract;computer science;linear discriminant analysis;speech processing;chin;microwave	ML	-1.9491834204621605	-89.21743955972354	19975

On account of the unique neural signature of each person, the brain activity recorded by Electroencephalogram (EEG) has recently been identified as a potential biometric trait. In this paper, we propose an online EEG-based biometric system which utilizes the activations of brain towards a set of subject-specific self-referential visual stimuli. The stimuli set consist of a number of self-face images and that of subject's relatives, which are expected to elicit brain activity in a subject-specific manner. The subject-specific biometric marker used in the proposed authentication system is the relative spectral activity of left and right hemisphere EEG in various frequency bands. Experimental analysis reveals utility of alpha and beta bands for the proposed approach, offering an average biometric recognition accuracy of 87.50% over 4 subjects. Results of the proposed methodology give insights for further research to examine the permanence and generalization of the proposed system in a larger group of subjects.	authentication;biometrics;electroencephalography;frequency band;self-reference	Ericsen;Kavitha P.

08a358e5cc5aac5c9d4708db75624bb3ad3d886b	unobtrusive heartbeat detection from mice using sensors embedded in the nest		Unobtrusive monitoring of physio-behavioral variables from animals can minimize variability in preclinical research and thereby maximize the potential for clinical translation. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and validation of an instrumented nest providing continuous recordings of seismocardiogram (SCG) signals and skin temperature. SCG represents the chest-wall vibrations associated with the heartbeat, and can potentially provide a measure by which individual heartbeats can be detected without the need for electrodes or implantable devices. A non-contact electric field sensor placed in proximity to the animal in the nest was also used to detect respiratory dynamics. The setup was tested with a total of six anesthetized mice. To understand the effects of mouse positioning within the nest on signal quality, the error in heartbeat detection at different positions of the sensor on the body was quantified, with a simultaneously-obtained electrocardiogram (ECG) as the reference standard. At the optimal placement determined with this approach, multiple perturbations were performed such as pinching, changing ambient temperature, and norepinephrine injection to modulate physiology and assess measurement capability. Heartbeat intervals obtained from the ECG and SCG during the perturbations were correlated (R2=0.82) and were in agreement according to Bland-Altman methods (bias: 0.006ms, 95% confidence interval: [-3.79, 3.78]ms) suggesting that SCG can be reliably used for unobtrusive heartbeat detection. Accordingly, the setup can provide a means by which individual heartbeats – and thereby heart rate and heart rate variability indices – can be quantified without the need for any sensors to be attached to the body of the animal.	anomaly detection;autonomic computing;confidence intervals;dermatologic disorders;electrocardiography;electroconvulsive therapy;embedding;heart rate variability;implants;norepinephrine;preparation;reference standards;rest;sleep;unobtrusive javascript;vibration - physical agent;electrode;physiological aspects;sensor (device)	Nil Z.

It is based on the alterations that OSA patients present in the LF and HF bands of the heart rate variability power spectrum. The algorithm calculates the power of the spectrum in two bands that roughly corresponding with the LF and HF bands. Then the ratio between the power of the low band and the power of the high band is obtained. If this ratio is greater than a certain threshold the patient is classified as having OSA, otherwise he/she is classified as not having OSA. Then the algorithm was validated over the test data set of the Apnea-ECG Database, classifying correctly 29 of 30 recordings.	algorithms for recovery and isolation exploiting semantics;computation;computational resource;frequency analysis;heart rate variability;personal digital assistant;rapid refresh;resampling (statistics);semiconductor industry;serial digital video out;spectral density;test data;test set;time series;wake-sleep algorithm	Abraham Otero;Xosé Antón Vila-Sobrino;Francisco Palacios Ortega;Francisco J.

Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by computing the Lyapunov exponents and classification using the classifier trained on the extracted features. The purpose was to determine an optimum classification scheme for this problem and also to infer clues about the extracted features. The research demonstrated that the Lyapunov exponents are the features which well represent the studied time-varying biomedical signals and the multiclass SVMs trained on these features achieved high classification accuracies.	lyapunov fractal;support vector machine	Elif Derya Übeyli	2008	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2007.10.001	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;lyapunov exponent;structured support vector machine	HPC	17.01053874273265	-90.30883054982438	20858

Subjects wore three inertial sensors (Opals, APDM) attached to both feet and the lumbar region for a week of continuous monitoring. Walking bouts, of at least 10s, were first identified, and then features of freezing, quantity and quality of mobility were extracted and averaged across the seven days.Results showed significant impairments in freezing and quality of mobility in the freezers group compared to the nonfreezers. Our measures of average and variability of time spent freezing was associated to the subjects’ perception of freezing, assessed with the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire. These preliminary results are introducing promising measures of mobility impairments measured during community-living in PD.	extraction;freezer;foot;freezing;heart rate variability;lumbar region;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;supernumerary maxillary left lateral incisor;sensor (device)	Martina Mancini;Carolin Curtze;Samuel Stuart;Mahmoud El-Gohary;James McNames;John G.

41da4fa304f737f28f55bf23d10d53c8261602c6	orthogonal matching pursuit based classifier for premature ventricular contraction detection		Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are a common topic of discussion among cardiologists as this type of heart arrhythmia is very frequent among the general population, often endangering people's health. In this paper, a software system is proposed that differentiates PVCs from normal, healthy heartbeats collected in the MIT-BIH Ar- rhythmia Database. During classification, training data were recorded from subjects different than those from which testing data were mea- sured, making the classifiers attempt to recognize patterns they were not trained for.

9c8f1ce169cad2d09134ad60cecb038f55de245a	employment of intra-individual variability to improve computerized ecg interpretation	computer assisted diagnosis;electrocardiography;body surface potential mapping	One of the reasons for the limited practical utility of computer programs for interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is their susceptibility to intra-individual variability. Two of the most prominent sources of intra-individual variability in ECGs, electrode placement variations and respiration, were studied for their effects on computerized ECG interpretation. Previous research has shown that the effects of intra-individual variability on computerized ECG interpretation depend largely on the individual ECG. To enable the assessment of chest electrode position variations for individual standard 12- lead ECGs, ECGs resulting from simulations of such position variations were interpreted. Variability due to respiration was assessed by interpreting all individual ECG beats instead of an averaged beat. In this paper two methods are presented that employ information about the intra-individual variability in individual ECGs. The first method provides an estimate of the reliability of the interpretation, the second attempts to improve the interpretation itself. In the first method we quantified the variation in interpretation caused by the two sources of intra-individual variability with the use of a stability index, a high index value indicating a low variation in interpretation. This index was subsequently studied using two sets of ECGs. For the first set a â clinical' reference interpretation was obtained from discharge letters. For the second set three cardiologists provided a â cardiologists' reference. The performance of subgroups of ECGs having stability indices higher than a particular value was computed. It appeared that for the â cardiologists' reference, the interpretations of ECGs with a high stability index were more often correct. No effect was found for the â clinical' reference. In the second method we attempted to improve the original interpretation by combining the alternative interpretations into a new interpretation. This was done by taking the median or the average of the quantified alternatives. These combined interpretations proved to perform better than the original interpretation when a cardiologist's interpretation was taken as a reference. This paper shows that intra-individual ECG variability can be used to improve original interpretations. This can be done without having to record multiple ECGs, provided that a model is available to simulate intra-individual variability. The presented methods do not depend on the classification algorithm that is used. They can be used both during classifier design to correct imperfections, and in routine use of the classifier to produce more representative classifications.	algorithm;attempt;classification;computer program;discharger;heart rate variability;index value;interpretation (logic);interpretation process;simulation;spatial variability	Bob J.

This paper investigated a measurement platform set-up for detecting the shade of the (yellow) colour of urine and its integration with the IoT principles for providing ubiquitous services to the users (citizens). We propose a smart IoT-based holistic system that consists of a urine colour measurement component to be fitted in urinals. Based on RGB colour theory, the system was implemented using a myRio board, which interacts with a mobile application. Bio-samples (urine) gathered from volunteers were tested using this board and with a hand-held refractometer. The results showed that it is possible to infer the BHL by analysing the blue values of RGB colour and by comparison with the recommended urine colour chart. We believe that the proposed system promotes sustainable healthy lifestyle through its ubiquitous “on-the-go” self-test solution and raises BHL awareness in a “greener” and more “personal” way.	arm architecture;biodiversity heritage library;embedded system;holism;microcontroller;mobile app;mobile device;multi-core processor;myrio;prototype;pseudo-hadamard transform;sensor;usb on-the-go	Jeannette Shiaw-Yuan Chin;Alin Tisan	2015	2015 IEEE 13th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	10.1109/INDIN.2015.7281774	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	4.924014075713988	-89.92728512369256	21200

They offer, inter alia, insights into diseases mechanisms, genetic predisposition to a disease, and drug therapy. However, the use of animals for medical research is a cause of major controversies and debates in modern science. To warrant high bioethical standards, new directives have been being adopted to replace animal research whenever possible, to reduce the number of animals, and to refine the procedures to minimize stress and pain. Here, we present two new approaches, based on thermal imaging (a remote and passive technology), to assess respiratory rate (RR) as well as exploratory behavior and general activity in rodents. In animal research, these parameters are gold standards for welfare assessment. The approaches were validated in a study conducted with both rats and mice. To test the feasibility of our algorithm to estimate RR, thermal videos from anesthetized rodents were acquired. The capability of the second approach to monitor activity was tested with videos of Open Field tests. Regarding RR, a high agreement between thermal imaging and gold standard (electrocardiography-derived RR) was achieved. The mean relative error averaged 0.50 ± 0.15 breaths/min and 4.55 ± 2.94 breaths/min for rats and mice, respectively. The second approach was capable of monitoring and tracking the activity of the rodents very well. This paper demonstrates that thermal imaging is a promising and relevant alternative for monitoring of RR and activity in rodents, thus contributing to the remote assessment of animal welfare.

Among these metrics, apparent pool size ratio (PSR) from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) imaging and radial diffusivity (RD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are both known to relate to histological measure of myelin density and integrity. However their relative sensitivities towards quantitative myelin detection are unknown. In this study, we correlated high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measures of subvoxel tissue structures with corresponding quantitative myelin histology in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated animal model of MS. Specifically, we acquired quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics (on the same tissue sample) in an animal model system of type III oligodendrogliopathy which lacked prominent lymphocytic infiltration, a system that had not been previously examined with quantitative MRI. We find that the qMT measured apparent pool size ratio (PSR) showed the strongest correlation with a histological measure of myelin content. DTI measured RD showed the next strongest correlation, and other DTI and relaxation parameters (such as the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1f) or fractional anisotropy (FA)) showed considerably weaker correlations with myelin content.	demyelination;diffusion tensor imaging;folic acid;fractional anisotropy;image resolution;lightweight portable security;linear programming relaxation;lipopolysaccharides;lymphocytic infiltration;magnetic resonance imaging;multiple sclerosis;myelin;platelet storage pool deficiency;radial (radio);radial basis function;ruby document format;sensitivity and specificity;tissue sample;white matter;nervous system disorder	Vaibhav A.

6676330da91debaf7a62265c76d1b0bbbb257f91	anticipating daily intention using on-wrist motion triggered sensing		Anticipating human intention by observing one’s actions has many applications. For instance, picking up a cellphone, then a charger (actions) implies that one wants to charge the cellphone (intention) (Fig. 1). By anticipating the intention, an intelligent system can guide the user to the closest power outlet. We propose an on-wrist motion triggered sensing system for anticipating daily intentions, where the on-wrist sensors help us to persistently observe one’s actions. The core of the system is a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Policy Network (PN), where the RNN encodes visual and motion observation to anticipate intention, and the PN parsimoniously triggers the process of visual observation to reduce computation requirement. We jointly trained the whole network using policy gradient and cross-entropy loss. To evaluate, we collect the first daily “intention” dataset consisting of 2379 videos with 34 intentions and 164 unique action sequences (paths in Fig. 1). Our method achieves 92:68%; 90:85%; 97:56% accuracy on three users while processing only 29% of the visual observation on average.	artificial intelligence;battery charger;computation;cross entropy;gradient;mobile phone;occam's razor;online and offline;online machine learning;random neural network;recurrent neural network;sensor	Tz-Ying Wu;Ting-An Chien;Cheng-Sheng Chan;Chan-Wei Hu;Min Sun	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)	10.1109/ICCV.2017.15	artificial intelligence;machine learning;visualization;computer science;computation;intelligent decision support system;recurrent neural network	Vision	3.548113618327348	-84.03942333941107	21569

Dem@Home is an ambient assisted living framework to support independent living while receiving intelligent clinical care. Dem@Home integrates a variety of ambient and wearable sensors together with sophisticated, interdisciplinary methods of image and semantic analysis. Semantic Web technologies, such as OWL 2, are extensively employed to represent sensor observations and application domain specifics as well as to implement hybrid activity recognition and problem detection. Complete with tailored user interfaces, clinicians are provided with accurate monitoring of multiple life aspects, such as physical activity, sleep, complex daily tasks and clinical problems, leading to adaptive non-pharmaceutical interventions. The method has been already validated for both recognition performance and improvement on a clinical level, in four home pilots.	activity recognition;ambient intelligence;application domain;semantic web;sensor;user interface;wearable computer;web ontology language	Stelios Andreadis;Thanos G.

Robust and accurate Heart-Rate (HR) monitoring at the right/left ventricles and the right atrium is essential for an implantable cardiac pacemaker system (Fig. 16.9.1), and ultra-low power consumption is needed. In addition, an accurate motion sensor and thoracic impedance measurement can acquire valuable additional information in clinical research on the intra-cardiac rhythm analysis. As shown in Fig. 16.9.2, our proposed Analog Signal Processor (ASP) IC consists of 3 power-efficient intra-cardiac signal readout channels. Each channel is equipped with a low-power QRS feature extraction unit and an ECG processor in parallel. The ASP also provides an ultra-low-power readout circuit for an external accelerometer (RA). In addition, two quadrature bio-impedance readout channels are used together with a digitized sinusoidal current generator in order to implement an accurate and wide dynamic range bio-impedance measurement. The ASP improves the state of the art by integrating a power-efficient means of QRS feature extraction for detecting Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), and a wide dynamic range bio-impedance readout.	analog signal processing;artificial cardiac pacemaker;british informatics olympiad;cathode ray tube;characteristic impedance;dynamic range;feature extraction;low-power broadcasting;motion detector;sensor;traffic collision avoidance system	Sunyoung Kim;Long Yan;Srinjoy Mitra;Masato Osawa;Yasunari Harada;Kosei Tamiya;Chris Van Hoof;Refet Firat Yazicioglu	2013	2013 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487745	electronic engineering;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;biological engineering;accelerometer;low-power electronics;biosensor	EDA	12.192438601638338	-88.57882195271276	21685

However, the literatures only able to classify subjects as either healthy of suffering from PD. This paper presents a pattern recognition method for multi stage classification of PD utilizing voice features. 22 features are obtained from University of California-Irvine (UCI) data repository. These features are extracted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). It is found that PCA is better than LDA in terms of extracting significant features. Some classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Adaptive Resonance Theory-Kohonen Neural Network (ART-KNN) are then used and compared. These methods are applied in multi stage classification. The classification results show that SVM has better testing accuracy than the other methods.	adaboost;adaptive resonance theory;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;linear discriminant analysis;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;research data archiving;self-organizing map;statistical classification;support vector machine	Wahyu Caesarendra;Farika T.

These devices can be part of e-Health systems used to diagnose, treat, and monitor patients with cardiovascular diseases. Manufacturers must show to regulatory agencies the effectiveness of devices during the certification process. Nowadays, simulators are used to test and calibrate ECG devices. Besides, manufacturers can use formal methods to specify ECG device requirements to increase dependability. In this context, it is necessary to validate formal models to provide confidence in the specification. Validations can be performed comparing models and physical devices using the same data generated from simulators. However, the simulators available in the market do not enable one to control the amplitude and frequency of signals. This makes difficult the use of the same data into formal models and physical devices. We present in this paper an open and low cost ECG simulator to validate models of ECG devices. The simulator generates ECG signals from digitized characteristic and noise waveforms. We analyzed the quality of the simulator qualitatively using the MATLAB and the Proteus software.	dependability;formal methods;matlab;proteus;requirement;simulation	Alvaro Sobrinho;Paulo Cunha;Leandro Dias da Silva;Angelo Perkusich;Thiago Cordeiro;Joilson Rego	2015	2015 17th International Conference on E-health Networking, Application & Services (HealthCom)	10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454478	embedded system;electronic engineering;simulation;engineering	SE	8.036825858112012	-89.46665713068478	21923

First, unimodal models are created using raw behavioral data such as speech, head motion, and face tracking. These models are then integrated into a fusion model that works as a classifier. The main advantage of this work is that the proposed models were trained without any hand-crafted features, and they outperformed a baseline model that was trained using hand-crafted features. It was also found that multimodal fusion is useful in applying the CNN approach to model multimodal multiparty interaction.	artificial neural network;baseline (configuration management);convolutional neural network;facial motion capture;machine learning;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;oracle fusion architecture;statistical classification	Fumio Nihei;Yukiko I.

Afterwards, Infomax was applied to 25 channels of recorded normal breathing sound where simulated fine and coarse crackles were added including acoustic propagation effects.

ec7bbaad4056ae54fdfe4a84a4b01282e50e7fb1	three drowsiness categories assessment by electroencephalogram in driving simulator environment		Traffic accidents remain one of the most critical issues in many countries. One of the major causes of traffic accidents is drowsiness while driving. Since drowsiness is related to human physiological conditions, drowsiness is hard to prevent. Several studies have been conducted in assessing drowsiness, especially in a driving environment. One of the common methods used is the electroencephalogram (EEG). It is known that drowsiness occurs in the central nervous system; thus, estimating drowsiness using EEG is the promising way to assess drowsiness accurately. In this study, we tried to estimate drowsiness using frequency-domain and time-domain analysis of EEG. To validate the physiological conditions of the subjects, the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS), a subject-based assessment of drowsiness condition; and an examiner-based assessment known as facial expression evaluation (FEE) were applied. Three categories were considered; alert (KSS < 6; FEE < 1), weak drowsiness (KSS 6–7; FEE 1–2) and strong drowsiness (KSS > 7; FEE > 2). The six parameters (absolute and relative power of alpha, ratio of β/α and (θ+α)/β, and Hjorth activity and mobility parameters) had statistically significant differences between the three drowsiness conditions (P < 0.001). By using both KSS and FEE, these parameters showed high accuracy in detecting drowsiness (up to 92.9%). Taken together, we suggest that EEG parameters can be used in detecting the three drowsiness conditions in a simulated driving environment.	alert:type:point in time:^patient:nominal;cns disorder;categories;cerebrovascular accident;disorders of excessive somnolence;domain analysis;driving simulator;electroencephalography;estimated;kss gene;kearns-sayre syndrome;sensor;simulation;simulators;sleep wake disorders	Izzat Aulia Akbar;Arthur M.

01b108b25bb7b9302741d9a7210382aa94dbc96d	preliminary evaluation of feature level compensation for missing data in multi-sensor activity recognition	feature value compensation;missing data compensation;activity recognition	Activity recognition using multiple body-worn sensors can directly monitor the movement of each body part and can recognize various activities accurately. However, using multiple sensors increases the chance of sensor failure or communication failure, and most current activity recognition algorithms do not work when failure occurs due to the difference (reduction) of the dimension of the feature vector from that of complete sensor data expected in system design time. Therefore, we compared three possible techniques to solves this problem on the feature value level: a classifier trained with reduced feature values, feature value compensation with multiple regression, and feature value compensation with kernel regression, in a no failure situation. All of these techniques do not depend on classification algorithms. While creating a regression model, which is in the training phase, requires relatively high computational power, compensation itself can work with low computational power. As overall results, kernel regression had the best performance that was the closest to the no failure situation. Also, the results imply that each sensor position has its own effective method and more accurate coping can be viable with the appropriate choice of the method.	activity recognition;algorithm;effective method;feature vector;missing data;sensor;systems design	Ryoma Uchida;Ren Ohmura	2012		10.1145/2370216.2370346	computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;feature;activity recognition	HCI	4.191192897640329	-84.39932991213277	22154

The module is composed of two sensors for the measuring of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). A first device validation was carried out by involving four subjects who were asked to perform tasks providing different stress-related statuses. A comparison of physiological parameters measured by the module with those measured by a commercial HRV-GSR sensor chosen as gold standard was made. Two out of the three HRV parameters and all of the GSR parameters measured with the module resulted consistent (mostly differing less than 10%) with the same parameters measured by the gold standard.

Research into the prediction of AF onset has been motivated by the necessity to develop better pacing therapy to reduce the incidence of AF and maintain the heart's normal sinus rhythm. In this paper, we address a similar problem to that posed in the Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001, but develop patient specific models to distinguish between epochs of ECG located far away from AF rhythms and those located just prior to the onset of those episodes. Our approach is validated using a publicly available dataset.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;binaural beats;data point;embedded system;incidence matrix;neural oscillation;onset (audio);rapid refresh;relative atrial index;sheffer stroke;terminate (software)	Dilranjan S.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals can be measured using a modified home weighing scale and used to track changes in myocardial contractility and cardiac output. With this approach, the BCG can potentially be used both for preventive screening and for chronic disease management applications. However, for achieving high signal quality, subjects are required to stand still on the scale in an upright position for the measurement; the effects of intentional (for user comfort) or unintentional (due to user error) modifications in the position or posture of the subject during the measurement have not been investigated in the existing literature. In this study, we quantified the effects of different standing and seated postures on the measured BCG signals, and on the most salient BCG-derived features compared to reference standard measurements (e.g., impedance cardiography). We determined that the standing upright posture led to the least distorted signals as hypothesized, and that the correlation between BCG-derived timing interval features (R-J interval) and the preejection period, PEP (measured using ICG), decreased significantly with impaired posture or sitting position. We further implemented two novel approaches to improve the PEP estimates from other standing and sitting postures, using system identification and improved J-wave detection methods. These approaches can improve the usability of standing BCG measurements in unsupervised settings (i.e., the home), by improving the robustness to nonideal posture, as well as enabling high-quality seated BCG measurements.	ability to sit question;ability to stand upright;artificial cardiac pacemaker;ballistocardiography;body position;cardiography, impedance;characteristic impedance;chronic disease;disease management;distortion;entity handling - upright;estimated;inversive congruential generator;phosphoenolpyruvate;poor posture;quantitative impedance;reference standards;synapomorphy;system identification;unsupervised learning;usability;user error;weak measurement;cardiography	Abdul Qadir Javaid;Andrew D.

cff484e19fff1ed710269aea701ec99087573f2f	3-d markerless tracking of human gait by geometric trilateration of multiple kinects	tracking cameras servers acoustics sensor phenomena and characterization sensor systems;3 d tracking clock synchronization delsys system comparison human gait kinect v2 motion capture	In this paper, we develop an integrated markerless gait tracking system with three Kinect v2 sensors. A geometric principle-based trilateration method is proposed for optimizing the accuracy of the measured gait data. To tackle the data synchronization problem among the Kinect clients and the server, a synchronization mechanism based on network time protocol (NTP) is designed for synchronizing the server and Kinect clients’ clocks. Furthermore, a time schedule is designed for timing each Kinect client's data transmission. In the experiment, participants are asked to perform a 60-s walk, while the proposed tracking system obtains the participant's gait data. Six joints (including left hip, right hip, left knee, right knee, left ankle, and right ankle) of the participants are tracked where the obtained gait data are described as 6000 movements of joint positions (1000 movements for each joint). The results show that the trilateration tracking result by the three Kinect sensors has a much higher accuracy compared with the accuracy measured by a single Kinect sensor. Within a randomly sampled time period (67.726 s in the experiment), 98.37$\%$ of the frames generated by the gait tracking system have timing errors less than 1 ms, which is much better than the default NTP service embedded in the Windows 8.1 operating system. The accuracy of the proposed system is quantitatively evaluated and verified by a comparison with a commercial medical system (Delsys Trigno Smart Sensor System).	data synchronization;embedded system;kinect;microsoft windows;operating system;randomness;sensor;server (computing);smart transducer;tracking system	Lin Yang;Bowen Yang;William Haiwei Dong;Abdulmotaleb El Saddik	2018	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2016.2553518	network time protocol;computer science;real-time computing;gait;synchronization;tracking system;data synchronization;computer vision;server;trilateration;gait (human);artificial intelligence	Mobile	10.932959542772497	-87.17990814897088	22444

Currently Autism is diagnosed in children no younger than 2 years old. This paper presents a new monitoring device, the WearCam, to help forming a diagnosis of this neurodevelopmental disorder at an earlier age than currently possible. The WearCam consists of a wireless camera located on the forefront of the child. The WearCam collects videos from the viewpoint of the child's head. Color detection, face detection and gaze detection are run on the data in order to locate the approximate gaze direction of the child and determine where her attention is drawn to (persons, objects, etc.). We report on early tests of the camera within normally developing children. Firstly the technical characteristics of the current prototype of the WearCam will be described. Afterwards the type of data collected with this device with young children will be shown.	approximation algorithm;face detection;interaction;microsoft forefront;prototype	Lorenzo Piccardi;Basilio Noris;Olivier Barbey;Aude Billard;Giuseppina Schiavone;Flavio Keller;Claes von Hofsten	2007	RO-MAN 2007 - The 16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415154	spectrum;computer vision;face detection;computer science;remote patient monitoring;multimedia;neurophysiology;data collection	Mobile	8.552835904040835	-87.43285684346377	22629

Recent studies state the fact that Malaysia has been experiencing improved health, longer life expectancy, and low mortality as well as declining fertility like other developing countries. As the population grows older, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases also increases exponentially. Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are related to movement disorders. After years of research and development solutions for detecting and assessing the symptoms severity in PD are quite limited. With current ongoing advance development sensor technology, development of various uni-modal approaches: technological tools to quantify PD symptom severity had drawn significance attention worldwide. The objective of this review is to compare some available technological tools for monitoring the severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson (PWP).	modal logic;sensor	Qi Wei Oung;M.

33b54ae74724a3028aa9228449915d86b10da1d0	infant cry detection in adverse acoustic environments by using deep neural networks		The amount of time an infant cries in a day helps the medical staff in the evaluation of his/her health conditions. Extracting this information requires a cry detection algorithm able to operate in environments with challenging acoustic conditions, since multiple noise sources, such as interferent cries, medical equipments, and persons may be present. This paper proposes an algorithm for detecting infant cries in such environments. The proposed solution is a multiple stage detection algorithm: the first stage is composed of an eight-channel filter-and-sum beamformer, followed by an Optimally Modified Log-Spectral Amplitude estimator (OMLSA) post-filter for reducing the effect of interferences. The second stage is the Deep Neural Network (DNN) based cry detector, having audio Log-Mel features as inputs. A synthetic dataset mimicking a real neonatal hospital scenario has been created for training the network and evaluating the performance. Additionally, a dataset containing cries acquired in a real neonatology department has been used for assessing the performance in a real scenario. The algorithm has been compared to a popular approach for voice activity detection based on Long-Term Spectral Divergence, and the results show that the proposed solution achieves superior detection performance both on synthetic data and on real data.

In order to properly decode the electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals, the BCI needs to adapt to the subject via calibration to ensure stable performance. One of the major challenges in realization of the EEG signals is the long calibration time required since they show significant variations between recording sessions even for the same subject within the same experimental condition. This paper proposes a score-based adaptive training algorithm that maximally utilizes relevant information from prior recording sessions and significantly shortens the calibration time. Also the proposed method is suitable to develop real-time, wearable, and low-power BCI embedded devices. The BCI developed in this work is based on the P300 word speller application introduced by Farwell and Donchin in 1988. The experimental results show that by employing few letters for calibration, the proposed adaptive training algorithm can achieve 100% classification accuracy.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;embedded system;low-power broadcasting;real-time clock;real-time computing;wearable computer	Yuan Zou;Omid Dehzangi;Roozbeh Jafari	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637829	brain–computer interface;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	12.805343359934186	-92.42551904402839	22843

Recent studies indicate a larger area of hyperechogenicity in elderly healthy adult subjects. The present study aimed to determine the size of the SN hyperechogenicity and of the mesencephalic brainstem in children and adults without evidence of movement disorders. The areas of echogenicity in the substantia nigra (aSN) and the area of the ipsilateral midbrain (aMid) were assessed in 121 healthy infants and children as well as in 64 healthy adults. Furthermore, the ratio of aSN and aMid was calculated (S/M ratio). We found a positive correlation between age and aSN and between age and the S/M ratio. The values for aSN and S/M ratio were smaller in infants and children compared to healthy adults (aSNmax 0.06+/-0.05 cm2 vs. 0.13+/-0.08 cm2). The aSN and S/M ratio grew with increasing age in an almost linear progression. The increase of SN hyperechogenicity over time suggests that the biological process underlying this ultrasound finding may be more dynamic and possibly progressive than previously thought.	asparagine;biological processes;brain stem;color gradient;infant, newborn;large;medical ultrasound;midbrain structure;movement disorders;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;progressive scan;small;substantia nigra structure;transcranial magnetic stimulation;ultrasonography	Johann Hagenah;Inke R.

c7ab8a5407e6fb639549415d356034a810f58d81	impact of the acquisition time on ecg compression-based biometric identification systems		The ECG signal conveys desirable characteristics for biometric identification (universality, uniqueness, measurability, acceptability and circumvention avoidance). However, based on the current literature review, there are no results that evaluate the number of heartbeats needed for personal identification. This information is undoubtedly useful when building a biometric identification system – any system should ask participants to provide data for identification, using the smallest time interval that is possible, for practical reasons. In this paper, we aim at exploring this topic using a measure of similarity based on the Kolmogorov Complexity, called the Normalized Relative Compression (NRC). To attain the goal, we built finite-context models to represent each individual – a compression-based approach that has been shown successful for several other pattern recognition applications like image similarity, DNA sequences or authorship attribution.	biometrics	João M.

The chronnectome is a model that takes into account the temporal variance in connectivity throughout a scan session. In this work, we evaluate the repeatability of properties of functional network connectivity (FNC) dynamics assessed using sliding-windowed correlations in 28 independent age-matched large samples of 250 subjects. This approach revealed that multiple discrete, reoccurring connectivity states arise during rest, and that subjects tend to remain in one connectivity state for long periods of time before transitioning to another. Occurrence time spent in certain states tends to increase as participants spend more time resting, while less time is spent in other states as time goes on. Overall, results show distinct connectivity states that are similar across groups during rest.	dynamic connectivity;geforce 7 series;repeatability;rest;sample variance;window function;fmri	Anees Abrol;Charlotte Chaze;Eswar Damaraju;Vince D.

Heart, being a magnificent pump, has his performance orchestrated via a group of valves and highly sophisticated neural control. While the kinetics of the heart is accompanied by sound production, sound waves produced, by the heart, are reliable diagnostic tools to check heart activity. Chronologically, several data sets have been put forward to sneak on the heart performance and lead to medical intervention whenever necessary. The heart sounds data set, utilized in this paper, provides researchers with abundance of sound signals that was classified using different classification algorithms; decision tree, rotation forest, random forest are few to mention. This paper proposes an approach based on local transfer function classifier as a new model of neural networks for heart valve diseases detection. In order to achieve this objective, and to increase the efficiency of the predication model, boolean reasoning discretization algorithm is introduced to discretion the heart signal data set, then the rough set reduction technique is applied to find all reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for classification. Then, the rough sets dependency rules are generated directly from all generated reducts. Rough confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes. Finally, a local transfer function classifier was employed to evaluate the ability of the selected descriptors for discrimination whether they represent healthy or unhealthy.

However, the impact of the PLR maneuver on CPR remains unclear due to difficulties in monitoring cardiac output in real-time during CPR and a lack of clinical evidence.   METHODS We developed a computational model that couples hemodynamic behavior during standard CPR and the PLR maneuver, and simulated the model by applying different angles of leg raising from 0° to 90° and compression rates from 80/min to 160/min.   RESULTS The simulation results showed that the PLR maneuver during CPR significantly improves cardiac output (CO), systemic perfusion pressure (SPP) and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) by ∼40-65% particularly under the recommended range of compression rates between 100/min and 120/min with 45° of leg raise, compared to standard CPR. However, such effects start to wane with further leg lifts, indicating the existence of an optimal angle of leg raise for each person to achieve the best hemodynamic responses.   CONCLUSIONS We developed a CPR-PLR model and demonstrated the effects of PLR on hemodynamics by investigating changes in CO, SPP, and CPP under different compression rates and angles of leg raising. Our computational model will facilitate study of PLR effects during CPR and the development of an advanced model combined with circulatory disorders, which will be a valuable asset for further studies.

5dde013520a306b8816fc75c19e3ea8caef00d44	affective eeg-based person identification using the deep learning approach		Electroencephalography (EEG) is another mode for performing Person Identification (PI). Due to the nature of the EEG signals, EEG-based PI is typically done while the person is performing some kind of mental task, such as motor control. However, few works have considered EEG-based PI while the person is in different mental states (affective EEG). The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of affective EEG-based PI using a deep learning approach. A cascade of deep learning architectures is proposed, using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CNNs are used to handle the spatial information from the EEG while RNNs extract the temporal information. Two kinds RNNs are evaluated, namely Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU). The proposed method is evaluated on the state-of-the-art affective dataset DEAP. The results indicate that CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM can perform PI from different affective states and reach up to 99.90–100% mean Correct Recognition Rate CRR, significantly outperforming a support vector machine (SVM) baseline system that uses power spectral density (PSD) features. Notably, the 100% mean CRR comes from only 40 subjects in DEAP dataset. To reduce the number of EEG electrodes from thirty-two to five for more practical applications, the frontal region gives the best results reaching up to 99.17% mean CRR (from CNN-GRU). Amongst the two deep learning models, we find CNN-GRU to slightly outperform CNN-LSTM, while having faster training time.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);convolutional neural network;deep learning;electroencephalography;experiment;long short-term memory;mental state;neural networks;recurrent neural network;spectral density;support vector machine;the 100	Theerawit Wilaiprasitporn;Apiwat Ditthapron;Karis Matchaparn;Tanaboon Tongbuasirilai;Nannapas Banluesombatkul;Ekapol Chuangsuwanich	2018	CoRR		deep learning;support vector machine;convolutional neural network;spatial analysis;and gate;electroencephalography;spectral density;recurrent neural network;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	14.997170462507556	-94.79215851139978	23264

Five controls were scanned 5 times over 1 year. The five MR measurements were made for 5 white matter regions. All measurements were found to be highly reproducible. MTR had a low reliability coefficient because all individual values were similar. Therefore, MTR would be most sensitive in detecting changes from normal. WC had a high reliability coefficient in all regions. For MWC, GMT2 and T1, the overall reliability coefficients were high but for some individual regions were low. The high coefficients suggest that these measurements, although different between normal subjects, are consistent over time. They could be used to explore natural differences in the normal population, but due to the large spread in normal values, larger sample sizes are needed to detect pathological changes.		Irene M.

In this paper, we extend the existing CI parameters and propose chronotropic competence indices (CCI) to describe the exercise response of the cardiopulmonary system. A cardiac chronotropic competence Test (3CT), dedicated to CCI measurement using a wearable device, is also presented. Preliminary clinical trials are presented for the validation of 3CT measurement accuracy, and to show the potential of CCI in the prevention and rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases.	aortic valve insufficiency;cardiac rehabilitation;cardiopulmonary;cardiovascular diseases;clinical interpretation;coronary heart disease;exercise stress test;extraction;heart diseases;heart failure;immunocompetence;interpretation process;patients;rehabilitation therapy;sensor;toe brachial index;wearable technology	Jian-Kang Wu;Jianan Li;Andrew J.

231b485d7902dae17785ce0732c772a965abe633	simultaneous 12-lead electrocardiogram synthesis using a single-lead ecg signal: application to handheld ecg devices		Recent introduction of wearable single-lead ECG devices of diverse configurations has caught the intrigue of the medical community. While these devices provide a highly affordable support tool for the caregivers for continuous monitoring and to detect acute conditions, such as arrhythmia, their utility for cardiac diagnostics remains limited. This is because clinical diagnosis of many cardiac pathologies is rooted in gleaning patterns from synchronous 12-lead ECG. If synchronous 12-lead signals of clinical quality can be synthesized from these single-lead devices, it can transform cardiac care by substantially reducing the costs and enhancing access to cardiac diagnostics. However, prior attempts to synthesize synchronous 12-lead ECG have not been successful. Vectorcardiography (VCG) analysis suggests that cardiac axis synthesized from earlier attempts deviates significantly from that estimated from 12-lead and/or Frank lead measurements. This work is perhaps the first successful attempt to synthesize clinically equivalent synchronous 12-lead ECG from single-lead ECG. Our method employs a random forest machine learning model that uses a subject’s historical 12-lead recordings to estimate the morphology including the actual timing of various ECG events (relative to the measured single-lead ECG) for all 11 missing leads of the subject. Our method was validated on two benchmark datasets as well as paper ECG and AliveCorKardia data obtained from the Heart, Artery, and Vein Center of Fresno, California. Results suggest that this approach can synthesize synchronous ECG with accuracies (R) exceeding 90%. Accurate synthesis of 12-lead ECG from a single-lead device can ultimately enable its wider application and improved point-of-care (POC) diagnostics.	apache axis;benchmark (computing);galaxy morphological classification;machine learning;random forest;wearable computer	Kahkashan Afrin;Parikshit Verma;Sanjay S.

The 76 static parameters were measured with the Non-contact 3d human boy scanners of VITUS SMART XXL systems while the 11 functional parameters were measured manually with Martin measuring scale. The correlation and fitting formulas of body height, sitting height and other parameters were measured and obtained. We also contrasted measured data with data form GJB 1835-1993. The present analysis showed that the correlation between sizes of body length and sitting height was significant. Sizes of body length and enclosing size and width direction were all increased compared to those in the 1980s. The present results were consistent with other researchers’ current research results. The measured data could be an important basis for the data of young male anthropometric parameters and edition of relative standard and design of specific equipment.	anthropometry	Qian-Xiang Zhou;Zhong-Qi Liu;Fang Xie;Sijuan Zheng;Shihua Zhou	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-07725-3_17	simulation;statistics;anthropometry;sitting height;engineering	Crypto	14.547058709936001	-84.63158783975004	23740
7e21afea723c54162624eccf0ce5a1c89bacb5d4	denoising of weak ecg signals by using wavelet analysis and fuzzy thresholding		The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a biological signal that contains important information about the cardiac activities of heart. ECG signal plays a very important role in the diagnosis and analysis of heart diseases. ECG signal is corrupted by various types of noise such as electrode movement, strong electromagnetic effect and muscle noise. Noisy ECG signal has been extracted using signal processing. This paper presents a weak ECG signal denoising method based on fuzzy thresholding and wavelet packet analysis. Firstly, the weak ECG signal is decomposed into various levels by wavelet packet transform. Then, the threshold value is determined using the fuzzy s-function. The reconstruction of the ECG signal from the retained coefficients is achieved by using inverse wavelet packet transform. We carried out several experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and compared the results with the traditional wavelet packet soft and hard thresholding methods for weak signal denoising. The results are satisfactory according to calculated the correlation coefficient.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;computer simulation;decibel;experiment;matlab;network packet;noise reduction;packet analyzer;performance evaluation;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;thresholding (image processing);utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet packet decomposition	Mehmet Üstündag;Muammer Gökbulut;Abdulkadir Şengür;Fikret Ata	2012	Network Modeling Analysis in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics	10.1007/s13721-012-0015-5	wavelet;speech recognition;pattern recognition;wavelet packet decomposition	AI	19.406598756873475	-89.27593601047654	23807

In addition, at birth, EEG signals are recorded from at-risk newborns. Studies have shown that both fetal movements and newborn EEGs are non-stationary signals. This paper aims to represent both newborn EEG and fetal movement signals in a time-frequency domain using a specifically designed time-frequency distribution (TFD) that is well adapted to these types of data for the purpose of analysis, detection and classification. The approach to design the quadratic TFDS is based on relating separable-kernel TFDS to DSP spectral window and digital filter design. To reach this goal, we compared recently proposed TFDs such as the Modified B distribution, a separable Gaussian distribution and the B distribution. Then, an extension of the modified B distribution (MBD) is proposed, referred to as the extended separable-kernel MBD. This new TFD uses a separable kernel based on an extension of the modified B kernel in both time and frequency domain with different windows for each domain. Simulation results are provided to compare the proposed Method with different TFDs and to assess its performance. The new TFD is then first applied to real fetal movement data recorded using accelerometers.	digital filter;digital signal processor;electroencephalography;filter design;image resolution;kernel (operating system);microsoft windows;model-based definition;motherboard;simulation;stationary process;time–frequency analysis;time–frequency representation	Boualem Boashash;Taoufik Ben Jabeur	2012	2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)	10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310574	normal distribution;methyl-cpg-binding domain;speech recognition;digital filter;time–frequency analysis;electroencephalography;computer science;mathematics;accelerometer;statistics	Robotics	13.942898407520506	-87.76234016830033	23824

The aim of this paper is to analyze the current evidence on radiocerebral effects following exposure to <5 Sv. Dose-related cognitive and neurophysiological abnormalities among prenatally exposed children after the Chernobyl accident at gestation ages of +8 weeks were revealed at >20 mSv on the fetus and >300 mSv on the thyroid in utero; at 16–25 weeks, abnormalities were >10 mSv and >200 mSv, respectively. In adults, radiationassociated cerebrovascular effects were obtained at >0.15-0.25 Sv. Dose-related neuropsychiatric, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging abnormalities following exposure to >0.3 Sv and neurophysiological and neuroimaging radiation markers at doses >1 Sv were revealed. Studies on radiation neuropsychiatric effects should be undertaken.		Konstantin N. Loganovsky	2009	Data Science Journal			HCI	18.178209097254925	-80.30210484528578	23869
4fc4c4a2b0cdd87cd980c4d4556b5df95d6a5567	self-adaptive multi-sensor activity recognition systems based on gaussian mixture models		Personal wearables such as smartphones or smartwatches are increasingly utilized in everyday life. Frequently, activity recognition is performed on these devices to estimate the current user status and trigger automated actions according to the user’s needs. In this article, we focus on the creation of a self-adaptive activity recognition system based on IMU that includes new sensors during runtime. Starting with a classifier based on GMM, the density model is adapted to new sensor data fully autonomously by issuing the marginalization property of normal distributions. To create a classifier from that, label inference is done, either based on the initial classifier or based on the training data. For evaluation, we used more than 10 h of annotated activity data from the publicly available PAMAP2 benchmark dataset. Using the data, we showed the feasibility of our approach and performed 9720 experiments, to get resilient numbers. One approach performed reasonably well, leading to a system improvement on average, with an increase in the F-score of 0.0053, while the other one shows clear drawbacks due to a high loss of information during label inference. Furthermore, a comparison with state of the art techniques shows the necessity for further experiments in this area.	activity recognition;mixture model	Martin Jänicke;Bernhard Sick;Sven Tomforde	2018	Informatics	10.3390/informatics5030038	mixture model;wearable computer;inertial measurement unit;inference;activity recognition;training set;normal distribution;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science	AI	4.0141839035241045	-84.55915772040562	23966
58c6c4c43d4114122eeb527970ff2316b3dd8d1f	acoustic correlates of laryngeal-muscle fatigue: findings for a phonometric prevention of acquired voice pathologies		This presentation focuses on the problem of defining valid acoustic correlates of vocal fatigue seen as a physiological condition that can lead to voice pathologies. Several findings are reported based on a corpus of recordings involving electromyography (EMG) of laryngeal muscles and voice acoustics. The recordings were obtained in sessions of vocal effort extending across 12-14 hours. A known technique for estimating muscle fatigue is applied involving “spectral compression” of EMG potentials. The results show critical changes at given times of day. In examining the effects of these changes on voice acoustics, there is no linear correlation with respect to conventional acoustic parameters, but peaks in voice tremor occur at points of critical change in muscle fatigue. Further results are presented showing the need to take into account compensatory muscle actions in defining phonometric signs of vocal fatigue.	acoustic cryptanalysis;electromyography	Victor J.

In this paper a classification of uncertainties centered on a meal notion is first proposed. Two of these uncertainties are developed in a smart home and homecare context. Meal preparation probability is evaluated by a simulation based on Naïve Bayesian Networks. To determine if a person is at risk of malnutrition or undernutrition, and to supervise prepared meal quality and quantity in terms of nutrients, the use of RFID tags is discussed, bringing many open issues for which additional sensors are proposed.

7ab63dabd68590230636bb3d4d588575cfaaac24	carbon-wire loop based artifact correction outperforms post-processing eeg/fmri corrections—a validation of a real-time simultaneous eeg/fmri correction method		"""Simultaneous EEG-fMRI combines two powerful neuroimaging techniques, but the EEG signal suffers from severe artifacts in the MRI environment that are difficult to remove. These are the MR scanning artifact and the blood-pulsation artifact--strategies to remove them are a topic of ongoing research. Additionally large, unsystematic artifacts are produced across the full frequency spectrum by the magnet's helium pump (and ventilator) systems which are notoriously hard to remove. As a consequence, experimenters routinely deactivate the helium pump during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions which potentially risks damaging the MRI system and necessitates more frequent and expensive helium refills. We present a novel correction method addressing both helium pump and ballisto-cardiac (BCG) artifacts, consisting of carbon-wire loops (CWL) as additional sensors to accurately track unpredictable artifacts related to subtle movements in the scanner, and an EEGLAB plugin to perform artifact correction. We compare signal-to-noise metrics of EEG data, corrected with CWL and three conventional correction methods, for helium pump off and on measurements. Because the CWL setup records signals in real-time, it fits requirements of applications where immediate correction is necessary, such as neuro-feedback applications or stimulation time-locked to specific sleep oscillations. The comparison metrics in this paper relate to: (1) the EEG signal itself, (2) the """"eyes open vs. eyes closed"""" effect, and (3) an assessment of how the artifact corrections impacts the ability to perform meaningful correlations between EEG alpha power and the BOLD signal. Results show that the CWL correction corrects for He pump artifact and also produces EEG data more comparable to EEG obtained outside the magnet than conventional post-processing methods."""	ablepharon;algorithm;amino acids;bipolar disorder;carbon-carbon lyases;cleaning (activity);composite artifact colors;coughing;deny (action);display resolution;doppler effect;electroencephalography;experiment;eye;fits;gradient;helium;independent computing architecture;magnet <device>;mental suffering;morphologic artifacts;motion;movement;neurofeedback;neuroimaging;optical burst switching;plasma cleaning;preparation;real-time clock;rejection sampling;requirement;scanner device component;score;semiconductor industry;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;throughput;usability;ventilator - respiratory equipment;video post-processing;visual inspection;benefit;fmri;sensor (device)	Johan N. van der Meer;André Pampel;Eus J.

Thus, we investigated how input variability and uncertainty at cellular level propagates through to affect tissue level dynamics. We simulated action potential (AP) propagation in a strip of cardiac tissue, using the monodomain and CRN tissue/cell models. Input maximal conductances (p=12) within the CRN model were varied within 1/3 of baseline, and points in parameter space selected by Latin hypercube sampling. The tissue was paced for twenty beats at 1Hz (S1), and 6 metrics of AP shape were derived for the final beat (max dV/dt, max voltage, resting voltage, action potential duration to 90% repolarisation (APD90), resting voltage and APD to 50% repolarisation (APD50)). S1 pacing was followed by a single ectopic beat (S2) at different intervals, at one end and the midpoint of the tissue. Additional tissue metrics were calculated, including conduction velocity (CV), CV and APD restitution curves and the size of the tissue vulnerable window. Subsequently, parameter sensitivity on both tissue and cell level outputs was performed using Partial Least Squares regression. Simulations and postprocessing were performed in Nektar++ and Matlab (Mathworks). Regression values were smaller in tissue compared to cell (APD90/max dV/dt R2=0.43/0.27 in tissue vs R2=0.92/0.97 in cells). AP metrics exhibited stronger sensitivities to maximal ionic conductances in single cell compared to tissue simulations (sensitivity indices 0.98/0.99 for max dVdt/max voltage to GNa in cell vs 0.48/0.59 in tissue) while CV was sensitive to GNa (0.61) and VW to GNa (-0.58) and GK1 (-0.61). Further analysis offunctional metrics in tissue will determine sensitivity of tissue to cellular changes.	ap computer science;action potential;auditory processing disorder;baseline (configuration management);general linear model;ionic;matlab;maximal set;nektar++;partial least squares regression;sampling (signal processing);simulation;software propagation;spatial scale;spatial variability;velocity (software development)	Eugene T.

Real-time and adaptive techniques for the detection and the delineation of the P-QRS-T waves were investigated to extract the fiducial points. Those techniques are robust to any variations in the ECG signal with high sensitivity and precision. Two databases of the heart signal recordings from the MIT PhysioNet and the American Heart Association were used as a validation set to evaluate the performance of the processor. Based on application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) simulation results, the overall classification accuracy was found to be 86% on the out-of-sample validation data with 3-s window size. The architecture of the proposed ESP was implemented using 65-nm CMOS process. It occupied 0.112-mm2 area and consumed 2.78-μW power at an operating frequency of 10 kHz and from an operating voltage of 1 V. It is worth mentioning that the proposed ESP is the first ASIC implementation of an ECG-based processor that is used for the prediction of ventricular arrhythmia up to 3 h before the onset.	application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;clock rate;database;fiducial marker;naive bayes classifier;onset (audio);real-time transcription;signal processing;simulation	Nourhan Bayasi;Temesghen Tekeste;Hani H.

a017f8042a0771b7f8325b80d4abd072ad879a3d	automatic detection of epileptiform discharges in the eeg		The diagnosis of epilepsy generally includes a visual inspection of EEG recorded data by the Neurologist, with the purpose of checking the occurrence of transient waveforms called interictal epileptiform discharges. These waveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process is usually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long-term EEG records. Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be a valuable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the development of a multi-stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signals and applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysis techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with a classification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm’s performance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, with epileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist.

The aim of this study was to assess pulse transit times at three different peripheral body sites in HTR, and in comparison to healthy controls, by using relatively low-cost and easy-to-perform photo plethysmography (PPG) technology. PPG waveforms and an electrocardiography timing reference were recorded from 12 HTR (age range 8-17 years; 5 males) and 30 healthy children (age range 8-16 years; 15 males) from the right and left ear lobes, index fingers, and great toes. The median values for pulse transit times to PPG-pulse foot (PTTj) were calculated over a period of 60 heart beats, with right and left sides averaged at each segmental site. Toe PTTf was significantly shorter in HTR (median 290 ms) compared to controls (324 ms, p <; 0.05). No significant differences were found for ear and finger PTTj Furthermore, toe PTTf significantly correlated with subject height both in HTR (ρ = 0.78, p <; 0.01, slope = 88 ms/m) and controls (ρ = 0.76, p <; 0.001, slope = 132 ms/m). A shorter PTTf at the toe site is consistent with increased AS in paediatric heart transplant recipients and the results from correlation analysis further corroborated this finding.	arterial stiffness;cardiography, impedance;ear lobe;fingers, unit of measurement;heart transplantation;heart valve disease;left ear structure;peripheral vascular diseases;plethysmography;toes;transplant recipients;transposition of great vessels	Costanzo Di Maria;Emma Sharkey;Annette Klinge;Dingchang Zheng;Alan Murray;John J.

Such measurements fitted a pattern of first order decay from an initial pressure towards a resting systolic or diastolic pressure, P. Using non-linear regression analysis it was possible to approach a standard error of 1mmHg/1mmHg for P values on a single day; the between-day dispersion, over a period of months, was found to be about 2mmHg/2mmHg. Computer analysis is required to give values of resting systolic and diastolic BP accompanied by error estimates.	blood substitute;diastole;diastolic blood pressure;estimated;hematological disease;nonlinear system;regression analysis;rest;seizures	Christopher J.

d12ed53a6e36c44d417c973c1c21c4e20e5417c0	beamforming and blind source separation have a complementary effect in reducing tonic cranial muscle contamination of scalp measurements		Scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) are susceptible to cranial and cervical muscle contamination from frequencies as low as 20 hertz, even in relaxed conditions. Reliably recording cognitive activity, which is in this range, is impossible without removing or reducing the effect of muscle contamination. Our unique database of paralysed conscious subjects enabled us to test the effect of combining beamforming and blind source separation in reducing tonic muscle contamination of scalp electrical recordings. Using the beamforming technique, muscle sources are separated automatically based on their location; while using blind source separation, muscle components are separated based on their spectral gradient. Our results show that applying the beamforming technique on data pruned by a blind source separation technique (or vice versa) can reduce tonic muscle contamination significantly more than applying either of them separately, especially at peripheral locations. Hence, these approaches complement each other in reducing muscle contamination of EEG.	beamforming;blind signal separation;complement system proteins;electroencephalography;gradient;greater than;hertz (hz);muscle;myalgia;neck;peripheral;relaxation;source separation;tonic-clonic epilepsy;visually impaired persons	Azin S.

6fd71cf064f61b828df08bd04f6051268d13e071	relevant features selection for automatic prediction of preterm deliveries from pregnancy electrohysterograhic (ehg) records	electrohysterographic ehg signal;huang-hilbert transform (hht);intrinsic mode function imf;preterm childbirth threat;support vector machine (svm);uterine emg signal	In this study, we proposed an approach able to predict whether a pregnant woman with contractions would give birth earlier than expected (i.e., before the 37 t h week of gestation (WG)). It only processes non-invasive electrohysterographic (EHG) signals fully automatically without assistance of an expert or an additional medical system. We used term and preterm EHG signals of 30-minutes duration collected between the 27 t h and the 32 n d WG. Preterm deliveries (< 37W G) had occurred in average 4.00 ± 1.88 weeks since recording dates. Each recording contains three bipolar channels. Using the Huang-Hilbert transform (HHT), we obtained up to twelve intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) for each signal. We found that the most relevant IMFs for both term and preterm records were IMF3 and IMF6. From these two IMFs, we extracted 8 most relevant features targeting EHG signal specificities. We investigated features classifications using support vector machine (SVM) for the 3 single-channels and for all their possible combinations. High discrimination power between term and preterm EHG records was obtained with linear-SVM classifiers. For almost all the cases, mean areas under curves (AUC) exceeded 0.92. A two-channel combination (7 features) achieved the best mean results with A c c u r a c y = 95.70%, S e n s i t i v i t y = 98.40%, S p e c i f i c i t y = 93.00% and A U C = 0.95. Results of the three-channel combination (9 features) were A c c u r a c y = 92.30%, S e n s i t i v i t y = 93.00%, S p e c i f i c i t y = 91.60% and A U C = 0.96. The best single-channel (8 features) gave the mean values: A c c u r a c y = 90.40%, S e n s i t i v i t y = 93.60% and A U C = 0.94. Thus, the advantage of our approach is the high diagnostic performance at low computational cost.	algorithmic efficiency;area under curve;bipolar disorder;classification;computation;contraction mapping;extraction;genetic selection;granulomatosis with polyangiitis;gum talha extract;hilbert transform;linear discriminant analysis;spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared;support vector machine;telemedicine;cellular targeting;interest;standards characteristics	Nafissa Sadi Ahmed;Baya Kacha;Hamza Taleb;Malika Kedir-Talha	2017	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-017-0847-8	data mining;medicine;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	Security	16.883800975470134	-89.4622187342854	25140
73ffabf3414ae3a848cd7ae11d881e46c737176b	detection of rem sleep behaviour disorder by automated polysomnography analysis		Objective: Evidence suggests Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) is an early predictor of Parkinson’s disease. This study proposes a fully-automated framework for RBD detection consisting of automated sleep staging followed by RBD identification. Methods: Analysis was assessed using a limited polysomnography montage from 53 participants with RBD and 53 age-matched healthy controls. Sleep stage classification was achieved using a Random Forest (RF) classifier and 156 features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels. For RBD detection, a RF classifier was trained combining established techniques to quantify muscle atonia with additional features that incorporate sleep architecture and the EMG fractal exponent. Results: Automated multi-state sleep staging achieved a 0.62 Cohen’s Kappa score. RBD detection accuracy improved by 10% to 96% (compared to individual established metrics) when using manually annotated sleep staging. Accuracy remained high (92%) when using automated sleep staging. Conclusions: This study outperforms established metrics and demonstrates that incorporating sleep architecture and sleep stage transitions can benefit RBD detection. This study also achieved automated sleep staging with a level of accuracy comparable to manual annotation. Significance: This study validates a tractable, fully-automated, and sensitive pipeline for RBD identification that could be translated to wearable take-home technology.	algorithm;bonjour sleep proxy;cobham's thesis;disk staging;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;fractal dimension;kerrison predictor;montagejs;programmable sound generator;radio frequency;random forest;wearable computer	Navin Cooray;Fernando Andreotti;Christine Lo;Mkael Symmonds;Michele T.

We study the collective behaviour of a !arge number of cells based on a measure of the correlation of sequences of spikes between neighbour units. Our first results show that we can obtain significant discrimination of spectra1 components of vowels without any kind of cabled lateral inhibition or second filter device. This collective behaviour is made possible by the synchronization of inputs of adjacent units.

Clinical research illustrating that continuing accurate measurements of core body temperature (CBT) are crucial to investigate human thermoregulation in ambulatory environment and during activity. On the other hand, ECG remains the mainstay test for primary diagnosis and survival analysis of heart diseases. We implement a wireless multisensory system that measures both the tympanic temperature inside the ear and ECG data from an ear and an arm. The behind-the-Ear device makes desirable to measure ECG data without any chest belt and allow the patient to move around freely. The proposed Bluetooth device has similarity of a hearing aid and is wirelessly connected to a smartphone for data transmission and displaying. This device not only gives access to the core temperature and ECG data in real time, but also the device can be controlled – removed and reapplied – by the patient at any time, thus increasing the performance of personal health applications.	bluetooth;mhealth;real-time clock;real-time computing;smartphone;wearable computer	Numan Celik;Wamadeva Balachandran;Nadarajah Manivannan	2015		10.4108/eai.28-9-2015.2261544	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;body area network;biological engineering	HCI	9.295991793056723	-88.65399431302505	25437
999a0d0c86c12505412c2e3e358b4b0e9cddd5c6	architectural configuration and microstructural properties of the sacral plexus: a diffusion tensor mri and fiber tractography study	fiber tractography;sacral plexus;peripheral nerves;microstructural properties;diffusion tensor imaging;spina bifida	The ability to investigate microstructural properties of the central nervous system with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been shown in many studies. More recently, DTI is being applied outside the brain showing promising results, for instance, for investigating muscle tissue. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography to study the nerves of the sacral plexus in humans in vivo and to assess the architectural configuration and microstructural properties of these peripheral nerves. For this research goal we optimized the acquisition parameters of a DTI sequence and acquired data from 10 healthy adults and one 12-year patient having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. For the healthy volunteers, we estimated the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivities (RD) of the sacral plexus nerves which may serve as a baseline for future studies. We demonstrated that tractography of the sacral plexus on a 3 Tesla MR scanner is feasible, giving 3D insight in the general anatomy and organization of the nerves L4 to S3. In addition, branches to the pudendal nerve were also found in 4 volunteers. There were no significant differences in any of the estimated diffusion measures between the right and left sided nerves or between the nerves L4 to S3 on an intra-subject basis. Furthermore, clinical feasibility of DTI and tractography in a child having spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction is demonstrated. The architectural configuration of the child's sacral plexus was comparable with the healthy volunteers and no significant disrupted nerve fibers were observed. However, there are strong indications that abnormal diffusion characteristics are present at the level of the neural tube defect due to incomplete segments of the nerves that are close to the vertebrae. These findings are encouraging for using DTI as a means to investigate changes in microstructural properties of the nerves of the sacral plexus. Moreover, this new methodology may provide a new avenue to a better analysis and diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunctions.	anatomic structures;baseline (configuration management);bladder neoplasm;bone structure of sacrum;bone structure of spine;diffusion tensor imaging;fractional anisotropy;futures studies;molecular dynamics;nerve fibers;nervous system structure;neural tube defects;neurogenic urinary bladder;optical fiber;patients;peripheral nerves;radial (radio);radial basis function;ruby document format;sacral anterior root stimulator;sacral nerve stimulation;sacral plexus structure;scanning systems;software bug;spina bifida;structure of pudendal nerve;tesla - unit;tissue fiber;video-in video-out	Pasquelle K.

5f1564a91f0a7570c1f7328b21ee98bcc4a576c2	quantifying stimulus-response rehabilitation protocols by auditory feedback in parkinson's disease gait pattern		External auditory cues stimulate motor related areas of the brain, activating motor ways parallel to the basal ganglia circuits and providing a temporary pattern for gait. In effect, patients may re-learn motor skills mediated by compensatory neuroplasticity mechanisms. However, long term functional gains are dependent on the nature of the pathology, follow-up is usually limited and reinforcement by healthcare professionals is crucial. Aiming to cope with these challenges, several researches and device implementations provide auditory or visual stimulation to improve Parkinsonian gait pattern, inside and outside clinical scenarios. The current work presents a semiautomated strategy for spatio-temporal feature extraction to study the relations between auditory temporal stimulation and spatiotemporal gait response. A protocol for auditory stimulation was built to evaluate the integrability of the strategy in the clinic practice. The method was evaluated in transversal measurement with an exploratory group of people with Parkinson’s (n = 12 in stage 1, 2 and 3) and control subjects (n =6). The result showed a strong linear relation between auditory stimulation and cadence response in control subjects (R=0.98 ±0.008) and PD subject in stage 2 (R=0.95 ±0.03) and stage 3 (R=0.89 ±0.05). Normalized step length showed a variable response between low and high gait velocity (0.2u003e R u003e0.97). The correlation between normalized mean velocity and stimulus was strong in all PD stage 2 (Ru003e0.96) PD stage 3 (Ru003e0.84) and controls (Ru003e0.91) for all experimental conditions. Among participants, the largest variation from baseline was found in PD subject in stage 3 (53.61 ±39.2 step/min, 0.12 ± 0.06 in step length and 0.33 ± 0.16 in mean velocity). In this group these values were higher than the own baseline. These variations are related with direct effect of metronome frequency on cadence and velocity. The variation of step length involves different regulation strategies and could need others specific external cues. In conclusion the current protocol (and their selected parameters, kind of sound time for training, step of variation, range of variation) provide a suitable gait facilitation method specially for patients with the highest gait disturbance (stage 2 and 3). The method should be adjusted for initial stages and evaluated in a rehabilitation program.		Gustavo Pineda;Angélica Atehortúa;Marcela Iregui;Juan D.

The considered arrhythmias include; right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), and Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) which accompanied with normal signal are investigated. Two levels of feature extraction are totally used for arrhythmia recognition and after each level, the features are sent to neural network (NN) for classification. At first level of feature extraction, ECG signal is compressed using principal component analysis (PCA) which yields feature vectors. Then feature vector is sent to NN as the input. The results showed that this strategy could appropriately identify three species of arrhythmia with high accuracy but had remarkable errors in classifying SVT and RBBB. To overcome this failure, the linear features of heart rate variation plot (HRV) are extracted and used for training a second NN which acts as second classifier for SVT and RBBB. By applying this hybrid technique a precision of one hundred percent is achieved.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bounding interval hierarchy;categorization;feature extraction;feature vector;heart rate variability;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;norm (social);principal component analysis	Seyed Saleh Mohseni;Matiar Mohamadyari	2016	2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS)	10.1109/IS.2016.7737390	speech recognition;engineering;machine learning;pattern recognition	Robotics	16.913536615005548	-90.59372166680198	25719

The level of strain nerves can tolerate and the functional deficits which result from exceeding this threshold are not thoroughly understood. To examine these phenomena, a novel system for tensile electrophysiology was created using a grease gap-recording chamber paired with a computerized micromanipulator and load cell. Guinea pig sciatic nerves were stretched beyond their maximum physiologic length to examine the effects of tension on signal conduction. Mechanical and electrophysiological data such as load, position, compound action potential amplitude, and signal latency were recorded in real-time. While 5% strain did not affect conduction, further elongation decreased amplitude approximately linearly with strain. These experiments verify the findings of prior studies into nerve stretch, and demonstrate the utility of this apparatus for investigating the mechanical and electrophysiological properties of nerves undergoing strain.	abducens nerve diseases;action potential;cavia porcellus;cognition disorders;experiment;nerve expansion;olfactory nerve;patients;peripheral nerves;real-time clock;structure of sciatic nerve;tension;wounds and injuries;micromanipulator	Todd Rickett;Sean Connell;Jennifer Bastijanic;Satya Hegde;Riyi Shi	2010	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-010-9468-1	electrophysiology;tension;anatomy;surgery	ML	17.726447087078775	-82.74963562955935	25794

It has advantages such as ease of use, little training and high Information Transfer Rate (ITR). Traditional SSVEP based BCI systems are based on the Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) approach in telecommunications. Recently, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) was also introduced to SSVEP based BCI to enhance the system performance. This study designed a new time-frequency joint coding method to utilize the information coding from both time and frequency domains. TDMA using Different Frequency (DF) mode and Same Frequency (SF) mode were compared to the traditional FDMA mode in the offline experiment. The result showed that the DF mode had better performance than the other two modes. The mean and the standard deviation of accuracy and ITR of the online experiment was 83.3%±5.5% and 130.3 + 14.9 bits/min (trial time: 1.25s) and 92.0%±7.5% and 136.6 + 19.8 bit/min (trial time: 1.5s). The average typing speed for the word-copy spelling task was 14.9 characters per minute (cpm) (trial time: 1.25s) and 14.8 cpm (trial time: 1.5s).

ae298ac0c2f0c28ecb0751766261cc3c7b3b746c	fall detection system for elderly people using iot and big data		Abstract Falls represent a major public health risk worldwide for the elderly people. A fall not assisted in time can cause functional impairment in an elder and a significant decrease in his mobility, independence and life quality. In that sense, the present work proposes an innovative IoT-based system for detecting falls of elderly people in indoor environments, which takes advantages of low-power wireless sensor networks, smart devices, big data and cloud computing. For this purpose, a 3D-axis accelerometer embedded into a 6LowPAN device wearable is used, which is responsible for collecting data from movements of elderly people in real-time. To provide high efficiency in fall detection, the sensor readings are processed and analyzed using a decision trees-based Big Data model running on a Smart IoT Gateway. If a fall is detected, an alert is activated and the system reacts automatically by sending notifications to the groups responsible for the care of the elderly people. Finally, the system provides services built on cloud. From medical perspective, there is a storage service that enables healthcare professional to access to falls data for perform further analysis. On the other hand, the system provides a service leveraging this data to create a new machine learning model each time a fall is detected.

The pulse transit time (PTT) and other parameter such as RS2 have been used previously for continuous BP monitoring. In this study, a system is designed using trial axis accelerometer as a sensor to collect seismocardiogram (SCG) data. The SCG waveforms have been used to find a relationship between Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and different axis of Seismocardiogram on 10 subjects aged 24+ years. The results reflect that the SBP is correlated with the starting point of the SCG wave in the x-axis to the mid-point of the z-axis. Their mean correlation and equations have been found which can state the systolic blood pressure of the subjects. The relative errors between the calculated SBP and the SBP measured from clinical equipment are up to 123 mmHg in normal range and 456 mmHg in high range. In summary, SCG can be used to determine the SBP as it has a moderate correlation.	apache axis;sbp;tire-pressure monitoring system	Mohammad Shamim Imtiaz;Rajeena Shrestha;Talwinder Dhillon;Kazi Ata Yousuf;Bilal Saeed;Anh Dinh;Khan A.

Purpose of the present work was to verify whether a computational-light ICA algorithm (FastICA), tailored to the characteristics of fMCG, could reconstruct reliable signals of the fetal cardiac activity during the last gestational trimester, when good electrophysiological traces are difficult to obtain although being extremely important for clinical diagnosis of severe fetal dysrhythmias. Several combinations of input recordings and output components were examined in order to assess the best configuration to successfully use FastICA. The reconstructed traces were compared with those obtained with deterministic techniques already used for this purpose, and they showed to be stable and reliable, unaffected by overlapped maternal and fetal beats and suitable for clinical applications.	algorithm;diagnosis, clinical;email;fastica;fetal growth retardation;fetal heart;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetic fields;magnetocardiography;performance;requirement;signal reconstruction;tracing (software);waveform	Silvia Comani;Dante Mantini;Paris Pennesi;Antonio Lagatta;Giovanni Cancellieri	2004	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2003.12.005	signal reconstruction;independent component analysis;electrophysiology;speech recognition;magnetic field;computer science;data retrieval;heart;fetus	Metrics	17.964474963532126	-87.32959426470597	26338

In order to realize the high-spatial-resolution tactile sensory feedback in the PFP region, we investigated the effects of electrode size and spacing on the tactile sensations for potentially optimizing the surface electrode array configuration. Six forearm-amputated subjects were recruited in the psychophysical studies. With the diameter of the circular electrode increasing from 3 mm to 12 mm, the threshold current intensity was enhanced correspondingly under different sensory modalities. The smaller electrode could potentially lead to high sensation spatial resolution. Whereas, the smaller the electrode, the less the number of sensory modalities. For an F-3 mm electrode, it is even hard for the subject to perceive any perception modalities under normal stimulating current. In addition, the two-electrode discrimination distance (TEDD) in the phantom thumb perception area decreased with electrode size decreasing in two directions of parallel or perpendicular to the forearm. No significant difference of TEDD existed along the two directions. Studies in this paper would guide the configuration optimization of the TENS electrode array for potential high spatial-resolution sensory feedback.	amputees;diameter (qualifier value);esthesia;forearm;imaging phantom;mathematical optimization;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;sacral nerve stimulation;sensory feedback;small;spacing;speech discrimination tests;stimulation (motivation);surface electrode;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation	Peipei Li;G.

Since biometrics is concerned with the measurements of unique human physiological or behavioural characteristics, the technology has been used to verify the identity of computer or network users. Given today's heightened security requirements of military as well as other applications such as banking, health care, etc., it is becoming critical to be able to monitor the presence of the authenticated user throughout a session. This paper presents a prototype system that uses facial recognition technology to monitor the authenticated user. The objective is to ensure that the user who is using the computer is the same person that logged onto the system. A neural network-based algorithm is implemented to carry out face detection, and an eigenface method is employed to perform facial recognition. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed which allows the performance of face detection and facial recognition to be monitored at run time. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of near-real-time continuous user verification for high-level security information systems.	adaboost;algorithm;artificial neural network;authentication;authorization;biometrics;computer;credential;display resolution;eigenface;entity;face detection;facial recognition system;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;information leakage;information security;information system;interrupt;login;pixel;printing;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);spectral leakage;webcam	Qinghan Xiao;Xue-Dong Yang	2009	2009 IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Biometrics: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications	10.1109/CIB.2009.4925689	facial recognition system;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;graphical user interface;computer security	Security	4.5215562502591435	-89.24448037365713	26594

a4501edda1ac0b652c535096cbf216203eeff26e	acoustic diversity classifier for automated marine big data analysis		In recent years, big data has increasingly drawn the attention of the R&D community. With the advent of marine data, monitoring marine big data becomes a new trend that advocates for assessing human impact on marine data. Nevertheless, there is a lack of support for acoustic sounds classification in such environment, covering diverse data that can exist (i.e., fish sounds, human activities sounds and environmental sounds). In this paper, we cope with this gap by proposing a deep learning-based approach that enables to efficiently classify these acoustic sounds aiming at automating the support of marine sound analysis in big data architectures. A set of experiments have been conducted using a real marine dataset to demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of our approach.

In order to alleviate the inherent limitations of recognition, we propose spatio-temporal reasoning techniques based upon an analysis of the occupant tracks. The key technical idea underlying our approach is to determine the identity of a person based upon information from a track of events rather than a single event. We abstract a smart environment by a probabilistic state transition system in which each state records a set of individuals who are present in various zones of the smart environment. An event abstracts a recognition step and the transition function defines the mapping between states upon the occurrence of an event. We define the concepts of ‘precision’ and ‘recall’ to quantify the performance of the smart environment. We provide experimental results to show performance improvements from spatio-temporal reasoning. Our conclusion is that the state transition system is an effective abstraction of a smart environment and the application of spatial-temporal reasoning enhances its overall performance.	biometrics;smart environment	Vivek Menon;Bharat Jayaraman;Venu Govindaraju	2011		10.1016/j.procs.2011.07.049	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;smart environment;computer security	AI	1.0955525733716516	-84.80169889797952	26756

However, most general anesthetics, such as isoflurane, are known to suppress SEPs, which might affect the interpretation of the signals. In animal studies, the usage of anesthetics during SEP measurements is inevitable due to which detailed effect of these drugs on the recordings should be known. In this paper, the effect of isoflurane on SEPs was studied in a rat model. Both time and frequency properties of the cortical recordings generated by stimulating the tibial nerve of rat's hindlimb were investigated at three different isoflurane levels. While the anesthetic agent is shown to generally suppress the amplitude of the SEP, the effect was found to be nonlinear influencing more substantially the latter part of waveform. This finding will potentially help us in future work aiming at separating the effects of anesthetics on SEP from those due to injury in the ascending neural pathways.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;anesthesiology;anesthetics;evoked potentials;general anesthetic drugs;isoflurane;lower extremity;neural pathways;nonlinear system;plxnb1 gene;stimulation (motivation);structure of tibial nerve;symantec endpoint protection;waveform	Jukka Kortelainen;Ashwati Vipin;Thow Xin Yuan;Hasan S.

In addition to self-report, an objective pain assessment system can provide a more complete picture of the neurophysiological basis for pain. In this study, a robust and accurate machine learning approach is developed to quantify tonic thermal pain across healthy subjects into a maximum of ten distinct classes. Methods: A random forest model was trained to predict pain scores using time–frequency wavelet representations of independent components obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) data, and the relative importance of each frequency band to pain quantification is assessed. Results: The mean classification accuracy for predicting pain on an independent test subject for a range of 1–10 is 89.45%, highest among existing state of the art quantification algorithms for EEG. The gamma band is the most important to both intersubject and intrasubject classification accuracy. Conclusion: The robustness and generalizability of the classifier are demonstrated. Significance: Our results demonstrate the potential of this tool to be used clinically to help us to improve chronic pain treatment and establish spectral biomarkers for future pain-related studies using EEG.	biological markers;chronic pain;class;electroencephalography phase synchronization;frequency band;gamma correction;machine learning;pain measurement;quantitation;random forest;stellar classification;wavelet;algorithm	Vishal Vijayakumar;Michelle Case;Sina Shirinpour;Bin He	2017	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2756870	pain assessment;computer science;robustness (computer science);chronic pain;tonic (music);computer vision;simulation;generalizability theory;time–frequency analysis;random forest;electroencephalography;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	ML	17.314471357524464	-87.84299001015972	26866

Early results show that the system can be used to detect the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is traditionally diagnosed using polysomnography, which requires a whole night stay at the sleep laboratory of a hospital, where the patient is attached to multiple electrodes and sensors. Our system detects heartbeats, breathing, snoring, sleeping positions and movements using a special electret microphone and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The system first analyses the sleep using the acoustic information provided by the electret microphone. From the acoustic information breathing events and heartbeats are identified. The system also analyses the patient's activity and positions from data delivered by the IMU. The information from both sensors is fused to detect sleep events. First experiments show that the system is capable of detecting and interpreting relevant data to improve sleep monitoring.	acoustic cryptanalysis;carpal tunnel syndrome;cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher;experiment;microphone device component;movement;patients;polysomnography;sleep (system call);sleep apnea syndromes;sleep apnea, obstructive;snoring;electrode;proteasome storage granule;sensor (device)	Christoph Kalkbrenner;Philipp Stark;Guy Kouemou;María-Elena Algorri;Rainer Brucher	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945224	acoustics;anesthesia;audiology	Robotics	9.66382098997412	-87.36309472787882	27096

In this piece of work, a hybrid methodology that combines the main advantages of these two methods is proposed. We hypothesize that the artifactual independent components (ICs) extracted by a BSS method include more ocular and less cerebral activity than the contaminated EEG signals. We thus propose to apply a regression algorithm to the ICs rather than directly to the recorded signals. The analysis was carried out with synthetic mixtures of real EEG and electroocculographic (EOG) recordings. A BSS method, the extended INFOMAX version of Independent Component Analysis (ICA), was initially used to decompose the artificially contaminated EEG signals into spatiotemporal ICs. Then, a regression scheme, based on a stable version of the Recursive Least Squares algorithm, sRLS, was applied to the artifactual components in order to remove only the ocular artifacts, maintaining the underlying neural signals intact. The processed ICs were then projected back, reconstructing the artifact-free EEG signals. The performance of the proposed technique was compared with two automatic techniques; a regression technique based on Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and a BSS-based artifact rejection technique called wavelet-ICA (W-ICA) on the artificially contaminated data. For comparison, two metrics were used to assess the different methods’ performance: the first quantified how successful each technique was in removing the ocular artifacts from the EEG recordings, and the second one quantified how much each technique distorted the ongoing brain activity in both time and frequency domains. Confirming our main hypothesis, results have shown that the artifactual ICs contained more ocular and less cerebral activity (p < 0.04) (artifact to signal ratio (ASR) = 1.83 ± 3.65) in contrast to the contaminated electrode signals (ASR = 0.69 ± 3.40). Our results reveal that the proposed methodology, namely REG-ICA, removes the ocular artifacts more successfully than W-ICA (p < 0.01) or LMS (p < 0.01). It also distorts less the brain activity in the time domain when compared to W-ICA and LMS. In the frequency domain, it distorts the brain activity less than the W-ICA in all frequency bands, and less than the LMS for the delta, beta, and gamma bands. Our results suggest that the proposed methodology is evidently an attractive alternative to other already proposed artifact rejection methodologies.	algorithm;blind signal separation;distortion;electroencephalography;electrooculography;frequency band;gamma correction;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;infomax;least mean squares filter;magnetoencephalography;neural oscillation;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;rejection sampling;source separation;synthetic data;wavelet	Manousos A.

Healthy sleep is vital to people’s normal lives. Sleep analysis can be used to diagnose certain physiological and neurological diseases such as insomnia and narcolepsy. This paper will introduce the sleep stage and the corresponding electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics at each stage. We used the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify original EEG data with narcolepsy. We use perturbations based on frequency to generate adversarial examples to analyze the characteristics of narcolepsy in different sleep stages. We find that perturbations at specific frequencies affect the classification results of deep learning.

We conducted a non-invasive method to detect ligament injuries of knee. The detection tool is an electronic stethoscope made by myself. We detect and record the sound around knee-joint to determine the possibility of ligament injury . The subjects’ knee-joint sound was recorded during the passive motion of knee joint. In our study, we increase the sensing positions around the knee joint. Using the mean square method could make the sound signals of stricken ligament more distinct than normal sound signals. Adopting the MFCC as the characteristic value of sound, thus classify sound signals to judge whether the subject’s ligament get hurt and the extent of damage. We conducted experiments and evaluated factors. The results suggested that the proposed KSLDM had accuracy about 89 % of ligament identification.

However, a more challenging problem of providing training on the activities to the users with the help of wearable sensors has not been adequately attempted. Specially, in the agriculture applications, an appropriate training to the farmers on performing the agricultural activities would result in the sustainable agriculture practices for achieving higher and better quality yield. In this paper, a novel first-of-a-kind, multimedia and wearable sensors based Agricultural Activity Training (AgriAcT) system has been proposed for the dissemination of agricultural technologies to the remotely located farmers. In the proposed system, a training video of an expert farmer performing an activity is captured along with the gesture data obtained from the wearable motion sensors from the expert's body while the activity is being performed. A trainee farmer, can learn a selected activity by watching the multimedia content of the expert performing that activity on the mobile phone and subsequently perform the activity by wearing the required motion sensors. We present a novel K-Nearest Neighbor based Agriculture Activity Performance Score (KAAPS) engine to generate an Activity performance score (AcT-Score) which suggest how efficiently the activity had been performed by the trainee as compared to the expert's performance. The exhaustive experimental results by collecting data from eight experts and ten trainees for two different activities are used to present the inferences on the impact made by the Act-Score on the performance of the trainee farmers.	best practice;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mobile phone;open platform;seamless3d;sensor;wearable computer	Somya Sharma;Bhushan G.

Glass slides serve as a permanent record of the patient disease. Over the course of a patient's treatment slides may need to be reviewed at other institutions before treatment can commence. Due to their fragile nature a transportable permanent digital facsimile of the glass slide would be ideal. A digital slide is a set of digital images representing the whole slide normally used by the pathologist, or a significant part of it; it is usually made by a large amount of images, up to thousands, which makes its management difficult. The present paper provides a description of the requirements needed to reproduce glass slides and of the available technological equipment, then the features of the two systems we implemented on different hardware are described, together with those of the digital slide viewer. The viewer was evaluated in two experimental test phases, during which user behaviour and diagnostic reports were measured. Digital slides used in the two experiments were acquired with either system. Possible applications of digital slides are then discussed, including undergraduate and professional education, quality control, and image analysis on full samples as well as on tissue microarrays.

Sensor data on gait were acquired using a triaxial accelerometer. A test was performed according to a test protocol for different walking speeds, e.g., slow walking, walking, fast walking, slow running, running, and fast running. Each test was carried out for 36 min on a treadmill with the participant wearing a portable gas analyzer(K4B2), an Actical device, and the device developed in this study. The signal vector magnitude(SVM) was used to process the X, Y, and Z values output by the triaxial accelerometer into one representative value. In addition, for accurate step-count detection, we used three algorithms: a heuristic algorithm(HA), the adaptive threshold algorithm(ATA), and the adaptive locking period algorithm(ALPA). A regression equation to estimate the energy expenditure(EE) was derived by using acceleration data and information of the participants. The recognition rate of our algorithm was 97.34%, and the performance of the activity conversion algorithm was better than that of the Actical device by 1.61%.	adaptive grammar;algorithm;heuristic;lock (computer science);multistage interconnection networks;piezoelectric accelerometer;real-time clock;wearable technology	Yun Kyoung Kim;Sung-Mok Kim;Hyung Suk Lho;We-Duke Cho	2012	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2008.10643241	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation	HCI	11.135040049645301	-88.98599017445555	27234

757ed7333ee5db698543df5246aa0c28a555fbce	classify epileptic eeg signals using weighted complex networks based community structure detection		Background: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that is mainly diagnosed by neurologists based on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Epileptic EEG signals are recorded as multichannel signals. A reliable technique for analysing multi-channel EEG signals is in urgent demand for the treatment and diagnosis of patients who have epilepsy and other brain disorders. Method: In this paper, each single EEG channel is partitioned into four segments, with each segment is further divided into small clusters. A set of statistical features are extracted from each cluster. As a result, a vector of all the features from each EEG single channel is obtained. The resulting features vector is then mapped into an undirected weighted network. The modularity of the networks is found to be the best to detect epileptic seizures in EEG signals. Other local and global network features, including clustering coefficients, average degree and closeness centrality, are also extracted and studied. All the network attributes are ranked based on their potential to detect abnormalities in EEG signals. Results: Eight pairs of combinations of EEG signals are classified by the proposed method using four well known classifiers: a least support vector machine, k -means, Naïve Bayes, and K -nearest. The proposed method achieved an average of 98%, 96.5%, 99%, rand 0.012, respectively, for its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the false positive rate. Comparisons were made using several existing epileptic seizures detection methods using the same datasets. The obtained results showed that the proposed method was efficient in detecting epileptic seizures in EEG signals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The design goals for the sensors were accuracy, low power consumption, small size and compatibility with each other. The circuits were designed successfully and tested simultaneously in vivo. The CW Doppler flowmeter draws 9 mA and the sonomicrometer draws 28 mA on a 5-V supply. The ability to measure heart dimension and blood velocity will add significantly to our understanding of the sequence of events leading up to spontaneous sudden cardiac death.	animal model;doppler effect;flowmeters;implants;isaacs syndrome;medical device incompatibility problem;sensor;spontaneous order;sudden cardiac death;telemetry;velocity (software development);ventricular arrhythmia ecg assessment;video-in video-out;wavelength	Wei Kong;Dennis L.

The exoskeleton concept is a very positive scientific approach for human rehabilitation in case of lower limb impairment. Although the exoskeleton shows potential, it is not yet applied extensively in clinical rehabilitation. In this research, a fuzzy based control algorithm is proposed for lower limb exoskeletons during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements. Surface electromyograms (EMGs) are acquired from the vastus lateralis muscle using a wearable EMG sensor. The resultant acceleration angle along the z-axis is determined from a kinematics sensor. Twenty volunteers were chosen to perform the experiments. The whole experiment was accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, acceleration angles and EMG data were acquired from the volunteers during both sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions. During sit-to-stand movements, the average acceleration angle at activation was 11°-48° and the EMG varied from -0.19 mV to +0.19 mV. On the other hand, during stand-to-sit movements, the average acceleration angle was found to be 57.5°-108° at the activation point and the EMG varied from -0.32 mV to +0.32 mV. In the second phase, a fuzzy controller was designed from the experimental data. The controller was tested and validated with both offline and real time data using LabVIEW.	algorithm;axis vertebra;controllers;electromyography;experiment;kinesiology;labview;lower extremity;motion;movement;online and offline;optic axis of a crystal;resultant;structure of vastus lateralis muscle;wearable computer;wearable technology;exoskeleton;sensor (device)	Sharif Muhammad Taslim Reza;Norhafizan Ahmad;Imtiaz Ahmed Choudhury;Raja Ariffin Bin Raja Ghazilla	2014		10.3390/s140304342	fuzzy logic;acceleration;movement;control engineering;simulation;exoskeleton;young adult;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrode;telemetry;accelerometer;physics	Robotics	12.861794698762482	-85.12834618918195	28019
6fdaf466846c56e3fe440deae1cd29257e73a764	pulse arrival time based indices as surrogates of ankle brachial index for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease		Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABI), the ratio of ankle blood pressure to arm pressure, has been used to assess the severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and to predict major cardiovascular events. This study proposes three indices which can be readily obtained from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram, and studies their correlation with ABI in supine and sitting positions. The proposed indices were derived from pulse arrival time (PAT). Specifically, the ratio of PAT measured from the fingertips to PAT measured from the toes of both sides (PAT ralio ), and the relative bilateral differences in PAT measured from the toes of the legs, normalised by average PAT from the two legs (PAT diff1 ) and by the minimal PAT from one side (PAT diff2 ) were calculated. The results showed that PAT ratlo is better correlated with ABI compared to PAT diffl and PAT dff2 . The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between PAT ratio and ABI is 0.57 when measured in sitting posture, indicating its potential role as an alternative index of ABI for PAD diagnosis. Compared with ABI, the advantages of PAT ratio are 1) it can be measured at ease with wearable sensors that are available at a relatively low cost; 2) the PAT-derived indices can be measured in a sitting posture which is more convenient to obtain; and 3) it can potentially provide longer term, continuous monitoring of the vascular function.	application binary interface;bilateral filter;coefficient of determination;inverted index;peripheral;poor posture;sensor;surrogates;time of arrival;wearable computer	Yali Zheng;Bryan P.

To explore the role of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during ischemia, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), a full-field high-resolution optical imaging technique, was used for real-time monitoring of the fluctuations of CBF in a rat model of asphyxial-CA. The temporal changes of CBF were characterized and the relationship between CBF and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was evaluated. Asphyxial-CA led to transient CBF dysregulation, manifested by changes in CBF velocity were significantly impacted by MAP. Hyperemia is aligned with a bolus injection of vecuronium, the first two minutes of asphyxia, the time of epinephrine injection and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and then lasted for 13 min after the return of spontaneous respiratory (ROSC), followed by hypoperfusion about 55-70% of baseline level no later than 40 min after ROSC. Interestingly, we found that the velocity of venule blood flow increased more than that of the arteriole blood flow during the hyperemia (176% vs 120%). Our study, for the first time, shows real-time CBF changes during and immediately after asphyxial-CA, with high spatial and temporal resolution images. The quantified cerebro-vascular response during the different phases of recovery after CA may underlie the mechanism of injury and recovery after brain ischemia. The study provides a new technique to study the neurovascular coupling and metabolic regulation of CBF after CA.	alignment;arterial system;arteries;asphyxia;baseline (configuration management);blood capillaries;bolus tracking;brain ischemia;cardiac arrest;cardiopulmonary resuscitation;cerebrovascular circulation;dilate procedure;epinephrine;global brain;hippocampus (brain);hyperemia;image resolution;imaging techniques;immune system diseases;impacted tooth;large;laser speckle imaging;magnetic resonance imaging;maxima and minima;metabolic process, cellular;multistage interconnection networks;oxygen saturation measurement;real-time clock;resuscitation procedure;sa node cell to atrial cardiac muscle cell communication by electrical coupling;spontaneous order;structure of arteriole;structure of venule;vecuronium;veins;velocity (software development);hypoperfusion;plasma membrane proton-transporting atp synthase complex location, coupling factor f(o)	Junyun He;Hongyang Lu;Ruoxian Deng;Leanne M.

In the first stage, a discrete perceptron fed by six features are used to classify the peaks into two subgroups: (i) definite non-EPs and (ii) definite EPs and EP-like non-EPs. In the second stage, the peaks falling into the second group are aimed to be separated from each other by a modified RBFN designed by a perturbation method that would function as a post-classifier. If there exist redundant data components in training data set, they can be discarded by analyzing the total disturbance of the RBFN output corresponding to the perturbed inputs. Thus, input dimension size is reduced and network becomes smaller. The classification performance of the system is comparatively evaluated for three different feature sets such as raw EEG data, discrete Fourier transform coefficients, and discrete wavelet transform coefficients.	electroencephalography	Nurettin Acir	2005	Expert Syst.

36b59228cd18eafc16c2d5266142b9560db6aec7	building an intelligent and efficient smart space to detect human behavior in common areas		Smart spaces have become an integral part of our daily routines to improve quality of life for many different groups of people. The use of embedded systems to build these smart spaces, in combination with data analytics, can provide real-time information about the environment and how it interacts with the people in it. In this paper, we demonstrate how one embedded system that acquires data based on a 2-dimensional positional-grid, movement, temperature and vibration is used to build a smart and pervasive space. Data collected from these sensors is used for real time localization in conjunction with machine learning mechanisms to analyze human activities. We evaluate five machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Artificial Neural Network applied on a dataset collected in our lab. Results show high classification performance for all methods giving up-to 99.95% classification accuracy. These patterns provide useful information about occupancy patterns, movement patterns, etc., which will be later used to allocate computational resources in the smart space accordingly. Furthermore, our implementation does not use any camera or microphone deployment, hence addressing potential privacy issues.	activity recognition;algorithm;artificial neural network;computation;computational resource;cubic function;decision tree;embedded system;floor and ceiling functions;logistic regression;machine learning;microphone;naive bayes classifier;pervasive informatics;privacy;random forest;real-time data;real-time locating system;sensor;smart tv;software deployment;support vector machine	Yifeng Ni;Jacob Harbour;Baris Aksanli	2018	2018 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)	10.1109/ISNCC.2018.8530988	naive bayes classifier;software deployment;artificial neural network;decision tree;support vector machine;machine learning;intelligent sensor;data analysis;random forest;artificial intelligence;computer science	AI	4.764481015856911	-85.94276810343474	28308

Considerable research on individual motion classifiers has been done to exploit this idea. A drawback with the individual prediction approach, however, is its limitation to serial control, which is slow, cumbersome, and unnatural. In this work, different classifier topologies suitable for the decoding of mixed classes, and thus capable of predicting simultaneous motions, were investigated in real-time. These topologies resulted in higher offline accuracies than previously achieved, but more importantly, positive indications of their suitability for real-time systems were found. Furthermore, in order to facilitate further development, benchmarking, and cooperation, the algorithms and data generated in this study are freely available as part of BioPatRec, an open source framework for the development of advanced prosthetic control strategies.	class;electromyography;limb prosthesis;limb structure;motion;movement;online and offline;open-source software;real-time clock;real-time computing;algorithm;electrode	Max Ortiz-Catalan;Rickard Branemark;Bo Håkansson	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6611081	computer vision;simulation;speech recognition;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;biomechanics;machine learning;mathematics;physiology;public domain software	Robotics	12.22832042461538	-92.55444690189016	28337

In this paper we have analysed a wide list of Phonocardiogram (PCG) features in time and frequency domain along with morphological and statistical features to construct a robust and discriminative feature set for dataset-agnostic classification of normal and cardiac patients. The large and open access database, made available in Physionet 2016 challenge was used for feature selection, internal validation and creation of training models. A second dataset of 41 PCG segments, collected using our in-house smart phone based digital stethoscope from an Indian hospital was used for performance evaluation. Our proposed methodology yielded sensitivity and specificity scores of 0.76 and 0.75 respectively on the test dataset in classifying cardiovascular diseases. The methodology also outperformed three popular prior art approaches, when applied on the same dataset.	cardiovascular diseases;classification;demography;feature extraction;feature selection;heart diseases;heart sounds;heart failure;large;modal logic;numerous;patients;penicillin g;performance evaluation;phonocardiogram;polycomb-group proteins;srgn gene;sensitivity and specificity;silo (dataset);smartphone;stethoscopes;test set;algorithm	Rohan Banerjee;Anirban Dutta Choudhury;Parijat Deshpande;Sakyajit Bhattacharya;Arpan Pal;K.

Though physiological sensing devices and self-care applications support that, sensing devices of most existing mobile healthcare systems are very expensive and the service only provides basic notification about a patient's condition. In this paper we propose a mobile self-care system using voice and facial images. The system consists of a health monitoring module and a symptom checking module. In the system emotion, age and gender information are acquired automatically by using distributed computing-based server-side multimodal emotion, age, and gender recognition system using voice and facial images. The user is then able to use their own voice and face effectively for wellness self-management.

9a0b42b4f4843261ed68c06e5ca7808cfd3ee05b	analysis of music/speech via integration of audio content and functional brain response	g400 computer science;c800 psychology;multi view learning;fmri;fmri measured feature;journal;期刊论文;audio analysis	A novel music/speech analysis framework via integration of audio content and functional brain response.Brain response features are derived from fMRI data when participants are listening to the music/speech.A novel regression algorithm named ITGP is proposed to improve the quality in predicting functional brain response. Effective analysis of music/speech data such as clustering, retrieval, and classification has received significant attention in recent years. Traditional methods mainly rely on the low-level acoustic features derived from digital audio stream, and the accuracy of these methods is limited by the well-known semantic gap. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework for music/speech clustering, retrieval, and classification by integrating the low-level acoustic features derived from audio content with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measured features that represent the brain's functional response when subjects are listening to the music/speech excerpts. First, the brain networks and regions of interest (ROIs) involved in the comprehension of audio stimuli, such as the auditory, emotion, attention, and working memory systems, are located by a new approach named dense individualized and common connectivity-based cortical landmarks (DICCCOLs). Then the functional connectivity matrix measuring the similarity between the fMRI signals of different ROIs is adopted to represent the brain's comprehension of audio semantics. Afterwards, we propose an improved twin Gaussian process (ITGP) model based on self-training to predict the fMRI-measured features of testing data without fMRI scanning. Finally, multi-view learning algorithms are proposed to integrate acoustic features with fMRI-measured features for music/speech clustering, retrieval, and classification, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed work in comparison with existing methods and suggest the advantage of integrating functional brain responses via fMRI data for music/speech analysis.

1afc24a5d46948b9ff7797e9010ed2e9c345b0e4	estimation of ssvep-based eeg complexity using inherent fuzzy entropy		This study considers the dynamic changes of complexity feature by fuzzy entropy measurement and repetitive steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) stimulus. Since brain complexity reflects the ability of the brain to adapt to changing situations, we suppose such adaptation is closely related to the habituation, a form of learning in which an organism decreases or increases to respond to a stimulus after repeated presentations. By a wearable electroencephalograph (EEG) with Fpz and Oz electrodes, EEG signals were collected from 20 healthy participants in one resting and five-times 15 Hz SSVEP sessions. Moreover, EEG complexity feature was extracted by multi-scale Inherent Fuzzy Entropy (IFE) algorithm, and relative complexity (RC) was defined the difference between resting and SSVEP. Our results showed the enhanced frontal and occipital RC was accompanied with increased stimulus times. Compared with the 1st SSVEP session, the RC was significantly higher than the 5th SSVEP session at frontal and occipital areas (p < 0.05). It suggested that brain has adapted to changes in stimulus influence, and possibly connected with the habituation. In conclusion, effective evaluation of IFE has a potential EEG signature of complexity in the SSEVP-based experiment.	algorithm;electroencephalography;steady state;wearable computer	Zehong Cao;Mukesh Prasad;Chin-Teng Lin	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015730	fuzzy logic;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evoked potential;computer science;stimulus (physiology);electroencephalography;habituation	Robotics	13.756089226741116	-91.40404094250277	28717

Although this procedure has been applied in a great amount of studies both with healthy and pathological populations, the reliability of such FC estimates is unknown, and this impairs the use of resting-state MEG FC at the individual level. In this study, the test-retest reliability of MEG resting FC was evaluated by exploring both within- and between-subject variability in FC in 16 healthy subjects who underwent three resting-state MEG scans. FC was computed after beamforming source reconstruction with four popular FC metrics: phase-locking value (PLV), phase lag index (PLI), direct envelope correlation (d-ecor), and envelope correlation with leakage correction (lc-ecor). Then, test-restest reliability and within- and between-subject agreement were evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kendall's W, respectively. Reliability was found to depend on the FC metric, the frequency band, and the specific link. As a general trend, greater test-retest reliability was found for PLV in theta to gamma, and for lc-ecor and d-ecor in beta. Further inspection of the ICC distribution revealed that volume conduction effects could be contributing to high ICC in PLV and d-ecor. In addition, stronger links were found to be more reliable. Overall, this encourages the further use of resting-state MEG FC for individual-level studies, especially with PLV or envelope correlation metrics.	algorithm;bands;beamforming;blast phase;cdisc sdtm respiratory test name terminology;coefficient;coefficient;correlation study;dec alpha;estimated;extravasation;frequency band;functional gastrointestinal disorders;futures studies;gamma correction;heart rate variability;interphase cell;lock (computer science);magnetoencephalography;magnetoencephalography;map;pl/i;population;rest;resting state fmri;serpinf2 gene;serpinf2 wt allele;stmn1 gene;spatial variability;spectral leakage;test-retest reliability;two-phase locking;verilog;weight;algorithm	Pilar Garcés;María Carmen Martín-Buro;Fernando Maestú	2016	Brain connectivity	10.1089/brain.2015.0416	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	19.840709177326595	-80.58263900313821	28748

We aim to provide quantitative functions or conditions with a clearly distinguishable behavior during the ictal-postictal transition. Spectral methods were used to analyze foramen ovale electrodes (FOE) recordings during the ictal/postictal transition in 31 seizures of 15 patients with strictly unilateral drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, density of links, spectral entropy, and relative spectral power were analyzed. Partial simple seizures are accompanied by an ipsilateral increase in the relative Delta power and a decrease in synchronization in a 66% and 91% of the cases, respectively, after seizures offset. Complex partial seizures showed a decrease in the spectral entropy in 94% of cases, both ipsilateral and contralateral sides (100% and 73%, respectively) mainly due to an increase of relative Delta activity. Seizure offset is defined as the moment at which the “seizure termination mechanisms” actually end, which is quantified in the spectral entropy value. We propose as a definition for the postictal start the time when the ipsilateral SE reaches the first global minimum.	acoustic lobing;electroencephalography;maxima and minima;operational definition	Ancor Sanz-García;Lorena Vega-Zelaya;Jesús Pastor;Rafael G.

bfea047de9a37425a043492ef5162c7e3f21c510	desarrollo de una bci utilizando el potencial p300 y la diadema mindwave®		In this paper we propose a recording, processing and classification scheme for a spelling Brain-Computer Interface application based on the P300 potential and the electroencephalography (EEG) device Mindwave-NeuroSky®; this device has only one EEG recording channel and is currently the most affordable in the market for this purpose. Open access software Openvibe was chosen for signal recording, and Matlab scripts were written for signal analysis and classification, the latter being based on Linear Discrimant Analysis (LDA). Five test subjects were exposed to several spelling sessions each, in which different acquisition and stimulation parameters were varied to evaluate the effects in character identification. Those parameters were the number of repetitions of the stimulation sequence of the speller character matrix (r=8, 12), the type of character sequence (chosen randomly of beforehand), and the EEG recording site (Pz or Oz). The subjects achieved, an average performance of 45% correct row and column identifications. In comparison, a very recent work in which 64 EEG channels were acquired, and a complex classification and feature extraction scheme was used, they achieved an average of 90.4% correct character identifications. The MindWave-Neurosky® headset was not designed for application in BCI systems. However, by looking at the results in this work, its application for BCI it seems feasible when thinking of combining the proposed approach with some word prediction scheme based on the context of the spelled phrase.	best, worst and average case;brain–computer interface;cellular automaton;discriminant;electroencephalography;feature extraction;headset (audio);linear algebra;matlab;randomness;signal processing;unique name assumption	Sergio René Vivar Vera;María Antonieta Abud-Figueroa;Gabriel Rodríguez Vásquez;Ulises Juárez-Martínez;Silvestre Gustavo Peláez-Camarena;Jorge Airy Mercado Gutiérrez;Josefina Gutiérrez-Martínez	2017	Research in Computing Science			ML	13.033952775817676	-94.86194520426282	28813
069e0d2bccfa83f7a72dc3f58085eed84583fa9e	woody: a post-process method for smartphone-based activity recognition		In the past decade, the rapid popularization of smartphone has provided a promising direction for human activity recognition. Despite identifying a variety of movements without any complicated wearable device, the smartphone-based activity recognition is still deeply affected by the differences between users and phone locations. To overcome this problem, post-process attempts to correct the errors in the classified activity sequence. In consideration of both the activity sequence continuity and the recognition result confidence, we propose WOODY, a novel post-process method that locates and corrects the errors in a classified activity sequence just like Woody Woodpecker pecking holes to catch the pests. In our method, the recognition result is considered as the weighted observation state, and a weighted observation hidden Markov model (WOHMM) is built to model the classified activity sequence. Consequently, a sequence labeling algorithm of the WOHMM is also designed to modify those recognition results with low confidence. To validate the effectiveness of WOODY, we make a series of contrast experiments on two public data sets collected from real scenarios. The results show that WOODY is not only able to improve the recognition accuracy but also significantly enhance the robustness.	activity recognition;algorithm;experiment;hidden markov model;information privacy;markov chain;scott continuity;sequence labeling;smartphone;wearable technology	Changhai Wang;Yuwei Xu;Hui Liang;Wanwei Huang;Ling Zhang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866872	robustness (computer science);sequence labeling;support vector machine;feature extraction;wearable computer;computer science;distributed computing;hidden markov model;activity recognition;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;data set	Vision	4.780626398770415	-84.78655255029774	28836

A principled analysis of the SOP can serve as a foundation for answering questions of fundamental importance in basic neuroscience and sleep medicine. Unfortunately, current methods for analyzing the SOP fail to account for the overwhelming evidence that the wake/sleep transition is governed by continuous, dynamic physiological processes. Instead, current practices coarsely discretize sleep both in terms of state, where it is viewed as a binary (wake or sleep) process, and in time, where it is viewed as a single time point derived from subjectively scored stages in 30-second epochs, effectively eliminating SOP dynamics from the analysis. These methods also fail to integrate information from both behavioral and physiological data. It is thus imperative to resolve the mismatch between the physiological evidence and analysis methodologies. In this paper, we develop a statistically and physiologically principled dynamic framework and empirical SOP model, combining simultaneously-recorded physiological measurements with behavioral data from a novel breathing task requiring no arousing external sensory stimuli. We fit the model using data from healthy subjects, and estimate the instantaneous probability that a subject is awake during the SOP. The model successfully tracked physiological and behavioral dynamics for individual nights, and significantly outperformed the instantaneous transition models implicit in clinical definitions of sleep onset. Our framework also provides a principled means for cross-subject data alignment as a function of wake probability, allowing us to characterize and compare SOP dynamics across different populations. This analysis enabled us to quantitatively compare the EEG of subjects showing reduced alpha power with the remaining subjects at identical response probabilities. Thus, by incorporating both physiological and behavioral dynamics into our model framework, the dynamics of our analyses can finally match those observed during the SOP.	data structure alignment;discretize;electroencephalography;imperative programming;neuroscience discipline;onset (audio);physiological processes;population;probability;score;sleep apnea syndromes;source of payment typology;standard operating procedure list;wake (cipher);wake-sleep algorithm;wakefulness	Michael J.

2bd1e63fcffa7ddaf079a387730215931ee294f2	automated ibeacon-based community detection: a data-driven approach		In this paper, we address the detection of face-to-face social interactions between people using unobtrusive, wearable iBeacon devices, as well as the determination of groups and communities that these individuals form. This is a challenging problem since this type of sensor data is very noisy, often incomplete with many missing values, and easily perturbed by motion and nearby obstacles, especially in very dynamic indoor environments. The key idea of our approach is to transform the original noisy sensor data into specific feature vectors by a series of statistical methods designed to overcome the challenges in the data. These features vectors, reflecting the interaction between people, are then clustered to reveal communities without the need to rely on localization information or pre-defined interaction models and parameters. Our data-driven approach provides robust community detection that is not sensitive to noise and missing signals, and automatically captures the dynamic interaction between people. Our approach is scalable for application in real-time.		Jeongran Lee;Ahmet A.

3af64d6055a9f65e5680aae765953c521c371271	high-level speech event analysis for cognitive load classification		The Cognitive Load (CL) refers to the load imposed on an individual’s cognitive system when performing a given task, and is usually associated with the limitations of the human working memory. Stress, fatigue, lower ability to make decisions and perceptual narrowing are induced by cognitive overload which occurs when too much information has to be processed. As many physiological measures and for a nonintrusive measurement, speech features have been investigated in order to find reliable indicators of CL levels. In this paper, we have investigated high-level speech events automatically detected using the CMU-Sphinx toolkit for speech recognition. Temporal events (speech onset latency, event starting timecodes, pause and phone segments) were extracted from the speech transcriptions (phoneme, word, silent pause, filled pause, breathing). Seven audio feature sets related to the speech events were designed and assessed. Three-class SVM classifiers (Low, Medium and High level) were developed and assessed on the CSLE (Cognitive-Load with Speech and EGG) databases provided for the Interspeech'2014 Cognitive Load Sub-Challenge. These experiments have shown an improvement of 1.5 % on the Test set compared to the official baseline Unweighted Average Recall (UAR).	artificial intelligence;baseline (configuration management);cognitive science;database;experiment;high- and low-level;onset (audio);speech recognition;sphinx4;test set	Claude Montacié;Marie-José Caraty	2014			voice activity detection;natural language processing;audio mining;speech recognition;computer science	NLP	-0.9651108897655142	-87.60224077365886	29585

Considering a heteroscedastic binary classification setup, this method extracts the spatio-spectral features whose variance is maximized for one brain task and minimized for the other task. Therefore, our method can be considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. In comparison to the similar solutions in the literature, such as filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) method, the proposed method benefits from joint processing of both spatial and spectral features, which improves the overall performance of the BCI while reducing its computational cost. Furthermore, our algorithm provides a simple measure that allows for ranking the discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features, which is not possible in FBCSP method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms FBCSP for both raw EEG and preprocessed EEG data.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;binary classification;brain–computer interface;computation;data pre-processing;discriminant;electroencephalography;filter bank	Amirhossein S.

The methods are tailored for brain-computer interfacing, where fast and accurate detection is of vital importance for achieving high information transfer rates. High detection accuracy using short time segments is obtained by finding combinations of electrode signals that cancel strong interference signals in the EEG data. Data from a test group consisting of 10 subjects are used to evaluate the new methods and to compare them to standard techniques. Using 1-s signal segments, six different visual stimulation frequencies could be discriminated with an average classification accuracy of 84%.

9f555a9bbc2e7cc97ce9b72ec9b43dbe3882c930	continuous user authentication using smartwatch motion sensor data		Smartwatches, which contain an accelerometer and gyroscope, have recently been used to implement gait/activity-based biometrics. However, many research questions have not been addressed in the prior work such as the training and test data was collected in the same day from a limited dataset, using unrealistic activities (e.g., punch) and/or the authors did not carry out any particular study to identify the most discriminative features. This paper aims to highlight the impact of these factors on the biometric performance. The acceleration and gyroscope data of the gait and game activity was captured from 60 users over multiple days, which resulted in a totally of 24 h of the user’s movement. Segment-based approach was used to divide the time-series acceleration and gyroscope data. When the cross-day evaluation was applied, the best obtained EER was 0.69%, and 4.54% for the walking and game activities respectively. The EERs were significantly reduced into 0.05% and 2.35% for the above activities by introducing the majority voting schema. These results were obtained by utilizing a novel feature selection process in which the system minimizing the number of features and maximizing the discriminative information. The results have shown that smartwatch-based activity recognition has significant potential to recognize individuals in a continuous and user friendly approach.	authentication;motion detector;smartwatch	Neamah Al-Naffakh;Nathan L.

Subcutaneous glucose profiles are characterised by a strong non-stationarity, which limits the application of correlation-spectral analysis. We derived an index of linear predictability by calculating the autocorrelation function of time series increments and applied detrended fluctuation analysis to assess the non-stationarity of the profiles. Time series from volunteers with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and from control subjects were analysed. The results suggest that in control subjects, blood glucose variation is relatively uncorrelated, and this variation could be modelled as a random walk with no retention of 'memory' of previous values. In diabetes, variation is both greater and smoother, with retention of inter-dependence between neighbouring values. Essential components for adequate longer term prediction were identified via a decomposition of time series into a slow trend and responses to external stimuli. Implications for diabetes management are discussed.	autocorrelation;blood glucose;detrended fluctuation analysis;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent;nsa product types;quantum fluctuation;stationary process;time series	N.

The method uses a support vector machine classifier, trained from sensor-based data from a datalogging platform installed on the PW. Data from a 3D accelerometer positioned on the back of the PW were collected in a laboratory space during PW driving tasks. 16-segmented events and driving activities (i.e. impacts from different side on different objects, rolling down or up on incline surface, going across threshold of different height) were performed repeatedly (n=25 trials) by one operator at three different speeds (slow, normal, high). We present results from an experiment aiming to classify five different events and driving activities from the sensor data acquired using the datalogging platform. Classification results show the ability of the proposed method to reliably segment 100% of events, and to identify the correct event type in 80% of events.	eighty;experiment;hl7 2.5 event type;physical object;power (psychology);sensor;statistical classification;support vector machine;tight binding;accelerometers;biologic segmentation;collision;motorized wheelchair	Athena K.

In this study, we explored the integrity of connecting networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and two whole-brain voxel-based methods: statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).   METHODS Thirty-three consecutive patients with mTLE and HS undergoing presurgical evaluation were scanned at 3 T, a DTI data set was acquired and parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated. Twenty-one patients had left hippocampal sclerosis (LHS) and 12 patients had right HS (RHS). These groups were compared to 37 normal control subjects using both SPM5 and TBSS.   RESULTS The ipsilateral temporal lobe showed widespread FA reduction in both groups. The limbic system was clearly abnormal in the LHS group, also involving the arcuate fasciculus. In RHS, changes were more restricted but also showed involvement of the contralateral temporal and inferior frontal lobe. Increased MD was found in the ipsilateral hippocampus by SPM that was only marginally detected by TBSS. In white matter regions, however, TBSS was more sensitive to changes than SPM.   CONCLUSION DTI detects extensive changes in mTLE with HS. The affected networks were principally in the ipsilateral temporal lobe and the limbic system but also the arcuate fasciculus. SPM and TBSS gave complementary information with higher sensitivity to FA changes using TBSS.	acoustic lobing;diffuse cerebral sclerosis of schilder;diffusion tensor imaging;epilepsies, partial;epilepsy;epilepsy, temporal lobe;focal (programming language);fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;hippocampus (brain);limbic system;molecular dynamics;multiple sclerosis discovery forum;patients;scanning;spatial analysis;star catalogue;super paper mario;tract (literature);tuberous sclerosis;voxel;white matter	Niels K.

c5fdfc8c2a0c62a8c05afe486ca76a715827ad54	abnormal gait detection in surveillance videos with fft-based analysis on walking rhythm		For abnormal gait detection in surveillance videos, the existing methods suffer from that they are unable to recognize novel types of anomalies if the corresponding prototypes have not been included in the training data for supervised machine learning but it is impractical to foresee all types of anomalies. This research aims to solve the problem in an unsupervised manner, which does not rely on any prior knowledge regarding abnormal prototypes and avoids time-consuming machine learning over large-scale high-dimensional features. The intuition is that normal gait is nearly periodic signal and anomalies may disturb such periodicity. Hence, the time-varying ratio of width to height of a walking person is transformed to frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and the standard deviation over spectrum is used as an indicator of anomalies, subject to any sudden change to break the normally periodical walking rhythm. The experimental results demonstrate its precision.	fast fourier transform	Anqin Zhang;Su Yang;Xinfeng Zhang;Jiulong Zhang;Weishan Zhang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-71607-7_10	pattern recognition;periodic function;artificial intelligence;computer vision;frequency domain;fast fourier transform;gait;rhythm;standard deviation;computer science;unsupervised learning;intuition	Vision	-2.806862749405246	-94.77123432073057	30207

In order to extend the capacity of microPET to quantify neuroreceptors in rat brain, we carried out studies of 2-[F]F-A-85380 to measure the apparent binding potential BP* in individual rats, which were studied repeatedly over several months. Using a bolus-plus-infusion paradigm, 2-[F]FA-85380 (specific activity 20–1300 GBq/μmol) was administered intravenously over 8 to 9 h with Kbol values of 350 to 440 min and a mean infusion rate of 0.03±0.01 nmol/kg/h. Studies included a 2-h nicotine infusion initiated 2 h before the end of scanning to displace specifically bound radioactivity. Steady state binding in brain was obtained within 5 h as defined by the occurrence of constant radioactivity concentrations in brain regions and constant, free arterial plasma levels of nonmetabolized radioligand. BP* averages (±SEM) for thalamus, forebrain, and cerebellum were 5.9±0.7, 2.6±0.4, and 1.0±0.1, respectively, which are consistent with the α4β2* nAChR distribution in rat brain measured in vitro. Studies of receptor occupancy determined the ED50 to be 0.29 nmol/kg/h. The demonstration that α4β2* nAChRs are quantifiable in the rat brain using PET measurements, coupled with the ability to conduct longitudinal studies over several months in the same rats, suggests potential applications to studies of chronic nicotine use, its treatment, and abnormal functioning of α4β2* receptors in a rat model.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) at different intensities on energy expenditure (oxygen and calories) in healthy adults. The secondary aim was to develop a generalized linear regression (GEE) model to predict the increase of energy expenditure facilitated by NMES and identify factors (NMES stimulation intensity level, age, body mass index, weight, body fat percentage, waist/hip ratio, and gender) associated with this NMES-induced increase of energy expenditure. Forty sedentary healthy adults (18 males and 22 females) participated. NMES was given at the following stimulation intensities for 10 minutes each: sensory level (E1), motor threshold (E2), and maximal intensity comfortably tolerated (E3). Cardiopulmonary gas exchange was evaluated during rest, NMES, and recovery stage. The results revealed that NMES at E2 and E3 significantly increased energy expenditure and the energy expenditure at recovery stage was still significantly higher than baseline. The GEE model demonstrated that a linear dose-response relationship existed between the stimulation intensity and the increase of energy expenditure. No subject's demographic or anthropometric characteristics tested were significantly associated with the increase of energy expenditure. This study suggested NMES may be used to serve as an additional intervention for weight loss programs. Future studies to develop electrical stimulators or stimulation electrodes to maximize the comfort of NMES are recommended.	anthropometry;baseline (configuration management);body mass index;cardiovascular diseases;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;electric stimulation technique;energy metabolism;epilepsy, generalized;estradiol;functional electrical stimulation;generalized linear model;health promotion;how much distress weight loss;how often weight loss;human body weight;maximal set;neuromuscular electrical stimulation;nutrition, calories;oxygen;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;protein-energy malnutrition;weight reduction programs;electrode	Miao-Ju Hsu;Shun-Hwa Wei;Yaju Chang	2011		10.3390/s110201932	young adult;respiration;health	HCI	16.064821451871474	-82.54151114205375	30362
2fb72142757403d76d4552fd5420e61b06acbd04	an exercise health simulation method based on integrated human thermophysiological model		Research of healthy exercise has garnered a keen research for the past few years. It is known that participation in a regular exercise program can help improve various aspects of cardiovascular function and reduce the risk of suffering from illness. But some exercise accidents like dehydration, exertional heatstroke, and even sudden death need to be brought to attention. If these exercise accidents can be analyzed and predicted before they happened, it will be beneficial to alleviate or avoid disease or mortality. To achieve this objective, an exercise health simulation approach is proposed, in which an integrated human thermophysiological model consisting of human thermal regulation model and a nonlinear heart rate regulation model is reported. The human thermoregulatory mechanism as well as the heart rate response mechanism during exercise can be simulated. On the basis of the simulated physiological indicators, a fuzzy finite state machine is constructed to obtain the possible health transition sequence and predict the exercise health status. The experiment results show that our integrated exercise thermophysiological model can numerically simulate the thermal and physiological processes of the human body during exercise and the predicted exercise health transition sequence from finite state machine can be used in healthcare.

Pulpitis and apical periodontitis were induced by pulp exposure and contamination by the oral flora in the premolar teeth of six mongrel dogs, comprising four experimental groups (36 root canals). In a control group, measured lengths of teeth with uninfected pulps were performed on the first experimental day (44 root canals). In all animals the ERCLMs were performed on teeth with healthy pulps, and at the end of the experimental period (20, 35, 50 and 65 days) following pulp exposure. The point of measuring canal lengths was the anatomical obstacle above the apical delta. Electronically measured lengths (EML) were compared between each other and with the root canal length established by tactile-sense measurement verified radiographically. The EMLs were less accurate in teeth with healthy pulps and teeth with pulpitis in the third experimental group (dif = 2.27 × 2.65 mm2; t test, p < 0.05), while they were most precise after 65 days in teeth with completely necrotic pulp and established chronic apical periodontitis (dif = 0.54 × 1.36 mm2; t test, p > 0.05). These results suggest that the state of the pulp and periapical tissue may have an influence on the ERCLM.	canis familiaris;dental pulp necrosis;emotion markup language;experiment;mongrel;odontogenic tissue;oral microbiome;pnma2 gene;periapical periodontitis;periodontal ligament;plant roots;pulp canals;pulpitis;structure of periapical tissue;tooth root structure;chronic apical periodontitis;permanent premolar tooth;t test	Maja Kovacevic;Tomislav Tamarut;Snjezana Glavicic;Nives Jonjic;Sanja Zoricic-Cvek;Dragica Bobinac	2006	Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing	10.1007/s11517-006-0076-7	medicine;orthodontics;mathematics;dentistry;anatomy;scientific control;statistics	SE	23.586653428668356	-85.27926877819638	30507

Hence, assessment tools are needed to study this physical activity in free-living conditions. Wearable motion sensing technology is used to assess physical activity. However, there is a lack of harmonisation of validation protocols and applied statistics, which make it hard to compare available and future studies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to formulate recommendations for assessing the validity of sensor-based activity monitoring in older persons with focus on the measurement of body postures and movements. Validation studies of body-worn devices providing parameters on body postures and movements were identified and summarized and an extensive inter-active process between authors resulted in recommendations about: information on the assessed persons, the technical system, and the analysis of relevant parameters of physical activity, based on a standardized and semi-structured protocol. The recommended protocols can be regarded as a first attempt to standardize validity studies in the area of monitoring physical activity.	body position;exercise;futures studies;movement;physical symbol system;protocols documentation;recommender system;semiconductor industry;wearable computer	Ulrich Lindemann;Wiebren Zijlstra;Kamiar Aminian;Sebastien F.

A continuous monitoring of f-ECG, for example using the technologies already applied for adults ECG tele-monitoring (e.g., Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs)), may increase early detection of fetal arrhythmias. In this study, we propose a novel framework, based on compressive sensing (CS) theory, for the compression and joint detection/classification of mother and fetal heart beats. Methods: Our scheme is based on the sparse representation of the components derived from independent component analysis (ICA), which we propose to apply directly in the compressed domain. Detection and classification is based on the activated atoms in a specifically designed reconstruction dictionary. Results : Validation of the proposed compression and detection framework has been done on two publicly available datasets, showing promising results (sensitivity S = 92.5%, P += 92%, F1 = 92.2% for the Silesia dataset and S = 78%, P += 77%, F1 = 77.5% for the Challenge dataset A, with average reconstruction quality PRD = 8.5% and PRD = 7.5%, respectively). Conclusion: The experiments confirm that the proposed framework may be used for compression of abdominal f-ECG and to obtain real-time information of the fHR, providing a suitable solution for real time, very low-power f-ECG monitoring. Significance: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a framework for the low-power CS compression of fetal abdominal ECG is proposed combined with a beat detector for an fHR estimation.	calcium-sensing receptor;compressed sensing;compression;detectors;dictionary [publication type];early diagnosis;electrocardiography;experiment;fetal diseases;fetal heart;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;low-power broadcasting;product requirements document;real-time clock;real-time data;silo (dataset);sparse approximation;sparse matrix;television	Giulia Da Poian;Riccardo Bernardini;Roberto Rinaldo	2016	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2493726	electronic engineering;speech recognition;sparse matrix;computer science;engineering;sensor;noise;mathematics;biological engineering;compressed sensing;physics	Vision	19.028711590729184	-88.70496066666223	30790

Pressure ulcers cost between $9.1 to 11.6 billion a year in the United States. Each individual pressure can cost from $20,900 to $151,700 per pressure ulcer. Wheelchair users with spinal cord injury have a higher risk of developing pressure ulcers due to limited mobility and the countless hours they spend in the wheelchair, exerting pressure on the points of interface between the bony structure and the wheelchair cushion. The areas of interface that are under prolonged pressure lack blood flow, causing the tissue to breakdown, leading to a decubitus or pressure ulcer. Approximately 28.9 % wheelchair users in communities, 27% in nursing homes, and between 5 and 30% of hospitalized patients develop pressure sores. Nearly 70% of elderly patients develop pressure ulcers, which in turn significantly increase the healthcare management and costs and can be a cause of pain, discomfort, loss of independence and mobility in not only the elderly but also the younger patients. Mobile technology can be exploited to provide a technological solution to preventing pressure ulcers. An app was designed and developed to notify, walk through the process of weight shifting and also track the movements of the patient performing weight shifting using the accelerometer. The app was tested to find that the forward lean movements can be tracked accurately using the accelerometer but the lateral movements although tracked could not verify that the weight shifting was correctly performed. In order to fix this issue the pressure map is used as an additional sensor to track and monitor the weight shifting accurately. This paper discusses the design and development of the app in two phases.	lateral thinking	Arshia A. Khan;Michael Reuter;Nam Phung;Syed S.

Twelve weeks after bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) and sham operation (sham), all animals were randomly divided into four groups: group OVX, group OVX + β-TCP, group sham, and group sham + β-TCP, then all rats underwent bone defect in the bilateral distal femurs, and β-TCP were implanted into critical-sized defects for group OVX + β-TCP and group sham + β-TCP. After defect operation, all animals were received following subcutaneous injections with PTH (60 μg/kg, three times a week) until death at 4 and 8 weeks. The defected area in distal femurs of rats was harvested for evaluation by histology, micro-CT, and biomechanics. The results of our study show that systemic usage of PTH or local usage of β-TCP can increase the healing of defects in OVX or sham rats. Furthermore, treatments with PTH and β-TCP showed a stronger effect on accelerating the local bone formation than used alone. Osteoporosis can limit the function of PTH and/or β-TCP. The results from our study demonstrate that combination of PTH and β-TCP had an additive effect on local bone formation in non-osteoporosis and/or osteoporosis rats.	adrenergic beta-antagonists;bilateral filter;bilateral oophorectomy;bone tissue;cessation of life;femur;gonadorelin;implants;kohn–sham equations;osteogenesis;osteoporosis;ovariectomy;parathyroid hormone;randomness;software bug;utility functions on indivisible goods;beta thalassemia;tricalcium phosphate	Zhoushan Tao;Kai-kai Tu;Zheng-Liang Huang;Qiang Zhou;Tao Sun;Hong-Ming Xu;Yu-Long Zhou;Yang-Xun Lv;Wei Cui;Lei Yang	2015	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-015-1402-8	endocrinology;anatomy;surgery	HCI	21.610727526821425	-81.98096395880502	31001

By identifying neural features underlying movement parameters, a detailed and well defined control command set can be provided to the BCI output device. A continuous control to the output device is better suited for practical BCI systems, and can be achieved by continuous reconstruction of movement trajectory than discrete brain activity classifications. In this study, we attempt to reconstruct/estimate various parameters of hand movement trajectory from multi channel EEG recordings. The data for analysis is collected by performing an experiment that involved centre-out right hand movement tasks in four different directions at two different speeds in random order. Multiple linear regression (MLR) strategy that fits the recorded movement parameters to a set of spatial, spectral and temporal localized neural data set is adopted. We propose a method to define the predictor set for MLR, using wavelet analysis, to decompose the signal into various sub bands. The correlation between recorded and estimated parameters are calculated and an average correlation coefficient of (0.56 ± 0.16) is obtained over estimating six movement parameters. The promising results achieved using the proposed algorithm, which are better than that of the existing algorithms, indicate the applicability of EEG for continuous motor control.	algorithm;brain–computer interface;coefficient;computer;electroencephalography;fits;kerrison predictor;kinesiology;learning to rank;mobile robot;output device;wavelet	Neethu Robinson;A.

The proposed method is based on the principle component analysis known also as the Karhunen–Loéve transform. Features frequently used in the sleep stage classification studies were divided into three main groups: (i) time-domain features, (ii) frequency-domain features, and (iii) hybrid features. That how well features in each group separate the sleep stages was determined by performing extensive simulations and it was seen that the results obtained are in agreement with those available in the literature. Considering the fact that sleep stage classification algorithms consist of two steps, namely feature extraction and classification, it will be possible to tell a priori whether the classification step will provide successful results or not without carrying out its realization thanks to the proposed method.	algorithm;bonjour sleep proxy;electroencephalography;feature extraction;feature vector;largest;principal component analysis;simulation;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep stages;statistical classification	Cabir Vural;Murat Yildiz	2008	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-008-9218-9	speech recognition;feature extraction;time domain;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;frequency domain;principal component analysis	Web+IR	16.7240785610405	-90.93025751714693	31137

The framework uses nonlinear ECG dynamic models formulated to represent noisy ECG signal. The advantage of the models is the ability to capture distinct ECG features used for biometric recognition such as temporal and amplitude distances between PQRST points. Moreover the inherent modeling of additive noise provides robust recognition. Log-likelihood scoring is proposed for classification. The algorithm is evaluated on identification task on 13 subjects of MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database using single lead data. Identification rate of 87.50% is achieved on 30s test recordings of normal beat. Experimental results using artificial additive white noise show that the model is robust to noise for SNR level above 20dB.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;biometrics;bounding interval hierarchy;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical classification;utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Chee-Ming Ting;Sheikh Hussain Shaikh Salleh	2010	10th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA 2010)	10.1109/ISSPA.2010.5605516	kalman filter;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning	Robotics	20.076092744179146	-90.56174707347616	31175
b6406e13391538a068eff22ba7e00d97ee2063fe	comparison of three databases with a decision tree approach in the medical field of acute appendicitis.	acute abdominal pain;medical informatics;acute appendicitis;machine learning;decision trees	Decision trees have been successfully used for years in many medical decision making applications. Transparent representation of acquired knowledge and fast algorithms made decision trees one of the most often used symbolic machine learning approaches. This paper concentrates on the problem of separating acute appendicitis, which is a special problem of acute abdominal pain from other diseases that cause acute abdominal pain by use of an decision tree approach. Early and accurate diagnosing of acute appendicitis is still a difficult and challenging problem in everyday clinical routine. An important factor in the error rate is poor discrimination between acute appendicitis and other diseases that cause acute abdominal pain. This error rate is still high, despite considerable improvements in history-taking and clinical examination, computer-aided decision-support and special investigation, such as ultrasound. We investigated three different large databases with cases of acute abdominal pain to complete this task as successful as possible. The results show that the size of the database does not necessary directly influence the success of the decision tree built on it. Surprisingly we got the best results from the decision trees built on the smallest and the biggest database, where the database with medium size (relative to the other two) was not so successful. Despite that we were able to produce decision tree classifiers that were capable of producing correct decisions on test data sets with accuracy up to 84%, sensitivity to acute appendicitis up to 90%, and specificity up to 80% on the same test set.	aap;acetaminophen;acute abdominal pain;acute appendicitis nos (disorder);aspartate transaminase;bilateral filter;bit error rate;computer science;decision tree;eighty;email;leukemia, myelocytic, acute;machine learning;medical decision making;ninety nine;published database;sensitivity and specificity;test data;test set;time complexity;trees (plant);algorithm	Milan Zorman;Hans-Peter Eich;Peter Kokol;Christian Ohmann	2001	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-928-8-1414	intensive care medicine;medical emergency;surgery	ML	23.6532267224884	-88.05027017646977	31208

The deficiency in glucose counter-regulation may even lead to severe hypoglycaemia. It is always threatening to the well-being of patients with T1DM since more severe hypoglycemia leads to seizures or loss of consciousness and the possible development of permanent brain dysfunction under certain circumstances. Thus, an accurate early detection on hypoglycemia is an important research topic. With the use of new emerging technology, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based hypoglycemia detection system is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemic episodes. From a clinical study of 16 children with T1DM, natural occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes are associated with increased heart rates (p <; 0.06) and increased corrected QT intervals (p <; 0.001). The overall data were organized into a training set with 8 patients (320 data points) and a testing set with 8 patients (269 data points). By using the ELM trained feed-forward neural network (ELM-FFNN), the testing sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) for detection of hypoglycemia is 78 and 60% respectability.	angular defect;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cerebral dysfunction;consciousness;data point;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent;elm;feedforward neural network;glucose;hypoglycaemic episode;hypoglycemia;hypoglycemic agents;learning disorders;patients;permanent brain;real-time clock;seizures;sensitivity and specificity;test set;whole earth 'lectronic link;heart rate	Phyo Phyo San;Sai-Ho Ling;Soe Ni Ni;Hung T.

MMGdi signals were acquired with a capacitive accelerometer placed between 7th and 8th intercostal spaces, on the right anterior axillary line, during a maintained inspiratory pressure test. Subjects were asked to maintain a constant inspiratory pressure with a mouthpiece connected to a closed tube (without breathing). This maneuver was repeated at five different contraction efforts: apnea (no effort), 20 cmH2O, 40 cmH2O, 60 cmH2O and maximum voluntary contraction. An adaptive noise canceller (ANC) using the RLS algorithm was applied on the MMGdi signals. To evaluate the behavior of the ANC, the MMGdi signals were analyzed in two segments: with and without cardiac interference (WCI and NCI, respectively). In both segments it was analyzed the power spectral density (PSD), and the ARV and RMS amplitude parameters for each contraction effort. With the proposed ANC algorithm the amplitude parameters of the WCI segments were reduced to a level similar to the one of the NCI segments. The obtained results showed that ANC using the RLS algorithm allows to significantly reduce the cardiac interference in MMGdi signals.	adaptive filter;apnea;centimeters of water;inspiration function;interference (communication);least-squares analysis;nc (complexity);noise-induced hearing loss;peritoneal stomata;recursion;recursive least squares filter;restless legs syndrome;root mean square;spectral density;structure of intercostal space;wiki conference india;xm1219 armed robotic vehicle;accelerometers;algorithm	Leonardo Sarlabous;Abel Torres;José Antonio Fiz;Raimon Jané	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610383	adaptive filter;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;band-pass filter;interference;accelerometer	EDA	14.138323501188818	-85.7542512288118	31298
1ab05c244202e56bc3d6e6f34b159ac0b4071af0	feasibility study of inertial sensor-based joint moment estimation method during human movements - a test of multi-link modeling of the trunk segment		The conventional method of estimating joint moments needs kinematic data measured with a 3D optical motion measurement system and ground reaction forces measured with force plate. However, the conventional method is limited generally to laboratory use because of the required measurement systems. Therefore, we proposed a convenient method to estimate joint moments from measurements only with inertial sensors for application to clinical evaluation of motor function of paralyzed and elderly subjects. In this paper, multi-link modeling of the trunk was examined for reliable estimation of joint moments only from measured data with inertial sensors attached on the body. Body segment parameters (segment length and mass, center of mass location and moments of inertia) were calculated from anthropometric data. Experimental test with 3 healthy subjects showed that segmented trunk model estimated joint moments better than a rigid trunk model for squat and sit-to-stand movements. The estimation results were not different largely between the 5-link model that modeled the trunk by 3 segments and the 4-link model that modeled the trunk by 2 segments. However, trunk modeling for 4-link model was suggested to be appropriate when the upper and the middle trunk segments of the 5-link model were modeled as one segment.	anthropometry;exploratory testing;sensor;signal processing;squatting attack;system of measurement;waveform	Takashi Watanabe;Jun Kodama	2016		10.5220/0005747902480255	computer vision;simulation;geodesy	Robotics	11.692767782774393	-85.17925072037575	31352

Combining knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches improves activity recognition (AR) by providing the benefits of each while also mitigating their challenges. In this paper we present the Semantic Cross-Environment Activity Recognition (SCEAR) system which is a novel method for creating semantic feature spaces and enables data-driven AR systems to transfer AR models across environments. We evaluate SCEAR using 22 datasets from real-world smart environments. Transferred model performance is compared to models trained in the target environment and shown to provide a 39% average per-class improvement.		Zachary Wemlinger;Lawrence B.

Such single trial detection requires a robust response that can be detected in a variety task conditions. Here, we investigated the influence of target probability, a key factor known to influence the amplitude of the evoked response, on single trial target classification in a difficult rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Our classification approach for detecting target vs. non target responses, considers spatial filters obtained through the maximization of the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio, and then uses the resulting information as inputs to a Bayesian discriminant analysis. The method is evaluated across eight healthy subjects, on four probability conditions (P=0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50). We show that the target probability has a statistically significant effect on both the behavioral performance and the target detection. The best mean area under the ROC curve is achieved with P=0.10, AUC=0.82. These results suggest that optimal performance of ERP detection in RSVP tasks is critically dependent on target probability.	area striata structure;bayesian network;brain neoplasms;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;erp;electroencephalography;expectation–maximization algorithm;interface device component;linear discriminant analysis;pattern recognition;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio	Hubert Cecotti;Joyce Sato-Reinhold;Jocelyn L.

The proposed method is based on the analysis of single-channel EEG using frequency and time domain features as well as Shannon entropy measure. The fuzzy classifier is trained with features obtained from four subsets of data comprising well-defined anesthesia states: awake, moderate, general anesthesia, and isoelectric. The classifier extracts efficient fuzzy if-then rules and the DOA index is derived between 100 (full awake) to 0 (isoelectric) using fuzzy inference engine.

c0178fd20a9ad23d54e9ff28919c9d7ea8845f57	denoising time series data using asymmetric generative adversarial networks		Denoising data is a preprocessing step for several time series mining algorithms. This step is especially important if the noise in data originates from diverse sources. Consequently, it is commonly used in biomedical applications that use Electroencephalography (EEG) data. In EEG data noise can occur due to ocular, muscular and cardiac activities. In this paper, we explicitly learn to remove noise from time series data without assuming a prior distribution of noise. We propose an online, fully automated, end-to-end system for denoising time series data. Our model for denoising time series is trained using unpaired training corpora and does not need information about the source of the noise or how it is manifested in the time series. We propose a new architecture called AsymmetricGAN that uses a generative adversarial network for denoising time series data. To analyze our approach, we create a synthetic dataset that is easy to visualize and interpret. We also evaluate and show the effectiveness of our approach on an existing EEG dataset.

Heart rate variability was analyzed in 14 swimmers (16.2 ± 2.6 years, 169.1 ± 10.2 cm and 61.3 ± 9.9 kg) in basal condition and during a HIT session before and after completing a training period. The HIT session that was evaluated consisted of: 16 × 25 m maximum speed, resting 30 s between sets. Participants combined aerobic training with tethered swimming and HIT sessions three times per week in a period of 4 weeks. Results showed a significantly decrease (p < 0.05) of the standard deviation of the NN intervals (SDNN), the standard deviation of differences between adjacent NN intervals (SDSD), the number of successive difference of intervals which differ by more than 50 ms (NN50), after the training period. Results showed a higher parasympathetic activation besides improvements in autonomic adaptation after HIT training period.	acclimatization;amendment;autonomic computing;autonomic networking;basal (phylogenetics);behavior;consent forms;declaration (computer programming);delta modulation;heart failure;heart rate variability;helsinki declaration;interval arithmetic;modulation;pulse-width modulation;rest;standard deviation;thrombocytopenia;training techniques;standards characteristics	Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez;Juan Jaime Arroyo Toledo	2018	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-018-0907-8	statistics;data mining;standard deviation;heart rate variability;high-intensity interval training;aerobic exercise;medicine;interval training	ML	16.678405951077185	-84.24338095859308	32069

However, directions and patterns of maternal and fetal heartbeat coupling are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to quantify the direction of short-term maternal–fetal cardiac coupling in early, mid and late gestation fetuses by using partial directed coherence (PDC) analysis approach. The analysis was based on fetal electrocardiograms (fECGs) of 66 healthy fetuses; 22 from early gestation 16–25 weeks, 22 from mid gestation 26–30 weeks and 22 from late gestation 32–41 weeks. Results of analyzing PDC demonstrated a causal influence of fetal on maternal heart rate in the early gestation, while it significantly decreased from artial directed coherence etal autonomic nervous system oupling analyses early to mid gestation along with a significant increase of maternal to fetal coupling strength. The causal influence of maternal on fetal heart rate was the strongest in the mid gestation and remained dominant in the late gestation. In conclusion, the application of PDC revealed detailed information about shortterm maternal–fetal cardiac couplings and regulatory mechanisms (patterns) of developing autonomic nervous system function. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

9a102983769a7ee1acb29d847a19fd4ab8870912	look no further: adapting experience history to the temporal characteristics of the environment		Many localization algorithms use a spatiotemporal window of sensory information in order to recognize spatial locations, and the length of this window is often a sensitive parameter that must be tuned to the specifics of the application. This paper presents a general method for environment-driven variation of the length of the spatiotemporal window based on narrowing down localization hypotheses to a desired threshold, to use as much history as is necessary but no more. We evaluate this approach on benchmark datasets using different sensor modalities in a variety of situations, and show that without tuning, the system greatly reduces the maximum distance traveled without localization compared to a fixed-length approach, while achieving competitive localization performance. Our results also show that the performance of the proposed method is much less sensitive to precise parameter values than the fixed-length baseline approach, requiring little to no application-specific tuning to achieve competitive performance.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);window function	Jake Bruce;Adam Jacobson;Michael Milford	2017	CoRR			Robotics	-0.007053379407401477	-82.05210682534928	32134

Several methods have been proposed to investigate the relationship between signals recorded externally from several sites on the pregnant uterus. A promising recent method is the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model. In this paper we proposed a windowed (time varying) version of the multivariate autoregressive model, called W-MVAR, to investigate the connectivity between signals while still respecting their non-stationary characteristics. The proposed method was tested on synthetic signals as well as applied to real signals. The comparison between the two methods on synthetic signals showed the superiority of W-MVAR to detect connectivity even if it is non-stationary. The application of W-MVAR on multichannel real uterine signals show that the proposed method is a good tool to distinguish non-labor and labor signals. These results are very promising and can very possibly have important clinical applications in labor detection and preterm labor prediction.	autoregressive model;icelandic language;labor (childbirth);pregnant uterus;premature obstetric labor;software propagation;stationary process;synthetic intelligence;window function	Brynjar Karlsson;Mahmoud Hassan;Catherine Marque	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6611279	econometrics;computer science;engineering;machine learning;mathematics;biological engineering;multivariate analysis;communication;regression analysis;statistics	Vision	19.140291274586904	-86.70822768155288	32152

Advances in engineering have extended electromyography beyond the traditional diagnostic applications to also include applications in diverse areas such as rehabilitation, movement analysis and myoelectric control of prosthesis. This paper aims to study and develop a system that uses myoelectric signals, acquired by surface electrodes, to characterize certain movements of the human arm. To recognize certain hand-arm segment movements, was developed an algorithm for pattern recognition technique based on neuro-fuzzy, representing the core of this research. This algorithm has as input the preprocessed myoelectric signal, to disclosed specific characteristics of the signal, and as output the performed movement. The average accuracy obtained was 86% to 7 distinct movements in tests of long duration (about three hours).	artificial intelligence;chorea;confusion;electromyography;execution;fuzzy control system;movement;neuro-fuzzy;part dosing unit;pattern recognition;prosthesis implantation;skeletal muscle structure;supervised learning;thrombocytopenia;user error;algorithm;electrode	Alexandre Balbinot;Gabriela W.

It is considered to be an immuno-neuronal disorder, but little is known about the part played by the neural system in nasal allergic reaction. This is due mainly to the lack of objective measurement techniques producing accurate, reliable and continuous measurement data about the dynamic changes in nasal respiratory function. Here, a method to assess the association of nasal airflow resistance and the underlying function of autonomic nervous system (ANS) is presented and used during the birch pollen provocation test. Ten allergic volunteers were challenged with allergen. Continuous nasal airflow resistance and spectral heart rate variability parameters were computed and analyzed for the dynamic changes. The derived signals show in detail the timing and intensity differences in subjects' reactions. After the provocation, the nasal airflow resistance rose gradually, whereas LF power and LF/HF ratio decreased gradually for all subjects. This implies gradually increasing sympathetic withdrawal in allergic patients during the provocation with allergen. The proposed method opens entirely new possibilities to assess accurately the dynamic and short-term changes in non-stationary nasal function and could increase the accuracy and reliability of diagnostics and assessment of the effect of nasal treatments.	allergens;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;betula genus;cfh gene;cns disorder;desensitization (telecommunications);drug allergy;heart rate variability;helicon focus;large;maxima and minima;microsoft windows;nasal provocation tests;patients;pollen;respiratory tract diseases;rhinitis;stationary process;chronic respiratory disease;hypersensitivity desensitization;nervous system disorder	Tiina M.

A HMM is trained based on the reference or correct gesture. Then, samples of the gesture that we want to score are used to train a second HMM. Both HMMs are compared, and a measure of their similarity is used to qualify the gesture. We used 3 different metrics to compare HMMs: Levinson, Kullback-Leibler and Porikli. For this, a visual system was developed to track a person's arm, which serves as input to the models that qualify the gestures. We applied this method to qualify the arm movements of stroke patients under rehabilitation. We analyzed three therapeutic gestures: flexion, circular and abduction. A HMM is trained to represent the movement of a healthy person for each gesture, which is compared with the HMMs obtained for each patient. The results are compared with the scales that are used in therapy. From the analysis of several experiments, the Porikli metric was the best to qualify the three gestures, in terms of the motricity index.	abductive reasoning;experiment;feedback;gesture recognition;hidden markov model;kullback–leibler divergence;levinson recursion;metric;markov chain	G.

These areas are likely to represent the irritative zone, which is itself a reflection of the epileptogenic zone. This paper reports on the imaging findings using independent component analysis (ICA) to continuously quantify epileptiform activity in simultaneously acquired EEG and fMRI. Using ICA derived factors coding for the epileptic activity takes into account that epileptic activity is continuously fluctuating with each spike differing in amplitude, duration and maybe topography, including subthreshold epileptic activity besides clear IEDs and may thus increase the sensitivity and statistical power of combined EEG/fMRI in epilepsy. Twenty patients with different types of focal and generalized epilepsy syndromes were investigated. ICA separated epileptiform activity from normal physiological brain activity and artifacts. In 16/20 patients, BOLD correlates of epileptic activity matched the EEG sources, the clinical semiology, and, if present, the structural lesions. In clinically equivocal cases, the BOLD correlates aided to attribute proper diagnosis of the underlying epilepsy syndrome. Furthermore, in one patient with temporal lobe epilepsy, BOLD correlates of rhythmic delta activity could be employed to delineate the affected hippocampus. Compared to BOLD correlates of manually identified IEDs, the sensitivity was improved from 50% (10/20) to 80%. The ICA EEG/fMRI approach is a safe, non-invasive and easily applicable technique, which can be used to identify regions with altered hemodynamic effects related to IEDs as well as intermittent rhythmic discharges in different types of epilepsy.	acoustic lobing;body fluid discharge;electroencephalography;epilepsy;epilepsy, generalized;epilepsy, temporal lobe;focal (programming language);hemodynamics;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;morphologic artifacts;myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile;patients;semiotics;topography;wolff-parkinson-white syndrome;fmri	Kay Jann;Roland Wiest;Martinus Hauf;Klaus Meyer;Chris Boesch;Johannes Mathis;Gerhard Schroth;Thomas Dierks;Thomas Koenig	2008	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.05.001	psychology;eeg-fmri;independent component analysis;neuroscience;developmental psychology;statistical power;communication	ML	19.007882075913276	-81.51287640653648	32801
423eb19a239aee783e910c410c9f57f9f8438b5e	eeg based epileptiform pattern recognition inside and outside the seizure states		Automatic diagnosis of epilepsy by computers based on Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a beneficial practice which increases recognition rate, speeds up diagnosis and saves physicians from long hours of EEG inspection. Most studies on this subject report results on detecting seizures; but seizures, which appear during the ictal states are very rare to catch. Therefore, an efficient algorithm must be able to detect epilepsy during nonseizure periods, or in other words interictal states as well. We present a novel algorithm to detect epileptiform patterns during both states: ictal and interictal. For this purpose, we use wavelet packet analysis (WPA) rather than traditional time and frequency domain methods. WPA, by providing arbitrary time-frequency resolution, enables analyzing signals of stationary and non-stationary nature. It has better time representation than Fourier analysis and better high frequency resolution than Wavelet analysis. WPA subimages are analyzed further to obtain feature vectors of Log Energy Entropy, Norm Entropy and Energy. These features are fed into a classifier, multilayer perceptron (MLP). We test our method on a well-known and widely studied database which includes healthy, ictal and interictal EEG recordings. Normal vs. Ictal and Interictal vs. Ictal zone classifications are realized at 100% accuracy by using any of the three features. Nonseizure vs. Seizure state classification is realized with 100% accuracy using Norm entropy. Normal vs. Interictal zone classification is achieved with 100% accuracy using Log Energy Entropy. Normal vs. Interictal vs. Ictal Zone classifications are considered as two-step binary classifications of Nonseizure vs. Seizure state followed by Normal vs. Interictal zone both of which are realized at 100% accuracy. Therefore, jointly use of Log Energy Entropy and Norm entropy is able to realize all possible classifications with 100% accuracy. We make the most comprehensive comparison of results belonging to all possible classification categories reported on the same datasets. The proposed method outperforms all the other results in all possible classifications by achieving 100% accuracy in all possible classifications. The method presented is the only single method that achieves this. Overall, the method provides us with a promising tool for the detection of epileptiform patterns during and outside the seizure states. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

So AI based arrhythmia recognition is effective for the management of cardiac disorders. Various techniques have been studied to classify arrhythmias. A simple wavelet transform based technique is proposed to classify normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and various cardiac arrhythmias including atrial premature contraction (APC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), super ventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Wavelet transform may be performed on ECG data with normal sinus rhythm as well as various arrhythmias. Accuracy of most of existing methods for detecting NSR, APC, PVC, SVT, VT and VF is between 90% to 98%. Expanding the overall data set greatly reduces overall accuracy due to significant variation in ECG morphology among different patients. As a result, morphological information must be coupled with timing information, which is more constant among patients, in order to achieve high classification accuracy for larger data sets. An AI based detection and classification techniques coupled with wavelet based processing is suggested which will extend accuracy even to large data sets.	artificial neural network;fuzzy logic;galaxy morphological classification;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;neuro-fuzzy;sensor;wavelet transform	Prabhakar D.

A similar situation occurred in biometric security applications where the goal is to identify or verify an individual using his signature or handwriting. These studies do not consider the distance of the pen tip to the writing surface. This is due to the fact that current acquisition devices do not provide height formation. However, it is quite straightforward to differentiate movements at two different heights (a) short distance: height lower or equal to 1 cm above a surface of digitizer, the digitizer provides x and y coordinates; (b) long distance: height exceeding 1 cm, the only information available is a time stamp that indicates the time that a specific stroke has spent at long distance. Although short distance has been used in several papers, long distances have been ignored and will be investigated in this paper. In this paper, we will analyze a large set of databases (BIOSECUR-ID, EMOTHAW, PaHaW, OXYGEN-THERAPY, and SALT), which contain a total amount of 663 users and 17,951 files. We have specifically studied (a) the percentage of time spent on-surface, in-air at short distance, and in-air at long distance for different user profiles (pathological and healthy users) and different tasks; (b) the potential use of these signals to improve classification rates. Our experimental results reveal that long distance movements represent a very small portion of the total execution time (0.5% in the case of signatures and 10.4% for uppercase words of BIOSECUR-ID, which is the largest database). In addition, significant differences have been found in the comparison of pathological versus control group for letter “l” in PaHaW database (p = 0.0157) and crossed pentagons in SALT database (p = 0.0122).	antivirus software;basic stamp;biometrics;cerebrovascular accident;database;digitizer device component;distance;emoticon;graphology;height;mac os x 10.4 tiger;movement;oxygen;paper;run time (program lifecycle phase);salt (cryptography);user profile	Carlos Alonso-Martinez;Marcos Faúndez-Zanuy;Jirí Mekyska	2017		10.1007/s12559-017-9501-5	pattern recognition;timestamp;artificial intelligence;computer science;pathology diagnosis;handwriting;speech recognition;biometrics	DB	14.781719592848413	-83.82656488166381	32990

We also suggest a way of training classifiers jointly for multiple notes to improve training speed and classification performance. Our method is evaluated on three public piano datasets. The results show that the learned features outperform the baseline features, and also our method gives significantly better frame-level accuracy than other state-of-the-art music transcription methods.	baseline (configuration management);bayesian network;deep belief network;feature learning;medical transcription;transcription (software);unsupervised learning	Juhan Nam;Jiquan Ngiam;Honglak Lee;Malcolm Slaney	2011			speech recognition;computer science;machine learning	ML	-4.21102233725526	-87.20149347382278	33007

A new measure for ST deviation based on the time–frequency analysis of the ECG and the use of a reduced set of Hermite basis functions for T wave and QRS complex morphology characterization, are the key points of the proposed methodology. Usually, ischemia manifests itself in the ECG signal by ST segment deviation or by QRS complex and T wave changes in morphology. These effects might occur simultaneously. Time–frequency methods are especially adequate for the detection of small transient characteristics hidden in the ECG, such as ST segment alterations. A Wigner–Ville transform-based approach is proposed to estimate the ST shift. To characterize the alterations in the T wave and the QRS morphologies, each cardiac beat is described ermite functions igner–Ville transform eural networks classifier by expansions in Hermite functions. These demonstrated to be suitable to capture the most relevant morphologic characteristics of the signal. A lead dependent neural network classifier considers, as inputs, the ST segment deviation and the Hermite expansion coefficients. The ability of the proposed method in ischemia episodes detection is evaluated using the European Society of Cardiology ST–T database.

2a5e1000066f9b711ede210f158337561987c525	a deep bag-of-features model for music auto-tagging		Feature learning and deep learning have drawn great attention in recent years as a way of transforming input data into more effective representations using learning algorithms. Such interest has grown up in the area of music information retrieval (MIR) as well, particularly in music classification tasks such as auto-tagging. While a number of promising results have been shown, it is not well understood what acoustic sense the learned feature representations have and how they are associated with semantic meaning of music. In this paper, we attempt to demystify the learned audio features using a bag-of-features model with two learning stages. The first stage learns to project local acoustic patterns of musical signals onto a high-dimensional sparse space in an unsupervised manner and summarizes an audio track as a bag-of-features. The second stage maps the bag-of-features to semantic tags using deep neural networks in a supervised manner. For the first stage, we focus on analyzing the learned local audio features by quantitatively measuring the acoustic properties and interpreting the statistics in semantic context. For the second stage, we examine training choices and tuning parameters for the neural networks and show how the deep representations of bag-of-features become more discriminative. Through this analysis, we not only provide better understanding of learned local audio features but also show the effectiveness of the deep bag-of-features model in the music autotagging task.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;algorithm;artificial neural network;auto-tune;computer vision;convolution;convolutional neural network;deep learning;dictionary;feature learning;feature model;information retrieval;machine learning;map;onset (audio);principle of abstraction;restricted boltzmann machine;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;supervised learning;unsupervised learning	Juhan Nam;Jorge Herrera;Kyogu Lee	2015	CoRR		speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;multimedia	ML	-4.130999713455733	-87.06873896986416	33107

6fdbd9dea09ae3208dde2f53c3f103640520e024	therapeutic effects of an anti-gravity treadmill (alterg) training on gait and lower limbs kinematics and kinetics in children with cerebral palsy		We aimed to investigate the effects of the lower body weight support treadmill (AlterG) training on kinetics and kinematics of the lower extremities in children with cerebral palsy (CP). We provided a 45-minute training program, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. AlterG can support the subject's weight up to 70% so that the subject will be able to walk more comfortably to reach a more correct walking pattern. The kinematics and kinetics were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer. The locomotion parameters were assessed in the gait laboratory. Subjects performance was evaluated at four time points: baseline (prior to training), 1 and 2 months after the beginning of training, and one month after the end of the training (as a follow-up evaluation). The results showed that the major gait, kinematic, and kinetic parameters improved after the AlterG training and were persistent. These findings suggest that the AlterG training can be considered as a therapeutic tool for improving the lower limb performance and locomotion in children with CP.	baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);cerebral palsy;congenital abnormality;gait disorders, neurologic;human body weight;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;limb structure;lower extremity;training programs;treadmill, device	Mahboube Lotfian;Mohamad Reza Kharazi;Alireza Mirbagheri;Farnoosh Dadashi;Rohollah Nourian;Mehdi M.

076983863422e1e16a88c4a87b9936290179f675	reducing compensatory motions in motion-based video games for stroke rehabilitation		Stroke survivors’ unsupervised therapeutic exercise motions are often accompanied by harmful compensatory motions that prevent proper motor recovery and introduce additional health issues. These compensatory motions are often performed unconsciously and are difficult to prevent. Motion-based games show promise for motivating patients to perform stroke rehabilitation exercises at home by themselves. Currently, exercises with these games are likely to contain undesired compensatory motions. In this article, we provide the design and empirical evaluation of a motion-based game system that addresses the issue of compensation in therapeutic games. We introduce a technique to identify and measure compensation, develop a game that meaningfully uses exercise and compensation as inputs, and use incentives and disincentives to reduce compensation. We show that this technique outperforms existing approaches by significantly reducing compensatory motions during therapeutic exercise. This has important implications for therapeutic games, which can use our findings to improve the quality of motions to be closer to therapist-supervised motions. Our techniques can increase the effectiveness of therapeutic games and reduce the possibility that they may cause harm in long-term use.

The proposed algorithm is based on the generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) feature reduction scheme and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier.   METHODOLOGY Initially 15 different features are extracted from the input HRV signal by means of linear and nonlinear methods. These features are then reduced to only five features by the GDA technique. This not only reduces the number of the input features but also increases the classification accuracy by selecting most discriminating features. Finally, the SVM combined with the one-against-all strategy is used to classify the HRV signals.   RESULTS The proposed GDA- and SVM-based cardiac arrhythmia classification algorithm is applied to input HRV signals, obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, to discriminate six different types of cardiac arrhythmia. In particular, the HRV signals representing the six different types of arrhythmia classes including normal sinus rhythm, premature ventricular contraction, atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, ventricular fibrillation and 2 degrees heart block are classified with an accuracy of 98.94%, 98.96%, 98.53%, 98.51%, 100% and 100%, respectively, which are better than any other previously reported results.   CONCLUSION An effective cardiac arrhythmia classification algorithm is presented. A main advantage of the proposed algorithm, compared to the approaches which use the ECG signal itself is the fact that it is completely based on the HRV (R-R interval) signal which can be extracted from even a very noisy ECG signal with a relatively high accuracy. Moreover, the usage of the HRV signal leads to an effective reduction of the processing time, which provides an online arrhythmia classification system. A main drawback of the proposed algorithm is however that some arrhythmia types such as left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block beats cannot be detected using only the features extracted from the HRV signal.	adverse event associated with cardiac arrhythmia;artificial cardiac pacemaker;atrial fibrillation;bounding interval hierarchy;business interoperability interface;cacna1e gene;class;classes - encounter;extraction;gnome-db;heart atrium;heart block;heart rate variability;left bundle-branch block;left bundle branch structure;linear discriminant analysis;nasal sinus;nonlinear system;premature ventricular contractions;qt interval feature (observable entity);real-time clock;sick sinus syndrome;statistical classification;support vector machine;ventricular fibrillation;algorithm;synovial sarcoma	Babak Mohammadzadeh Asl;Seyed Kamaledin Setarehdan;Maryam Mohebbi	2008	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2008.04.007	support vector machine;heart rate variability;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	AI	16.97412077003719	-90.16529619857756	33589

This limitation results from the unavailability of real clinical 12-lead ECG data, which would help train the classification models. In this study, we propose a new tensor-based scheme, which is motivated by the lack of effective feature extraction methods for direct tensor data input. In this scheme, an ECG signal is represented by third-order tensors in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain after using short-time Fourier transform on the raw ECG data. To overcome the limitations of tensor rank one discriminant analysis (TR1DA) inherited from linear discriminant analysis, we introduced a generalized tensor rank one discriminant analysis (GTR1DA). This approach involves considering the distribution of the data points near the classification boundary to calculate better projection tensors. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieves greater classification accuracy than other vectorand tensor-based methods. Finally, GTR1DA features a better convergence property than the original TR1DA.	data point;feature extraction;linear discriminant analysis;short-time fourier transform;unavailability	Kai Huang;Liqing Zhang	2014	EURASIP J.

3b3043d8816e9caecb3ee2a52597da08c535bb95	actigraphy-based sleep/wake pattern detection using convolutional neural networks		"""Common medical conditions are often associated with sleep abnormalities. Patients with medical disorders often suffer from poor sleep quality compared to healthy individuals, which in turn may worsen the symptoms of the disorder. Accurate detection of sleep/wake patterns is important in developing personalized digital markers, which can be used for objective measurements and efficient disease management. Big Data technologies and advanced analytics methods hold the promise to revolutionize clinical research processes, enabling the effective blending of digital data into clinical trials. Actigraphy, a non-invasive activity monitoring method is heavily used to detect and evaluate activities and movement disorders, and assess sleep/wake behavior. In order to study the connection between sleep/wake patterns and a cluster headache disorder, activity data was collected using a wearable device in the course of a clinical trial. This study presents two novel modeling schemes that utilize Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify sleep/wake states. The proposed methods are a sequential CNN, reminiscent of the bi-directional CNN for slot filling, and a MultiTask Learning (MTL) based model. Furthermore, we expand standard """"Sleep"""" and """"Wake"""" activity states space by adding the """"Falling asleep"""" and """"Siesta"""" states. We show that the proposed methods provide promising results in accurate detection of the expanded sleep/wake states. Finally, we explore the relations between the detected sleep/wake patterns and onset of cluster headache attacks, and present preliminary observations."""	alpha compositing;big data;convolutional neural network;digital data;neural networks;onset (audio);personalization;wake-sleep algorithm;wearable technology	Lena Granovsky;Gabi Shalev;Nancy Yacovzada;Yotam Frank;Shai Fine	2018	CoRR		machine learning;convolutional neural network;movement disorders;actigraphy;wearable computer;big data;artificial intelligence;mathematics;wake;siesta;analytics	AI	4.021832980596333	-82.83509109540273	33979

This paper developed a suite of home care sensor network system by ZigBee's characteristic, which is embedded three sensors (temperature sensor, humid sensor, and light sensor). It is attached to other sensors, such as the biosensor for observe heart rate and blood pressure. We implemented Panasonic EW3035 blood pressure monitor to measure heart rate and blood pressure. The biosensor transmits measured signals via ZigBee, and then sends to the remote wireless monitor for acquiring the observed human physiological signals. The remote wireless monitor is constructed of ZigBee and personal computer (PC). The measured signals send to the PC, which can be data collection, analyzing and statistic. When the measured signals over the standard value, the personal computer sends Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) short message to the manager.

Since the injured nervous system in stroke-related hemiplegia is located in the brain and difficult to be identified and operate on, we use another nervous system functioning as a new signal source to supply similar neural signals. In these cases, that means, two independent nervous systems are connected by a MENB. As preclinical experiments, we have made a series of tests on bodies of animals and healthy human. The principle, the system construction and the experimental results will be given.	cns disorder;cerebrovascular accident;experiment;hemiplegia;limb structure;nerve;nervous system structure;neuromuscular junction;numerous;hemiplegics	Zhi-Gong Wang;Xiao-Ying Lü;Yang Xia;Weyuan Li;Zonghao Huang;Yu-Xuan Zhou;Xiaoyan Shen;Xintai Zhao;Jingdong Yang;Suyang Wang;Ming Ma;Bilei Wang	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346063	neuroscience;physical medicine and rehabilitation;computer science;engineering;integrated circuit;biological engineering	Robotics	10.739591465234582	-82.2766830153893	34607

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven multiscale signal decomposition framework named empirical mean curve decomposition (EMCD). Targeted on functional brain mapping, the EMCD optimizes mean envelopes from fMRI signals and iteratively extracts coarser-to-finer scale signal components. The EMCD framework was applied to infer meaningful low-frequency information from blood oxygenation level-dependent signals from resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, and natural stimulus fMRI, and promising results are obtained.	brain mapping;cell respiration;inference;magnetic resonance imaging;name;nonlinear system;rest;resting state fmri;signal processing;time series	Fan Deng;Dajiang Zhu;Jinglei Lv;Lei Guo;Tianming Liu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2221125	computer vision;neuroscience;speech recognition;radiology;medicine;computer science;magnetic resonance imaging;hemodynamics;time series;mathematics;iterative method;brain mapping;communication;neurophysiology;statistics	ML	21.2140367545691	-87.74626851886484	34611

In combination with functional imaging techniques, the rapid advancement of neuroimaging techniques—such as magnetic resonance imaging—and their growing applicability in studying brain morphometry has led to great advances in neuroscience research. Considering the requirements of the diverse technologies—from image processing to statistics—in performing morphometry of the brain, it is critical to have an overall understanding of this subject. The major objective of this review is to provide a practical introduction to this field. The review starts by covering basic concepts and techniques that are commonly used in morphometry of structural magnetic resonance imaging and then extends to further technical perspectives. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The temporal signal changes on different brain tissues manifest distinct blood supply patterns which are vital for the profound analysis of cerebral hemodynamics. Under the assumption of the spatial independence among these patterns, noiseless independent factor analysis (NIFA) was first applied to decompose the DSC-MR data into different independent-factor images with corresponding signal-time curves. A major tissue type, such as artery, gray matter, white matter, vein, sinus, and choroid plexus, etc., on each independent-factor image was further segmented out by an optimal threshold. Based on the averaged signal-time curve on the arterial area, the cerebral hemodynamic parameters, such as relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and mean transit time (MTT), were computed and their averaged ratios between gray matter and white matter for normal subjects were in good agreement with those in the literature. Data of a stenosis patient before and after treatment was analyzed and the result illustrates that this method is effective in extracting spatio-temporal blood supply patterns which improves differentiation of pathological and physiological hemodynamics.

This study also tests the embedded BCI on simulated and real EEG signals. Experimental results indicated that the efficacy of the online ICA decomposition is comparable with that of the offline version of the same algorithm, suggesting the feasibility of ICA for online analysis of EEG in a BCI. To demonstrate the feasibility of the wearable embedded BCI, this study also implements an online spectral analysis to the resultant component activations to continuously estimate subject's task performance in near real time.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;embedded system;real-time clock	Li-Wei Ko;I-Ling Tsai;Fu-Shu Yang;Jen-Feng Chung;Shao-Wei Lu;Tzyy-Ping Jung;Chin-Teng Lin	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03040-6_126	independent component analysis;brain–computer interface;real-time computing;simulation;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning	EDA	12.640513083328504	-92.66772289256737	35034

We have designed a flowchart of a use of the WBANs to illustrate the functioning of such platforms. We show the use of this platform in a wide area to detect and to track disease movement in the case of epidemic situation. Indeed, tracking epidemic disease is a very challenging issue. The success of such process could help medical administration to stop diseases quicker than usual. In this study, WBANs deployed over volunteers who agree to carry a light wireless sensor network. Sensors over the body will monitor some health parameters (temperature, pressure, etc) and will run some light classification algorithms to help disease diagnosis. Finally, the WBAN will send aggregated data about the disease to some base stations which collect the results. Our platform will run an on-line disease tracking program and to detect some information about how the disease is propagated.	mobile phone	Bandar Alghamdi;Hacène Fouchal	2014	J. Comput.

Remaining challenges are among others a low signal-to-noise ratio of neural signals, lack of robustness for decoders in the presence of inter-trial and inter-subject variability, time constraints on the calibration phase and the use of BCIs outside a controlled lab environment. Recent advances in BCI research addressed these issues by novel combinations of complementary analysis as well as recording techniques, so called hybrid BCIs. In this paper, we review a number of data fusion techniques for BCI along with hybrid methods for BCI that have recently emerged. Our focus will be on sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs. We will give an overview of the three main lines of research in this area, integration of complementary features of neural activation, integration of multiple previous sessions and of multiple subjects, and show how these techniques can be used to enhance modern BCI systems.	brain–computer interface;heart rate variability;signal-to-noise ratio	Siamac Fazli;Sven Dähne;Wojciech Samek;Felix Bießmann;Klaus-Robert Müller	2015	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2015.2413993	computer vision;speech recognition;image resolution;electroencephalography;computer science;data integration;multimodal interaction;band-pass filter;sensor fusion;accuracy and precision;mutual information;statistics;robustness	DB	14.350631442680058	-93.06298403448447	35093

METHODS By employing a specialized image segmentation and vocal fold movement visualization technique - namely phonovibrography - a novel set of numerical features is derived from laryngeal HS videos capturing the dynamic behavior and the symmetry of oscillating vocal folds. In order to assess the discriminatory power of the features, a support vector machine is applied to the preprocessed data with regard to clinically relevant diagnostic tasks. Finally, the classification performance of the learned nonlinear models is evaluated to allow for conclusions to be drawn about suitability of features and data resulting from different examination paradigms. As a reference, a second feature set is determined which corresponds to more traditional voice analysis approaches.   RESULTS For the first time an automatic classification of healthy and pathological voices could be obtained by analyzing the vibratory patterns of vocal folds using phonovibrograms (PVGs). An average classification accuracy of approximately 81% was achieved for 2-class discrimination with PVG features. This exceeds the results obtained through traditional voice analysis features. Furthermore, a relevant influence of phonation frequency on classification accuracy was substantiated by the clinical HS data.   CONCLUSION The PVG feature extraction and classification approach can be assessed as being promising with regard to the diagnosis of functional voice disorders. The obtained results indicate that an objective analysis of dysfunctional vocal fold vibration can be achieved with considerably high accuracy. Moreover, the PVG classification method holds a lot of potential when it comes to the clinical assessment of voice pathologies in general, as the diagnostic support can be provided to the voice clinician in a timely and reliable manner. Due to the observed interdependency between phonation frequency and classification accuracy, in future comparative studies of HS recordings of oscillating vocal folds homogeneous frequencies should be taken into account during examination.	classification;clinical decision support system;contain (action);decision support systems, clinical;dysphonia;feature extraction;image segmentation;imagery;interdependence;laryngeal prosthesis;larynx;learning disorders;machine learning;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;phonation;rem sleep behavior disorder;support vector machine;vagueness;vocal cord paralysis;vocal cord structure;voice disorders;voice analysis;videocassette	Daniel Voigt;Michael Döllinger;Thomas Braunschweig;Anxiong Yang;Ulrich Eysholdt;Jörg Lohscheller	2010	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2010.01.001	speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning	Web+IR	16.226192022138232	-89.74438083704457	35226

We present a rapid and reliable method to detect optic glioma (OPG) in a mouse neurofibromatosis-1 model (Nf1(flox/mut)GFAP-Cre mice) in vivo using Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI). In a blinded study, 23 mice were chosen randomly from a cohort of Nf1(flox/mut)GFAP-Cre mice and two sets of age-matched controls. In all cases, OPG presence or absence was correctly identified. In addition, the OPG size and shape were accurately measured in vivo, facilitating the use of this model for preclinical drug studies.	drug evaluation;eye;nf1 gene;neoplasms;neurofibromatoses;optic nerve glioma;optical fiber;randomness;resonance;video-in video-out	Debasish Banerjee;Balázs Hegedűs;David H Gutmann;Joel R.

The VO2 estimated with a small motion sensor can be used to calculate the energy expenditure, however, its accuracy depends on the intensities of various types of activities. In order to achieve high accuracy over a wide range of intensities, we employ an estimation framework that first classifies activities with a simple machine-learning based classification algorithm. We prepare different coefficients of linear regression model for different types of activities, which are determined with training data obtained by experiments. The best-suited model is used for each type of activity when VO2 is estimated. The accuracy of the employed framework depends on the trade-off between the degradation due to classification errors and improvement brought by applying separate, optimum model to VO2 estimation. Taking this trade-off into account, we evaluate the accuracy of the employed estimation framework by using a set of experimental data consisting of VO2 and motion data of people with a wide range of intensities of exercises, which were measured by a VO2 meter and motion sensor, respectively. Our numerical results show that the employed framework can improve the estimation accuracy in comparison to a reference method that uses a common regression model for all types of activities.	coefficient;elegant degradation;energy metabolism;estimation of distribution algorithm;exercise;experiment;gyroscope;machine learning;motion detector;numerical analysis;oxygen consumption measurement;sports;accelerometers	Takashi Nagata;Naoteru Nakamura;Masato Miyatake;Akira Yuuki;Hiroyuki Yomo;Takashi Kawabata;Shinsuke Hara	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591785	acceleration;control engineering;data modeling;estimation;simulation;computer science;engineering;sensor;linear regression;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Vision	11.474708422357052	-85.7885192766346	35286

However, the reliability of these tags is limited in the presence of common noise sources in their environment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to improve the beat detection for RFID based heart rate monitors in noisy environments. To achieve this, a logistic regression model is first employed to determine data points that have a very high probability of being actual heart beats. These data points are then used as features to remove the ambiguity in detection of other heart beats. The algorithm is trained using features from a single heart rate measurement and the obtained parameters are used for determining various other heart rates. Using our algorithm, we achieve an F1-score of 0.98 for correct heart beat detection, and completely eliminate an error of over 75% in mean heart rate calculation.	algorithm;beam propagation method;beat detection;data point;f1 score;logistic regression;radio-frequency identification;sensor	Shrenik Vora;Timothy P.

bffa2891f1ff66e1c1019e3e582fe7dcfd97d460	a wearable long-term single-lead ecg processor for early detection of cardiac arrhythmia		Cardiac arrhythmia (CA) is one of the most serious heart diseases that lead to a very large number of annual casualties around the world. The traditional electrocardiography (ECG) devices usually fail to capture arrhythmia symptoms during patients' hospital visits due to their recurrent nature. This paper presents a wearable long-term single-lead ECG processor for the CA detection at an early stage. To achieve on-sensor integration and long-term continuous monitoring, an ultra-low complexity feature extraction engine using reduced feature set of four (RFS4) is proposed. It reduces the area by >25% compared to the conventional QRS complex detection algorithms without compromising the accuracy. Moreover, RFS4 eliminates the need for complex machine learning decision logic for the detection of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NVT). To ensure correct functional verification, the proposed system is implemented on FPGA and tested using the MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database. It achieves a sensitivity and specificity of 94.64% and 99.41%, respectively. The proposed processor is also synthesized using 0.18um CMOS technology with an overall energy efficiency of 139 nJ/detection.	algorithm;bounding interval hierarchy;cmos;feature extraction;field-programmable gate array;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;machine learning;recurrent neural network;sensitivity and specificity;wearable computer	Syed Muhammad Abubakar;Wala Saadeh;Muhammad Awais Bin Altaf	2018	2018 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)	10.23919/DATE.2018.8342148	computer science;real-time computing;wearable computer;field-programmable gate array;feature extraction;electrocardiography;qrs complex;ventricular tachycardia;functional verification	EDA	13.778344656547208	-88.93623448680341	35506

6bab9570ab82f2c53c0e7d939e798d6f409babea	teager energy based approach to detect atrial peaks to predict atrial fibrillation recurrence		Radiofrequency catheter ablation is currently used widely and successfully to treat atrial fibrillation (AF), whose success is limited in part by uncertainty in the mechanisms that sustain AF. AF intracardiac recordings were registered from the right atrium (RA) and left atrial (LA) in 41 patients immediately before AF ablation procedure. They were divided in 2 groups according to AF recurrence outcome 3 months after ablation procedure: 26 of them remained in sinus rhythm and the other 15 turned back to AF. There was no statistically significant difference between clinical parameters from recurrent and non-recurrent AF patients in both groups. Atrial peaks were detected from the envelope obtained by Teager Energy operator. Results showed differences between maximum of atrial fibrillation cycle length in the RA in both groups, with shorter atrial intervals in the group without recurrences in AF (p=0,03). Moreover, differences between both atria were found in AF non-recurrent patients, higher atrial intervals in the LA (p=0.04), nevertheless not statistical significant differences were found recurrent AF group. High frequency values, especially without a gradient between both atria, predict AF recurrence. It suggests that when the atrial electrical activity is more irregular and similar in both atria, the reversion to sinus rhythm is more difficult.	anisotropic filtering;gradient;radio frequency;recurrence relation;recurrent neural network;relative atrial index;reversion (software development);traffic collision avoidance system	Raquel Cervigón Abad;Javier Moreno;José Millet-Roig;Francisco Castells	2015	2015 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)	10.1109/CIC.2015.7410959	medicine;anesthesia;medical emergency;cardiology	ML	16.58111021101103	-84.58191930993333	35714

In this paper, sensors that perform the task of measuring the physical quantity of acceleration are discussed. These sensors are of special significance since, by integrating their output signals, accelerometers can additionally provide measures of velocity and position. Applications for such measurements, and thus of accelerometers, range from early diagnosis procedures for tremor-related diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease) to monitoring daily patterns of patient activity using telemetry systems. The system-level requirements in such applications are considered, and two novel neural-network transducer designs developed by the authors are presented, which aim to satisfy such requirements. Both designs are based on a micromachined sensing element with capacitive signal pickoff. The first is an open-loop design utilizing a direct-inverse control strategy, while the second is a closed-loop design, where electrostatic actuation is used as a form of feedback. Both transducers are nonlinearly compensated, capable of self-testing, and provide digital outputs.	actuation dosing unit;artificial neural network;control theory;instrument - device;nonlinear system;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;requirement;telemetry;transducer;transducers;tremor;velocity (software development);accelerometers;sensor (device)	Elena I.

48cd21ca048b7f66cfd4a60a8069edef3104ab75	articulatory dynamics and coordination in classifying cognitive change with preclinical mtbi.		Speech analysis has shown potential for identifying neurological impairment. With brain trauma, changes in brain structure or connectivity may result in changes in source, prosodic, or articulatory aspects of voice. In this work, we examine the articulatory components of speech reflected in formant tracks, and how changes in track dynamics and coordination map to cognitive decline. We address a population of athletes regularly receiving impacts to the head and showing signs of preclinical mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), a state indicated by impaired cognitive performance occurring prior to concussion. We hypothesize that this preclinical damage results in 1) changes in average vocal tract dynamics measured by formant frequencies, their velocities, and acceleration, and 2) changes in articulatory coordination measured by a novel formant-frequency cross-correlation characterization. These features allow machine learning algorithms to detect preclinical mTBI identified by a battery of cognitive tests. A comparison is performed of the effectiveness of vocal tract dynamics features versus articulatory coordination features. This evaluation is done using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves along with confidence bounds. The articulatory dynamics features achieve area under the ROC curve (AUC) values between 0.72 and 0.98, whereas the articulatory coordination features achieve AUC values between 0.94 and 0.97.	algorithm;brain implant;cross-correlation;machine learning;receiver operating characteristic;tract (literature)	Brian S.

This paper shows the potential use of short-time PPG signals for differentiating patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) from healthy control (HC) subjects with nonlinear dynamics analysis. Multiscale entropy, time-shift multiscale entropy, and fuzzy recurrence plots were applied for extracting features from PPG signals of PD patients and HC subjects. Least-square support vector machine based cross-validations of the features extracted from the three nonlinear dynamics analysis methods achieve high classification rates, where those obtained from fuzzy recurrence plots are the highest.	entropy (information theory);nonlinear dynamics;recurrence plot;sensor;support vector machine;wearable computer	Tuan D.

Caregivers have to monitor the postures of such elderly people to correct dangerous posture. It is high-workload care because it must be conducted throughout the day. Therefore, our project aims to reduce the workload by ICT-based posture monitoring with smart wheelchairs. In this paper, we discuss line-oriented sensing point reduction for the non-categorical quantitative score based sitting posture evaluation.

934754a50b84ffec2947fa6e0d66077544996948	quantifying the approaching behaviors for interactions in detecting estrus of breeding cattle		In the management of beef cattle breeding, estrus detection is especially important for improving productivity. Generally, pedometers have been used since the past few decades to measure the increase in momentum, which is likely to occur during estrus. Cattle are known to be social animals which take unique actions such as the approaching or mounting other cattle during estrus. However, the sociality of cattle has not been focused much on detecting estrus accurately. In this paper, we propose the method to detect estrus in relation to the approaching behavior between cattle. We extract the approaching behaviorbased on position information from GPS devices attached to the cattle. Our method focuses on moving direction to detect even small approaching actions with which the momentum may not increase clearly. Furthermore, we conducted an experiment based on the records of artificial insemination to examine the efficiency of our method. As a result, we verified some cases with a distinctive characteristic related to approaching behavior, which occurred during the days when the pregnancy was confirmed from the artificial insemination records.

We used these biological data to examine the effect of facing another child and the relationship of this effect to an action index. The relationship between problem behavior in the children and maternal attachment was then investigated. Each mother filled out a checklist on maternal attachment and her child's behavior. The nursery school caregiver also filled out the child behavior checklist for each child. The measured values were subjected to chaos analysis, and the Lyapunov exponents were calculated. The change in the Lyapunov exponent between the single-child and child-pair measurements is thought to relate to the maternal attachment index and the child's action index.	action potential;action selection;attachments;lyapunov fractal;maxima and minima	Junko Tsujino;Mayumi Oyama-Higa;Mitsuko Tanabiki	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811750	behavioural sciences;computer science;lyapunov exponent	Robotics	15.223663807933896	-83.83479190825813	36406

The tool uses signals from the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope (as the phone is held or mounted on a subject's hand) to compute a set of metrics which can be used to quantify a patient's tremor symptoms. In a small-scale clinical study with 25 PD patients and 20 age-matched healthy volunteers, we combined our metrics with machine learning techniques to correctly classify 82% of the patients and 90% of the healthy volunteers, which is high compared to similar studies. The proposed method could be effective in assisting physicians in the clinic, or to remotely evaluate the patient's condition and communicate the results to the physician. Our tool is low cost, platform independent, noninvasive, and requires no expertise to use. It is also well matched to the standard clinical examination for PD and can keep the patient “connected” to his physician on a daily basis. Finally, it can facilitate the creation of anonymous profiles for PD patients, aiding further research on the effectiveness of medication or other overlooked aspects of patients' lives.	gyroscope;machine learning;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;smartphone;tremor;accelerometers	N.

64380a2c18b1c16119404a62a6e518999bad932e	object-use activity monitoring: feasibility for people with cognitive impairments		A significant amount of prior work has addressed the question of whether wireless sensor networks can collect sufficient data about how people interact with everyday objects to support accurate interpretation of their behavior. One commonly discussed application for object-use-based activity monitoring is the development of systems to support people with cognitive impairment. However, most prior studies have involved only cognitively intact subjects. In this paper, we report on an experiment in which we attempt to replicate an earlier study that used object-use activity monitoring to identify individuals, but we used subjects with traumatic brain injuries (TBI). We describe the work, which is currently ongoing, and provide preliminary answers to the key questions of whether this approach to activity monitoring is feasible for people with TBI, and whether the data collected provides a level of identification accuracy equivalent to that of the unimpaired subjects.	self-replicating machine	Mark R.

Secondly, the proposed SGA is distinguished due to the embedded medical advisory system, which can provide the comparative medical services while adaptive to the source restricted embedded platforms. In this paper, the hemodynamic analysis of sphygmogram is firstly introduced and then, the implementation of SGA, including data acquiring and analyzing unit (DAU), embedded medical advisory system (e-MAS) boosted for the application of soft computing, and the distributed information exchanging framework, is addressed in detail. q 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

897b13a6b0d9d977c9b07da8941ff1f150ebf23e	automatic 1d convolutional neural network-based detection of artifacts in meg acquired without electrooculography or electrocardiography		Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging tool that records the magnetic fields induced by electrical neuronal activity; however, signal from non-neuronal sources can corrupt the data. Eye-Blinks (EB) and Cardiac Activity (CA) are two of the most common types of non-neuronal artifacts. They can be measured by affixing eye proximal electrodes, as in electrooculography (EOG) and chest electrodes, as in electrocardiography (EKG), however this complicates imaging setup, decreases patient comfort, and often induces further artifacts from facial twitching and postural muscle movement. We propose an EOG- and EKG-free approach to identify eye-blink, cardiac, or neuronal signals for automated artifact suppression. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we combine a data driven, multivariate decomposition approach based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a highly accurate classifier constructed as a deep 1-D Convolutional Neural Network. Second, we visualize the features learned to reveal what features the model uses and to bolster user confidence in our model’s training and potential for generalization. We train and test three variants of our method on resting state MEG data from 49 subjects. Our cardiac model achieves a 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity on the set-aside test-set. Our eye-blink model achieves a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. This work facilitates automated MEG processing for both, clinical and research use, and can obviate the need for EOG or EKG electrodes.	artificial neural network;convolutional neural network;eb-eye;electrooculography;facial recognition system;independent component analysis;magnetoencephalography;resting state fmri;sensitivity and specificity;zero suppression	Prabhat Garg;Elizabeth M.

Performance data sets encompass measurements such as position, velocity and force, as well as final performance measures. We apply the Principal Component Analysis method in an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, molding subsets that were the input into a Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network which would carry out data mining with the purpose of discovering the relative significance of each field, in relation to a performance measure. It was possible to notice the impact caused by the lack of each field in terms of specific performance measures, indicating which data are more relevant to use in further experiments.	approximation;artificial neural network;big data;data mining;dimensionality reduction;experiment;jackknife resampling;multilayer perceptron;principal component analysis;rehabilitation robotics;robot;velocity (software development)	Caio Benatti Moretti;Ricardo C.

This is due to the work habits, quality and intensity of life, diet and individual factors. Hip arthroplasty is a surgery to remove the pain and to allow the patient to return to normal functioning in society. Endoprosthesoplasty brings the desired effect, but the life span of contemporary endoprosthesis is still not satisfactory. Clinical studies have shown that the introduction of the implant to the bone causes a number of changes within the bone --- implant contact. The correct prediction of changes around the implant allows to plan the surgery and to identify hazardous areas where bone decalcification and loss of primary stability in implant can occur.	neural networks	Arkadiusz Szarek;Marcin Korytkowski;Leszek Rutkowski;Rafal Scherer;Janusz Szyprowski	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29350-4_40	artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;work habit;dentistry;artificial neural network;bone decalcification;implant;arthroplasty	Robotics	11.57256438607776	-81.91320455411775	37452

A blood oxygen saturation level was measured in percent of Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2). Medical doctors needed to order an oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 of the infants between 90-95% while SpO2 of normal infants is 99-100%. Oxygen therapy was a procedure to stimulate lung functions and to maintain life. A registered nurse (RN) was responsible for adjusting levels of a fractional of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 21% to 100% which was a proportion of oxygen gas provided to the infants periodically. In real situation, the adjustment could only be made as often as every 20-30 minutes, which might not be adequate. This caused ineffectiveness of an oxygen therapy and result in a longer hospital stay. A critical error of this adjustment could also cause blindness due to oxygen toxicity or dead due to hypoxia. This research was to develop a reliable embedded system that allowed automatically control of FiO2 according to an order of SpO2 by medical doctors. As a result, risks of oxygen toxicity and hypoxia could be minimized. The system also allowed medical doctors to use recorded data for future care planning in oxygen therapy.	algorithm;care-of address;circuit complexity;control system;embedded system;fatal exception error;peripheral	Phattaradanai Kiratiwudhikul;Pornchai Chanyagorn	2014	2014 International Conference on Smart Computing	10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2014.7043870	oxygen saturation;intensive care medicine;medicine;anesthesia;surgery	Robotics	16.343343069020776	-84.33767994071417	37544
19f11d886028f4d0e492733c224298fa6d3292f5	multilabel classification of eeg-based combined motor imageries implemented for the 3d control of a robotic arm. (classification multilabels à partir de signaux eeg d'imaginations motrices combinées : application au contrôle 3d d'un bras robotique)		Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) replace the natural nervous system outputs by artificial ones that do not require the use of peripheral nerves, allowing people with severe motor impairments to interact, only by using their brain activity, with different types of applications, such as spellers, neuroprostheses, wheelchairs, or among others robotics devices. A very popular technique to record signals for BCI implementation purposes consists of electroencephalography (EEG), since in contrast with other alternatives, it is noninvasive and inexpensive. In addition, due to the potentiality of Motor Imagery (MI, i.e., brain oscillations that are generated when subjects imagine themselves performing a movement without actually accomplishing it) to generate suitable patterns for scheming self-paced paradigms, such combination has become a common solution for BCI neuroprostheses design. However, even though important progress has been made in the last years, full 3D control is an unaccomplished objective. In order to explore new solutions for overcoming the existing limitations, we present a multiclass approach that considers the detection of combined motor imageries, (i.e., two or more body parts used at the same time). The proposed paradigm includes the use of the left hand, right hand, and both feet together, from which eight commands are provided to direct a robotic arm comprising fourteen different movements that afford a full 3D control. To this end, an innovative switching-mode scheme that allows managing different actions by using the same command was designed and implemented on the OpenViBE platform. Furthermore, for feature extraction a novel signal processing scheme has been developed based on the specific location of the activity sources that are related to the considered body parts. This insight allows grouping together within a single class those conditions for which the same limb is engaged, in a manner that the original multiclass task is transformed into an equivalent problem involving a series of binary classification models. Such approach allows using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm; which has been shown to be powerful at discriminating sensorimotor rhythms, but has the drawback of being suitable only to differentiate between two classes. Based on this perspective we also have contributed with a new strategy that combines together the CSP algorithm and Riemannian geometry. In which the CSP projected trials are mapped into the Riemannian manifold, from where more discriminative features can be obtained as the distances separating the input data from the considered class means. These strategies were applied on three new classification approaches that have been compared to classical multiclass methods by using the EEG signals from a group of naive healthy subjects, showing that the proposed alternatives not only outperform the existing schema, but also reduce the complexity of the classification task.	algorithm;binary classification;brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;electroencephalography;feature extraction;neuroprosthetics;openvibe;peripheral;programming paradigm;robot;robotic arm;robotics;signal processing	Cecilia Lindig-León	2017				ML	12.839493144695616	-92.9700340600416	37707

This paper presents a new approach that uses principle component analysis (PCA) to separate the signal and noise components of unfiltered PPGs and provide the determination of R. Also, rather than use peak-to-valley time intervals to obtain R, this technique uses eigenvalue and eigenvector data obtained during PCA to optimize these time intervals and improve the R calculation. Early analyses on unfiltered PPGs from 16 subjects indicate that these R values compare to those obtained from FFT-based methods and yield SpO2 values consistent with those reported by a commercial unit. All signal data are considered during the PCA process, so this technique shows promise to precisely segment clean versus noise-corrupted PPGs.	coefficient;fast fourier transform;noise generator;oxygen saturation measurement;oxygen saturation test result;principal component analysis;biologic segmentation	Kejia Li;Steve Warren	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091812	electronic engineering;medicine;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;photoplethysmogram;statistics;principal component analysis	Robotics	18.87533332981127	-87.74583400571842	37718

Passive dynamics emerging from the morphology of the human musculoskeletal system, reflexes as stabilization mechanisms, modular control of movement as well as supra-spinal control of gait are reviewed to get insight on how these mechanisms can be used to explain human locomotion.	cns disorder;galaxy morphological classification;hrh2 wt allele;patients;reflex action;supra, inc.

In a first implantation thin film electrodes were epimysially implanted on the deltoideus of a rhesus macaque and the encapsulation process was monitored by impedance measurements. Increase of impedance reached a constant level after four weeks indicating a complete encapsulation of electrodes. EMG recorded with these electrodes yielded a signal-to-noise ratio of about 80 dB at 200 Hz. The EMG recorded during goal-directed arm movements showed a high similarity to movements in the same direction and at the same time presented clear differences between different movement directions in time domain. Six classifiers and seven time and frequency domain features were investigated with the aim of discriminating the direction of arm movement from EMG signals. Reliable recognition of arm movements was achieved for a subset of the movements under investigation only. A second implantation of the whole measurement system for nine weeks demonstrated simple handling during surgery and good biotolerance in the animals.	characteristic impedance;encapsulation (networking);ion implantation;signal-to-noise ratio;system of measurement	Soren Lewis;Michael Friedrich Russold;Hans Dietl;Roman Ruff;Josep Marcel Cardona Audi;Klaus-Peter Hoffmann;Lait Abu Saleh;Dietmar Schroeder;Wolfgang H.

The P300-based BCI is among the most popular paradigms in the field and most current versions operate in synchronous mode and assume participant engagement throughout operation. In this study, we demonstrate a new approach for assessment of user engagement through a hybrid classification of ERP and band power features of EEG signals that could allow building asynchronous BCIs. EEG signals from nine electrode locations were recorded from nine participants during controlled engagement conditions when subjects were either engaged with the P3speller task or not attending. Statistical analysis of band power showed that there were significant contrasts of attending only for the delta and beta bands as indicators of features for user attendance classification. A hybrid classifier using ERP scores and band power features yielded the best overall performance of 0.98 in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results indicate that band powers can provide additional discriminant information to the ERP for user attention detection and this combined approach can be used to assess user engagement for each stimulus sequence during BCI use.	annual bci research award;area under curve;bands;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;discriminant;erp;electroencephalography;interaction;interface device component;neuromuscular diseases;patients;power (psychology);receiver operating characteristic;version	Yichuan Liu;Hasan Ayaz;Adrian Curtin;Patricia A.

In addition, if the number of mixture elements is increased, our method is capable of detecting additional activity-related areas.	mixture model;time series	Vittorio Sanguineti;Claudio Parodi;Sergio Perissinotto;Francesco Frisone;Paolo Vitali;Pietro G.

The Handcopter Game was designed to support the recovery of motor function in patients who have suffered a stroke recently. We propose a non-conventional low cost input device to function as the game controller. It detects the patient's hand movements via computer vision algorithms and map that to movements of the game character in the virtual environment. The premise is that the game play makes patients execute hand movements typically found in a physiotherapy session. We also discuss how to use this game as part of the patient's treatment. Finally, we present the results collected when real patients played the game as part of their recovery treatment.	algorithm;computer vision;controller (computing);experiment;game controller;input device;opencv;video tracking;virtual reality	Alyson Matheus de Carvalho Souza;Selan Rodrigues dos Santos	2012	2012 14th Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality	10.1109/SVR.2012.24	psychology;simulation;physical therapy;multimedia	HCI	8.395474639306324	-83.30242323475778	38456

Among many indoor positioning technologies, we chose Wi-Fi, BLE beacon and ultra-wide band (UWB) sensor technologies for their popularity and investigated their applicability in BM. We tested three technologies for error ranges and found an average error of 1.39 m for Wi-Fi in a 36 m² test area (6 m × 6 m), 0.86 m for the BLE beacon in a 37.44 m² test area (9.6 m × 3.9 m) and 0.24 m for ultra-wide band sensors in a 36 m² test area (6 m × 6 m). We simulated the applicability of these error ranges for real-time locations by using a behavioral dataset collected from an active learning classroom. We used two UWB tags simultaneously by incorporating a custom-designed ceiling system in a new 39.76 m² test area (7.35 m × 5.41 m). We considered 26 observation points and collected data for 180 s for each point (total 4680) with an average error of 0.2072 m for 23 points inside the test area.

In order to assess the process of learning or adaptation of a coincident timing task, we have used an exoskeleton-based experiment applying different dynamics. The experimental task consisted of intercepting a moving virtual target displayed on the screen. The interception area was defined simultaneously in a virtual and a real environment. The real target was marked on a table, in such a way that the subject wearing the elbow exoskeleton could reach the target by performing an elbow flexion. The task goal was to position the hand over a marker placed on the table at the same time as the virtual object ascended to the virtual interception area on the computer screen. Hand motion data were acquired by an inertial sensor (VN-100, VectorNAv) attached to the subject's hand while electromyography (EMG, FreeEMG, BTS) was used to record the activity of the following muscles: biceps brachii, triceps brachii and brachioradialis to assess muscle response. Our research focused on the percentage of correct responses and the tendency of correct responses. We also monitored smoothness of the movement and correlated our observations with EMG activities. The preliminary results indicate that the addition of a mechanical predictable load improves the learning rate.	ascendency;augmented reality;broadcast television systems inc.;computer monitor;electromyography;experiment;lopes (exoskeleton);modulus of smoothness	Rafael T.

Driving fatigued was significantly related to traffic accidents in which the driver’s behavior contributed to the accident. This paper describes prototype driver fatigue evaluating performance by setting up various parameters that typically characterize fatigue level of the driver. This model was validated that the driver with fatigue states need longer time to reduce the decisive, sensitive and real-time competence under the protean road condition, and correlation analysis to exact parameters of drivers' reaction time.	prototype;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;simulation;test data	Maorong Weng	2010	2010 International Conference on Machine Vision and Human-machine Interface	10.1109/MVHI.2010.95	computer vision;public health;computer science;control theory;transfer function	EDA	7.352884925392492	-81.40531659261883	38835
f6741f961456d7121d5969dbb6f9d956e481043e	application of empirical mode decomposition (emd) for automated identification of congestive heart failure using heart rate signals		Electrocardiogram is widely used to diagnose the congestive heart failure (CHF). It is the primary noninvasive diagnostic tool that can guide in the management and follow-up of patients with CHF. Heart rate variability (HRV) signals which are nonlinear in nature possess the hidden signatures of various cardiac diseases. Therefore, this paper proposes a nonlinear methodology, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), for an automated identification and classification of normal and CHF using HRV signals. In this work, HRV signals are subjected to EMD to obtain intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). From these IMFs, thirteen nonlinear features such as approximate entropy $$ (E_{\text{ap}}^{x} ) $$ ( E ap x ) , sample entropy $$ (E_{\text{s}}^{x} ) $$ ( E s x ) , Tsallis entropy $$ (E_{\text{ts}}^{x} ) $$ ( E ts x ) , fuzzy entropy $$ (E_{\text{f}}^{x} ) $$ ( E f x ) , Kolmogorov Sinai entropy $$ (E_{\text{ks}}^{x} ) $$ ( E ks x ) , modified multiscale entropy $$ (E_{{{\text{mms}}_{y} }}^{x} ) $$ ( E mms y x ) , permutation entropy $$ (E_{\text{p}}^{x} ) $$ ( E p x ) , Renyi entropy $$ (E_{\text{r}}^{x} ) $$ ( E r x ) , Shannon entropy $$ (E_{\text{sh}}^{x} ) $$ ( E sh x ) , wavelet entropy $$ (E_{\text{w}}^{x} ) $$ ( E w x ) , signal activity $$ (S_{\text{a}}^{x} ) $$ ( S a x ) , Hjorth mobility $$ (H_{\text{m}}^{x} ) $$ ( H m x ) , and Hjorth complexity $$ (H_{\text{c}}^{x} ) $$ ( H c x ) are extracted. Then, different ranking methods are used to rank these extracted features, and later, probabilistic neural network and support vector machine are used for differentiating the highly ranked nonlinear features into normal and CHF classes. We have obtained an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.64, 97.01, and 98.24 %, respectively, in identifying the CHF. The proposed automated technique is able to identify the person having CHF alarming (alerting) the clinicians to respond quickly with proper treatment action. Thus, this method may act as a valuable tool for increasing the survival rate of many cardiac patients.	antivirus software;approximate entropy;artificial neural network;color gradient;cryptographic hash function;entropy (information theory);heart rate variability;hilbert–huang transform;nonlinear system;probabilistic neural network;rényi entropy;sample entropy;sensitivity and specificity;shannon (unit);support vector machine;the quality of life;tsallis entropy;unbalanced circuit;wavelet	U.

Along with the recent prevalence of pervasive e-Health in various applications such as smart homes, automatic activity recognition is being implemented increasingly for rehabilitation systems, chronic disease management, and monitoring the elderly for their personal well-being. In this paper, we present WITS, an end-to-end web-based in-home monitoring system for convenient and efficient care delivery. The system unifies the data- and knowledge-driven techniques to enable a real-time multi-level activity monitoring in a personalized smart home. The core components consist of a novel shared-structure dictionary learning approach combined with rule-based reasoning for continuous daily activity tracking and abnormal activities detection. WITS also exploits an Internet of Things middleware for the scalable and seamless management and learning of the information produced by ambient sensors. We further develop a user-friendly interface, which runs on both iOS and Andriod, as well as in Chrome, for the efficient customization of WITS monitoring services without programming efforts. This paper presents the architectural design of WITS, the core algorithms, along with our solutions to the technical challenges in the system implementation.	accessibility;activity recognition;algorithm;computer multitasking;dictionary;end-to-end principle;experiment;home automation;internet of things;interoperability;logic programming;machine learning;middleware;personalization;pervasive informatics;real-time web;scalability;seamless3d;sensor;usability;water industry telemetry standard;web application;ios	Lina Yao;Quan Z.

Deep neural networks achieve convincing results and are currently the state-of-the-art approach for many tasks. One advantage is their implicit feature learning, opposite to an explicit feature extraction of the input signal. In this work, we analyzed whether more discriminative features can be learned from either the time-domain or the frequency-domain representation of the audio signal. For this purpose, we trained multiple deep networks with different architectures on the Freiburg-106 and ESC-10 datasets. Our results show that feature learning from the frequency domain is superior to the time domain. Moreover, additionally using convolution and pooling layers, to explore local structures of the audio signal, significantly improves the recognition performance and achieves state-of-the-art results.	acoustic cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;convolution;deep learning;feature extraction;feature learning	Lars Hertel;Huy Phan;Alfred Mertins	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727635	feature learning;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	-4.395595772309782	-87.26614480092154	39126

In order to assess the signals acquired from high resolution mapping, a robust framework is required. Our framework is semi-automated and allows for rapid processing, analysis and interpretation of slow waves via qualitative and quantitative measures including isochronal activation time mapping, and velocity and amplitude mapping. Noise removal techniques were validated for raw recorded signals, where three filters were evaluated for baseline drift removal and three filters for removal of high frequency interference. For baseline drift removal, the Gaussian moving median filter was most effective, while for eliminating high frequency interference the Savitzky Golay filter was the most effective. Methods for assessing slow wave velocity and amplitude were investigated. To estimate slow wave velocity, a finite difference approach with interpolation and smoothing was used. To evaluate the slow wave amplitude and width, a peak and trough method based on Savitzky Golay derivative filters was used. Together, these methods constitute a significantly improved framework for analyzing gastric high resolution mapping data.	baseline (configuration management);finite difference;gastric tissue;image resolution;interference (communication);interpolation imputation technique;median filter;normal statistical distribution;semiconductor industry;serous membrane;signal processing;smoothing (statistical technique);velocity (software development);serosal;width	Niranchan Paskaranandavadivel;Leo K.

This study applied the non-linear analytical tool recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to 400 breath interval periods of REM and N-REM sleep, and then using an overlapping moving window. The RQA variables were different between sleep states, with REM radius 150% greater than N-REM radius, and REM laminarity 79% greater than N-REM laminarity. RQA allowed the observation of temporal variations in non-linear breathing dynamics across a night's sleep at 30s resolution, and provides a basis for quantifying changes in complex breathing dynamics with physiology and pathology.

In this paper, we experiment to measure the effects of variables and controls in a source code to the brain activity in program comprehension. The measurement results are evaluated after noise reduction and normalization to statistical analysis. As the result of the experiment, significant differences in brain activity were observed at a task that requires memorizing variables to understand a code snippet. On the other hand, no significant differences between different levels of mental arithmetic tasks were observed. We conclude that the frontal pole reflects workload to short-term memory caused by variables without affected from calculation.	control flow;database normalization;east pole–west pole divide;electroencephalography;experiment;noise reduction;program comprehension;wavelet	Yoshiharu Ikutani;Hidetake Uwano	2014	15th IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)	10.2991/ijndc.2014.2.4.7	speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	SE	13.73300516896456	-91.29183376476432	39554

Hence, the challenge is how to train the BCI system effectively especially in the scenario with small amount of training data. In this paper, we introduce improved semisupervised adaptation based on common spatial pattern (CSP) features. The feature extraction and classification are performed jointly and iteratively. In the iteration step, training data are expanded by part of the testing data with labels which are predicted by a linear discriminant analysis classifier and/or a Bayesian linear discriminant analysis classifier in the previous iteration. Then CSP features are reextracted from the expanded training data, and the classifiers are retrained. Both self-training and cotraining paradigms are proposed for the improved semisupervised adaptation. Throughout the investigation on different number of initial training trials, we find that when a small number of training trials are used, e.g., a training session contains no more than 30 trials, similar classification performance to that of large training data items (40-50 trials) can be achieved. Effectiveness of the algorithms is verified by two competition datasets. Compared with several existing algorithms, the proposed semisupervised algorithms show improvements in classification accuracy for most of the competition datasets especially in the case of small training data.	acclimatization;algorithm;application program interface;brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;experiment;feature extraction;interface device component;iteration;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;p-value;programming paradigm;sample variance;semi-supervised learning;silo (dataset);small;spatiotemporal pattern	Jianjun Meng;Xinjun Sheng;Dingguo Zhang;Xiangyang Zhu	2014	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2013.2285232	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Vision	15.094599211135334	-93.44900163464945	39615

In this pilot study we investigated the feasibility of surface electromyographic (sEMG) dynamic topography as a new approach for continuously visualizing muscle activity of normal swallowing. The dynamic sEMG topographies (or potential mappings) of swallowing were constructed with high-density sEMG recordings from three subjects without any swallowing disorders. The root mean square (RMS) of the sEMG signals was calculated as a function of both position and time to produce two-dimension dynamic sEMG maps of the muscle activity during swallowing. The sEMG maps could provide the information about the dynamic characteristics of swallowing muscles, which is accordance with physiological and biomechanical laws of a normal swallowing. With the results of the present study, we might conclude that the dynamic topography would provide a noninvasive means to continuously visualize the distribution of surface EMG signals of complex muscle activities of normal deglutition.	deglutition disorders;electromyography;hepatitis b surface antigens;imagery;map;mean squared error;muscle;muscle contraction;muscle function;root mean square;topography;physiological aspects	Bin Yu;Mingxing Zhu;Lisheng Xu;Guanglin Li	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6611077	speech recognition;engineering;biomechanics;physical therapy;physiology;anatomy	Visualization	13.203245229210992	-85.37854496705222	39941

This work used combinations of observations of skin temperature (T S ), heat flux (HF), and heart rate (HR) to accurately estimate T C using a Kalman Filter (KF). Data were collected from eight volunteers (age 22 ± 4 yr, height 1.75 ± 0.10 m, body mass 76.4 ± 10.7 kg, and body fat 23.4 ± 5.8%, mean ± standard deviation) while walking at two different metabolic rates (∼350 and ∼550 W) under three conditions (warm: 25 °C, 50% relative humidity (RH); hot-humid: 35 °C, 70% RH; and hot-dry: 40 °C, 20% RH). Skin temperature and HF data were collected from six locations: pectoralis, inner thigh, scapula, sternum, rib cage, and forehead. Kalman filter variables were learned via linear regression and covariance calculations between T C and T S , HF, and HR. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias were calculated to identify the best performing models. The pectoralis (RMSE 0.18 ± 0.04 °C; bias −0.01 ± 0.09 °C), rib (RMSE 0.18 ± 0.09 °C; bias −0.03 ± 0.09 °C), and sternum (RMSE 0.20 ± 0.10 °C; bias −0.04 ± 0.13 °C) were found to have the lowest error values when using T S , HF, and HR but, using only two of these measures provided similar accuracy.

Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve real-time continuous activity recognition as sensor data segmentation remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to real-time sensor data segmentation for continuous activity recognition. Central to the approach is a dynamic segmentation model, based on the notion of varied time windows, which can shrink and expand the segmentation window size by using temporal information of sensor data and activities as well as the state of activity recognition. The paper first analyzes the characteristics of activities of daily living from which the segmentation model that is applicable to a wide range of activity recognition scenarios is motivated and developed. It then describes the working mechanism and relevant algorithms of the model in the context of knowledge-driven activity recognition based on ontologies. The presented approach has been implemented in a prototype system and evaluated in a number of experiments. Results have shown average recognition accuracy above 83% in all experiments for real time activity recognition, which proves the approach and the underlying model.	activity recognition;real-time clock	George Okeyo;Liming Chen;Hui Wang;Roy Sterritt	2014	Pervasive and Mobile Computing	10.1016/j.pmcj.2012.11.004	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;ontology;data mining	HCI	1.7802350906746722	-84.81055363254849	40322

In a placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover study we investigated the effect of a single oral dose of citalopram on brain cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a pulsed ASL sequence (PASL) in twelve female healthy volunteers. The within-session repeatability of the PASL signal was good for all regions tested (wsCV<15%). Both ROI- and voxel-based analyses revealed small but significant effects of a citalopram challenge on CBF values in 5-HT rich brain regions, among which the frontal gyrus and thalamus. These effects could however not be replicated between sessions, most probably due to the small effect size of the oral citalopram challenge on cerebral blood flow. We therefore conclude that the test-retest reliability of PASL phMRI with an oral citalopram challenge is low, limiting the technique's sensitivity to time-dependent changes and consequently its use as a (clinical) research tool.	arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging;cerebrovascular circulation;citalopram;frontal lobe gyrus;ibm ssec;mental disorders;pharmacology;pierre robin syndrome;repeatability;serotonin uptake inhibitors;thalamic structure;voxel	A.

CSI is used to develop MIMO technology. We measure the waveform of the subcarriers that are exchanged during communication between WiFi devices, and create CSI information, which is then used as an input for a big data algorithm and provides device-free based information that can extract characteristic information about repeated human behavior. We propose a technique to recognize human motion and distinguish people using the Deep Learning algorithm for extracted CSI big data.	activity recognition;algorithm;big data;deep learning;kinesiology;mimo;subcarrier;waveform	Sang-Chul Kim	2017	2017 Ninth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2017.7993844	computer network;mimo;activity recognition;deep learning;big data;3g mimo;distributed computing;universal software radio peripheral;computer science;waveform;artificial intelligence;internet of things	Robotics	5.409178537194943	-83.15000612950021	40543

Several parameters of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) have been analyzed in previous works to predict AF termination by CA. Nevertheless, they are affected by some limitations, such as manual computation and the examination of a single ECG lead while neglecting contributions from other electrodes. AF spatio-temporal organization has been described on surface ECG by means of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between consecutive atrial activity (AA) signal segments and their reduced-rank approximations based on principal component analysis (PCA). However, these features do not show to be correlated with CA outcome. In this study, such descriptors are adequately adapted and applied to CA outcome prediction. An NMSE index is put forward, computed over the set of eight linearly independent ECG leads after AA signal rank-1 approximations determined by weighted principal component analysis (WPCA). The final predictor is able to discriminate between successful (70.76 ± 17.74) and failing CA procedures (37.54 ± 20.01) before performing the ablation (p-value = 0.0013, AUC = 0.91). The proposed WPCA-based technique emphasizes the most descriptive components of AF electrophysiology by selectively enhancing contributions coming from the most representative ECG leads. Our investigation confirms that ECG spatial diversity exploitation in this WPCA-based framework not only endows the NMSE index with clinical value in the context of CA outcome prediction, but it also improves classification accuracy and increases robustness to ECG lead selection. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

By selecting the proper components from the Gabor transform prior expansion we obtained good accuracy for heart beat and respiration rates. Also, with minor correction in frequency, the algorithm leads to usable heartbeat waveform, opening new doors for further information extraction.	arm cortex-m;arm architecture;algorithm;ambulances;architecture as topic;baseband;cardiopulmonary;central processing unit;coprocessor;curve fitting;digital signal processor;digitorenocerebral syndrome;float;information extraction;instrument - device;labview;microcontroller;monitoring device;preparation;radar;refinement (computing);respiratory rate;short-time fourier transform;signal transduction;stellaris;time–frequency analysis;waveform	Nicusor Birsan;Doru-Petru Munteanu	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346652	electronic engineering;time–frequency analysis;acoustics;telecommunications;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;machine learning;remote patient monitoring;quantum mechanics	EDA	12.584004125084743	-88.60359331139185	40634

The brain switch is operated through foot motor imagery (MI) and is based on the classification of event-related desynchronization (ERD) during a motor task or event-related synchronization (ERS) after the termination of the task (also known as the beta rebound). The methods described in this work are suitable for operating a brain–computer interface (BCI) as an attractive control alternative for healthy users. A general description of ERD/ERS is obtained with several band power features and a rigid paradigm timing. Two support vector machines (SVMs) are trained in a novel fashion by using the patterns from motor execution (ME) and a priori information about the significance of ERD/ ERS patterns. A maximum true positive rate (TPR) of 0.92 and a minimum of 0.43 was achieved (in 8 out of 9 subjects) during training of the classifiers; with a mean false positive rate (FPR) of 0.09 � 0.05. A simulation of an asynchronous BCI using MI data and the classifiers trained with ME data achieved a maximum TPR of 0.88, a minimum of 0.50 (in 6 out of 9 subjects) and an average FPR of 0.09 � 0.04.

b53bfd6289ca5ad2a74b160fd9fb45c70712b4e6	a semg classification framework with less training data		Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have been applied to surface electromyograph (sEMG) to classify user’s muscular states. This paper introduces a novel framework to design a binary sEMG classifier to distinguish if the user performs a repetitive motion with a dumbbell. This framework enables to reduce the number of tasks required for collecting training data as it utilizes prior knowledge of sEMG. The performance of the proposed classifier is validated experimentally. Experimental results show that the proposed framework enables the design of a classifier which distinguishes the user’s state with a 95.7% success rate. This accuracy is comparable to an accuracy of ANN classifier (99.6%), but with less training data. Under the identical training conditions, the accuracy of the proposed framework outperforms the ANN classifier whose accuracy drops to 65.6%.	algorithm;artificial neural network;dumbbell-shaped femur;electromyographs;electromyography;experiment;hepatitis b surface antigens;lifting scheme;machine learning;manuscripts;muscle;performance;polynomial;quadratic function;sensor;statistical classification;test set;exoskeleton	Daisuke Kaneishi;Robert Peter Matthew;Masayoshi Tomizuka	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512623	task analysis;computer vision;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;training set;computer science;machine learning	Mobile	14.191640579403645	-95.18218094493464	40861

Based on the wavelet packet analysis, the audio signals are divided into different frequency channels, and then the TKEO and the energy are estimated within each band. The Hidden Markov Models have been used as a classification tool to distinguish the voiced cry parts from the irrelevant acoustic activities that compose the audio signals. The proposed method divided the audio signal containing newborns' cry sounds into different periods showing the audible Expiration and Inspiration of the cry. Different levels of wavelet packet transform have been used to verify the performance of the proposed method on crying signals segmentation and have shown that based on wavelet packet decomposition, the TKEO measure is more effective than the traditional energy measure in detecting important parts of cry signal in a very noisy environment.

20cd1712ab07a32912e156f1d373abb7402b1959	end-to-end multimodal emotion recognition using deep neural networks		Automatic affect recognition is a challenging task due to the various modalities emotions can be expressed with. Applications can be found in many domains including multimedia retrieval and human–computer interaction. In recent years, deep neural networks have been used with great success in determining emotional states. Inspired by this success, we propose an emotion recognition system using auditory and visual modalities. To capture the emotional content for various styles of speaking, robust features need to be extracted. To this purpose, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the speech, while for the visual modality a deep residual network of 50 layers is used. In addition to the importance of feature extraction, a machine learning algorithm needs also to be insensitive to outliers while being able to model the context. To tackle this problem, long short-term memory networks are utilized. The system is then trained in an end-to-end fashion where—by also taking advantage of the correlations of each of the streams—we manage to significantly outperform, in terms of concordance correlation coefficient, traditional approaches based on auditory and visual handcrafted features for the prediction of spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA database of the AVEC 2016 research challenge on emotion recognition.	algorithm;artificial neural network;coefficient;concordance (publishing);convolutional neural network;database;deep learning;emotion recognition;end-to-end principle;experiment;feature extraction;flow network;human–computer interaction;long short-term memory;machine learning;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;recurrent neural network;spontaneous order;test set	Panagiotis Tzirakis;George Trigeorgis;Mihalis A.

Recent evidence of the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord that can be enhanced by repeated practice- such as that available with robotic devices- suggest that robotic training of upper limbs can be beneficial to persons with SCI. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate an innovative rehabilitation technique using the RiceWrist, a newly developed robotic device, for a person with tetraplegia. A 24-year-old male with incomplete SCI at the C4 level, 6.5 months post-injury participated in 10 sessions of robotic training over 2 weeks. Variability of movement trajectory (spatial) and the time to complete (temporal) simple point-to-point wrist and forearm movements were collected before and after training completion to determine skill acquisition. The participant successfully completed 10 sessions of robotic training. While there were minimal changes in variability of movement trajectory, great improvements were observed for the average movement time for the majority of wrist and forearm movements. Overall, results suggest that the RiceWrist robotic device could be used for upper-limb rehabilitation and can potentially serve as an assessment tool for the SCI population.	heart rate variability;point-to-point protocol;robot;spatial variability	Dillon P.

Though this whisker movement is well characterized, the role and effect of this movement on subsequent sensing is poorly understood. One method for investigating this phenomena is to generate artificial whisker deflections with robotic hardware under different movement conditions. A limitation of this approach is that assumptions must be made in the design of any artificial whisker actuators, which will impose certain restrictions on the whisker-object interaction. In this paper we present three robotic whisker platforms, each with different mechanical whisker properties and actuation mechanisms. A feature-based classifier is used to simultaneously discriminate radial distance to contact and contact speed for the first time. We show that whisker-object contact speed predictably affects deflection magnitudes, invariant of whisker material or whisker movement trajectory. We propose that rodent whisker control allows the animal to improve sensing accuracy by regulating contact speed induced touch-to-touch variability.	computer mouse;radial (radio);robot;spatial variability;touch sensation;vibrissae	Mathew H.

bcb8da62c544dfc84cd9828b3e31ff6dcefa3452	graph-based transfer learning for managing brain signals variability in nirs-based bcis		One of the major limitations to the use of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in realistic interaction settings is the long calibration time needed before every use in order to train a subject-specific classifier. One way to reduce this calibration time is to use data collected from other users or from previous recording sessions of the same user as a training set. However, brain signals are highly variable and using heterogeneous data to train a single classifier may dramatically deteriorate classification performance. This paper proposes a transfer learning framework in which we model brain signals variability in the feature space using a bipartite graph. The partitioning of this graph into sub-graphs allows creating homogeneous groups of NIRS data sharing similar spatial distributions of explanatory variables which will be used to train multiple prediction models that accurately transfer knowledge between data sets.	brain–computer interface;feature vector;heart rate variability;spatial variability;test set	Sami Dalhoumi;Gérard Derosière;Gérard Dray;Jacky Montmain;Stéphane Perrey	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08855-6_30	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining	AI	3.736150280450078	-82.91548799762369	41314

This method decomposes multichannel brain signals into subbands. The spatial filtering and feature extraction is then processed in each subband. The two-stage analysis of Fisher ratio and mutual information is carried out in the feature domain to reject the noisy feature indexes and select the most informative combination from the remaining. In the approach, we develop two practical solutions, avoiding the difficulties of using high dimensional mutual information in the application, that are the feature indexes clustering using cross mutual information and the latter estimation based on conditional empirical PDF. We test the proposed feature selection method on two BCI data sets and the results are at least comparable to the best results in the literature. The main advantage of proposed method is that the method is free from any time-consuming parameter tweaking and therefore suitable for the BCI system design.	brain–computer interface;cluster analysis;feature extraction;feature selection;fisher–yates shuffle;mutual information;portable document format;systems design;tweaking	Tran Huy Dat;Cuntai Guan	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366685	brain–computer interface;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;feature selection;feature	Robotics	15.397181397414723	-93.26402789403687	41319

AST is based on the Sensitivity Test described by the Standard CEI EN 45502-2-1 for pacemakers and consists of determining the ICD sensing thresholds at different heartbeat frequencies. Consequently, an extensive evaluation of ICD sensing performances can be achieved. AST has been implemented by means of virtual instruments developed in the Labview environment and has been validated experimentally through several tests. These have been performed inside an anechoic RF chamber. Such an environment guarantees proper shielding against external electromagnetic interferences, thus ensuring reliability and repeatability of the tests. The discussion of the results highlights the usefulness of the proposed procedure.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;experiment;implantable cardioverter-defibrillator;labview;performance;radio frequency;repeatability	Ivan Luigi Spano;Sara Sulis;Alessandro Serpi;Ignazio Marongiu;Gianluca Gatto;Vincenzo Nissardi	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings	10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145196	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;biological engineering	Embedded	11.149185832873222	-88.20095809122598	41409

The vast majority of BCI systems rely on feature vectors derived from e.g., bandpower or univariate adaptive autoregressive (AAR) parameters. However, ample evidence suggests that additional information is obtained by quantifying the relationship between signals of single electrodes, which might provide innovative features for future BCI systems. This paper investigates one method to extract the degree of phase synchronization between two electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by calculating the so-called phase locking value (PLV). In our offline study, several PLV-based features were acquired and the optimal feature set was selected for each subject individually by a feature selection algorithm. The online sessions with three trained subjects revealed that all subjects were able to control three mental states (motor imagery of left hand, right hand, and foot, respectively) with single-trial accuracies between 60% and 66.7% (33% would be expected by chance) throughout the whole session	adaptive grammar;association for automated reasoning;autoregressive model;brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography phase desynchronization;electroencephalography phase synchronization;feature selection;feature vector;guided imagery;interface device component;lock (computer science);mental state;online and offline;randomness;selection algorithm;two-phase locking;electrode;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Clemens Brunner;Reinhold Scherer;Bernhard Graimann;Gernot G.

We present a data analysis method for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the narrow-band steady-state response in the frequency and time-frequency domains. The method, termed rhythmic entrainment source separation (RESS), is based on denoising source separation approaches that take advantage of the simultaneous but differential projection of neural activity to multiple electrodes or sensors. Our approach is a combination and extension of existing multivariate source separation methods. We demonstrate that RESS performs well on both simulated and empirical data, and outperforms conventional SSEP analysis methods based on selecting electrodes with the strongest SSEP response, as well as several other linear spatial filters. We also discuss the potential confound of overfitting, whereby the filter captures noise in absence of a signal. Matlab scripts are available to replicate and extend our simulations and methods. We conclude with some practical advice for optimizing SSEP data analyses and interpreting the results.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;brainwave entrainment;matlab;noise reduction;optimizing compiler;overfitting;self-replicating machine;separation anxiety disorder;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;source separation;steady state;electrode;sensor (device)	Michael X.

Using HINE, especially for preterm or premature babies, the risk of neural disorder can be minimized through proper preventive measures. This paper presents the design of a semi-automatic application that can be used as an aid to doctors for efficiently conducting the examinations listed in the Hammersmith chart. The user friendly version of the examination interface provides a platform for quantitative neurological assessment of the infants. It includes various simplified video and image based schemes that are suited to inexperienced staff. It provides an interface to go through the previous records of patients. Ten examinations are enlisted in the Hammersmith chart for neonatal babies. This paper examines a semi-automatic approach for posture estimation examination. For post neonatal infants, a follow-up management interface is designed that can be used to fetch / consult past records of the patients for better diagnosis.

However, a lot of previous scientific papers reported that 95% of obesity patients would not be able to control their weight by the diet. The surgical operation has been considered to the subjects with severe obesity. But, there is a possibility of complication or comorbidity in surgical operation. Tohoku University started to develop the expanding capsule with transcutaneous energy transmission system (TETS) having the same effect as the surgical operation. The capsule in the stomach will expand mechanically by energy transmission from outsides of the body, when the obesity patients will felt hungry. Small linear drive with folding umbrella type actuator would enable us the expansion of the diet capsules. Satisfactory characteristic of the energy transmission was obtained by the trial model of TETS during animal experiments. Animal experiments with healthy adult goats enabled us the evaluation of the inner stomach pressure time series changes, and feasibility study. Double blind test of the expanding capsule is now under planning. If the expanding capsule diet control system will be embodied, it becomes the gospel of the obese subject.	actuator device component;artificial organs;cessation of life;control system;experiment;gastric tissue;obesity;obesity, morbid;paper;patients;scientific literature;stigler diet;time series;capsule (pharmacologic)	Tomoyuki Yambe;Yasuyuki Shiraishi;Hidekazu Miura;Norihiro Sugita;Makoto Yoshizawa	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610854	obesity;medicine;pathology;biomechanics;time series;biological engineering;geriatrics;physiology;surgery;statistics	Robotics	11.484795453702999	-82.11127146074098	41494

Because of the inevitable intraclass variation of pulse patterns, the automatic classification of pulse waveforms has remained a difficult problem. In this paper, by referring to the edit distance with real penalty (ERP) and the recent progress in k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers, we propose two novel ERP-based KNN classifiers. Taking advantage of the metric property of ERP, we first develop an ERP-induced inner product and a Gaussian ERP kernel, then embed them into difference-weighted KNN classifiers, and finally develop two novel classifiers for pulse waveform classification. The experimental results show that the proposed classifiers are effective for accurate classification of pulse waveform.	algorithmic efficiency;erp;edit distance;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;sensor;signal processing;statistical classification;tcp wrapper;time series;waveform	Dongyu Zhang;Wangmeng Zuo;David Zhang;Hongzhi Zhang;Naimin Li	2010	EURASIP J.

The sensors' data are collected and processed using a microcontroller, then, the data will be stored on a cloud to form a permanent record, as well as, to facilitate the diagnosis and the real-time monitoring for doctors, which plays a vital role in the patients' rehabilitation and healing process. To fulfill this, a web interface is created that gives doctors the authority to access all patients' medical records and monitor their health statuses. Furthermore, to detect whether the patient will suffer from unpredicted fall, a fall detection system is also considered. The system is composed of a microcontroller, voice recognition module, accelerometer and a gyroscope.

In this study, a new system for inducing variations in mean ABP was designed, implemented and tested using programmable sequences and programmable controls to induce pressure changes through bilateral thigh cuffs. The system is also integrated with a computer-controlled switch to select air or a CO2/air mixture to be provided via a face mask. Adaptive feedback control of a pressure generator was required to meet stringent specifications for fast changes, and accuracy in timing and pressure levels applied by the thigh cuffs. The implemented system consists of a PC-based signal analysis/control unit, a pressure control unit and a CO2/air control unit. Initial evaluations were carried out to compare the cuff pressure control performances between adaptive and non-adaptive control configurations. Results show that the adaptive control method can reduce the mean error in sustaining target pressure by 99.57 % and reduce the transient time in pressure increases by 45.21 %. The system has proven a highly effective tool in ongoing research on brain blood flow control.	adaptive system;alternating bit protocol;benign childhood cerebral neoplasm;bilateral filter;carbon dioxide;control flow;control system;control theory;control unit;evaluation;expectation propagation;experiment;feedback;inspiration function;performance;providing (action);response time (technology);secret sharing;signal processing;specification	Lingke Fan;Glen Bush;Emmanuel Katsogridakis;David M.

e926220947375a9e2c2e6427396362ca26b43efb	adaptive modulation spectral filtering for improved electrocardiogram quality enhancement		Advances in portable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring devices has allowed for new cardiovascular applications to emerge beyond diagnostics, such as stress detection, sleep disorder characterization, mood recognition, activity surveillance, or fitness monitoring, to name a few. Such devices, however, are prone to artifacts, particularly due to movement, thus rendering heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) metrics useless. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new ECG quality enhancement algorithm based on filtering in the so-called spectro-temporal (or modulation spectral) domain. Our experiments show that this new signal representation accurately separates ECG signal and noise components, thus allowing for adaptive filtering to improve signal quality even in extremely noisy settings. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforming a state-of-the-art wavelet-based enhancement algorithm in terms of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, as well as ECG kurtosis; the latter has been widely used in the literature as an ECG quality index. The obtained findings suggest that the proposed algorithm can be used to enhance the quality of wearable ECG monitors even in extreme conditions, thus can play a key role in athletic peak performance training/monitoring.	adaptive filter;algorithm;benchmark (computing);experiment;heart rate variability;modulation;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelet;wearable computer	Diana P.

Practical usage of BCIs requires that the whole BCI system be portable so that disabled subjects can use them anywhere. The key aspect in mobility is to use mobile devices for processing by developing software applications with low-computational complexity. In this thesis, a low-computational P300 speller application is developed for Android using an Emotiv wireless EEG neuroheadset. Given the limited resources of mobile devices, a novel ensemble classifier approach is proposed that uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features to identify evoked P300 signals from EEG recordings. The performance of the method is demonstrated on benchmark data and on our own data. Results demonstrate the capability of the PCA ensemble classifier to classify P300 data recorded using the Emotiv neuroheadset with an average online classification accuracy of 97.22%.	android;benchmark (computing);brain–computer interface;computational complexity theory;electroencephalography;emotiv systems;ensemble learning;mobile device;principal component analysis	Amr S.

Electroencephalography (EEG) represents an effective tool to allow the implementation of a BCI. The present paper describes a modular framework for the implementation of the graphic interface for binary BCIs based on the selection of symbols in a table. The proposed system is also designed to reduce the time required for writing text. This is made by including a motivational tool, necessary to improve the quality of the collected signals, and by containing a predictive module based on the frequency of occurrence of letters in a language, and of words in a dictionary. The proposed framework is described in a top-down approach through its modules: signal acquisition, analysis, classification, communication, visualization, and predictive engine. The framework, being modular, can be easily modified to personalize the graphic interface to the needs of the subject who has to use the BCI and it can be integrated with different classification strategies, communication paradigms, and dictionaries/languages. The implementation of a scenario and some experimental results on healthy subjects are also reported and discussed: the modules of the proposed scenario can be used as a starting point for further developments, and application on severely disabled people under the guide of specialized personnel.	body of uterus;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;contain (action);dictionary [publication type];drag and drop;electroencephalography phase synchronization;execution;graphical user interface;html;interface device component;machine learning;manuscripts;page (document);personalization;programming languages;server (computer);server (computing);signal processing;statistical classification;text corpus;top-down and bottom-up design;web server	Giuseppe Placidi;Andrea Petracca;Matteo Spezialetti;Daniela Iacoviello	2015	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-015-0402-4	simulation;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Web+IR	11.54768365996981	-94.01938562116136	42270

An early accurate prediction increases the usability and the comfort of a prosthetic device. This work proposes an electromyographic-based learning approach that decodes the grasping intention at an early stage of reach-to-grasp motion, i.e. before the final grasp/hand pre-shape takes place. Superficial electrodes and a Cyberglove were used to record the arm muscle activity and the finger joints during reach-to-grasp motions. Our results showed a 90% accuracy for the detection of the final grasp about 0.5 s aftermotion onset. This paper also examines the effect of different objects’ distances and different motion speeds on the detection time and accuracy of the classifier. The use of our learning approach to control a 16-degrees of freedom robotic hand confirmed the usability of our approach for the real-time control of robotic devices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The study took place over 9 sets of Zen meditations in a quiet, Zen practice hall. Each set of Zazen lasted at least for 25 minutes. The first sets were used for habituation, and the data obtained from the following eight sets were used for analysis, where 2 modes of LAM tension, i.e., intentional LAM contraction (LAMC) and LAM relaxation (LAMR), were allocated alternately. Power spectrum analysis showed distinctive change in frequency components. High frequency (HF) components increased for LAMC (p=0.05). Most notably, detrended fluctuations analysis (DFA) of HRV were around 1/2 for LAMC and 0.82 for LAMR. During Zen practice, we seat ourselves in a lotus posture with LAMC, practice lower abdominal (Tanden) breathing, and keep mind free from specific state of consciousness. We attribute the increase of HF components and decrease of DFA exponent in LAMC to the parasympathetic stimulation, and to the minimal use of antigravity muscles in the optimal posture generated by LAMC, as contrasted with the active use of antigravity muscles in the unstable posture during LAMR.	consciousness;control theory;creative zen;edge contraction;heart rate variability;hemodynamics;linear programming relaxation;poor posture;spectral density;woo–lam	Masaki Hoshiyama;Asagi Hoshiyama	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014		psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;surgery	HCI	16.25651494145164	-81.37516310715236	42433
0ac82d5e7bad7310da5798d0da9a8dfd6fef96e8	study on relationship between foot pressure pattern and hallux valgus (hv) progression		Hallux valgus is one of the most common foot deformities. Plantar pressure technologies are used widely for determination of biomechanical changes in foot during walking. There are already published claims relating to the pressure distribution of HV condition. However some of these claims are disputed and challenged. Although, disputed or otherwise, association of HV to sole pressure widely presented as a means of identifying such condition. Or knowing that HV exist, establishing what kind of pressure variation is expected may lead to better foot wear design for HV patients. Despite of extensive work on sole pressure patterns of patients, there has been no reported work found on conditions which leads to HV. Considering the fact that 23% of adults develop such condition during their life time, understanding HV is badly needed. To have better understanding of how plantar pressure patterns can be linked to the deformity progression or existence, extracting some patterns out of force and pressure measurements can be beneficial in recognising the patients with and without deformity during their gait cycle. We examined the dynamic changes of the forces that applied to the whole sole of the feet in control group and in the patients group when they walked at different speeds. It was observed for those with HV condition having higher forces on 2 and 3 metatarsal heads, and less force on the 1 metatarsal head compared to those without the condition. Although this finding was previously reported in the literature what was new was the fact that, speed of walking shown to have a significant influences on plantar force distribution. This finding in itself is significant as no sole pressure distribution given in conjunction with walking speed in the past. It was observed that there was significant variability of pressure distribution of the same individual from one trial to another indicating that getting consistent pressure pattern is an important hurdle to overcome. After many trials individuals’ walking regulated giving consistent readings. After achieving this, it was further discovered that pressure pattern very much depended on walking speed. Considering the fact that inconsistency of pressure of unregulated (casual) walking and variability of due to speed raises doubts of validity of previously published work on HV which ignored such factors. Having said that, in our studies too, raised loading is observed on Metatarsal 2 and, 3 although it was not possible to give statistical significance to these finding. Although the Study on Relationship between Foot Pressure Pattern and HV Progression 77 loading on metatarsal 2 and 3 may indicate existence of HV, in authors’ opinion, there is little chance of using pressure pattern as a predictive tool as no such pressure increase observed on those appeared to be at the start of HV condition or any individual with normal feet.

Information on how the amplitude and morphology of the recorded signal changes with the distance from the source tissue undergoing depolarization can help to better understand unipolar electrograms fractionation and provide insights into the passive conduction properties of the atrial tissue. Ten second unipolar atrial fibrillation (AF) electrograms were recorded using high-density electrode array from the posterior left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) of 19 (8 persistent - PERS & 11 paroxysmal - PAF) AF patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Conduction along lines of conduction block was detected in the recorded activation patterns by a proposed automated algorithm. Changes of the amplitude of the unipolar electrogram with increasing distance from the conduction blocks were assessed and compared to predictions of a theoretical model. For each recording, the median far-field decay space constant (FF0.5) was calculated. Overall, we found a significant difference between FF0.5 for patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF. Estimation of maximum FF0.5 from both RA and LA resulted in a mean FF0.5 of 1.5±0.2 mm for PERS patients and 2.1±0.6 mm for PAF patients (p=0.03). Moreover, detected conduction blocks demonstrated high spatial organization and appeared in distinctive areas of the mapped area in all patients, regardless of the type of AF, while the total number of detected block lines was higher in PERS patients.	anisotropic filtering;discrepancy function;dose-fractionation theorem;field effect (semiconductor);galaxy morphological classification;heart atrium;heart block;left atrial structure;paroxysmal atrial fibrillation;patients;platelet activating factor;right atrial structure;spatial organization;theory;traffic collision avoidance system;unipolar depression;ventricular fibrillation;algorithm;electrical activity	Piotr Podziemski;Pawel Kuklik;Arne van Hunnik;Stef Zeemering;Bart Maesen;Ulrich Schotten	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319681	text mining;medical research;medicine;computer science;electrical engineering;biological engineering;cardiology	Visualization	19.40707240117594	-81.51073469495294	42864

1ccf036d9724d2b91a4b959ebcad9944613c5d33	real-time estimation of eye gaze by in-ear electrodes		Cognitive control of a hearing aid is the topic for several ongoing studies. The relevance of these studies should be seen in the light of inadequate steering of current hearing aids. While most studies are concerned with auditory attention tracking from the electroencephalogram (EEG), a complimentary approach may be to use visual attention tracking to steer the devices. Visual attention may be characterized by gaze direction, which can be obtained by electrooculography (EOG). EOG may be recorded from electrodes placed in the ear canal, termed EarEOG. To test the comparison of conventional EOG and EarEOG recordings, we conducted two experiments with six subjects. In the first experiment, the subjects were instructed to follow a moving dot on the screen moving in large saccades. In the second experiment, there were five large targets, and within each target, the dot had minor movements. When comparing conventional EOG and EarEOG, correlations of 0.9 and 0.91 with standard deviations of 0.02 were obtained for the two experiments respectively. To assess the feasibility of using EarEOG in real-time, correlation between EarEOG and the timecourse of the dot position was performed. When both signals were filtered with the same real-time applicable filter, correlations of 0.83 and 0.85 with standard deviations of 0.09 and 0.05 were found respectively to the two experiments. In conclusion, this study provides motivational aspects of using EarEOG to estimate eye gaze, as well as it identifies important future challenges in real-time applications to steer external devices such as a hearing aid.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;electroencephalography phase synchronization;electrooculography;experiment;external auditory canal structure;hearing aids;hearing problem;movement;real-time clock;real-time transcription;relevance;saccades;electrode	Antoine Favre-Félix;Carina Graversen;Torsten Dau;Thomas Lunner	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037754	ear canal;artificial intelligence;computer vision;electrooculography;computer science;hearing aid;electroencephalography;eye tracking	HCI	10.922065319892063	-91.88322112670262	43096
52ad25136ce7f263c3ae3e5f7b544c22beab2c9f	personalizing a generic ecg heartbeat classification for arrhythmia detection: a deep learning approach		We propose an end-to-end model for generic and personalized ECG arrhythmic heartbeat detection on ECG data from both wearable and non-wearable devices. We first develop a deep learning based model to address the challenging problem caused by inter-patient differences in ECG signal patterns. This model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for ECG heartbeat arrhythmia detection on the commonly used benchmark dataset from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. We then utilize our model in an active learning process to perform patient-adaptive heartbeat classification tasks on the non-wearable ECG dataset from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the wearable ECG dataset from the DeepQ Arrhythmia Database. Results show that our personalization model requires a query of less than 5% of data from each new patient, significantly improves the precision of disease detection from the generic model on each new subject, and reaches nearly 100% accuracy in normal and VEB beat predictions on both databases.	active learning (machine learning);algorithm;artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);bounding interval hierarchy;database;deep learning;end-to-end principle;feature learning;heuristic;iteration;machine learning;map;naive bayes classifier;network model;one-shot learning;personalization;spatial variability;user experience;wearable computer;wearable technology	Meng-Hsi Wu;Emily J.

The long term goal of this work is development of novel computational tools to support the study of addiction in the context of cocaine use. The current paper takes the first step in this important direction by posing a simple, but crucial question: Can cocaine use be reliably detected using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors? The main contributions in this paper include the presentation of a novel clinical study of cocaine use, the development of a computational pipeline for inferring morphological features from noisy ECG waveforms, and the evaluation of feature sets for cocaine use detection. Our results show that 32mg/70kg doses of cocaine can be detected with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve levels above 0.9 both within and between-subjects.	receiver operating characteristic;sensor;wearable computer	Annamalai Natarajan;Abhinav Parate;Edward Gaiser;Gustavo Angarita;Robert Malison;Benjamin M.

Accumulated data is essential for monitoring vital signs and tracking the dynamics of the treatment process of disabled patients or patients undergoing the recovery after traumatic knee joint injury (e.g. post-operative rehabilitation). The main goal of employing the wearable sensor system is to conduct rehabilitation process more effectively and increase the rate of successful rehabilitation. The results of data analysis of patient’s vital signs and feedback allow a physiotherapist to adjust the rehabilitation scenario on the fly.

No single modality or combinations of modalities can be applied universally that is best for all applications. This paper deliberates different combinations of physiological biometric modalities with different levels of fusion. In our experiments, we have selected Face, Palmprint, Finger Knuckle Print, Iris, and Handvein modalities. All the modalities are of image type and publicly available, comprising at least 100 users. Proper selection of modalities for fusion can yield desired level of performance. Through our experiments it is learnt that a multimodal system which is considered just by increasing number of modalities by fusion would not yield the desired level of performance. Many alternate options for increased performance are presented.	biometrics;multimodal interaction	Mohammad Imran;Ashok Rao;S. Noushath;G.

Specifically, acceleration and ventilation measured by a wearable multi-sensor device on 50 test subjects performing 13 types of activities of varying intensities are analyzed, from which the activity types and related energy expenditures are derived. The result shows that the method correctly recognized the 13 activity types 84.7% of the time, which is 26% higher than using a hip accelerometer alone. Also, the method predicted the associated energy expenditure with a root mean square error of 0.43 METs, 43% lower than using a hip accelerometer alone. Furthermore, the fusion method was effective in reducing the subject-to-subject variability (standard deviation of recognition accuracies across subjects) in activity recognition, especially when data from the ventilation sensor was added to the fusion model. These results demonstrate that the multi-sensor fusion technique presented is more effective in assessing activities of varying intensities than the traditional accelerometer-alone based methods.	activity recognition;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;energy metabolism;exercise;mean squared error;metastatic neoplasm;numerous;respiration;sensor web;spatial variability;support vector machine;wearable computer;accelerometers;algorithm	Shaopeng Liu;Robert X.

The aim of this study was to classify different sets of EEG signals by using Hilbert transform and artificial neural networks (ANN). The EEG data used in this study has been acquired from database of Epileptology Department of Bonn University. The database constitutes of five data sets, namely A, B, C, D and E. Besides, each data set has a difference due to healthy/epileptic subject, eyes open/closed, the position of electrode, seizure-free or seizure activity. A-B, A-E, C-D and A-B-E signal groups are classified with each other. For classification, magnitude and phase difference components obtained with Hilbert transform were used. To get the different frequency (theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (12-38Hz), all (0.5-40Hz)) band, the signal filtered with band pass filter. The classification result of phase difference is higher than the amplitude based result. The highest performances of data sets are; 100% for A-B (phase difference, 0.5-40Hz, 7×30×2 network structure), 99.93% for A-E (phase difference, theta band, 7×75×2 network structure), 99.68% for C-D (phase difference, 0.5-40Hz, 7×30×2 network structure) and 97.72% for A-B-E (phase difference, theta, 7×20×3 network structure).	artificial neural network;electroencephalography;hilbert transform;performance	Mesut Seker;Mehmet Siraç Özerdem	2016	2016 24th Signal Processing and Communication Application Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2016.7496148	speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	16.952235755198153	-90.27908758607995	43692

6fd227f9fdb164658f041780489127674bacb86d	wi-play: robust human activity recognition for somatosensory game using wi-fi signals		Existing somatosensory games mainly use vision-based methods, which are affected easily by Line-of-Sight (LOS), occlusions, complex background, wearable devices, and so on. To address these limitations, we propose Wi-Play, a robust human activity recognition system using Wi-Fi signals. Based on the intuition that a specified activity introduces a unique pattern in the time-series of waveform for Channel State Information (CSI-waveform), Wi-Play leverages the unique pattern in the CSI-waveform values as the indicator of human activities. Wi-Play consists of two commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi devices, a TP-LINK TL-WR842N router as the transmitter and an Intel NUC D54250WYKH laptop as the receiver. As our major contributions, we propose a human activity detection algorithm for the extraction of CSI-waveform, build multi-classifiers to recognize human activities, and implement a real-time human activity recognition system using a series of novel technologies. Wi-Play achieves more than 88.3 % average recognition accuracy for recognizing human activities.	activity recognition	Xiaoxiao Cao;Bing Chen;Yanchao Zhao	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48674-1_19	computer vision;speech recognition	HCI	5.464841014233035	-83.27527877977607	44375

Six features were extracted from filtered spikes, including a newly developed feature, and a separability index was applied to select optimal features. Using a set of the three highest-performing features, which includes the new feature, this method can achieve spike classification error as low as 5% for the worst case noise level of 0.2. The computational complexity is only 11% of principle component analysis method and it only costs nine registers per channel.	benign rolandic epilepsy;best, worst and average case;computational complexity theory;feature extraction;filtered-popping recursive transition network;information;linear separability;noise (electronics);noise reduction;principal component analysis;real-time clock;sorting	Yuning Yang;Samuel Boling;Amir Eftekhar;Sivylla E.

Two wearable inertial sensors are placed near the wrist and elbow joints, respectively. The measurement drift in segment orientation is dramatically reduced after a Kalman filter is applied to estimate inclinations using accelerations and turning rates from gyroscopes. Using premeasured lengths of the upper and lower arms, we compute the position of the wrist and elbow joints via a proposed kinematic model. Experimental results demonstrate that this new motion capture system, in comparison to an optical motion tracker, possesses an RMS position error of less than 0.009 m, with a drift of less than 0.005 ms-1 in five daily activities. In addition, the RMS angle error is less than 3°. This indicates that the proposed approach has performed well in terms of accuracy and reliability.	authorization;coat of arms;cross-validation (statistics);ieee xplore;kalman filter;motion capture;motion detector;sensor;wearable computer	Huiyu Zhou;Huosheng Hu	2010	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2025065	kalman filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;biomechanics;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	11.642108348367657	-85.24243414376994	44619

Four new featured characteristics of the signals, namely activity, complexity, mobility and the spectral peaks from the power spectral density plots are used as input to the neural network. Ninety-four PCG signals for three heart diseases were used in this study to test the accuracy of the neural networks. After the signals are filtered and the feature characteristics are extracted, the features are fed to the neural networks. Classification is carried using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network and the Back Propagation Network (BPN) techniques. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is calculated to measure the accuracy for both structures. The results show that RBF provided 98% accuracy in predicting the disease compared with 90.8% for BPN. The developed artificial intelligence algorithm has been shown to be a powerful technique in automatic diagnosis of heart diseases using PCG signals.	algorithm;artificial intelligence system;artificial neural network;business process network;radial (radio);radial basis function network;receiver operating characteristic;software propagation;spectral density	Ibrahim Abdel-Motaleb;Rohit Akula	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology	10.1109/EIT.2012.6220714	radial basis function;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;backpropagation;machine learning;accuracy and precision;spectral density;receiver operating characteristic;heart;artificial neural network	Robotics	17.864971404933083	-90.16364975352494	44672

In this study, we aim to utilize TUG test to estimate disability level of community dwelling elderly participants. Forty features are extracted from single wrist mounted accelerometer signals which are recorded in home environment from the 321 participants performing TUG test. As an initial exploratory analysis, linear discriminant classifier is used to estimate the disability levels. The study compares models built using features extracted from accelerometer signals with the standard measure which is the time taken to complete the test. The developed accelerometer model has yielded a mean accuracy of 62.16% outperforming the standard measure with a mean accuracy of 39.10%. The obtained results show that TUG test has an ability to classify disability levels and accelerometer has an added value in evaluations and monitoring progression of disability levels.	color gradient;linear discriminant analysis	Sathish K.

The first method is based on a modular probabilistic network architecture that employs multiple dependant hidden Markov models (DM-HMM-D) on the input features (channels). The second method, eClass, is based on an on-line evolvable fuzzy rule base of EEG signal prototypes that represent each class and take into consideration the spatial proximity between input signals. Both approaches use supervised learning but differ in their mode of operation. eClass is designed recursively, on-line, and has an evolvable structure, while DM-HMM-D is trained off-line, in a block-based mode, and has a fixed architecture. Both methods have been extensively tested on real EEG data that is recorded during several experimental sessions involving a single female subject who is exposed to mild pain induced by a laser beam. Experimental results illustrate the viability of the proposed approaches and their potential in solving similar classification problems.	block cipher mode of operation;diabetes mellitus;electroencephalography;fuzzy rule;hidden markov model;markov chain;network architecture;online and offline;pain;recursion;rule-based system;statistical classification;supervised learning	Costas S.

1238a20f30841037bec0e1ce0fcf919ef271a5ef	an exploratory analysis targeting diagnostic classification of aac app usage patterns		Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) apps are apps that enable non-speech communicative forms. One class of AAC apps are speech-generating devices (SGDs), where icons/pictures are tapped to produce spoken words. These apps are widely used to support communication and language learning for individuals with disabilities such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given that these apps are used in everyday scenarios, they can generate massive streams of data, providing a wealth of information regarding individual usage patterns and for developing usage model profiles. However, the utility and potential of these streams of data has been little explored from a data mining perspective. The objective of this study is to evaluate several feature representations of usage patterns, coupled with data mining and data modelling techniques, for identifying differences in AAC usage patterns between users with and without ASD. The study is conducted using data streams aggregated from an AAC app called FreeSpeech, specifically designed for individuals with learning disabilities and ASD. Several feature representations for modeling usage profiles based on temporal, behavioral and frequency of usage, are investigated. The potential of each usage representation is assessed using a collection of well-known and well-established learning methods such as support vector machine and ensemble learning. While, in general, prediction performance was only slightly above chance in most representations, results from unsupervised class labeling experiments showed promising results regarding the potential of stationary keypress usage representations with bootstrapped ensembles for separating ASD from non-ASD users.	advanced audio coding;data mining;data modeling;ensemble learning;event (computing);experiment;streams;speech-generating device;stationary process;support vector machine	Adham Atyabi;Beibin Li;Amy Yeo-jin Ahn;Minah Kim;Erin Barney;Frédérick Shic	2017	2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966047	machine learning;support vector machine;artificial intelligence;language acquisition;data modeling;augmentative and alternative communication;data stream mining;bootstrapping;computer science;ensemble learning;learning disability	HCI	-1.4986549613265199	-86.63845216633933	44924

This is due to the characteristics of the IoT (Internet of Things), which allows data to be measured and transmitted at any time, anywhere. In this study, we developed a health data collection platform that stores and transmits the foot pressure data of Parkinson patients using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). The platform can be used to collect the foot pressure of a large number of Parkinson's patients. Based on the accumulated data, it is possible to identify abnormal behaviors such as walking pattern, tilt and instability of stride length in patients with Parkinson's disease. Based on the results of this study, accurate diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease can be made.

In the case of single channel data, many conventional techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) cannot be directly applied. SSA is a powerful tool to analyze such data. However, the corresponding subspace of the desired signal component should be identified manually. In this work, EMD is used to supervise this procedure in places where the sources are narrowband. The results of applying the method to synthetic and real EEG data show that the supervised SSA can separate the single channel signal components automatically.	electroencephalography;hilbert–huang transform;independent component analysis;source separation;supervised learning;synthetic intelligence	Samaneh Kouchaki;Saeid Sanei	2013	2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)	10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661895	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	20.95928534748151	-89.67801196740949	45224

Our goal is to show that kinematic features and pressure features in handwriting can be used for the differential diagnosis of PD.   METHODS AND MATERIAL The database contains records from 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls performing eight different handwriting tasks. The tasks include drawing an Archimedean spiral, repetitively writing orthographically simple syllables and words, and writing of a sentence. In addition to the conventional kinematic features related to the dynamics of handwriting, we investigated new pressure features based on the pressure exerted on the writing surface. To discriminate between PD patients and healthy subjects, three different classifiers were compared: K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), ensemble AdaBoost classifier, and support vector machines (SVM).   RESULTS For predicting PD based on kinematic and pressure features of handwriting, the best performing model was SVM with classification accuracy of Pacc=81.3% (sensitivity Psen=87.4% and specificity of Pspe=80.9%). When evaluated separately, pressure features proved to be relevant for PD diagnosis, yielding Pacc=82.5% compared to Pacc=75.4% using kinematic features.   CONCLUSION Experimental results showed that an analysis of kinematic and pressure features during handwriting can help assess subtle characteristics of handwriting and discriminate between PD patients and healthy controls.

Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by high level of sugar in the blood, and considered as the fastest growing long-term disease affecting millions of people globally. The study measures the blood glucose level using sensor patch through diffused reflectance spectra on the inner side of the forearm. The Arduino microcontroller does the processing of the information from the sensor patch while the Bluetooth module wirelessly transmits to the android device the measured glucose level for storing, interpreting and displaying. Results showed that there is no significant between the measured values using the commercially available glucose meter and the created device.

c47f2c5b95b40c456b7e339d7e498a51feb8f8e9	combined signal averaging and electrocardiographic imaging method to non-invasively identify atrial and ventricular tachycardia mechanisms		Current clinical electrocardiographic imaging (ECGi) aims to reconstruct epicardial signals using a single selected beat. However, minor sources of error that can be present on a beat-to-beat basis may affect the result, complicating arrhythmia mechanism identification and thus diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we applied signal averaging (SA) to ECGi on atrial and ventricular tachycardia diagnosis compared to a single beat approach. For that, a multi-lead SA algorithm was applied to QRS-complexes or atrial activity to obtain a robust template. Datasets came from patients with confirmed tachycardia obtained by invasive diagnosis. The non-invasive diagnosis was compared to the invasive with activation time maps and other clinical features in order to evaluate the contribution of SA versus the single beat approach (SB). The outcomes indicate that signal averaging improves the quality of non-invasive diagnosis for tachycardia reducing the diagnosis variability and the cycle length error (from 28% with SB to 13% with SA).	algorithm;heart rate variability;map;sandy bridge;signal averaging	Corentin Dallet;Josselin Duchateau;Mélèze Hocini;Laura Bear;Marianna Meo;Frédéric Sacher;Michel Haïssaguerre;Rémi Dubois	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		medicine;biological engineering;medical emergency;cardiology	AI	16.638662666934657	-85.61351417430059	45923

Clinical spirometers, however, are expensive and have limited portability. Vortex whistles have shown promise as a potential substitute for clinical spirometers. While vortex whistles are low-cost and are highly portable, only a subset of common spirometry measurements can be measured reliably. Moreover, no research studies have evaluated characteristics of human interaction with vortex whistles, such as maneuver learnability and mental effort. We present a modified 3D-printed vortex whistle design that enables estimation of spirometry measures not previously attainable with traditional vortex whistles. We evaluate the whistle using a pulmonary waveform generator (a commercial standard) and map parameters of the whistle construction to spirometry test endpoints. Through a human subjects trial we evaluate how to personalize whistle parameters for different subjects and assess cognitive workload while using a vortex whistle. We show that, with personalization, vortex whistles are as effective as clinical spirometers for identifying moderate airway obstruction and require similar cognitive load to use.	3d printing;hoc (programming language);iteration;learnability;mobile app;personalization;robertson–seymour theorem;smartphone;the daily telegraph;vortex	Spencer A.

In most of the representation learning approaches, the connectionist systems have been used to learn and extract latent features from the fixed length data. In this paper, we propose an approach to combine the learned features and the MFCC features for speaker recognition task, which can be applied to audio scripts of different lengths. In particular, we study the use of features from different levels of deep belief network for quantizing the audio data into vectors of audio word counts. These vectors represent the audio scripts of different lengths that make them easier to train a classifier. We show in the experiment that the audio word count vectors generated from mixture of DBN features at different layers give better performance than the MFCC features. We also can achieve further improvement by combining the audio word count vector and the MFCC features.	bayesian network;coefficient;computation;computational resource;connectionism;deep belief network;exploit (computer security);feature learning;graphics processing unit;machine learning;mel-frequency cepstrum;speaker recognition;statistical classification;time complexity	Hazrat Ali;Son N.

While the body of evidence about the effect of tACS on behavioral and cognitive performance is constantly growing, those studies fail to address the importance of subjectspecific stimulation protocols. With this study here, we set the foundation to combine tACS with a recently presented framework that utilizes real-time fRMI and Bayesian optimization in order to identify the most optimal tACS protocol for a given individual. While Bayesian optimization is particularly relevant to such a scenario, its success depends on two fundamental choices: the choice of covariance kernel for the Gaussian process prior as well as the choice of acquisition function that guides the search. Using empirical (functional neuroimaging) as well as simulation data, we identified the squared exponential kernel and the upper confidence bound acquisition function to work best for our problem. These results will be used to inform our upcoming realtime experiments.	bayesian optimization;cognition;deep brain stimulation;experiment;gaussian process;kernel (operating system);mathematical optimization;real-time clock;simulation;time complexity;transcranial alternating current stimulation;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Romy Lorenz;Ricardo Pio Monti;Adam Hampshire;Yury Koush;Christoforos Anagnostopoulos;Aldo A.

e371eb6b9c354afa78f81f203af25343aee7d98a	evaluation of multiple voxel-based morphometry approaches and applications in the analysis of white matter changes in temporal lobe epilepsy		The purpose of this study was to compare multiple voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approaches and analyze the whole-brain white matter (WM) changes in the unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients relative to controls. In our study, the performance of the VBM approaches, including standard VBM, optimized VBM and VBM-DARTEL, was evaluated via a simulation, and then these VBM approaches were applied to the real data obtained from the TLE patients and controls. The results from simulation show that VBM-DARTEL performs the best among these VBM approaches. For the real data, WM reductions were found in the ipsilateral temporal lobe, the contralateral frontal and occipital lobes, the bilateral parietal lobes, cingulated gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and brainstem of the left-TLE patients by VBMDARTEL, which is consistent with previous studies. Our study demonstrated that DARTEL was the most robust and reliable approach for VBM analysis.	acoustic lobing;bilateral filter;morphometrics;simulation;voxel	Wenjing Li;Huiguang He;Jingjing Lu;Bin Lv;Meng Li;Zhengyu Jin	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40843-4_29	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology	ML	19.59510744564461	-80.22164109553982	46303
e79697e1d96d9ec6802b5d8b6b56d906548554b4	homogeneity measure for forensic voice comparison: a step forward reliability		In forensic voice comparison, it is strongly recommended to follow the Bayesian paradigm to present a forensic evidence to the court. In this paradigm, the strength of the forensic evidence is summarized by a likelihood ratio (LR). But in the real world, to base only on the LR without looking to its degree of reliability does not allow experts to have a good judgement. This work is mainly motivated by the need to quantify this reliability. In this concept, we think that the presence of speaker specific information and its homogeneity between the two signals to compare should be evaluated. This paper is dedicated to the latter, the homogeneity. We propose an information theory based homogeneity measure which determines whether a voice comparison is feasible or not.

Three specific areas of the valence–arousal emotional space are defined, corresponding to negatively excited, positively excited, and calm-neutral states. An acquisition protocol based on the recall of past emotional life episodes has been designed to acquire data from both peripheral and EEG signals. Pattern classification is used to distinguish between the three areas of the valence–arousal space. The performance of several classifiers has been evaluated on 10 participants and different feature sets: peripheral features, EEG time–frequency features, EEG pairwise mutual information (MI) features. Comparison of results obtained using either peripheral or EEG signals confirms the interest of using EEGs to assess valence and arousal in emotion recall conditions. The obtained accuracy for the three emotional classes is 63% using EEG time–frequency features, which is better than the results obtained from previous studies using EEG and similar classes.

0cb3e72cf350da8ed282a73cdc2352fefc32d766	sequential labeling with structural svm under nondecomposable losses		Sequential labeling addresses the classification of sequential data, which are widespread in fields as diverse as computer vision, finance, and genomics. The model traditionally used for sequential labeling is the hidden Markov model (HMM), where the sequence of class labels to be predicted is encoded as a Markov chain. In recent years, HMMs have benefited from minimum-loss training approaches, such as the structural support vector machine (SSVM), which, in many cases, has reported higher classification accuracy. However, the loss functions available for training are restricted to decomposable cases, such as the 0–1 loss and the Hamming loss. In many practical cases, other loss functions, such as those based on the  $F_{1}$  measure, the precision/recall break-even point, and the average precision (AP), can describe desirable performance more effectively. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a training algorithm for SSVM that can minimize any loss based on the classification contingency table, and we present a training algorithm that minimizes an AP loss. Experimental results over a set of diverse and challenging data sets (TUM Kitchen, CMU Multimodal Activity, and Ozone Level Detection) show that the proposed training algorithms achieve significant improvements of the  $F_{1}$  measure and AP compared with the conventional SSVM, and their performance is in line with or above that of other state-of-the-art sequential labeling approaches.	addresses (publication format);algorithm;computer vision;contingency table;hamming distance;hidden markov model;information retrieval;loss function;markov chain;multimodal interaction;osteoporosis, postmenopausal;precision and recall;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);support vector machine;tums;hearing impairment	Guopeng Zhang;Massimo Piccardi;Ehsan Zare Borzeshi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2757504	viterbi algorithm;support vector machine;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;hidden markov model;pattern recognition;data set;markov chain;hamming code	ML	-3.0919960805608193	-87.65804882805546	46905

To investigate the role of atrial anatomy in AF, we apply a computer model of human atrial electromechanics that includes SACs and contraction of the sarcomeres. Trabecular bundle structures are modeled by varying atrial wall thickness in a triangular mesh representing the human atria. Vulnerability to AF is investigated by application of overall stretch, while stimulating near the pulmonary veins. Due to contraction of some areas, stretch increases in other areas, leading to a variation in effective refractory period (ERP). Onset and perpetuation of AF in our model is explained by an increased dispersion in ERP, conduction slowing, and local conduction block. Atrial contraction attributes to the termination of AF through mechanoelectric feedback. We conclude that onset and termination of AF episodes under stretch are related to atrial structure and mechanoelectric feedback.	computer simulation;numerical weather prediction;onset (audio)	Nico H.

21f0a2045071b2f0863f2d57279d6dcb6037cd3d	a novel cardiac arrhythmias detection approach for real-time ambulatory ecg diagnosis		In view of requirements of low-resource consumption and high-efficiency in real-time Ambulatory Electrocardiograph Diagnosis (AED) applications, a novel Cardiac Arrhythmias Detection (CAD) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm consists of three core modules: an automatic-learning machine that models diagnostic criteria and grades the emergency events of cardiac arrhythmias by studying morphological characteristics of ECG signals and experiential knowledge of cardiologists; a rhythm classifier that recognizes and classifies heart rhythms basing on statistical features comparison and linear discriminant with confidence interval estimation; and an arrhythmias interpreter that assesses emergency events of cardia arrhythmias basing on a two rule-relative interpretation mechanisms. The experiential results on off-line MIT-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database as well as online clinical testing explore that this algorithm has 92.8% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity in average, so that it is suitable for real-time cardiac arrhythmias monitoring.	real-time transcription	Haiying Zhou;Xiancheng Zhu;Sishan Wang;Kui Zhou;Zheng Ma;Kun Mean Hou;Christophe De Vaulx	2017	IJPRAI	10.1142/S0218001417580046	mathematics;cad;ambulatory;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;ambulatory ecg;confidence interval;linear discriminant analysis	AI	15.567736522461015	-88.81594743717459	46987
97bc3125e5759a2afa7ff8f3592d3bc55dbdd2a2	a pilot study of planar coil based magnetic stimulation using acute hippocampal slice in mice		Micromagnetic stimulation using small-sized implantable coils has recently been studied. The main advantage of this method is that it can provide sustainable stimulation performance even if a fibrotic encapsulation layer is formed around the implanted coil by inflammation response, because indirectly induced currents are used to induce neural responses. In previous research, we optimized the geometrical and control parameters used in implantable magnetic stimulation. Based on those results, we fabricated the planar coil and studied the LTP effect in the hippocampal slice by two different magnetic stimulation protocols using the quadripulse stimulation (QPS) pattern. We found that direct magnetic stimulation (DMS) induced insignificant LTP effect and priming magnetic stimulation (PMS) occluded LTP effect after tetanic stimulation, when QPS patterned magnetic stimulation with 1 A current pulse was applied to the planar coil.	coil device component;deep brain stimulation;electricity;encapsulation (networking);implants;linux test project (ltp);long-term potentiation;obstruction;priming exercise;protocols documentation;slope	H.

By combining different kinds of sensors in a sensor network, several characteristic parameters of the human ambulation can be measured. Extensive sensor data fusion and interpretation is used to extract significant features, which will be used for inference purposes.

516bd6c33f49e4c99c5fcd8141831988054679ac	automatic seizure detection in eeg based on sparse representation and wavelet transform		Sparse representation has been widely applied to pattern classification in recent years. In the framework of sparse representation based classification (SRC), the test sample is represented as a sparse linear combination of the training samples. Due to the epileptic EEG signals are non-stationary and transitory, wavelet transform as a time-frequency analysis method is widely used to analyze EEG signals. In this work, a novel EEG signal classification method based on sparse representation and wavelet transform was proposed to detect the epileptic EEG from EEG recordings. The frequency subbands decomposed by wavelet transform provided more information than the entire EEG. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could classify the ictal EEG and interictal EEG with accuracy of 98 %.	electroencephalography;sparse approximation;wavelet transform	Shanshan Chen;Qingfang Meng;Yuehui Chen	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22180-9_20	pattern recognition;discrete wavelet transform	Vision	17.88158012400637	-90.79382947021239	47288

There are various approaches used to classify human activities for fall detection. Related studies have employed wearable, non-invasive sensors, video cameras and depth sensor-based approaches to develop such monitoring systems. The proposed approach in this study uses a depth sensor and employs a unique procedure which identifies the fall risk levels to adapt the algorithm for different people with their physical strength to withstand falls. The inclusion of the fall risk level identification, further enhanced and improved the accuracy of the fall detection. The experimental results showed promising performance in adapting the algorithm for people with different fall risk levels for fall detection.	accidental falls;algorithm;community;depth map;gait analysis;physical strength;population;range imaging;real life;silo (dataset);supervised learning;wearable computer;sensor (device)	Yoosuf Nizam;Mohd Norzali Haji Mohd;M.

A (conceptually) simpler distance measure is proposed that allows for a linear transformation of amplitude and time only, but is also open for other normalizations (unachievable by z-normalization preprocessing). Lower bounding techniques are presented for this measure that apply directly to raw series.	canonical account;dynamic time warping;image scaling;preprocessor;smoothing;time series	Frank Höppner	2014		10.1137/1.9781611973440.65	pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science;amplitude;dynamic time warping;linear map;preprocessor	DB	-2.2057563603850276	-92.76185774431026	47407

Major forerunners of such a conception are brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), which are based on a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device. First developed in the 1970s, BCIs have been largely focused on improving the quality of life of particular clinical populations and include, for example, advanced communications with locked-in patients and the direct control of prostheses and wheelchairs. Over the past five years there has been an explosion of research and development into technologies underlying the use of online brain–signal processing to influence human interactions with computers, their environment, and even other humans, i.e., BCI technologies, which has even led to the commercialization of the first brain-based toys. Over the next decades, BCI technology will expand beyond integration in medical and laboratory settings and into everyday life. In this section of the Centennial Special Issue, we focus on current and potential BCI technologies and research enabled by recent advances in wearable, mobile biosensors and data acquisition; neuroscience; computational and analytical approaches; and computing for brain imaging in real-world environments. In the first paper, Liao et al. discuss barriers to taking brain imaging systems out of laboratory and clinical settings and into everyday environments, and highlight current and future approaches to address those barriers. This paper focuses on recent and projected advances of a wide range of sensor and acquisition neurotechnologies enabling online brain– signal processing in everyday, real-life environments. In the second paper, Makeig et al. discuss the challenges associated with building robust and useful BCI models from accumulated biological knowledge and available data, and the technical problems associated with incorporating multimodal physiological, behavioral, and contextual data that may become ubiquitous in the future. This paper focuses on recent advances and current trends in signal processing of electroencephalography (EEG) data and future approaches to processing EEG in combination with multimodal sources of data. One of the primary benefits of the neurotechnologies discussed in the first two papers is that they are envisioned to enable researchers to experiment using naturalistic tasks and in real-world environments to produce a much deeper and perhaps very different understanding of the link between behavior and biology; an understanding which may dramatically influence BCI technologies as well as the broader neuroscience community. In the third paper, Lance et al. discuss the potential of using online brain–signal processing to enhance human–computer interactions and the barriers to realizing this potential. This paper discusses past and current BCI applications and proposes future BCI technologies that will make significant expansion into training, education, entertainment, rehabilitation, and human–system performance domains. These technologies include novel user-acceptable interfaces to monitor brain function and human behaviors in real-world environments. The vast growth in neuroscience research over the past several decades presents a remarkable opportunity to synthesize and leverage this knowledge base for improving This special section on neurotechnological systems focuses on current and potential brain–computer interface (BCI) technologies and research enabled by recent advances in wearable, mobile biosensors and data acquisition as well as advances in neuroscience and computing for brain imaging and related fields.	brain–computer interface;data acquisition;electroencephalography;gene regulatory network;knowledge base;multimodal interaction;neurotechnology;peripheral;population;prolog;real life;signal processing;the quality of life;toys;wearable computer	Chin-Teng Lin;Kaleb McDowell	2012	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2012.2187137	brain–computer interface;human–computer interaction;computer science	HCI	8.227249306645469	-91.06710778502566	47538

By using that signal to, e.g., control a wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis, a BCI could become a valuable tool for paralyzed patients. One approach to implement a BCI is to let users learn to self-control the amplitude of some of their brain rhythms as extracted from multichannel electroencephalogram. We present a method that estimates subject-specific spatial filters which allow for a robust extraction of the rhythm modulations. The effectiveness of the method was proved by achieving the minimum prediction error on data set IIa in the BCI Competition 2003, which consisted of data from three subjects recorded in ten sessions.	brain neoplasms;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;estimated;extraction;interface device component;patients;neuroprosthesis	Gilles Blanchard;Benjamin Blankertz	2004	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2004.826691	brain–computer interface;computer vision;neuroscience;common spatial pattern;speech recognition;neuroprosthetics;spatial ecology;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;biological engineering;communication	ML	13.962189699471725	-92.29802900877678	47625

The driver safety monitoring system was developed in practice in the form of an application for an Android-based smartphone device, where measuring safety-related data requires no extra monetary expenditure or equipment. Moreover, the system provides high resolution and flexibility. The safety monitoring process involves the fusion of attributes gathered from different sensors, including video, electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, temperature, and a three-axis accelerometer, that are assigned as input variables to an inference analysis framework. A Fuzzy Bayesian framework is designed to indicate the driver's capability level and is updated continuously in real-time. The sensory data are transmitted via Bluetooth communication to the smartphone device. A fake incoming call warning service alerts the driver if his or her safety level is suspiciously compromised. Realistic testing of the system demonstrates the practical benefits of multiple features and their fusion in providing a more authentic and effective driver safety monitoring.	android;bluetooth;british informatics olympiad;discrete mathematics;inference;money;optic axis of a crystal;personnameuse - assigned;photoplethysmography;real-time clock;sensor;smartphone;accelerometers;benefit;transmission process	Boon Giin Lee;Nguyen Trung Hau	2012		10.3390/s121217536	embedded system;simulation;computer science;engineering;photoplethysmogram;bluetooth;computer security	Mobile	7.952747436269743	-85.95692650059365	47821

VV is used by radiologists in clinical practice and has one of the highest obtainable effect sizes for tracking brain change in clinical trials, but it is crucial to relate VV to structural alterations underlying clinical symptoms. Here we identify patterns of thinner cortical gray matter (GM) associated with dynamic changes in lateral VV at 1-year (N=677) and 2-year (N=536) intervals, in the ADNI cohort. People with faster VV loss had thinner baseline cortical GM in temporal, inferior frontal, inferior parietal, and occipital regions (controlling for age, sex, diagnosis). These findings show the patterns of relative cortical atrophy that predict later ventricular enlargement, further validating the use of ventricular segmentations as biomarkers. We may also infer specific patterns of regional cortical degeneration (and perhaps functional changes) that relate to VV expansion.	alzheimer's disease;atrophic;baseline (configuration management);biological markers;cerebral atrophy;dementia;enlargement procedure;gray matter;inference;lateral thinking;magnetic resonance imaging;occipital lobe;premature ventricular contractions;radiology;right heart strain;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);ventricular volume;verification and validation	Sarah K.

This device acts as an exoskeleton for people who had failure of their limb. Electromyography (EMG) is the techniques to analyze the presence of electrical activity in musculoskeletal systems. The electrical activity in muscles of disable person is failed to contract the muscle for movements. In order to prevent the muscles from paralysis becomes spasticity the force of movements should minimize the mental efforts. The objective of this work is to model the muscle EMG signal to torque using ANN technique. The EMG signal is collected from Biceps Brachii muscles to estimate the elbow joint torque. A two layer feed-forward network is trained using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The experimental results show that ANN can well represent EMG-torque relationship for arm rehabilitation device control.	arm architecture;artificial neural network;backpropagation;electromyography;feedforward neural network;software propagation	Mohd Hafiz Jali;Tarmizi Ahmad Izzuddin;Zul Hasrizal Bohari;Mohamad Fani Sulaima;Hafez Sarkawi	2014	2014 UKSim-AMSS 16th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSim.2014.78	engineering;physical therapy;anatomy;surgery	Robotics	12.536578369309266	-83.58748569499302	48050

Additionally, we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector, the number of trials, and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents, for a given electrode, the subject's P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93%, that is, 10% higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88. Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8. Finally, we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification.	algorithm;bci2000;brain–computer interface;calibration;chain code;clinical use template;computation;computational resource;contain (action);context-free grammar;dimensionality reduction;erp;electroencephalography;experiment;feature vector;forty nine;hypothalamic area, lateral;integer (number);interface device component;linear equation;parsing;real-time computing;receiver operator characteristics;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;statistical test;subgroup;time complexity;electrode;interest;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Montserrat Alvarado-González;Edgar Garduño;Ernesto Bribiesca;Oscar Yáñez-Suárez;Verónica Médina-Bañuelos	2016	Computational and mathematical methods in medicine	10.1155/2016/2029791	machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;mathematics	ML	15.310324199902254	-91.12804861890643	48120
89e7a6fce900038e476d8f72fe07eedf6bd9aaa5	on the pleasantness of a haptic stimulation: how different textures can be recognized through heart rate variability nonlinear analysis	heart rate variability;support vector machines;physiology;feature extraction;pattern recognition;fabrics;haptic interfaces	The hedonic attributes of cutaneous elicitation play a crucial role in everyday life, influencing our behavior and psychophysical state. However, the correlation between such a hedonic aspect of touch and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)-related physiological response, which is intimately connected to emotions, still needs to be deeply investigated. This study reports on caress-like stimuli conveyed to the forearm of 32 healthy subjects through different fabrics actuated by a haptic device, which can control both the strength (i.e. the normal force exerted by the fabric) and the velocity of the elicitation. The mimicked caresses were elicited with a fixed force of 6 N, two levels of velocity of 9.4 mm/sec and 65 mm/sec, and four different fabrics with different textures: burlap, hemp, velvet and silk. Participants were asked to score the caress-like stimuli in terms of arousal and valence through a self-assessment questionnaire. Heartbeat data related to the perceived most pleasant (silk) and unpleasant (burlap) fabrics were used as an input to an automatic pattern recognition procedure. Accordingly, considering gender differences, support vector machines using features extracted from linear and nonlinear heartbeat dynamics showed a recognition accuracy of 84.38% (men) and 78.13% (women) while discerning between burlap and silk elicitations at the higher velocity. Results suggest that the fabrics used for the caress-like stimulation significantly affect the nonlinear cardiovascular dynamics, also showing differences according to gender.	arousal;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;cns disorder;emotions;extraction;haptic device component;haptic technology;heart rate variability;millimeter per second;nonlinear system;pattern recognition;self-assessment;support vector machine;textiles;velocity (software development);physical hard work	Mimma Nardelli;Alberto Greco;Matteo Bianchi;Enzo Pasquale Scilingo;Gaetano Valenza	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591497	support vector machine;heart rate variability;simulation;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;machine learning;communication;social psychology	HCI	11.639290393095836	-91.64314213503542	48122

The 149 records are preprocessed to calculate the root-mean square of the successive differences in the R-R intervals and Shannon entropy which are validated from x-means and Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital database for the features for AF detection. A smartphone camera was used to obtain photoplethysmography signals. Clinicians labeled 29 records by referring to the electrocardiogram signals. These labeled records were used as a ground truth set to evaluate the accuracy of each method. In the experiments, the kNN, NN, and SVM methods achieved 98.65%, 99.32%, and 97.98% accuracies, respectively.	anisotropic filtering;artificial neural network;data pre-processing;entropy (information theory);evert willem beth;experiment;ground truth;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mean squared error;relative atrial index;shannon (unit);smartphone;support vector machine	Keonsoo Lee;Hyung Oh Choi;Se Dong Min;Jin Seok Lee;B.

In this research, an accelerometer-based sensing system implemented on a vest is used to detect the behavior of festinating gait. The detection algorithm is based on the analysis of gait symmetry from the data measured by accelerometers. Specific indices were proposed to evaluate the severity of festinating gait behavior. Along with detection of the upper body lean forward angle while walking, the system could be used as a long-term trend monitoring tool for the development of festinating gait. This application could help users to know the development of the progressive behavior of festinating gait and hence to get proper treatment on PD earlier.	algorithm	Wen-Yen Lin;Wen-Zheng Chou;Wen-Shao Wu;Ming-Yih Lee	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844788	simulation;computer science;sensor;accelerometer	Robotics	10.07257277189389	-86.14892484087257	48264

Moreover, it has been suggested that motor imagery-specific EEG differences can be enhanced by feedback training. However, the differences observed in the EEGs of naive subjects are typically not sufficient to provide reliable EEG control and thus result in unintended feedback. Such feedback can frustrate subjects and impede training. In this study, a hybrid BCI paradigm combining motor imagery and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been proposed to provide effective continuous feedback for motor imagery training. Methods: During the initial training sessions, subjects must focus on flickering buttons to evoke SSVEPs as they perform motor imagery tasks. The output/feedback of the hybrid BCI is based on hybrid features consisting of motor imagery- and SSVEP-related brain signals. In this context, the SSVEP plays a more important role than motor imagery in generating feedback. As the training progresses, the subjects can gradually decrease their visual attention to the flickering buttons, provided that the feedback is still effective. In this case, the feedback is mainly based on motor imagery. Results: Our experimental results demonstrate that subjects generate distinguishable brain patterns of hand motor imagery after only five training sessions lasting approximately 1.5 h each. Conclusion: The proposed hybrid feedback paradigm can be used to enhance motor imagery training. Significance: This hybrid BCI system with feedback can effectively identify the intentions of the subjects.	beta rhythm;block cipher mode of operation;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;evoked potentials;feedback;guided imagery;modulation;mouse button;photopsia;programming paradigm;steady state	Tianyou Yu;Jun Xiao;Fangyi Wang;Rui Zhang;Zhenghui Gu;Andrzej Cichocki;Yuanqing Li	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2402283	psychology;computer vision;speech recognition;communication	ML	13.605089608219433	-92.61156141281381	48342

AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.	atm adaptation layer;activity recognition;algorithm;artificial neural network;hidden markov model;machine learning;markov chain;neural networks;performance;sensor;social support;support vector machine	Kadian Davis;Evans Owusu;Vahid Bastani;Lucio Marcenaro;Jun Hu;Carlo S.

Five minutes of recording were acquired with a 148-channel whole-head magnetometer in 14 ADHD patients and 14 control subjects. Our results showed that ADHD patients' MEGs were more regular than controls' recordings. Additionally, there were statistically significant differences (p < 0.01, Student's t-test with Bonferroni's correction) at the five analyzed brain areas: anterior, central, posterior, left lateral and right lateral. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the highest accuracy (82.14%) was achieved at posterior region, whereas the highest area under the ROC curves (0.8827) were reached at anterior and central brain regions. These results suggest the usefulness of SampEn to reveal an abnormal type of dynamics associated with ADHD.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;hyperactive behavior;lateral thinking;magnetoencephalography;mood disorders;patients;roc curve;receiver operating characteristic;receiver operator characteristics;sample entropy;spontaneous order;magnetometers;protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 4;t test	Carlos Gomez;Jesús Poza;María García;Alberto Fernández;Roberto Hornero	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090504	psychology;neuroscience;speech recognition;developmental psychology;computer science;mathematics;receiver operating characteristic;statistics	Visualization	17.281876105110438	-85.35596246826735	48395

These systems can be applied to many applications, such as fire emergency, surveillance system, and smart home. Recently, surveillance systems combining wireless sensor networks with video cameras have become more and more popular. In traditional video surveillance systems, the system performance and cost is proportional to the number of deployed video camera. In this paper, we propose a real time video surveillance system consisting of many low cost sensors and a few wireless video cameras. The system allows a group of cooperating sensor devices to detect and track mobile objects and to report their positions to the sink node in the wireless sensor network. Then, the sink node uses the IP cameras deployed in the sensing area to record these events and display the present situations. We also propose a camera control scheme to initialize the coverage distribution of cameras and support the inter-task handoff operations between cameras. We have implemented the proposed system with 16 sensor nodes and two IP cameras, and evaluated the system performance. The result shows that our surveillance system is adaptable to variant environments and provides real time information of the monitored environment.	closed-circuit television;computation;home automation;ip camera;image sensor;performance evaluation;seamless3d;smoothing;vagueness	Wen-Tsuen Chen;Po-Yu Chen;Wei-Shun Lee;Chi-Fu Huang	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.57	embedded system;computer vision;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;video tracking;computer performance;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;visual sensor network	Mobile	3.203933411273941	-87.09298249843445	48527

A 2axis accelerometer was attached on the top of the user's head to separately detect faint accelerations in both the front to back and right to left directions. The total weight of the headset device is only 195 grams including a 9V NiMH battery. This paper presents the results of several experiments performed with the headset system. First, we observed healthy subjects under normal conditions and recorded typical accelerations in the range of 10-30 milli-Gs, which was sufficient to be detected by the system's sensitivity. We then performed numerical analysis on traces of acceleration patterns for a specific user in different conditions. From these analyses we found that the total length of 2-dimensional acceleration pattern trace and a high frequency spectrum (2Hz-10Hz) of right/left acceleration were related to the physical condition of the user. The wearable headset device can be carried to anywhere the user goes and the diagnosis of the wearer's physical condition only requires that the user stand still for 30 seconds, showing that this system can be used for daily health care monitoring.	experiment;grams;headset (audio);numerical analysis;right-to-left;sensor;spectral density;tracing (software);wearable computer	Soichiro Matsushita;Toshihiko Oba;Kazuoki Otsuki;Masao Toji;Junichi Otsuki;Kaoru Ogawa	2003		10.1109/ISWC.2003.1241409	acceleration;sensory system;embedded system;spectrum;two-dimensional space;simulation;wearable computer;numerical analysis;computer science;high frequency;head;accelerometer;quantum mechanics;health care	HCI	9.869972073749086	-87.27800471120426	48739
e76f941b344be8338de774283ef95b7d87d135b2	heartbeat classification of ecg signals using rational function systems		The main idea of this paper is to show that rational orthogonal function systems, called Malmquist-Takenaka (MT) systems can effectively be used for ECG heartbeat classification. The idea behind using these systems is the adaptive nature of them. Then the constructed feature vector consists of two main parts, called dynamic and morphological parameters. The latter ones contain the coefficients of the orthogonal projection with respect to the MT systems. Then Support Vector Machine algorithm was used for classifying the heartbeats into the usual 16 arrhythmia classes. The comparison test were performed on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the previous ones in many respects.

The system enables the noninvasive real-time monitoring and measurement of breathing rate and respiratory/body movement pattern of healthy subjects inside the MRI gantry, and has potential application in respiratory-gated image acquisition based on respiratory cues. The working principle behind this sensor is based on the microbending effect of an optical fiber on light transmission. The sensor system comprises of a 1.0-mm-thin graded-index multimode optical fiber-embedded plastic sensor mat, a photoelectronic transceiver, and a computer with a digital signal processing algorithm. In vitro testing showed that our sensor has a typical signal-to-noise ratio better than 28 dB. Clinical MRI trials conducted on 20 healthy human subjects showed good and comparable breathing rate detection (with an accuracy of ±2 bpm) and respiratory-gated image quality produced using the sensor system, with reference to current predicate hospital device/system. The MRI safe, ease of operation characteristics, low fabrication cost, and extra patient comfort offered by this system suggest its good potential in replacing predicate device/system and serve as a dual function in real-time respiratory monitoring and respiratory-gated image acquisition at the same time during MRI.	algorithm;bend radius;digital signal processing;dual;duality (optimization);embedded system;embedding;eye;fiber optic sensor;image quality;lewy body disease;modulation;optical fiber device component;passive optical network;real-time clock;respiratory rate;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver device component	D.

Ear-EEG could be implemented into hearing aids, and provide neurofeedback for e.g. objective hearing assessment through measurements of the auditory steady-state response. In cases where the objective is to measure a specific feature of an event-related potential, there will be a subject specific optimal reference configuration. This work presents a method for optimizing the reference configuration for steady-state type potentials. For given electrode positions, the method maximizes the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the first harmonic of the steady-state response. This is obtained by estimating a set of weights applied to the electrode signals. The method was validated on a dataset recorded from 12 subjects. The weights were estimated from one part of the dataset, and the validation was performed on another part of the dataset. For all subjects the proposed method demonstrated a robust SNR estimate, yielding on par or better SNR compared to other well-known methods.	acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;configuration interaction;ear-eeg;electroencephalography;estimated;hearing aids;neurofeedback;signal-to-noise ratio;silo (dataset);steady state;test set;weight;electrode	Simon Lind Kappel;Christian Bech Christensen;Kaare B.

First, a pacing beat and spontaneous beat recognition algorithm are established in which a FIR filter and three threshold methods are used to pick up the pacing spikes, and a dynamic threshold modification method is proposed for error elimination. Second, a beat classification algorithm is developed based on decision rules for six commonly used pacemaker types. Third, a pacemaker malfunction recognition algorithm is established to evaluate the pacemaker working status. Fourth, the statistics of the analysis and the report are also provided. To validate the algorithm, clinical data were collected and manually classified by specialists. Then, the classification and recognition results were obtained with the clinical data. The results show that the algorithm can achieve a recognition rate of 98.4%. The results also indicate that the algorithm is capable of working at real-time speed. The algorithm has been incorporated into the telemonitoring system, and trial application cases are also reported.	algorithm;artificial cardiac pacemaker;classification;excretory function;finite impulse response;real-time transcription;rule (guideline);spontaneous order	Jing Bai;Jianwu Lin	1999	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/4233.788581	speech recognition;medicine;computer science;blood pressure;statistics	Visualization	16.24972570224911	-88.32760391155583	49204

In this context, predicting the discrete goal is necessary. Although grasping various objects is critical in determining independence in daily life of amputees, decoding of different grasp types from noninvasively recorded brain activity has not been investigated. Here we show results suggesting electroencephalography (EEG) is a feasible modality to extract information on grasp types from the user's brain activity. We found that the information about the intended grasp increases over the grasping movement, and is significantly greater than chance up to 200 ms before movement onset.	amputees;electroencephalography phase synchronization;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;modality (human–computer interaction);neuroprosthetics;onset (audio);physical object	Harshavardhan A.

The physical task was meant to stimulate the sensitivity correlation of sensory response of a child. A group of autism children was chosen for this study and were given by five sensory stimulations which are audio, taste, touch, visual and vestibular. The acquisition of brain signals was acquainted using EEG Neurofax 9200 and the electrode positions were using 10-20 International System placements. The preprocessing signals were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) using EEGLAB Software and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The alpha wave was selected by level 6 decomposition and the extracted features represents the characteristic of the sensory task. The means, standard deviations and approximation entropy were extracted on the clean signals and forms into Sensory Profile (Sensory Profiling). From the overall results, the behavior of each autism children has been observed unstable emotion while running the sensory stimulation.

Execution of such tasks in awkward postures can strain their body parts and can result in fatigue, injuries or in severe cases permanent disabilities. The number of reported cases every year is in the thousands. Among these injuries, back injuries and Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder (WMSD) are the most common injuries. Such injuries occur primarily with workers involved in carrying heavy loads, kneeling, contact stress, vibration, extreme temperatures, twisting hands or wrists, stretching to work overhead or other awkward positions while performing job activities. These injuries typically occur due to awkward work posture while carrying out tasks such as lifting loads (back and knee injuries) and working overhead (neck and shoulder injuries). In view of this, it is essential to train workers before the commencement of any construction activity. Furthermore, traditional worker monitoring methods are tedious, inefficient and are carried out manually whereas, an automated approach can yield valuable information concerning work-related behavior of worker that can be beneficial for worker training in a virtual reality world. Our research work focuses on developing an automated approach for posture estimation and classification using a range camera for posture analysis and categorizing it as ergonomic or non-ergonomic. Using a range camera, first we classify worker's pose to determine whether a worker is 'standing', 'bending', 'sitting', or 'crawling' and then estimate the posture of the worker using OpenNI middleware to get the body joint angles and spatial locations. A predefined set of rules is then formulated to use this body posture information to categorize tasks as ergonomic or non-ergonomic.

Subjects were evaluated 4 times for Timed-Up-and-Go, 10-Meter-Walking, and 6-Minute-Walking testings, at the baseline, 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after training. Latent Class Growth model was used to classify the LOKOMAT training speed, and clinical walking evaluations. Subjects in each treatment group could be classified into two subclasses for training speed and clinical evaluation. It was found that the training speed increased in all treatment group, while the subjects in LOKOMAT+Tizanidine presented a significant improvement of their training speed from the training session. The clinical evaluations classified subjects similarly, and no significant improvement of clinical measurements was observed for either treatment. The MVC dorsiflexion torque at the ankle joint was able to predict the class memberships of subjects for their walking capacity and can be used as a significant predictor for therapeutic functional recovery after spinal cord injury.	ankle joint structure;articular system;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);classification;evaluation;kerrison predictor;model–view–controller;muscle spasticity;robot;spinal cord injuries;spinal cord neoplasms;subclass;tizanidine	X.

Eighteen consecutive hemiplegic patients suffering from foot drop were assigned either to subacute or chronic group. Patients of both groups' were treated according to conventional rehabilitation program combined with FES therapy for 12 weeks. At post-treatment, subacute subjects showed a mean increase in walking speed of 29.4% and chronic subjects of 17.1% and the physiological cost index (PCI), with a reduction of 73.1% in subacute subjects and 46.5 % in chronic subjects. Improvement was also found in cadence, step length, and mean-absolute-value (MAV) and root-mean-square (RMS) of EMG signal of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in both groups, but subacute subjects improved better compared with chronic subjects. Thus we suggested that an early intervention of FES therapy combined with conventional rehabilitation program (CRP) could significantly improve the gait and muscle strength in stroke survivors.	cerebrovascular accident;electromyography;functional electrical stimulation;lumbar anterior root stimulator;mean squared error;muscle spasticity;muscle strength;patients;personnameuse - assigned;rms;rehabilitation therapy;shin megami tensei: persona 3;strength:imp:pt:musculoskeletal system:ord;survivors;tibialis anterior muscle structure;tooth root structure;walking speed;hemiplegics;physical rehabilitation	Sukanta K.

Using this method, the differentiation of R waves from large, peaked T and P waves is achieved with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, problems with baseline drift, motion artifacts and muscular noise are minimised. The performance of the algorithm was tested using standard ECG waveform records from the MIT-BITH Arrhythmia database. An average detection rate of 99.87%, a sensitivity (Se) of 99.94% and a positive prediction (+P) of 99.93% have been achieved against study records from the MIT-BITH Arrhythmia database. A detection error rate of less than 0.8% was achieved in every study case. The reliability of the proposed detector compares very favorably with published results for other QRS detectors.	baseline (configuration management);dynlrb1 wt allele;david h. koch institute for integrative cancer research at mit;detectors;hilbert transform;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;morphologic artifacts;motion detector;muscle;receptors, monoiodotyrosine;scientific publication;sensitivity and specificity;signal processing;waveform;algorithm	Diego S.

A wearable device aggregates signals from various sensors while periodically transmitting the collected data to a backend server, which builds custom user profiles based on inferred hidden Markov states. They discuss how these user profiles can be used in various contexts as proxies for fluctuating physiological states and leveraged for various longitudinal classification tasks. Using data collected in a two-week study hosted at Jaslok Hospital, the authors show how physiological changes induced by different environments with various levels of stress can be quantified by the authors’ platform. To minimize the dependence on continuous connectivity with the backend server, they introduce a heuristic to enable real-time state identification using the modest processing capabilities of the wearable device.

However, the application of neural patterns in the recognition of self-induced emotions remains uninvestigated. In this study we inferred the patterns and neural signatures of self-induced emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The EEG signals of 30 participants were recorded while they watched 18 Chinese movie clips which were intended to elicit six discrete emotions, including joy, neutrality, sadness, disgust, anger and fear. After watching each movie clip the participants were asked to self-induce emotions by recalling a specific scene from each movie. We analyzed the important features, electrode distribution and average neural patterns of different self-induced emotions. Results demonstrated that features related to high-frequency rhythm of EEG signals from electrodes distributed in the bilateral temporal, prefrontal and occipital lobes have outstanding performance in the discrimination of emotions. Moreover, the six discrete categories of self-induced emotion exhibit specific neural patterns and brain topography distributions. We achieved an average accuracy of 87.36% in the discrimination of positive from negative self-induced emotions and 54.52% in the classification of emotions into six discrete categories. Our research will help promote the development of comprehensive endogenous emotion recognition methods.	antivirus software;bilateral filter;brain implant;categories;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;emotions;happiness;inference;mental recall;occipital lobe;sadness;topography;video clip;electrode	Ning Zhuang;Ying Zeng;Kai Yang;Chi Zhang;Li Tong;Bin Yan	2018		10.3390/s18030841	electronic engineering;communication;disgust;engineering;emotion classification;electroencephalography;sadness;affect (psychology);emotion recognition;anger	AI	10.296424823973421	-93.92792935594375	50029

In this paper, we represent a data object by several time series-valued attributes. Although this kind of object representation is very natural and straightforward in many applications, there has not been much research on data mining methods for objects of this special type. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based classifier exploiting the benefits of representing objects by several time series. Classification decisions are based on class-specific interaction patterns among the time series of an object. Experimental results on benchmark data and real-world medical data demonstrate the performance of our classifier.	benchmark (computing);cross-validation (statistics);data mining;database;electroencephalography;linear model;random-access memory;similarity search;statistical classification;time series	Christian Böhm;L.

Rhythm hypotheses are first extracted from symbolic input data, e.g. MIDI, by the ACF. These hypotheses are analysed by the use of DFT to remove duplicates before the classification process. The classification of rhythms is performed using ACF in combination with rhythm patterns contained in a knowledge base. We evaluate this method using pre-labelled input data and discuss our results. We show that a knowledge-based approach is reasonable to address the problem of rhythm classification for symbolic data.	acf;beat detection;computation;discrete fourier transform;discretization;distributed computing;knowledge base;midi;parallel computing;statistical classification	Johannes Fliege;Frank Seifert;André Richter	2014		10.5220/0004919507470752	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning	ML	19.172538708134926	-92.57505437837145	50125

However, in the case of heterogeneous BSNs integration with Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) a large number of difficulties remain, that must be solved, especially when talking about the detection of human state factors that impair the driving of motor vehicles. The main contributions of this investigation are principally three: (1) an exhaustive review of the current mechanisms to detect four basic physiological behavior states (drowsy, drunk, driving under emotional state disorders and distracted driving) that may cause traffic accidents is presented; (2) A middleware architecture is proposed. This architecture can communicate with the car dashboard, emergency services, vehicles belonging to the VANET and road or street facilities. This architecture seeks on the one hand to improve the car driving experience of the driver and on the other hand to extend security mechanisms for the surrounding individuals; and (3) as a proof of concept, an Android real-time attention low level detection application that runs in a next-generation smartphone is developed. The application features mechanisms that allow one to measure the degree of attention of a driver on the base of her/his EEG signals, establish wireless communication links via various standard wireless means, GPRS, Bluetooth and WiFi and issue alarms of critical low driver attention levels.	alcoholic intoxication;android;bluetooth;body dysmorphic disorders;chimeric antigen receptor;dna integration;distracted driving;drug vehicle;electroencephalography;emergence;emergency medical service;emotional states;feel drowsy;hoc (programming language);middleware;real-time clock;smartphone;speech;traffic accidents;nervous system disorder	Angelica Reyes;Mari Carmen Domingo;Marco Antonio López Trinidad;José Luis Delgado	2016		10.3390/s16010107	embedded system;simulation;electroencephalography;engineering;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;transport engineering;computer security;behavior	Mobile	6.862971876781076	-90.81056627521957	50156

The state during which the user wants to activate the BCI by is called the IC state. False positive rate (FPR) plays a critical role in evaluating a SP-BCI's usability, where FPR refer to the rate incorrectly classifying NC states. Therefore, development of a method which can not only minimize the FPR and also control it to be smaller than any predefined threshold is of vital importance. In this paper, an imbalanced support vector machine (ISVM)-based FPR control scheme is proposed. This method is able to force the FPR of a two-state SP-BCI to achieve the desired FPR, and this effect is independent of subjects and the feature extraction methods used. In this study, the IC state refers to the state during which the subjects perform an instructed motor imagery task, while during the NC state the subjects are instructed to relax. Spectral power and common spatial pattern (CSP) were used to extract features from EEG signals. Results on the IC and NC EEG data from four participants demonstrate the validity of the proposed ISVM-based FPR control scheme in controlling the FPR to be equal to or smaller than any thresholds, including 5% and 0%.	brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;electroencephalography;feature extraction;film-type patterned retarder;mental state;sensitivity and specificity;spatiotemporal pattern;support vector machine;usability	Yi-Hung Liu;Chun-Wei Huang;Yu-Tsung Hsiao	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2013.255	brain–computer interface;support vector machine;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	14.163354381816617	-92.79151175049839	50188
cc7a066999f416926db7d6d02caed064d66c831d	device-free and device-bound activity recognition using radio signal strength	room impulse response;pattern recognition;algorithms;indoor positioning	Background: We investigate direct use of 802.15.4 radio signal strength indication (RSSI) for human activity recognition when 1) a user carries a wireless node (device-bound) and when 2) a user moves in the wireless sensor net (WSN) without a WSN node (device-free). We investigate recognition feasibility in respect to network topology, subject and room geometry (door open, half, closed).  Methods: In a 2 person office room 8 wireless nodes are installed in a 3D topology. Two subjects are outfitted with a sensor node on the hip. Acceleration and RSSI are recorded while subject performs 6 different activities or room is empty. We apply machine learning for analysis and compare our results to acceleration data.  Results: 10-fold cross-validation with all nodes gives accuracies of 0.896 (device-bound), 0.894 (device-free) and 0.88 (accelerometer). Topology investigation reveals that similar accuracies may be reached with only 5 (device-bound) or 4 (device-free) selected nodes. Applying trained data from one subject to the other and vice-versa shows higher recognition difference on RSSI than on acceleration. Changing of door state has smaller effect on both systems than subject change; with least impact when door is closed.  Conclusion: 802.15.4 RSSI suited for activity recognition. 3D topology is helpful in respect to type of activities. Discrimination of subjects seems possible. Practical systems must adapt no only to long-term environmental dispersion but consider typical geometric changes. Adaptable, robust recognition models must be developed.	activity recognition;algorithm;cross-validation (statistics);gesture recognition;machine learning;network topology;radio wave;sensor node;transceiver	Markus Scholz;Till Riedel;Mario Hock;Michael Beigl	2013		10.1145/2459236.2459254	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	HCI	6.3618167675669755	-86.00409825372508	50300

We have used 14 channel wireless EEG-system Emotiv EPOC+ with accelerometer (motional data MD) for short-term recording under several functional states for 10 healthy subjects: Functional rest (rest state), TOVA-test (mental load), Hyperventilation (physical load) and Aftereffect (after test state). We then extracted core features from EEG-only and MD-only data using principal component analysis. After that, supervised learning methods were used for mental state classification: EEGonly core features for AF3, T7, O1, T8, AF4 channels, MD-only core features and EEGMD integrated core features. Experimental results showed that integrated core features for mental status evaluation have higher prediction accuracy 92,0% for decision tree method.	decision tree;electroencephalography;emotiv systems;feature extraction;headset (audio);mental state;molecular dynamics;principal component analysis;supervised learning	Alexey Syskov;Vasilii Borisov;Vsevolod Tetervak;Vladimir S.

5fa4c426e5a180191860b9319789cfcea3f57e78	continuous speech classification systems for voice pathologies identification		Voice pathologies identification using speech processing methods can be used as a preliminary diagnostic. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of sustained vowel /a/ and continuous speech task in identification systems to diagnose voice pathologies. The system recognizes between three classes consisting of two different pathologies sets and healthy subjects. The signals are evaluated using MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) as speech signal features, applied to SVM (Support Vector Machines) and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) classifiers. For continuous speech, the GMM system reaches 74% accuracy rate while the SVM system obtains 72% accuracy rate. For the sustained vowel /a/, the accuracy achieved by the GMM and the SVM is 66% and 69% respectively, a lower result than with continuous speech.

The device works by delivering precise interoceptive parasympathetic stimuli to C-tactile afferents connected to the lamina I spinothalamocortical system. In humans, interoceptive stimulation can be used to enhance heart rate variability (HRV). To test the effectiveness of the device in enhancing HRV, 13 subjects were randomly assigned in a single-blind between-subjects design either to the experimental condition or to the control condition. In the experimental condition, subjects received stimulation with the developed device; in the control condition subjects received stimulation with static non-interoceptive pressure. Subjects' electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded, with sampling at 1000 Hz for 5 min as a baseline, and then during the stimulations (11 min). Time domain analyses were performed to estimate the short-term vagally mediated component (rMSSD) of HRV. Results indicated that the experimental group showed enhanced rMSSD, compared to the control group. Moreover, frequency domain analyses indicated that high frequency band power, which reflects parasympathetic activity in humans, also appeared to be enhanced in the experimental group compared to control subjects. Conclusions and future challenges for an embodied perspective of rehabilitative medicine are discussed.	baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);experiment;frequency band;heart failure;heart rate variability;hertz (hz);maxima and minima;mobile device;one thousand;personnameuse - assigned;randomness;rehabilitation therapy;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;transcranial magnetic stimulation;molecular layer of the cerebral cortex	Daniele Di Lernia;Pietro Cipresso;Elisa Pedroli;Giuseppe Riva	2018		10.3390/s18082469	electronic engineering;computer engineering;engineering;heart rate variability;embodied cognition;stimulation	HCI	15.56526867530613	-82.12910826401931	50458
d2b44ed272a7ec1b24024630d51f90b2b5e18f56	development of bone-conduction mobile phones: assessment of hearing mechanisms by measuring psychological characteristics and acoustical properties in the outer ear canal	vibrations;irrigation;auditory system;bones;ear;loudspeakers;mobile handsets	We have been developing novel mobile phones using bone conduction, with flat-panel loudspeakers that convey speech sound by vibrating the pinna. In bone conduction via the pinna, i.e., pinna conduction, it is thought that speech sounds are conveyed via both air- and bone-conduction pathways. To obtain useful information for further development of bone-conduction mobile phones, peripheral mechanisms of the pinna conduction need to be clarified. In this study, hearing thresholds, sound field in the outer ear canals, and vibrations of the inner wall of the outer ear canals were measured while normal-hearing participants used pinna-conduction mobile phones. Thresholds decreased linearly as contact pressure increased below 1 kHz, but contact pressure did not affect thresholds above 2 kHz. Additionally, sound fields in the ipsilateral ear canal showed similar results. These results indicate that there is a considerable degree of bone-conduction components from the pinna to the inner ear, which only allow sounds below 1 kHz through. Because similar characteristics were observed in the threshold and the sound field in the outer ear canal, we suggest that osseotympanic emission, sound emission into the ear canal from the inner wall, and air conduction via external auditory foramen are the dominant components of pinna conduction. However, in the vibration measurement, differences between the ipsi- and contra-lateral responses were smaller than the sound field measurement. The smaller inter-lateral differences of the vibration in the outer ear canal suggest the existence of a significant amount of bone-conduction components that directly reach the middle or inner ear. Although the amount of such bone-conduction components does not seem sufficient for pinna.	auditory processing disorder;auricle of external ear;bone conduction;bone tissue;clarify;external auditory canal structure;flat panel display;kilohertz;labyrinth;lateral thinking;loudspeaker;mobile phone;peripheral;small;vibration - physical agent	Seiji Nakagawa;Takuya Hotehama;Kazuhito Ito;Tomohiro Inagaki	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591954	loudspeaker;acoustics;sound localization;engineering;vibration;irrigation;communication;audiology;physics	Visualization	24.315599377231276	-84.70195089817034	50505
84f80e94da241fa23ff79683c2dfbc950ea80216	a novel diagnosis system for parkinson’s disease using complex-valued artificial neural network with k-means clustering feature weighting method		Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a degenerative, central nervous system disorder. The diagnosis of PD is difficult, as there is no standard diagnostic test and a particular system that gives accurate results. Therefore, automated diagnostic systems are required to assist the neurologist. In this study, we have developed a new hybrid diagnostic system for addressing the PD diagnosis problem. The main novelty of this paper lies in the proposed approach that involves a combination of the k-means clustering-based feature weighting (KMCFW) method and a complex-valued artificial neural network (CVANN). A Parkinson dataset comprising the features obtained from speech and sound samples were used for the diagnosis of PD. PD attributes are weighted through the use of the KMCFW method. New features obtained are converted into a complex number format. These feature values are presented as an input to the CVANN. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system have been rigorously evaluated against the PD dataset in terms of five different evaluation methods. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed hybrid system, entitled KMCFW–CVANN, significantly outperforms the other methods detailed in the literature and achieves the highest classification results reported so far, with a classification accuracy of 99.52 %. Therefore, the proposed system appears to be promising in terms of a more accurate diagnosis of PD. Also, the application confirms the conclusion that the reliability of the classification ability of a complex-valued algorithm with regard to a real-valued dataset is high.	artificial neural network;chi;cluster analysis;entity–relationship model;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;f1 score;feature selection;harmony search;hybrid system;k-means clustering;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;monte carlo method;mutual information;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;performance evaluation;phase-shift oscillator;preprocessor;sensitivity and specificity;software release life cycle;support vector machine;test set;usability	Hüseyin Gürüler	2015	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-015-2142-2	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining	AI	19.07414195543538	-91.65976127734119	50602
8523ca137fe04fe4ff28e0ba20b1f5cb2a97326b	effect of vigilance changes on the incidence of high frequency oscillations in the epileptic brain		Recent studies show that the rate of cortical high frequency oscillations (HFOs) differentiates epileptogenic tissue in individuals with epilepsy. However, HFO occurrence can vary widely with vigilance state. In this study we attempt to characterize this variation, which has implications for the choice of a suitable diagnostic baseline for spatiotemporal analysis of HFO activity. We analyzed simultaneous recordings of the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and the electrocorticogram (ECoG) to examine the correlation of HFO activity with vigilance state. We detected HFOs (80–500 Hz) from all bipolar ECoG derivations using the well-known Staba algorithm in ten seizure-free overnight recordings from five patients being evaluated for surgery. In addition, we classified EEG features using a linkage tree into four vigilance states representing gradations in sleep depth from wakefulness to slow wave sleep. Finally, we examined the correlation between vigilance state and HFO occurrence in the five channels with the most HFOs in each recording. The proportion of 30-s epochs containing HFOs was found to increase significantly with sleep depth (p<0.01). Further analysis is necessary to examine the effects of epoch length and sample size in the choice of diagnostic baseline.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);classification;electrocorticogram;electroencephalography;epilepsy;epoch (reference date);hertz (hz);hybrid fibre-optic;incidence matrix;linkage (software);neural oscillation;patients;seizures;wakefulness;whole earth 'lectronic link	Amir F.

However, most activity recognitionresearches only deal with general activity recognition, which usesthe same model for all single-person individuals. This is becauseit is difficult to build a customized model for each individual viamanual feature engineering. Thus, in this paper, we introducepersonalized activity recognition as a new research direction andpropose our own approach to build model for each individualusing recurrent neural network (RNN). Also, we suggest a graphbasedevent processing approach to seamlessly collect time-slicedand annotated data. Finally, we construct three kinds of RNNarchitectures with three different unit types including iRNN, LSTM and GRU, and perform experiments using real dataset. From the experimental results, we conclude that our approachis feasible to build the customized model in real-world forpersonalized activity recognition.	activity recognition;artificial neural network;complex event processing;experiment;feature engineering;korea computer center;line code;long short-term memory;personalization;random neural network;recurrent neural network	Sungpil Woo;Jaewook Byun;Seong Hoon Kim;Minh Hoang Nguyen;Janggwan Im;Daeyoung Kim	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT)	10.1109/CIT.2016.16	data modeling;logic gate;computer science;artificial intelligence;recurrent neural network;operating system;machine learning;middleware;data mining;encoding;activity recognition	Robotics	3.0766753635967934	-84.8209873116353	50662

In this paper, we investigate the differences between normal and impaired auditory processing on a frequency discrimination task by analyzing the responses of a computational auditory model using signal detection theory. Hearing impairments that were simulated included a threshold shift, damage to the outer hair cells, and impaired neural synchrony. We implemented two detectors, one using all of the information in the signal, the other using only the number of neural firings, and used them to generate theoretical predictions of performance. Evaluation of performance differences between theoretical detectors and experimental data allows quantification of both the type of information present in the auditory system and the efficiency of its use. This method of analysis predicted both the trends observed in comparable experimental data and the relation between normal and impaired behavior. Finally, a very simple hearing aid was simulated and the gains in performance in the impaired cases were related to the physiological bases of the impairments. This demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach in the design of more complex hearing aids. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Our goal is to make this procedure easier and more accurate using a digital eye scanner. Our system can help in making diagnoses, assists in the practice and shortens the time needed to find the appropriate treatment. First and foremost we collect all important visual effects in the field of neurological examination and create a video to make possible the testing of the eye movement of the patient during the video. Their gaze data is collected by an appropriate eye tracker, then we analyze the gaze information in order to evaluate the mental state of the patient using machine learning based algorithms. According to the experimental results, our proposed technique can separate the healthy and ill patients from each other using their gaze data.	algorithm;decision support system;deep learning;eye tracking;foremost;machine learning;mental state;retinal scan;visual effects	David Kupas;Balazs Harangi;Gyorgy Czifra;Gabor Andrassy	2017	Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis	10.1109/ISPA.2017.8073565	computer science;gaze;human–computer interaction;distributed computing;decision support system;computer vision;artificial intelligence	HCI	3.6661922219129934	-80.47600235835314	51142

This challenge becomes even more demanding when the AAL environment comes to serve the requirements of elderly people who need continuous monitoring and care. In light of this, this paper presents a multi -- modal decision making system that consists of mixed knowledge and non-knowledge based subsystems that deliver the appropriate intelligence among three modalities (i.e. ambient, health, fall detection). The main effort has been given on the health status assessment module, where a SVM classifier has been trained using the Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database in order to detect abnormal heart beats based on time-domain and statistical features. An initial study on the classification scheme showed satisfactory results for the purposes of a system that is responsible of early screening and dangerous event detection.	atm adaptation layer;bounding interval hierarchy;cellular automaton;modal logic;requirement	Christos Panagiotou;Theodor C.

Methods are needed to quantitatively classify emotions in order to better understand and treat mood disorders. This research proposes techniques to improve communication in body sensor network (BSN) that gathers data on the affective states of the patient. These BSNs can continuously monitor, discretely quantify, and classify a patient's depressive states. In addition, data on the patient's lifestyle can be correlated with his/her physiological conditions to identify how various stimuli trigger symptoms. This continuous stream of data is an improvement over a snapshot of localized symptoms that a doctor often collects during a medical examination. Our research first quantifies how the body interferes with communication in a BSN and detects a pattern between the line of sight of an embedded device and its reception rate. Then, a mathematical model of the data using linear programming techniques determines the optimal placement and number of sensors in a BSN to improve communication. Experimental results show that the optimal placement of embedded devices can reduce power cost up to 27% and reduce hardware costs up to 47%. This research brings researchers a step closer to continuous, real-time systemic monitoring that will allow one to analyze the dynamic human physiology and understand, diagnosis, and treat mood disorders.	bachelor of science in nursing;body dysmorphic disorders;depressive disorder;embedding;experiment;financial cost;linear programming;mhealth;mathematical model;mathematics;medical examination;mood disorders;patients;real-time clock;accelerometers;physiological aspects;sensor (device)	Tammara Massey;Gustavo Marfia;Miodrag Potkonjak;Majid Sarrafzadeh	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2009.2034738	psychiatry;simulation;medicine;mobile telephony;computer science;linear programming;remote patient monitoring;mathematical model;experimental analysis of behavior	EDA	8.256233675441043	-87.11319167734915	51400

The short-term feedback control models are implemented to assess the hemodynamic responses of the patients exposed to stresses such as gravity or hemorrhage. To construct the base line state of the Fontan model, we assume an increase in venous tone, an increase in heart rate, and an increase in systemic resistance all of which are based on clinical observations. For the verification of the present method we simulate a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test and hemorrhage (20% blood volume loss). Both simulation results are compared to experimental data from the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that cardiac output decreases when the shunt resistance increases.	computation;computer simulation	Eun Bo Shim;Chan-Hyun Youn;Thomas Heldt;Roger D. Kamm;Roger G.

The application focuses on processing data from internal sensors of a smart phone as well as external sensors in order to monitor current state of a person. Measured data are partly evaluated in the device in order to identify critical situations such as fall of the person, and then are also sent to a server for the deeper analysis. While using AHP method, pairwise comparison matrices have to be created by experts - in our case doctors. Each expert can have different preferences and thus the resulting matrix, created based on the opinions of several experts, may be inconsistent. The method presented in this paper is based on interval judgments and shows how to merge inconsistent and uncertain preference matrices from several experts to deliver a robust and sensitive model for online machine decision making.

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometrics utilizes the small intra-personal differences and large inter-personal differences between individuals' brainwave patterns. In the past, such methods have used features derived from manually-designed procedures for this purpose. Another possibility is to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically extract an individual's best and most unique neural features and conduct classification, using EEG data derived from both Resting State with Open Eyes (REO) and Resting State with Closed Eyes (REC). Results indicate that this CNN-based joint-optimized EEG-based Biometric System yields a high degree of accuracy of identification (88%) for 10-class classification. Furthermore, rich inter-personal difference can be found using a very low frequency band (0-2Hz). Additionally, results suggest that the temporal portions over which subjects can be individualized is less than 200 ms.	artificial neural network;biometrics;brain waves;convolutional neural network;disabled persons;electroencephalography;electroencephalography;fingerprint;frequency band;interphase cell;large;law enforcement;license;neural network simulation;neural oscillation;reo coordination language;rest;resting state fmri;retina;retinal scan;confirmation - responselevel	Lan Ma;James W.

This paper introduces an application of several machine learning methods for training a classifier which is capable of classifying individual older adults into a high risk group and a low risk group (distinguished by whether or not the members of the group have a recent history of falls). Using a 3D motion capture system, significant gait features related to falls risk are extracted. By training these features, classification hypotheses are obtained based on machine learning techniques (K Nearest-neighbour, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine). Training and test accuracies with sensitivity and specificity of each of these techniques are assessed. The feature adjustment and tuning of the machine learning algorithms are discussed. The outcome of the study will benefit the prediction and prevention of falls.	accidental falls;algorithm;artificial neural network;classification;extraction;feature vector;imperative programming;logistic regression;machine learning;motion capture;naive bayes classifier;sensitivity and specificity;support vector machine	Lin Zhang;Ou Ma;Jennifer M.

The first hour following injury can be critical to survival, requiring frequent assessment of vital signs and intravascular volume needs. Conventional vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are generally nonspecific and slow to change until acute blood loss volume nears 25--30% of total blood volume. The lack of specificity associated with these vital signs limits their usefulness in the early detection and monitoring of acute blood loss. In contrast, measurements of cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and a new parameter termed Cardiovascular Reserve Index (CRI), follow the progression of hemorrhage and response to intravenous fluid therapy. They are superior indicators of blood loss volume and fluid resuscitation needs. We will demonstrate the implementation of all three parameters on a small, noninvasive body-worn device that is wirelessly connected to a central monitoring system.	color gradient;repetitive strain;sensitivity and specificity;systemverilog	Isaac C.

This is usually detected by spirometry and body plethysmography. These tests, however, require a high degree of collaboration and maximal effort on the part of the patient. There is agreement in the literature that there is a demand of research into new technologies to improve non-invasive testing of lung function. The purpose of this study was to develop automatic classifiers to simplify the clinical use and to increase the accuracy of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in the diagnosis of airway obstruction in patients with asthma.   METHODS The data consisted of FOT parameters obtained from 75 volunteers (39 with obstruction and 36 without). Different supervised machine learning (ML) techniques were investigated, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost with decision trees (ADAB) and feature-based dissimilarity space classifier (FDSC).   RESULTS The first part of this study showed that the best FOT parameter was the resonance frequency (AUC = 0.81), which indicates moderate accuracy (0.70-0.90). In the second part of this study, the use of the cited ML techniques was investigated. All the classifiers improved the diagnostic accuracy. Notably, ADAB and KNN were very close to achieving high accuracy (AUC = 0.88 and 0.89, respectively). Experiments including the cross products of the FOT parameters showed that all the classifiers improved the diagnosis accuracy and KNN was able to reach a higher accuracy range (AUC = 0.91).   CONCLUSIONS Machine learning classifiers can help in the diagnosis of airway obstruction in asthma patients, and they can assist clinicians in airway obstruction identification.	adaboost;airway obstruction;area under curve;asthma;decision trees;decision tree;experiment;forced oscillation technique;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;maximal set;patients;plethysmography;population parameter;radio frequency;random forest;resonance;respiratory physiology;spirometry;supervised learning;trees (plant)	Jorge Luís Machado do Amaral;Agnaldo José Lopes;Juliana Veiga;Alvaro C.

9a04f98711ac0b6fc439ed69afb1a24be8578667	quantifying performance of bipedal standing with multi-channel emg		Spinal cord stimulation has enabled humans with motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI) to independently stand and recover some lost autonomic function. Quantifying the quality of bipedal standing under spinal stimulation is important for spinal rehabilitation therapies and for new strategies that seek to combine spinal stimulation and rehabilitative robots (such as exoskeletons) in real time feedback. To study the potential for automated electromyography (EMG) analysis in SCI, we evaluated the standing quality of paralyzed patients undergoing electrical spinal cord stimulation using both video and multi-channel surface EMG recordings during spinal stimulation therapy sessions. The quality of standing under different stimulation settings was quantified manually by experienced clinicians. By correlating features of the recorded EMG activity with the expert evaluations, we show that multi-channel EMG recording can provide accurate, fast, and robust estimation for the quality of bipedal standing in spinally stimulated SCI patients. Moreover, our analysis shows that the total number of EMG channels needed to effectively predict standing quality can be reduced while maintaining high estimation accuracy, which provides more flexibility for rehabilitation robotic systems to incorporate EMG recordings.	autonomic computing;deep brain stimulation;electromyography;humans;robot;spinal cord stimulator	Yanan Sui;Kun Ho Kim;Joel W.

fd075dafb3858e61311ef6e1b7ffabef731c6cc3	enhanced fish bending model for automatic tuna sizing using computer vision		Abstract This paper presents a non-invasive fully automatic procedure to obtain highly accurate fish length estimation in adult Bluefin Tuna, based on a stereoscopic vision system and a deformable model of the fish ventral silhouette. The present work takes a geometric tuna model, which was previously developed by the same authors to discriminate fish in 2D images, and proposes new models to enhance the capabilities of the automatic procedure, from fish discrimination to accurate 3D length estimation. Fish length information is an important indicator of the health of wild fish stocks and for predicting biomass using length-weight relations. The proposal pays special attention to parts of the fish silhouette that have special relevance for accurate length estimation. The models have been designed to best fit the rear part of the fish, in particular the caudal peduncle, and a width parameter has been added to better fit the silhouette. Moreover, algorithms have been developed to extract snout tip and caudal peduncle features, allowing better initialization of model parameters. Snout Fork Length (SFL) measurements using the different models are extracted from images recorded with a stereoscopic vision system in a sea cage containing 312 adult Atlantic Bluefin Tuna. The automatic measurements are compared with two ground truths: one configured with semiautomatic measurements of favourable selected samples and one with real SFL measurements of the tuna stock collected at harvesting. Comparison with the semiautomatic measurements demonstrates that the combination of improved geometric models and feature extraction algorithms delivers good results in terms of fish length estimation error (up to 90% of the samples bounded in a 3% error margin) and number of automatic measurements (up to 950 samples out of 1000). When compared with real SFL measurements of the tuna stock, the system provides a high number of automatic detections (up to 6706 in a video of 135 min duration, i.e., 50 automatic measurements per minute of recording) and highly accurate length measurements, obtaining no statistically significant difference between automatic and real SFL frequency distributions. This procedure could be extended to other species to assess the size distribution of stocks, as discussed in the paper.	computer vision	Pau Muñoz-Benavent;Gabriela Andreu García;José Miguel Valiente González;Vicente Luis Atienza Vanacloig;Vicente Puig-Pons;Juan Villalba Espinosa	2018	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2018.04.005	silhouette;computer vision;tuna;fish measurement;feature extraction;artificial intelligence;engineering;fish stock;frequency distribution;margin of error	Vision	23.813983400535154	-90.34635768869583	52274

It adopts the basic framework of the multiresolution Teager energy operator (MTEO) detector, but presents important new results including a significantly improved MTEO detector with some mathematical analyses, a new alignment technique with its effects on the whole spike sorting system, and a variety of experimental results. Specifically, the new MTEO detector employs smoothing windows normalized by noise power derived from mathematical analyses and has an improved complexity by utilizing the sampling rate. Experimental results prove that this detector achieves higher detection ratios at a fixed false alarm ratio than the TEO detector and the discrete wavelet transform detector. We also propose a method that improves the action potential alignment performance. Observing that the extreme points of the MTEO output are more robust to the background noise than those of the action potentials, we use the MTEO output for action potential alignment. This brings not only noticeable improvement in alignment performance but also quite favorable influence over the classification performance. Accordingly, the proposed detector improves the performance of the whole spike sorting system. We verified the improvement using various modeled neural signals and some real neural recordings.	action potential;alignment;detectors;discrete wavelet transform;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;edge detection;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;energy operator;image segmentation;mathematics;microsoft windows;noise power;online and offline;performance;roc curve;receiver operator characteristics;receiver operating characteristic;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;smoothing (statistical technique);sorting;stage level 1	Joon Hwan Choi;Hae Kyung Jung;Taejeong Kim	2006	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2006.870239	computer vision;extreme point;electronic engineering;neuroscience;speech recognition;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;discrete wavelet transform;signal-to-noise ratio;neurophysiology;action potential	Vision	18.59323188371643	-88.50664112335173	52290

The precise measurement of walking speed is very important to the rehabilitation guidance of the apoplectic people. The precision of traditional measuring methods on speed such as stopwatch is relatively low, and high precision measurement instruments because of the high cost cannot be used widely. What's more, these methods have difficulty in measuring the walking speed of the apoplectic people accurately. UHF RFID tag has the advantages of small volume, low price, long reading distance etc, and as a wearable sensor, it is suitable to measure walking speed accurately for the apoplectic people. In order to measure the human walking speed, this paper uses four reader antennas with a certain distance to reads the signal strength of RFID tag. Because RFID tag has different RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) in different distances away from the reader, researches on the changes of RSSI with time have been done by this paper to calculate walking speed. The verification results show that the precise measurement of walking speed can be realized by signal processing method with Gaussian Fitting-Kalman Filter. Depending on the variance of walking speed, doctors can predict the rehabilitation training result of the apoplectic people and give the appropriate rehabilitation guidance.	aging;curve fitting;distance;gaussian blur;instrument - device;interference (communication);kalman filter;normal statistical distribution;peterson's algorithm;radio frequency identification device;radio-frequency identification;reading (activity);sample variance;signal processing;ultra high frequency;verification of theories;walking speed;wearable computer	Huang Hua-lin;Mo Ling-fei;Liu Ying-jie;Li Cheng-yang;Xu Qi-meng;Wu Zhi-tong	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320258	text mining;medical research;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Mobile	11.581287246770328	-85.59493659508146	52309

In this paper, two training methods named Routine method and Confusing method were proposed from astronaut training experience. Two-factor experiment was conducted. The factors are training method and operation difficulty level. Sixteen male subjects participated in this experiment. Eight participants were trained with Routine method and the other eight trained with Confusing method. Physiological parameters, such as respiratory rate, body temperature, heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), were adopted as the dependent variables to evaluate operator's workload. Results show that there are significant differences on body temperature, respiratory rate, cubic root of high frequency component (HF) of HRV, normalized low frequency component (LFNu) of HRV, and mean heart rate (HR) (p values are 0.010, 0.000, 0.042, 0.009 and 0.000, respectively) between training methods, while other physiological parameters show no significant difference. Furthermore, only significant difference on body temperature (p value is 0.010) was found between different operation difficulty levels. Therefore, suitable training methods deserve thorough investigation since they have significant effects on the physiological workload of the operators. In conclusion, this work provides insight into the effect of some influencing factors to workload during the RVD procedure, and will benefit the astronaut training in future.

44682f96ea1a705cba120770a123e0130e121544	heart sound feature reduction approach for improving the heart valve diseases identification		Recently, heart sound signals have been used in the detection of the heart valve status and the identification of the heart valve disease. Due to these characteristics, therefore, two feature reduction techniques have been proposed prior applying data classifications in this paper. The first technique is the chi-Square which measures the lack of independence between each heart sound feature and the target class, while the second technique is the deep believe network that uses to generate a new data set of a reduced number of features according the partition of the heart signals. The importance of feature reduction prior applying data classification is not only to improve the classification accuracy and to enhance the training and testing performance, but also it is important to detect which of the stages of heart sound is important for the detection of sick people among normal set of people, and which period important for the classification of heart murmur. Different classification algorithms including naive bayesian tree classifier and sequential minimal optimization was applied on three different data sets of 100 extracted features of the heart sound. The extensive experimental results on the heat sound signals data set demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other classifiers and providing the highest classification accuracy with minimized number of features.	algorithm;bayesian network;identifier;mathematical optimization;murmurhash;relevance;sequential minimal optimization	Mostafa A.

Compared to existing linear binary classifiers, we show that the convex hull-based classifier easily removes ambiguous regions on a feature space determined by common spatial patterns, which result in false positive and negative errors. Experiments confirmed the useful behavior of our convex hull-based classifier, compared to linear or RBF-kernel based SVM.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;robot combat	Yunjun Nam;Hyohyeong Kang;Qibin Zhao;Andrzej Cichocki;Seungjin Choi	2010	Austr.

The heart sound data of one cardiac cycle can be decomposed into a number of atoms characterized by timing delay, frequency, amplitude, time width and phase. To segment heart sounds, we made a hypothesis that the atoms of a heart sound congregate as a cluster in time–frequency domains. We propose an atom density function to indicate clusters. To suppress clusters of murmurs and noise, weighted density function by atom energy is further proposed to improve the segmentation of heart eywords: eart sound egmentation ynamic clustering ensity function sounds. Therefore, heart sounds are indicated by the hybrid analysis of clustering and medical knowledge. The segmentation scheme is automatic and no reference signal is needed. Twenty-six subjects, including 3 normal and 23 abnormal subjects, were tested for heart sound signals in various clinical cases. Our statistics show that the segmentation was successful for signals collected from normal subjects and patients with moderate murmurs. ycle detection	atom;cluster analysis;cycle detection	Hong Tang;Ting Li;Tianshuang Qiu;Yongwan Park	2012	Biomed.

4298ab92af26616ead715e59849f08bcde17c7d2	imaging corticospinal tract connectivity in injured rat spinal cord using manganese-enhanced mri	biological patents;biomedical journals;text mining;europe pubmed central;citation search;citation networks;research articles;imaging radiology;abstracts;open access;life sciences;clinical guidelines;full text;article;r medicine;rest apis;orcids;europe pmc;biomedical research;bioinformatics;literature search	BACKGROUND Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEI) offers a novel neuroimaging modality to trace corticospinal tract (CST) in live animals. This paper expands this capability further and tests the utility of MEI to image axonal fiber connectivity in CST of injured spinal cord (SC).   METHODS A rat was injured at the thoracic T4 level of the SC. The CST was labeled with manganese (Mn) injected intracortically at two weeks post injury. Next day, the injured SC was imaged using MEI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) modalities.   RESULTS In vivo MEI data obtained from cervical SC confirmed that CST was successfully labeled with Mn. Ex vivo MEI data obtained from excised SC depicted Mn labeling of the CST in SC sections caudal to the lesion, which meant that Mn was transported through the injury, possibly mediated by viable CST fibers present at the injury site. Examining the ex vivo data from the injury epicenter closely revealed a thin strip of signal enhancement located ventrally between the dorsal horns. This enhancement was presumably associated with the Mn accumulation in these intact fibers projecting caudally as part of the CST. Additional measurements with DTI supported this view.   CONCLUSION Combining these preliminary results collectively demonstrated the feasibility of imaging fiber connectivity in experimentally injured SC using MEI. This approach may play important role in future investigations aimed at understanding the neuroplasticity in experimental SCI research.	betula ermanii;caudal;computer science tripos;corticospinal tracts;cumulative trauma disorders;diffusion tensor imaging;dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta;dynamic imaging;editorial;experiment;futures studies;horns;manuscripts;music encoding initiative;neck;neuroimaging;neuronal plasticity;outlines (document);parse tree;powell's method;promotion (action);structure of posterior gray horn of spinal cord;tissue fiber;tracer;tract (literature);tree accumulation;united states national institutes of health;urinary tract infection;veracity;video-in video-out;citation;funding grant;interest	Mehmet Bilgen	2006	BMC Medical Imaging	10.1186/1471-2342-6-15	text mining;medical research;medicine;pathology;bioinformatics	HPC	21.7237734433899	-81.17925041392257	53172

We present a comparative analysis of several features and evaluate their discriminant power for the task of normal-abnormal signal classification. We statistically evaluate the feature distributions using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Bhattacharyya distance.

AlterG training was performed 3 days/week for 8 weeks, with up to 45 minutes of training per session. The subject was evaluated before and after the 8-week training. The effects of training on the balance and postural stability was evaluated based on the Romberg test that was performed by using a posturography device. The parameters quantifying Center-of-Pressure (CoP) were calculated using different analytical approaches including power spectral density and principal components analyses. All of the key parameters including the Stabilogram, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Energy, the Eigenvectors, and the Eigenvalues of CoP were modified between 14%-84%. The results indicated that the balance features were improved substantially after training. The clinical implication is that the AlterG has the potential to effectively improve postural stability in children with cerebral palsy.	cerebral palsy;fast fourier transform;romberg's method;spectral density;treadmill, device	Parmida Moradi Birgani;Meghdad Ashtiyani;Amirhossein Rasooli;Maryam Shahrokhnia;Amin Shahrokhi;Mehdi M.

In this paper, we present an approach to analyze aEEG in newborns based on approximate entropy (ApEn). Unlike the traditional aEEG signal processing and diagnosing methods, the Box-Cox transformation is substituted for semilogarithmic amplitude compression to keep the continuity of the signal, reduce the excessive compression of chaotic information in high amplitudes, and use ApEn, rather than the amplitudes of the borders, to estimate the degree of chaos in the signal. Experiments with aEEGs of 120 cases (32 normal and 88 abnormal of full-term infants, and 57 cases of preterm infants) were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show an aEEG signal analyzed based on the proposed algorithm always belongs to an abnormal case and needs to be examined by physicians if the corresponding indicator is considered abnormal. The novel description of aEEG could be helpful in detecting brain disorders in the newborn as a new clinical target.	a wave amplitude:pres:pt:pulmonary artery.wedge:qn;approximate entropy;brain diseases;compression;electroencephalography;infant, newborn;preterm infant;scott continuity;semi-log plot;sensor;signal processing;algorithm	Lei Li;Weiting Chen;Xiaomei Shao;Zhizhong Wang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2010.2055863	entropy;neuroscience;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;signal processing;communication;amplitude;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	SE	19.76897457434922	-88.13168309326963	53573

Four types of ECG beats (normal beat, congestive heart failure beat, ventricular tachyarrhythmia beat, atrial fibrillation beat) obtained from the Physiobank database were analyzed. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the RNN trained on the extracted features. The RNNs were implemented for classification of the ECG beats using the statistical features as inputs. The ability of designed and trained Elman RNNs, combined with eigenvector methods, were explored to classify the ECG beats. The classification results demonstrated that the combined eigenvector methods/RNN approach can be useful in analyzing the ECG beats.

d74e708a058f0590c7a2ad679af483dad46acac1	multimodal gender detection		Automatic gender classification is receiving increasing attention in the computer interaction community as the need for personalized, reliable, and ethical systems arises. To date, most gender classification systems have been evaluated on textual and audiovisual sources. This work explores the possibility of enhancing such systems with physiological cues obtained from thermography and physiological sensor readings. Using a multimodal dataset consisting of audiovisual, thermal, and physiological recordings of males and females, we extract features from five different modalities, namely acoustic, linguistic, visual, thermal, and physiological. We then conduct a set of experiments where we explore the gender prediction task using single and combined modalities. Experimental results suggest that physiological and thermal information can be used to recognize gender at reasonable accuracy levels, which are comparable to the accuracy of current gender prediction systems. Furthermore, we show that the use of non-contact physiological measurements, such as thermography readings, can enhance current systems that are based on audio or visual input. This can be particularly useful for scenarios where non-contact approaches are preferred, i.e., when data is captured under noisy audiovisual conditions or when video or speech data are not available due to ethical considerations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computer forensics;conductance (graph);experiment;multimodal interaction;personalization;pitch (music);pulse;real life;requirement;sensor;statistical classification;video	Mohamed Abouelenien;Verónica Pérez-Rosas;Rada Mihalcea;Mihai Burzo	2017		10.1145/3136755.3136770	artificial intelligence;modalities;computer vision;thermography;computer science	HCI	10.240696788882428	-93.84396722947186	53679

Several works in the literature have evaluated these changes by considering approaches at the single EEG channel level, but multivariate analyses have been scarcely investigated in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) subjects. The aim of the present work is to assess if and how hypoglycemia affects EEG coherence in a subset of EEG channels acquired in a hospital setting where eye- and muscle activation-induced artifacts are virtually absent. In particular, EEG multichannel data, acquired in 19 T1D hospitalized subjects undertaken to an insulin-induced hypoglycemia experiment, are considered. Computation of Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) through multivariate autoregressive models of P3-A1A2, P4-A1A2, C3-A1A2 and C4-A1A2 EEG channels shows that a decrease in the value of coherence, most likely related to the progressive loss of cognitive function and altered cerebral activity, occurs when passing from eu- to hypoglycemia, in both theta ([4, 8] Hz) and alpha ([8, 13] Hz) bands.	autoregressive model;bands;chomsky hierarchy;cognition;computation;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent;electroencephalography;hertz (hz);hypoglycemia;hypoglycemic agents;morphologic artifacts;muscle;programme delivery control;subgroup	Maria Rubega;Giovanni Sparacino;Anne-Sophie Sejling;C.

In contrast, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are another class of seizures that are involuntary events not caused by abnormal electrical discharges but are a manifestation of psychological distress. The similarity of these two types of seizures poses diagnostic challenges that often leads in delayed diagnosis of PNES. Further, the diagnosis of PNES involves high-cost hospital admission and monitoring using video-electroencephalogram machines. A wearable device that can monitor the patient in natural setting is a desired solution for diagnosis of convulsive PNES. A wearable device with an accelerometer sensor is proposed as a new solution in the detection and diagnosis of PNES. The seizure detection algorithm and PNES classification algorithm are developed. The developed algorithms are tested on data collected from convulsive epileptic patients. A very high seizure detection rate is achieved with 100% sensitivity and few false alarms. A leave-one-out error of 6.67% is achieved in PNES classification, demonstrating the usefulness of wearable device in the diagnosis of PNES.	body fluid discharge;electroencephalography;epilepsy;hospital costs;hospital admission;inventory;leave-one-out error;patients;seizures;wearable technology;accelerometers;algorithm;nervous system disorder	Jayavardhana Gubbi;Shitanshu Kusmakar;Aravinda S.

QRS detection in the electrocardiogram signal is very crucial as a preliminary step for obtaining QRS complex, beat segmentation, and beat-to-beat intervals. Two main problems in QRS detection are a variety of noise types and various types of abnormal morphologies. We propose a QRS detection algorithm consisting of the quadratic filter for enhancing QRS signal to noise ratio. Results show that significant improvement in QRS signal to noise ratio can be obtained from challenging situations including low amplitude QRS complexes corrupted by baseline drift and abnormal morphologies such as an aberrated atrial premature beat, a premature ventricular contraction beat, a fusion of ventricular and normal beat, and a fusion of paced and normal beat. The enhancements in QRS signal to noise ratio allow us to use a single fixed threshold without any additional post-processing techniques in beat detection step. The performance of proposed algorithm was evaluated with the electrocardiogram data from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Results show that the quadratic filter is capable of enhancing QRS signal to noise very well leading to the average detection error rate of 0.38% from 48 records.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);beat detection;bounding interval hierarchy;computation;preprocessor;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;thresholding (image processing);video post-processing	Pornchai Phukpattaranont	2015	Expert Syst.

49ba0a9772c99e2a9a6f268455f741169f15fab6	heart rate variability analysis using neural network models for automatic detection of lifestyle activities		Abstract The quality of life and individual well-being are crucial factors in disease prevention. Particularly, healthy lifestyle lessens the risk and occurrence of main diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. Since a patient has an active role in being a co-producer of his/her health, innovative devices and technologies have been devoted to helping folks in self-evaluation and expected to play a key role to maintain their well-being. In this work, we present a very promising assessment tool for health, Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is the difference in time between one heartbeat and the next. HRV measurement is simple and non-invasive, it is derived from recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) on free-moving subjects. The main aim of this work is to investigate the dynamics in the autonomic regulation of the heart rate by using frequency and temporal analysis to correlate between the HRV and these physiological patterns. In addition to the applied frequency and temporal analyses, pattern recognition is also accomplished using Neural Networks which are further implemented and explored in this work. In the first place, the detection of the sleep/awake states is achieved. Next, a multiclassification of different types of activities such as sleeping, walking, exercising and eating is performed.	heart rate variability	Sarah Christina Matta;Ziad Sankari;Sandy Rihana	2018	Biomed.

The level of glucose in blood is regulated by the flux/reflux and controlled by hyperglycemia hormones and hypoglycemic insulin. Glycemic profiles are characterized by a nonlinear and nonstationary behavior but also influenced by circadian rhythms and patient daily routine which introduce quasi- periodic trends into them. This type of signals are commonly analyzed by Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) which states that the control system in charge of regulating the glucose level usually holds a long- range negative correlation. But there is an inconsistency about the windowing lengths, as no standard or rules are set. This work studies the influence of the windowing length sequence, and shows that there is a need for selecting the optimal values in order to obtain a good differentiation between different groups, and these values are somehow determined by signal characteristics.	control system;detrended fluctuation analysis;direct fluorescent antibody test;gastroesophageal reflux disease;glucose;hyperglycemia;hypoglycemic agents;nonlinear system;patients;quantum fluctuation;rem sleep behavior disorder;rule (guideline);sleep disorders, circadian rhythm;time series	Eva M.

In the majority of studies the cerebellum has been used as a reference region. However, cerebellar amyloid may be present in genetic Alzheimer's (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy and prion diseases. Therefore, we investigated whether the pons could be used as an alternative reference region for the analysis of [(11)C]PIB binding in AD. The aims of the study were to: 1) Evaluate the pons as a reference region using arterial plasma input function and Logan graphical analysis of binding. 2) Assess the power of target-to-pons ratios to discriminate controls from AD subjects. 3) Determine the test-retest reliability in AD subjects. 4) Demonstrate the application of target-to-pons ratio in subjects with elevated cerebellar [(11)C]PIB binding.   METHODS 12 sporadic AD subjects aged 65 ± 4.5 yrs with a mean MMSE 21.4 ± 4 and 10 age-matched control subjects had [(11)C]PIB PET with arterial blood sampling. Three additional subjects (two subjects with pre-symptomatic presenilin-1 mutation carriers and one probable familial AD) were also studied. Object maps were created by segmenting individual MRIs and spatially transforming the gray matter images into standard stereotaxic MNI space and then superimposing a probabilistic atlas. Cortical [(11)C]PIB binding was assessed with an ROI (region of interest) analysis. Parametric maps of the volume of distribution (V(T)) were generated with Logan analysis. Additionally, parametric maps of the 60-90 min target-to-cerebellar ratio (RATIO(CER)) and the 60-90 min target-to-pons ratio (RATIO(PONS)) were computed.   RESULTS All three approaches were able to differentiate AD from controls (p<0.0001, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test) in the target regions with RATIO(CER) and RATIO(PONS) differences higher than V(T) with use of an arterial input function. All methods had a good reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient>0.83); RATIO(CER) performed best closely followed by RATIO(PONS). The two subjects with presenilin-1 mutations and the probable familial AD case showed no significant differences in cortical binding using RATIO(CER), but the RATIO(PONS) approach revealed higher [(11)C]PIB binding in cortex and cerebellum.   CONCLUSION This study established 60-90 min target-to-pons RATIOs as a reliable method of analysis in [(11)C]PIB PET studies where cerebellum is not an appropriate reference region.	cdisc sdtm respiratory test name terminology;cerebellar diseases;cerebral amyloid angiopathy;cervical atlas;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;dementia;gray matter;hyperlipoproteinemia type i;map;maxima and minima;mutation;plasma active;polyethylene terephthalate;pontine structure;presenilin-1;prion diseases;prions;probability;region of interest;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;test-retest reliability;vascular diseases;venous blood sampling;drug distribution volume	Paul Edison;Rainer Hinz;Anil F.

The BioVid Emo DB is a multimodal database recorded for the purpose of analyzing human affective states and data mining related to emotion. Psychophysiological signals such as Skin Conductance Level, Electrocardiogram, Trapezius Electromyogram and also 4 video signals were recorded. 5 discrete emotions (amusement, sadness, anger, disgust and fear) were elicited by 15 standardized film clips. 94 participants watched them, rated them in terms of the experienced emotional level and selected the film clips that evoked the strongest emotion. A preliminary analysis of the subjective ratings made during the experiment is presented.

d0fe033fb9af5d2a58b72ea3a2274bad5d0c8fe6	multi-attention recurrent network for human communication comprehension		Human face-to-face communication is a complex multimodal signal. We use words (language modality), gestures (vision modality) and changes in tone (acoustic modality) to convey our intentions. Humans easily process and understand faceto-face communication, however, comprehending this form of communication remains a significant challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI must understand each modality and the interactions between them that shape human communication. In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for understanding human communication called the Multiattention Recurrent Network (MARN). The main strength of our model comes from discovering interactions between modalities through time using a neural component called the Multi-attention Block (MAB) and storing them in the hybrid memory of a recurrent component called the Long-short Term Hybrid Memory (LSTHM). We perform extensive comparisons on six publicly available datasets for multimodal sentiment analysis, speaker trait recognition and emotion recognition. MARN shows state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets.

Attachment assessment is an expensive and time-consuming process that is not often performed. The School Attachment Monitor (SAM) automates Attachment assessment to support expert assessors. It uses doll-play activities with the dolls augmented with sensors and the child's play recorded with cameras to provide data for assessment. Social signal processing tools are then used to analyse the data and to automatically categorize Attachment patterns. This paper presents the current SAM interactive prototype.	attachments;categorization;prototype;sensor;signal processing	Dong-Bach Vo;Mohammad Tayarani;Maki Rooksby;Rui Huan;Alessandro Vinciarelli;Helen Minnis;Stephen A.

Functional relevance analysis is performed over input multichannel data by computing the pair-wise channel similarities to describe the main behavior of the considered applications. Particularly, the well-known Kernel Least Mean Square filter is enhanced using a correntropy-based similarity criterion between channel pairs. Besides, two sparseness criteria are studied to extract a sample subset that constructs a learning model displaying a good trade-off between filter complexity and accuracy. The proposed approach allows devising complex relationship among multi-channel time-series, revealing dependencies among the channels and the process time-structure. The method is tested in a well-known MoCap data set. Results show that our framework is an adequate alternative for finding functional relevance amongst multi-channel time-series.	kernel (operating system);kernel adaptive filter;motion capture;neural coding;relevance;time series;whole earth 'lectronic link	Andrés Marino Álvarez-Meza;Germán Castellanos-Domínguez;José Carlos Príncipe	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854427	speech recognition;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Robotics	21.983263801059127	-88.73053727256007	55433
561aab857f67926830e4a27b91ca5e1190fa40d9	analysis of a smartphone-based architecture with multiple mobility sensors for fall detection		This paper describes a wearable Fall Detection System (FDS) based on a body-area network consisting of four nodes provided with inertial sensors and Bluetooth wireless interfaces. The signals captured by the nodes are sent to a smartphone which simultaneously acts as another sensing point. In contrast to many FDSs proposed by the literature (which only consider a single sensor), the multisensory nature of the prototype is utilized to investigate the impact of the number and the positions of the sensors on the effectiveness of the production of the fall detection decision. In particular, the study assesses the capability of four popular machine learning algorithms to discriminate the dynamics of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and falls generated by a set of experimental subjects, when the combined use of the sensors located on different parts of the body is considered. Prior to this, the election of the statistics that optimize the characterization of the acceleration signals and the efficacy of the FDS is also investigated. As another important methodological novelty in this field, the statistical significance of all the results (an aspect which is usually neglected by other works) is validated by an analysis of variance (ANOVA).	accidental falls;family computer disk system;patients;smartphone;testbed;sensor (device)	Jose A.

39ff2b7c4c606424175696f7fa23e84b7373ced4	recognizing visual signatures of spontaneous head gestures		Head movements are an integral part of human nonverbal communication. As such, the ability to detect various types of head gestures from video is important for robotic systems that need to interact with people or for assistive technologies that may need to detect conversational gestures to aid communication. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Deep Convolution-LSTM architecture, capable of recognizing short and long term motion patterns found in head gestures, from video data of natural and unconstrained conversations. In particular, our models use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn meaningful representations from short time windows over head motion data. To capture longer term dependencies, we use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that extract temporal patterns across the output of the CNNs. We compare against classical approaches using discriminative and generative graphical models and show that our model is able to significantly outperform baseline models.	assistive technology;baseline (configuration management);convolution;convolutional neural network;discriminative model;electronic signature;floor and ceiling functions;generative model;gesture recognition;graphical model;ibm notes;long short-term memory;microsoft windows;recurrent neural network;robot;spontaneous order	Mohit Sharma;Dragan Ahmetovic;László A.

15dced7e6875caeb37fa78044b2ea225f118c2b7	on the study of impacts of brain conditions on eeg-based cryptographic key generation systems		Abstract In this paper, we investigate impacts of brain conditions on an EEG-based cryptographic key generation system. Brain disorders, such as epilepsy and alcohol, involve in the EEG signal and hence it may have impacts on the system. This issue has not been analyzed in the literature. To solve this issue, we introduce a method for key generation from EEG signals, and implement experiments on the Australian EEG and the Alcoholism datasets. We use parametric spectrum estimate technique for feature exaction, and devised a error-correction quantization technique that is useful for a noisy data such as EEG. For experimental methodology, we perform on two groups of subjects, epileptic and non-epileptic, alcoholic and non-alcoholic to investigate the impact of brain conditions on the success rate of system. Experimental results show that both epilepsy and alcoholic actually have impacts on the performance of system.

An integrated hardware and software solution is built to improve their standard of living, consisting of sensor network based motion-capture gloves, a low-level signal processing unit and a mobile application for high-level natural language processing. This paper introduces the overall system architecture and describes our automatic sign language interpreter software solution that processes the gesture descriptor stream of the motion-capture gloves, produces understandable text and reads it out as audible speech. The main logic of our automatic sign language interpreter consists of two algorithms: sign descriptor stream segmentation and text auto-correction. The software architecture of this time-sensitive complex application and the semantics of the developed hand gesture descriptor are described.

In this study, wavelet-based fractal analysis is used to examine self-similar or scale-invariant characteristics of intracranial EEG data in terms of the spectral exponent. The intracranial EEG data were recorded from subjects with epilepsy during non-seizure period and during epileptic seizure activity. From the computational results, it is observed that the self-similar or scale-invariant characteristics of the intracranial EEG data obtained during these two periods are significantly different. The actual value of the estimated spectral exponent depends on the wavelet bases used for the computations. 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	computation;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;fractal analysis;self-similarity;wavelet	Suparerk Janjarasjitt;Kenneth A.

First, time and frequency features are extracted from the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Then, GMM is used to cluster these extracted features into burst & non burst. Those features with their class name are then used as the input for the AntCC algorithm in order to derive classification rules. Finally, the obtained rules are used to detect sEMG activation timing of human skeletal muscles during movement. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by means of synthetic simulated sEMG signals and real ones. The proposed technique is then compared to two previously published techniques: wavelet transform-based method [1] & double threshold-based method [2]. It is concluded that our technique outperforms those methods and significantly improves the accuracy of good MA timing detection. Moreover, to our knowledge, the proposed technique is the first user-independent one since no tuning parameters are required. Our findings show that the proposed method is convenient for automatically processing large amounts of sEMG signals with performance beyond that of the state of the-art methods.	activation function;algorithm;ant colony;burst transmission;dhrystone;electromyography;embedded system;google map maker;mixture model;onset (audio);real-time clock;synthetic intelligence;wavelet transform	Amal Naseem;Meryem Jabloun;Olivier Buttelli;Philippe Ravier	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760541	speech recognition;engineering;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	17.69388021121043	-89.64153075030576	56208

There is a strong requirement for more effective management of these chronic diseases. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are one kind of devices currently employed to deliver medication aimed at controlling asthma and COPD symptoms. Despite their proven effectiveness when used correctly, some patients are unable to reach the inspiratory flow rate required to remove medication from the breath actuated devices and as a result, the medication does not reach the airways. This study employs an acoustic recording device, attached to a common DPI to record the audio signals of simulated inhalations. A rotameter was used to measure the flow rate through the inhaler while a milligram weighing scale was used to measure the amount of drug removed from each simulated inhalation. It was found that a strong correlation existed (R2>0.96) when average power, median amplitude, root mean square and mean absolute deviation were used to predict peak inspiratory flow rate. At a flow of 30L/Min (mean absolute deviation=0.0049), it was found that 77% of the total emitted dose was removed from the inhaler. Results indicate that acoustic measurements may be used in the prediction of inspiratory flow rate and quantity of medication removed from an inhaler.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustics;audio media;ct pulmonary angiogram;chronic obstructive airway disease;chronic disease;currently employed;dots per inch;dry powder inhaler (device);dry run (testing);inspiration function;lung diseases, obstructive;lung diseases;mean squared error;morbidity - disease rate;patients;respiration disorders;root mean square;milligram	Martin S.

There have been tremendous efforts to improve such a lifestyle and reduce abdominal obesity. One of the results suggests that a correct posture could lead the reduction of the abdominal obesity. However, it is difficult for users to measure, record and correct their postures by themselves. Therefore, it is required to have a tool to enhance the situation. It is assumed that wearable devices can be used for supporting the efforts of reducing the abdominal obesity. In this paper, it is proposed to develop a wearable device, called Smart Belt, for life-logging, monitoring and analyzing living body data with personal big data processing.	big data;lifelog;poor posture;wearable technology	Hyejeong Nam;Jin Hyun Kim;Jee-In Kim	2016	2016 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BigComp)	10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425964	simulation;engineering;biological engineering;surgery	Robotics	7.127481654609641	-87.71809266723982	56362

Deficits in balance and postural control have long been associated with falls risk in elderly adults. The gold standard for quantitative assessment of human balance in a clinical setting is the force plate which is highly expensive, non-portable and requires specialized personnel to operate. The present study aims to evaluate the validity and reliability of a portable quantitative balance measurement technology compared to the forceplate. Two participants (1 male, 1 female) performed sixteen balance trials each (eight eyes open and eight eyes closed). Simultaneous data were recorded from a portable pressure sensor platform and a laboratory grade force platform. Standard centre of pressure (COP) metrics from both modalities were compared and high levels of agreement in terms of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean percentage error (MPE) were found.	8 eyes;ablepharon;accidental falls;approximation error;deploy;evaluation procedure;eye;mean squared error;pearson correlation coefficient;pressure sensor device component;primary health care;risk assessment;sixteen;software deployment;algorithm	Lorcan Walsh;Barry R.

1e61e60a912c8b72a8621c0c2d4bb0ed98b5fbdc	wearable healthcare systems: a single channel accelerometer based anomaly detector for studies of gait freezing in parkinson's disease		The causality of gait freezing in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease is still not fully understood. Clinicians are interested in investigating the freezing of gait (FoG) histogram of patients in their daily life. To that end, one needs a real-time signal processing platform that can help record freezing information (e.g., timing and the duration of every gait freezing occurrences). Wearable wireless sensors have been proposed to monitor FoG epochs. Existing automated methods using accelerometers have been introduced with high accuracy performance only for subject-dependent settings (e.g., an individual offline training process). This is a troublesome for large scale out-of-lab deployment and time-consuming. In this work, we used spectral coherence analysis for accelerometer data to apply an anomaly detection approach. Conventional features such as energy and freezing index are introduced to help refine normal epochs while the anomaly scores from spectral coherence measures define FoG epochs. Using this new set of features, our new FoG detector for subject-independent settings achieves the mean ±SD sensitivity (specificity) of 89.2±0.3% (95.6 ± 0.3%). To our best knowledge, this is the best performance for automated subject-independent approaches in literature of freezing of gait detection.	anomaly detection;causality;coherence (physics);digital scholarship;endeavour software project management;fog computing;online and offline;real-time locating system;scalability;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;signal processing;software deployment;unix signal	Thuy T.

Twenty-four-hour electrocardiographic (ECG) approaches to risk stratification include: counts of ventricular premature contractions (VPCs), measures of heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate turbulence (HRT) which has two components, turbulence onset and turbulence slope (TS). Refinement of these ECG risk stratifiers could enhance their clinical utility. We explored the structural relationships between heart rate (HR) and HRV and HRT measures. Our goal was to separate out the component of these measures due to the underlying average heart rate (HR), thus potentially reducing the variability of the measures and increasing their power to stratify risk. We proposed re-scaling tachograms of heart-beat intervals so that the re-scaled tachogram has a HR of 75 (or equivalently an average interval of 800 ms) and calculating HRV and HRT from the rescaled time series. We also explored the relationship between the number of VPCs and HRT. We showed that TS is structurally related to the number of VPCs (and hence to the length of the ECG recording). We proposed an adjusted TS that is independent of the number of VPCs. We also addressed the ability of shorter ECG recording to estimate HRV and HRT measures. We evaluated standard and rescaled HRV and HRT measures using qualifying ambulatory ECG recordings from 744 patients in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. We found that measures based on the rescaled tachogram had reduced variance (20% to 40%). Correlations between measures were also substantially reduced. We also found substantial circadian effects on some, but not all HRV indices, not explained by the circadian pattern in HR and possibly pointing to additional measures for risk prediction. In conclusion, we found that adjusting for HR and the number of VPCs in heart-beat related ambulatory ECG measures has the potential to significantly improve the power of these measures to risk stratify cardiac patients.	ejection fraction (procedure);heart rate variability;hormone replacement therapy;image scaling;onset (audio);patients;premature ventricular contractions;risk assessment;sample variance;stratification;structural cut-off;test scaling;time series;turbulence;ventricular fibrillation;ventricular remodeling;zero suppression	Alfred P.

The neurological background of the ssMRPs which are primarily studied by means of the averaged electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are briefly reviewed. A simple feature extraction method is suggested for single trial ssMRP processing. The proposed BCI paradigm is tested by using the Fishers linear discriminant (FLD) classifier. The novelty of this approach is mainly in the application of rhythmic cues for BCI, simple recording setup, and straightforward computations which make the real-time implementations plausible.	bereitschaftspotential;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;computation;electroencephalography;feature extraction;linear discriminant analysis;preparation;programming paradigm;radiotherapy systems, linear accelerator;real-time computing;real-time transcription;steady state	Kianoush Nazarpour;Peter Praamstra;R.

Such findings, however, lead to new challenges in how to quantify and interpret movement patterns. We posit that changes in coordination are most evident in statistical distributions of movements. In a test on 10 chronic stroke subjects practicing for 3 days, we found that inter-quartile range of motion did not show improvement. However, a multivariate Gaussians analysis required more complexity at the end of training. Beyond simply characterizing movement, linear discriminant classification of each patient's movement distribution also identified that each patient's motor deficit left a unique signature. The greatest distinctions were observed in the space of accelerations (rather than position or velocity). These results suggest that unique deficits are best detected with such a distribution analysis, and also point to the need for customized interventions that consider such patient-specific motor deficits.	cerebrovascular accident;discriminant;motor neuron disease;movement;patients;statistical distributions;statistical classification;velocity (software development);benefit	Felix C.

When superimposed, these components were used in a direct fit to the isometric force data to generate a linear predictor that resulted in residual values on the order of the white noise present in the original force time series.	gaussian blur;hertz (hz);isometric projection;kerrison predictor;normal statistical distribution;pink noise;spectral density;steady state;time series;white noise	Joseph P.

8d2d446232f2db4d5f5eae1cf77cbad232e4fedc	olfactory identification and white matter integrity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a preliminary study		Increasing evidence suggests that olfactory impairment is associated with an increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment MCI to Alzheimer's disease. This study was to explore how olfactory identification relates to white matter WM integrity, using diffusion tensor imaging DTI in individuals with amnestic MCI. DTI was performed from nineteen individuals with amnestic MCI mean age: 69.95±8.20 years. Olfactory identification was assessed using the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test CC-SIT, a widely used test for odor identification involving a scratch and sniff test of 12 micro-encapsulated odorants. Cross-sectional voxel-wise analyses of relationships between CC-SIT scores and DTI indices were performed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Higher CC-SIT scores were associated with lower mean, axial and radial diffusivities in areas such as the body and splenium of corpus callosum, frontal WM lateral orbitofrontal, caudal middle frontal, precentral, left superior frontal, and right pars opercularis, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, anterior and superior corona radiata, and internal and external capsules, while CC-SIT scores were not significantly associated with fractional anisotropy across all MCI participants. In individuals with amnestic MCI, impaired olfactory identification is associated with alterations in WM integrity expressed as a lower diffusivities value. This cross-sectional preliminary study suggests that olfactory impairment contributes to WM microstructural alterations in individuals with amnestic MCI. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

02538485988a5d8ec04557825067c6284bbed721	an experimental comparison of brain activity in professional and non-professional sewers during the use of sewing needles		The purpose of this experiment is to analyze differences in brain activity of people using hand motor skills. The subjects were twelve healthy female adults with professional or non-professional sewing abilities. Near infrared radiation spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure the brain activity of each subject related to the movement of fingers during the “needling” process. Furthermore, the finger muscle activity was measured to assist in calculating the value of the integral during the needling. “Needling” performance (number of needle stitches, needle stitch intervals, and completion time) was also recorded. The study required the subjects to sew four types of stitches in 20 second intervals. The results show that while the subjects with professional skills made a significantly higher number of needle stitches, there was no significant difference between the non-professionals. No major muscle activity occurred in either group, although there was some increase in force used by the non-professionals. An increasing tendency was found in the presence of oxy-Hb in the brain activity, which corresponded with the rhythm of the muscle activity. In the professional group it was present in the prefrontal cortex and the motor cortex during the related movement of needling. These results are similar to those found in a previous study. The findings of this study may be useful in understanding the skill level of non-expert sewers by analyzing either the brain activity or changes in the muscle activity of the fingers.	electroencephalography	Masako Omori;Yukari Morishita;Asuka Kawakita	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22095-1_61	cognitive psychology;multimedia;brain activity and meditation;motor cortex;motor skill;computer science;prefrontal cortex;radiation;dry needling	NLP	15.094526551110855	-82.31107996668334	57243

5c78fa889d3ee0feefa8545940f43e88be01d966	a novel feature set for video emotion recognition		Abstract In video recommendation systems, emotions are used along with several other proposed content-based video features. However, such features are independently based on visual or audio signals and the relationship representing the dependencies between the visual and the audio signals is still unexplored. In order to solve this problem, a novel feature set called HHTC features based on the combination of Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) based visual features, HHT-based audio features, and cross-correlation features is proposed in this paper. In addition to the dependencies between the visual and the audio signals, the proposed HHTC features have the ability to indicate the time-varying characteristics of these signals. The proposed features are applied to video emotion recognition with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) with potential use in video affective recommendation systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve an improved performance of video affective recognition.	emotion recognition	Shasha Mo;Jianwei Niu;Yiming Su;Sajal K.

We implemented a cross-species, hippocampal-dependent task--the virtual Morris Water task--to assess hippocampal function in people with PTSD and age-matched controls during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Performance on the task was equivalent between the groups. However, when correlating fMRI-derived hippocampal activity during this task with PTSD severity, we observe a -0.84 correlation, indicating that those with reduced hippocampal activity show more severe PTSD symptoms. This correlation is not explained by differences in task performance, IQ, duration since trauma, nor time with PTSD. Hence, PTSD severity is predicted by functionally assessing the hippocampus using the virtual Morris water task, suggesting that this task may be used to identify those at risk for developing PTSD following a trauma.	brain;magnetic resonance imaging;memory disorders;post-traumatic stress disorder;stress disorders, traumatic;wounds and injuries;fmri	Robert Astur;Sarah A.

This study employed the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) to address the problem with a posed hypothesis that background or emotion-irrelevant EEG perturbations lead to certain variability across days and somehow submerge emotion-related EEG dynamics. The empirical results of this study evidently validated our hypothesis and demonstrated the RPCA's feasibility through the analysis of a five-day dataset of 12 subjects. The RPCA allowed tackling the sparse emotion-relevant EEG dynamics from the accompanied background perturbations across days. Sequentially, leveraging the RPCA-purified EEG trials from more days appeared to improve the emotion-classification performance steadily, which was not found in the case using the raw EEG features. Therefore, incorporating the RPCA with existing emotion-aware machine-learning frameworks on a longitudinal dataset of each individual may shed light on the development of a robust affective brain-computer interface (ABCI) that can alleviate ecological inter-day variability.	brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography phase synchronization;http 404;heart rate variability;interface device component;machine learning;relevance;robust principal component analysis;silo (dataset);sparse matrix;spatial variability;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Ping-Keng Jao;Yuan-Pin Lin;Yi-Hsuan Yang;Tzyy-Ping Jung	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318426	psychology;speech recognition;machine learning;pattern recognition	SE	14.714085515510481	-94.83498458760819	57417
1292b46c4b47713df9c2234b0bee926a3e515750	poster abstract: comparison of classifiers for prediction of human actions in a smart home		There is a strong interest in IoT-based systems that monitor and control smart home environments by accurately predicting the needs of the human occupants. Past research has focused on the accuracy of prediction of a user's future action. However, much of that work uses synthetic datasets which do not always reflect the real-world interactions that occur between an individual and the home environment. In addition, a focus on prediction accuracy often comes at the cost of slower processing time. This paper focuses on the prediction of future human actions in an intelligent environment with the goal of achieving both high accuracy and real-time performance. We performed experiments using the MavPad dataset, which was gathered from a fully-instrumented home environment, and compared several different machine learning algorithms that included both single and ensemble classifiers. The results show that using a Support Vector Machine approach achieved the best results when using a group of sensors within a local zone around the user and the Random Forest classifier achieved higher performance when using sensors that are distributed across the entire home environment.	algorithm;experiment;home automation;intelligent environment;interaction;machine learning;random forest;real-time clock;sensor;support vector machine;synthetic intelligence	Basman M.

Revealing the cause of the decrease has the possibility to evaluate video content objectively. In this paper we discuss the relationship between subjective evaluation and brain activity on video content.

246553cd2137944fb7798868cb3fc9da6175f7be	instrumented vest for postural reeducation		According to the World Health Organization, 85% of the world population suffers from back pain, which accounts for over 50% of physical incapacity, permanent or temporary, among individuals in working-age. In most situations, this is caused by an incorrect posture, which causes changes in the spine structure. This paper proposes an instrumented vest for postural reeducation to address this issue. The vest has a set of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors strategically placed to provide an accurate characterization of the spine profile. The sensor readings are classified by a central processing unit. In case of an incorrect posture, users are alerted by an audio signal and through vibration. The wearable system works in stand-alone mode, but can also communicate with external systems through an API. Two applications were developed to communicate with the device through this API, one intended to run on a desktop computer and the other one for Android devices. These applications monitor spine profiles in real time and notify the user of incorrect postures, among other functionalities. The device prototype and the applications have been tested by 10 individuals in two different settings, first without any kind of feedback and then with feedback enabled. The tests demonstrate the usability, accuracy and robustness of the system, proving its high level of reliability in classifying postures and effectiveness for postural reeducation. In the future, the system is expected to be used as a platform for a serious game, to promote posture reeducation in a real world scenario.	android;application programming interface;central processing unit;desktop computer;feedback;high-level programming language;poor posture;population;prototype;resident monitor;sensor;usability;wearable computer	Pedro Carvalho;Sandro F.

Currently, CSFp is measured invasively through implanted catheters within the brain (ventricles and parenchyma) which is associated with a risk of infection and morbidity. In humans, the cerebrospinal fluid communicates indirectly with the ocular circulation across the lamina cribrosa via the optic nerve subarachnoid space. It has been shown that a relationship between retinal venous pulsation, intraocular pressure (IOP) and CSFp exists with the amplitude of retinal venous pulsation being associated with the trans-laminar pressure gradient (i.e. IOP-CSFp). In this study we use this characteristic to develop a non-invasive approach to estimate CSFp. 15 subjects were included in this study. Dynamic retinal venous diameter changes and IOP were measured and fitted into our model. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied to construct a relationship between retinal venous pulsation amplitude, IOP (input) and CSFp (output) and develop an algorithm to estimate CSFp based on these parameters. Results show a mean square error of 2.4 mmHg and 1.27 mmHg for train and test data respectively. There was no significant difference between experimental and ANN estimated CSFp values (p>;0.01).This study suggests measurement of retinal venous pulsatility in conjunction with IOP may provide a novel approach to estimate CSFp non-invasively.	algorithm;artificial neural network;brain neoplasms;cerebral ventricles;cerebrospinal fluid pressure;congenital abnormality;diameter (qualifier value);gradient;hydrocephalus;hypertensive disease;implants;infection;interoperability;intracranial hypertension;layer (electronics);mean squared error;morbidity - disease rate;multilayer perceptron;numerous;optic nerve (gchq);parenchyma;physiologic intraocular pressure;retina;seizures;source-to-source compiler;subarachnoid space;test data;nervous system disorder;torr	S.

Twelve de novo brain tumor patients, who underwent clinical fMRI examinations, including task-based fMRI (tbfMRI) and rsfMRI, were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved study. Each patient displayed decreased/absent tbfMRI activation in the primary ipsilesional (IL) sensorimotor cortex in the absence of a corresponding motor deficit or suboptimal task performance, consistent with NVU. Z-score maps for the motor tasks were obtained from general linear model analysis (reflecting motor activation vs. rest). Seed-based correlation analysis (SCA) maps of sensorimotor network, ALFF, and fALFF were calculated from rsfMRI data. Precentral and postcentral gyri in contralesional (CL) and IL hemispheres were parcellated using an automated anatomical labeling template for each patient. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on four maps: tbfMRI, SCA, ALFF, and fALFF. Voxel values in the CL and IL ROIs of each map were divided by the corresponding global mean of ALFF and fALFF in the cortical brain tissue. Group analysis revealed significantly decreased IL ALFF (p = 0.02) and fALFF (p = 0.03) metrics compared with CL ROIs, consistent with similar findings of significantly decreased IL BOLD signal for tbfMRI (p = 0.0005) and SCA maps (p = 0.0004). The frequency domain metrics ALFF and fALFF may be markers of lesion-induced NVU in rsfMRI similar to previously reported alterations in tbfMRI activation and SCA-derived resting-state functional connectivity maps.

This is poorly characterised in humans and does not reflect the predominantly venous nature of BOLD contrast, whilst this relationship may vary across brain regions and depend on the structure of the local vascular bed. This work demonstrates a new approach to BOLD calibration which does not require an assumption about the relationship between cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow. This method involves repeating the same stimulus both at normoxia and hyperoxia, using hyperoxic BOLD contrast to estimate the relative changes in venous blood oxygenation and venous CBV. To do this the effect of hyperoxia on venous blood oxygenation has to be calculated, which requires an estimate of basal oxygen extraction fraction, and this can be estimated from the phase as an alternative to using a literature estimate. Additional measurement of the relative change in CBF, combined with the blood oxygenation change can be used to calculate the relative change in CMRO(2) due to the stimulus. CMRO(2) changes of 18 ± 8% in response to a motor task were measured without requiring the assumption of a CBV/CBF coupling relationship, and are in agreement with previous approaches.	arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging;assumed;basal (phylogenetics);calibration;cell respiration;cerebral blood volume;cerebrovascular circulation;hyperoxia;oxygen;relative change and difference;tracer extraction fraction;while	Ian D.

1d157f07f930529492720f67c69a6173adce6560	neural activity estimation from eeg using an iterative dynamic inverse problem solution		Estimation of neural activity using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals allows identifying with high temporal resolution those brain structures related to pathological states. This work aims to improve spatial resolution of estimated neural activity employing time-varying dynamic constraints within the iterative inverse problem framework. Particularly, we introduce the use of Dynamic Neural Fields (DNF) to represent neural activity directly related to epileptic foci localization adequately. So, we develop a DNF-based time variant estimation model in the form of an Iterative Regularization Algorithm (IRA) that carries out neural activity estimation at every time EEG sample. The IRA model performance that is evaluated on simulated and real cases is compared with the baseline static and dynamic methods under several noise conditions. To this end, we use different error measures showing that the IRA estimation model can be more accurate and robust than the other compared methods.	electroencephalography;iterative method	E.

38998109faeec30e896966b26d4a892247605a13	grey matter alterations associated with cannabis use: results of a vbm study in heavy cannabis users and healthy controls	cannabis use disorder;dependence;universiteitsbibliotheek;article letter to editor;mri;cannabis;vbm	Cannabis abuse is related to impairments in a broad range of cognitive functions. However, studies on cannabis abuse in relation to brain structure are sparse and results are inconsistent, probably due to differences in imaging methodology, severity of cannabis abuse, and use of other substances. The goal of the current MRI study was to investigate brain morphology related to current and lifetime severity of cannabis use and dependence in heavy cannabis users without intensive use of other illicit drugs. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess differences in regional grey and white matter volume between 33 heavy cannabis users and 42 matched controls. Within heavy cannabis users, grey and white matter volume was correlated with measures of cannabis use and dependence. Analyses were focused a priori on the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum, regions implicated in substance dependence and/or with high cannabinoid receptor-1 concentrations. Regional grey matter volume in the anterior cerebellum was larger in heavy cannabis users. Within the group of heavy cannabis users, grey matter volume in the amygdala and hippocampus correlated negatively with the amount of cannabis use or dependence. No associations were found between white matter volume and measures of cannabis use or dependence. These findings indicate that associations between heavy cannabis use and altered brain structure are complex. Differential patterns of structural changes for various cannabis use levels imply that alterations in brain structure are associated with specific characteristics of cannabis use and dependence.	amygdaloid structure;brain;cannabinoids;cannabis abuse;cerebellum;cerebral white matter structure;cingulate cortex;cognition disorders;galaxy morphological classification;gray matter;large;mental association;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;neostriatum;sparse matrix;substance abuse problem;voxel;bleomycin/methotrexate/vincristine protocol;cannabinoid receptor	Janna Cousijn;Reinout W.

Autonomic function in mice can be assessed by directly recording sympathetic nerve activity. However, murine sympathetic spikes are typically detected using a manually adjusted voltage threshold and no unsupervised detection methods have been developed for the mouse. Therefore, we tested the performance of several unsupervised spike detection algorithms on simulated murine renal sympathetic nerve recordings, including an automated amplitude discriminator and wavelet-based detection methods which used both the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and several wavelet threshold rules. The parameters of the wavelet methods were optimized by comparing basal sympathetic activity to postmortem recordings and recordings made during pharmacological suppression and enhancement of sympathetic activity. In general, SWT methods were found to outperform amplitude discriminators and DWT methods with similar wavelet coefficient thresholding algorithms when presented with simulations with varied mean spike rates and signal-to-noise ratios. A SWT method which estimates the noise level using a """"noise-only"""" wavelet scale and then selectively thresholds scales containing the physiologically important signal information was found to have the most robust spike detection.

The indexes are validated by using Movement Related Potentials (MRPs). The signal processing stage is implemented on Altera Cyclone V FPGA. In the paper, we show in vivo measurements by comparing responses before and after the drug (Levodopa) treatment. The system quantifies the effect of the Levodopa treatment detecting: (i) a 17% reduction in typical agonist-antagonist co-contractions time (ii) 23.6% decrease in the maximum co-contraction time (iii) 33% decrease in number of critical co-contraction.

Most published studies have utilized data analysis methods based on voxel-wise application of general linear models (GLM). On the other hand, temporal clustering analysis (TCA) focuses on the identification of relationships between cortical areas by measuring temporal common properties. In its most general form, TCA is sensitive to the low signal-to-noise ratio of BOLD and is dependent on subjective choices of filtering parameters. In this paper, we introduce a method for wavelet-based clustering of time-series data and show that it may be useful in data sets with low signal-to-noise ratios, allowing the automatic selection of the optimum number of clusters. We also provide examples of the technique applied to simulated and real fMRI datasets.	advanced telecommunications computing architecture;algorithm;certified emergency nurse;choice behavior;cluster analysis;discrete wavelet transform;general linear model;generalized linear model;magnetic resonance imaging;scientific publication;signal-to-noise ratio;time series;voxel;fmri;statistical cluster	João Ricardo Sato;André Fujita;Edson Amaro Júnior;Janaina Mourão Miranda;Pedro Alberto Morettin;Michael J.

More than 4% of the population over 40 years old suffer from tremor. There is no cure for most tremors, and while psychological therapy is sometimes helpful, tremors are usually treated with either medication or invasive surgery including thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation. Both medications and surgery may have adverse effects, and thus, there is a growing interest in developing non-invasive vibration attenuation devices. This paper presents a passive absorber device for attenuating pronation/supination tremor, dubbed Vib-bracelet. It is based on the principles of dynamic vibration absorption and is tuned to the frequency of the tremor. Prototypes were manufactured and tested on a mechanical model of the human forearm. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the device in attenuating vibrations in the range of 4–6 Hz, which is the range of frequency of observed tremor, with maximum amplitude attenuation of 85%.	absorber device component;antistatic device;computer simulation;deep brain stimulation;experiment;forearm;hertz (hz);muscle;neuropathy, hereditary motor and sensory, type vib;patients;thalamotomy;tremor;vibration - physical agent	Eran Buki;Reuven Katz;Miriam Zacksenhouse;Ilana Schlesinger	2017	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-017-1742-7	psychological therapy;computer vision;physical medicine and rehabilitation;dynamic vibration absorber;artificial intelligence;mathematics;forearm;deep brain stimulation;thalamotomy;population	AI	16.78785007249801	-83.14439999737529	59211

A number of applications, ranging from data collection to chronic patient surveillance, and even to the control of therapeutic procedures, are being implemented in many parts of the world. As part of this growing trend, this paper discusses the problems in electrocardiogram (ECG) real-time data acquisition, transmission and visualization over the Internet. ECG signals are transmitted in real time from a patient in a remote non-clinical environment to a specialist in a hospital or clinic using the current capabilities and availability of the Internet. A prototype system is described that is composed of (1) a portable data acquisition and pre-processing module connected to the computer at the remote site via its RS-232 port, (2) a Java-based client-server platform, and (3) software modules to handle communication protocols between the data acquisition module and the patient's personal computer, and to handle client-server communication. The purpose of the system is the provision of extended monitoring for patients under drug therapy after infarction, data collection in some particular cases, remote consultation and low-cost ECG monitoring for the elderly.	base;client–server model;data collection;data acquisition;electrocardiography;imagery;infarction;internet;java;patients;personal computer;preprocessor;protocols documentation;prototype;rs-232;real-time data;real-time transcription;school;server (computer);server (computing);ships;telemedicine;therapeutic community technique;disease transmission	Alfredo I.

e6258bccdf424b419deb135c63ea26fd325e35fc	morphometric basis of depression in parkinson's disease and the possibility of its prediction		One of the most common variants of mood disorders is depression. According to various authors, the incidence of depression in the population is 3- 10 %, in Parkinson's disease (PD) - 40-50 % of patients. Most researchers are considering depression in PD as endogenous and finds it to be an important and independent component of the disease manifestations. We examined 49 patients with PD complicated by depression. All patients underwent MRI followed by postprocessing using FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). When de- pression occurs it affects lingual area, parahippocampal areas on both sides and straight gyrus. Regression analysis showed a predominant involvement of the frontal and temporal brain lobes. Prognostically three most important areas in- volved in the formation of depression were revealed - right and left parahippo- campal area and the average occipital-temporal sulcus.

2e594663561fbbb34842cd373713bc36e66c0ac1	relation between carotid intima-media thickness and diastolic augmentation index in chinese population	ultrasonic variables measurement;atherosclerosis;blood pressure;indexes;statistics;artificial intelligence;sociology	Both atherosclerosis measured by carotid intimamedia thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness measured by diastolic augmentation index (DAI) are risk factors of cardiovascular disease. We studied the relationship between CIMT and DAI in Chinese population. 65 outpatients (26 males and 39 females) aged 24–78 years (51±19 years) recruited from carotid ultrasound examination room were taken into the study. We used a tonometric device (IIM-2010A to measure DAI, pules wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI), and a Sonosite Micromax ultrasound unit to measure CIMT. CIMT was negatively correlated with DAI (r=−0.636, P<0.01), and positively relevant with PWV and AI (r=0.396 and r=0.596, P<0.01 for both). DAI was negatively related to AI (r=−0.522 and P<0.001). Age, PWV and DAI were independent predictors of CIMT, while age, CIMT and central blood pressure were independent predictors of DAI. CIMT was age-dependent and significantly related to DAI besides other parameters for arterial stiffness including PWV and AI.	artificial intelligence;finite thickness;thickness (graph theory);velocity (software development)	Qingyuan Wu;Jun Ye;Jian Yang;Zuchang Ma;Yining Sun;Yongliang Zhang	2016	2016 9th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2016.7853002	database index;medicine;computer science;blood pressure;diabetes mellitus;surgery;statistics	AI	14.955052461460795	-84.07195808273003	59422
e1dfaf6e9e2eaa9a543d79727563975cb37c8f08	a novel encoding lempel-ziv complexity algorithm for quantifying the irregularity of physiological time series	lempel ziv complexity;physiological time series;encoding lz complexity;coarse graining process	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and its variants have been extensively used to analyze the irregularity of physiological time series. To date, these measures cannot explicitly discern between the irregularity and the chaotic characteristics of physiological time series. Our study compared the performance of an encoding LZ (ELZ) complexity algorithm, a novel variant of the LZ complexity algorithm, with those of the classic LZ (CLZ) and multistate LZ (MLZ) complexity algorithms.   METHODS AND RESULTS Simulation experiments on Gaussian noise, logistic chaotic, and periodic time series showed that only the ELZ algorithm monotonically declined with the reduction in irregularity in time series, whereas the CLZ and MLZ approaches yielded overlapped values for chaotic time series and time series mixed with Gaussian noise, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed ELZ algorithm in capturing the irregularity, rather than the complexity, of physiological time series. In addition, the effect of sequence length on the ELZ algorithm was more stable compared with those on CLZ and MLZ, especially when the sequence length was longer than 300. A sensitivity analysis for all three LZ algorithms revealed that both the MLZ and the ELZ algorithms could respond to the change in time sequences, whereas the CLZ approach could not. Cardiac interbeat (RR) interval time series from the MIT-BIH database were also evaluated, and the results showed that the ELZ algorithm could accurately measure the inherent irregularity of the RR interval time series, as indicated by lower LZ values yielded from a congestive heart failure group versus those yielded from a normal sinus rhythm group (p < 0.01).	algorithm;bounding interval hierarchy;experiment;heart failure;lz77 and lz78;lempel–ziv–stac;normal statistical distribution;rapid refresh;refsum disease;simulation;sinus - general anatomical term;time series;chlorozotocin;nikkomycin l(z);ziv-aflibercept	Yatao Zhang;Shoushui Wei;Lina Zhao;Chengyu Liu	2016	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.05.010	speech recognition;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm	ML	19.91490189243585	-85.14755277386632	59434
5b2801f530d7b27c414a20f52b29685d72a32ff4	evaluation of bone conduction vibration system using photoacoustic effect		This article proposes a novel bone conduction vibrator based on an interesting phenomenon where audible sound can be perceived when a vibration is produced using a laser beam that is synchronized to the sound and this vibration is transmitted to an auricular cartilage. To study this phenomenon, we measured the effect using a rubber sheet with similar properties to those of soft tissue, together with an acceleration sensor, and found that audible sound was produced in the sample. We also calculated the force level based on the mechanical impedance and the acceleration in the proposed system. It is expected that a force level equal to the reference equivalent threshold force level can be achieved at a light intensity below the safety limit for human skin exposure by choosing an irradiation wavelength at which a larger degree of optical absorption occurs. This novel application of the photoacoustic effect is promising for bone conduction hearing aids.	acoustic cryptanalysis;auricular cartilage structure;bone conduction;characteristic impedance;choose (action);greater;hearing aids;less than;myeloproliferative disorder, chronic, with eosinophilia;photoacoustic spectroscopy;quantitative impedance;vibration - physical agent;vibrator (electronic);vibrator, device;disease transmission;light intensity;soft tissue;wavelength	Naoki Wadamori	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512587	mechanical impedance;acceleration;beam (structure);acoustics;bone conduction;electronic engineering;laser;wavelength;photoacoustic effect;computer science;vibration	Visualization	24.42193986281414	-84.6999104425635	59486
f9aa3e288c0f565fe4b81f4ea908891fc460a0d3	segmentation of gait sequences in sensor-based movement analysis: a comparison of methods in parkinson’s disease	parkinson’s disease;accelerometer;gait analysis;gyroscope;inertial sensors;step segmentation;stride segmentation	Robust gait segmentation is the basis for mobile gait analysis. A range of methods have been applied and evaluated for gait segmentation of healthy and pathological gait bouts. However, a unified evaluation of gait segmentation methods in Parkinson's disease (PD) is missing. In this paper, we compare four prevalent gait segmentation methods in order to reveal their strengths and drawbacks in gait processing. We considered peak detection from event-based methods, two variations of dynamic time warping from template matching methods, and hierarchical hidden Markov models (hHMMs) from machine learning methods. To evaluate the methods, we included two supervised and instrumented gait tests that are widely used in the examination of Parkinsonian gait. In the first experiment, a sequence of strides from instructed straight walks was measured from 10 PD patients. In the second experiment, a more heterogeneous assessment paradigm was used from an additional 34 PD patients, including straight walks and turning strides as well as non-stride movements. The goal of the latter experiment was to evaluate the methods in challenging situations including turning strides and non-stride movements. Results showed no significant difference between the methods for the first scenario, in which all methods achieved an almost 100% accuracy in terms of F-score. Hence, we concluded that in the case of a predefined and homogeneous sequence of strides, all methods can be applied equally. However, in the second experiment the difference between methods became evident, with the hHMM obtaining a 96% F-score and significantly outperforming the other methods. The hHMM also proved promising in distinguishing between strides and non-stride movements, which is critical for clinical gait analysis. Our results indicate that both the instrumented test procedure and the required stride segmentation algorithm have to be selected adequately in order to support and complement classical clinical examination by sensor-based movement assessment.	algorithm;clinical use template;complement system proteins;dynamic time warping;f1 score;gait disorders, neurologic;gait analysis;genetic heterogeneity;hidden markov model;machine learning;markov chain;memory segmentation;movement;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;programming paradigm;segmentation fault;template matching;biologic segmentation;non-t, non-b adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Nooshin Haji Ghassemi;Julius Hannink;Christine F.

While the pathophysiology behind this co-contraction, sometimes called abnormal muscle synergy, is not clear, reducing the co-contraction could improve overall arm function. This pilot study describes the use of a myoelectric-computer interface (MCI) to retrain arm muscle activation and reduce co-contraction. We found that both healthy subjects and stroke survivors with hemiparesis learned to reduce co-contraction with MCI training. Three out of five stroke survivors experienced some improvement in arm function as well. These results suggest that MCIs could provide a novel, relatively inexpensive paradigm for stroke rehabilitation.	arm architecture;cerebrovascular accident;interface device component;muscle;myalgia;programming paradigm;stroke rehabilitation;survivors;synergy	Zachary A.

In current discrete clinical cognitive assessment methods used to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia, physicians see patients annually or biannually. They rely on patient’s history and clinical cognitive assessments to identify changes in memory or functional ability as indications of MCI/dementia in conjunction with exclusionary tests. They are limited in these discrete assessments by their accuracy and infrequent occurrence. The episodic assessment framework proposed will allow better ongoing information about the true well-being of the patient through assessment of memory and functional cognitive ability on a weekly or even daily basis between appointments. This paper identifies features of EEG/ERP measurements during Neuropsychological Behavioral Testing that could allow the future inclusion in the framework using now available consumer EEG devices. A pilot group of 32 participants (17 healthy, 15 MCI) was studied using a 1-back test, while their brain activity was measured using EEG. Features of the ERP thus generated were identified and measured. These ERP features and associated behavioral measurements from the 1-back test were analyzed to identify features both alone and in combination that allowed the correct classification of the participants using a repeated leave-one-out train and test method. A feature pair (1-back response time and CPz correlation) was identified that provides the best two-feature performance (1 false positive/1 false negative error) with a third feature (response required – Pz P1 to N1 latency) providing additional improvement. Given these results, it is possible that episodic ERP measurements may help with cognitive impairment diagnosis in the future.	cognition;cognitive tutor;erp;electroencephalography;machine learning;response time (technology)	Bruce Wallace;Frank Knoefel;Rafik A.

In this study, a new nonlinear analysis method is used to detect the degree of nonlinearity and stochastic nature of heart rate variability signals during two forms of meditation (Chi and Kundalini). The data obtained from an online and widely used public database (i.e., MIT/BIH physionet database), is used in this study. The method used is the delay vector variance (DVV) method, which is a unified method for detecting the presence of determinism and nonlinearity in a time series and is based upon the examination of local predictability of a signal. From the results it is clear that there is a significant change in the nonlinearity and stochastic nature of the signal before and during the meditation (p value > 0.01). During Chi meditation there is a increase in stochastic nature and decrease in nonlinear nature of the signal. There is a significant decrease in the degree of nonlinearity and stochastic nature during Kundalini meditation.	autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;bounding interval hierarchy;chi;database;developmental delay (disorder);guru meditation;heart rate variability;meditation therapy;nervous system structure;nonlinear system;p-value;poo-chi;sample variance;sensor;time series;nervous system disorder	L.

Since applying gesture recognition based on static image processing may easily fail when it comes to work with patients with neurological disorders, it is crucial to convert static masks into dynamic 3-dimensional geometrical model. The system being developed is meant to be used by patients with Parkinson Disease (PD). Three tests based on UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) are envisioned to be performed by a patient with the use of the system, i.e.: finger tapping (test No. 23), hand movements (test No. 24) and rapid alternating hand movements (test No. 25). In this concept presentation the movement interpolation curves based on various parameters are to be used as an input to the fuzzy logic classifier. In conclusion the aim of this research is presented and the approach advantages and disadvantages are shown and discussed.	gesture recognition	Katarzyna Kaszuba;Bozena Kostek	2012	Intelligent Decision Technologies	10.3233/IDT-2012-0133	fuzzy logic;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence	AI	10.687838224571735	-92.84167019978965	59759
8963244e7149b3b822ee9fbd051441afa976dadf	a new algorithm for fetal qrs detection in abdominal recordings		The acquisition and the analysis of electrophysiological signals are often followed by the detection of parameters of clinical importance. In the case of fetal electrocardiogram signal, the presence of QRS complex is the best indicator of the fetal heart rate, as it is directly correlated with the fetal cardiac activity. However, to detect this complex, it is necessary to separate the signal from the maternal ECG signal. In this paper, a new algorithm for the fetal QRS detection is presented. This algorithm is based on two methods: the blind source separation method and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The results obtained by the application of this algorithm to recordings of fetal electrocardiogram signals from the DaISy database show its good performance.	algorithm;blind signal separation;hilbert–huang transform;source separation	Bouabida Zohra;Hadj Slimane Zinne Eddine;Fethi Bereksi-Reguig	2014			electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;communication	ML	19.011096510782814	-88.75015138042534	59856

The focus of this study is to propose a methodology to define new (t,f) features by extending time-only and frequency-only features to the joint (t,f) domain for detecting changes in non-stationary signals. The (t,f) features are used as a representative subset characterizing the status of the observed non-stationary signal. Change in the signal is then reflected as a change in the (t,f) features. This (t,f) approach is applied to the problem of detecting abnormal brain activity in newborns (e.g. seizure) using measurements of the EEG for diagnosis and prognosis. In addition, a pre-processing stage for detecting artifacts in EEG signals for signal enhancement is studied and implemented separately. Overall results indicate that, in general, the (t,f) approach results in an improved performance in detecting artifacts and seizures in newborn EEG signals as compared to time-only or frequency-only features. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using a priori knowledge about the interferences. It performs a linear decomposition of the input signal spectrogram into non-negative components, which represent the PLI, BW and EMG spectrogram estimates. They all exhibit very different time-frequency patterns: PLI and BW are both sparse whereas EMG is noise-like. Initialization of the classical NMF algorithm with accurately designed PLI, BW and EMG structures and a carefully adjusted matrix decomposition rank increases the separation performance. The comparative study suggests that the proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art reference methods.	algorithm;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);electromyography;estimated;it baseline protection;interference (communication);iterative method;laser therapy, low-level;noise reduction;non-negative matrix factorization;pl/i;potassium channels, tandem pore domain;serpinf2 gene;serpinf2 wt allele;singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;spectrogram;unsupervised learning	Maciej Niegowski;Miroslav Zivanovic;Marisol Gómez;Pablo Lecumberri	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320071	electronic engineering;speech recognition;pattern recognition;mathematics	Vision	20.61530081219303	-89.503972583466	60386
739ba18fa565b09f563e8ac64ccaf1cc78878d1e	char-hmm: an improved continuous human activity recognition algorithm based on hidden markov model		With the rapid development of wearable sensor technology, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on sensor data has attracted more and more attentions. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with perfect performance in speech recognition has a good effect on HAR. However, almost all these techniques train multiple Hidden Markov Models for different classes of activity. For a given activity sequence with multiple activities, the activity corresponding to the HMM with the maximum generating probability is selected as the recognition result, which is not suitable for continuous HAR with multiple activities. For this problem, we propose an improved Hidden Markov activity recognition algorithm where discriminative model and generative model are utilized. The discriminative model SVM is used to produce the observation sequence of HMM, and the generative model HMM is used to generate the final result. Compared with the traditional Hidden Markov HAR model, our proposal has good performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 score.	activity recognition;algorithm;hidden markov model;markov chain	Chuangui Yang;Zhu Wang;Botao Wang;Shizhuo Deng;Guangxin Liu;Yuru Kang;Huichao Men	2017		10.1007/978-981-10-8890-2_19	discriminative model;support vector machine;algorithm;generative model;activity recognition;hidden markov model;computer science;f1 score	Vision	3.7114208391829133	-84.74155892867049	60455

Cognitive impairment is one of the determinants of poor functioning in patients suffering from an affective disorder. For example, memory impairment in bipolar patients brings about confusion in their daily life. Other cognitive domains include attention, executive function, and psychomotor speed.

The locomotor activities (level walking, stair climbing, and stair descending) were recorded by an inertial sensor placed on the shank (preferred leg), performed in a natural indoor-outdoor scenario by 10 healthy young adults (age 25-35 yrs.). From each segmented activity epoch, sixteen features were chosen in the frequency and time domain. Dimension reduction was then performed through 2D Sammon's mapping. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained to mimic Sammon's mapping on the whole dataset. In the Bayes' approach, the two features were then fed to a Bayes' classifier that incorporates an update rule, while, in the SVM scheme, the ANN was considered as the kernel function of the classifier. Bayes' approach performed slightly better than SVM on both the training set (91.4% versus 90.7%) and the testing set (84.2% versus 76.0%), favoring the proposed Bayes' scheme as more suitable than the proposed SVM in distinguishing among the different monitored activities.	artificial neural network;cellular automaton;climbing stairs;epoch (reference date);execution;extraction;sammon mapping;sensor;silo (dataset);sixteen;speed (motion);support vector machine;test set;young adult;accelerometers	Maurizio Schmid;Francesco Riganti Fulginei;Ivan Bernabucci;Antonino Laudani;Daniele Bibbo;Rossana Muscillo;Alessandro Salvini;Silvia Conforto	2013		10.1155/2013/343084	acceleration;movement;identification;support vector machine;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;energy homeostasis;system;bayes' theorem;artificial neural network	AI	9.536665167634377	-86.17046425706927	60586
18d05d5561456664cef8c071326f8f997546d2e2	a general practitioner or a specialist for your infected smartphone?		With explosive growth in the number of mobile devices, the mobile malware is rapidly spreading as well, and the number of encountered malware families is increasing. Existing solutions, which are mainly based on one malware detector running on the phone or in the cloud, are no longer effective. Main problem lies in the fact that it might be impossible to create a unique mobile malware detector that would be able to detect different malware families with high accuracy, being at the same time lightweight enough not to drain battery quickly and fast enough to give results of detection promptly. The proposed approach to mobile malware detection is analogous to general practitioner versus specialist approach to dealing with a medical problem. Similarly to a general practitioner that, based on indicative symptoms identifies potential illnesses and sends the patient to an appropriate specialist, our detection system distinguishes among symptoms representing different malware families and, once the symptoms are detected, it triggers specific analyses. A system monitoring application operates in the same way as a general practitioner. It is able to distinguish between different symptoms and trigger appropriate detection mechanisms. As an analogy to different specialists, an ensemble of detectors, each of which specifically trained for a particular malware family, is used. The main challenge of the approach is to define representative symptoms of different malware families and train detectors accordingly to them.

However, nonlinear relationship between neural activities and limb movements may challenge the linear decoders in real-time brain computer interface (BCI) applications. In this study, we propose a nonlinear neural decoder using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to infer lower limb joint angles from noninvasive scalp EEG signals during human treadmill walking. Our results demonstrate that lower limb joint angles during treadmill walking can be decoded from the fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials in the delta band (0.1-3Hz). Overall, the average decoding accuracy were 0.43 ± 0.18 for Pearson's r value and 1.82 ± 3.07 for signal to noise ratio (SNR), and robust to ocular, muscle, or movement artifacts. Moreover, the signal preprocessing scheme and the design of UKF allow the implementation of the proposed EEG-based BCI for real-time applications. This has implications for the development of closed-loop EEG-based BCI systems for gait rehabilitation after stroke.	brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;cerebrovascular accident;decoder device component;electroencephalography phase synchronization;interface device component;kalman filter;lower extremity;morphologic artifacts;muscle;neural decoding;nonlinear system;preprocessor;real-time clock;signal-to-noise ratio;treadmill, device;wiener filter;limb movement	Trieu Phat Luu;Yongtian He;Sho Nakagome;Jeffrey Gorges;Kevin Nathan;José Luis Contreras-Vidal	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591006	kalman filter;computer vision;simulation;electroencephalography;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;band-pass filter;communication;signal-to-noise ratio	Robotics	13.238574225150506	-84.30308486622404	60640

Signals are recorded from biceps brachii muscle of 50 normal adults during repetitive dynamic contractions. After prescribed preprocessing, each signal is divided into six segments out of which first and last segments are considered in this analysis. Multiscale RMS (MSRMS) and Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MSPE) are computed for each subject in the time scales ranging from 1 to 50. The median values of the MSRMS and MSPE are calculated for further analysis. The results show an increase in amplitude for sEMG signals under fatigue condition. MSRMS values are found to be significantly higher in fatigue. An approximately constant difference in MSRMS value between fatigue and non-fatigue condition is observed over the entire time scale with a negative slope. Further, the median of MSRMS values for each subject is able to distinguish fatigue and non-fatigue conditions. Similar analysis on MSPE showed significant difference between fatigue and non-fatigue cases and lower values of MSPE is observed in fatigue. It is also observed that the median value of MSRMS and MSPE are able to distinguish these conditions. t-test for MSRMS, MSPE and their median value show high statistical significance. It appears that this method of analysis can be used for clinical evaluation of muscles.	anthropometry;auditory recruitment;biceps brachii muscle structure;chronic fatigue syndrome;electromyography;mean squared prediction error;motor unit;multiscale modeling;nonlinear system;p-value;preprocessor;sema5b gene;tissue fiber;electrode;nerve supply;non-t, non-b childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia;t test	M.

Emerging knowledge about brain connectivity is leading to new insights into the pathophysiology of FOG and has suggested that electroencephalogram (EEG) may offer a novel technique for understanding and predicting FOG. In this study we have integrated spatial, spectral, and temporal features of the EEG signals utilizing wavelet coefficients as our input for the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. This approach allowed us to predict transition from walking to freezing with 87% sensitivity and 73% accuracy. This preliminary data affirms the functional breakdown between areas in the brain during FOG and suggests that EEG offers potential as a therapeutic strategy in advanced PD.	artificial neural network;coefficient;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);electroencephalography phase synchronization;freezing;heart failure;multilayer perceptron;nearest neighbour algorithm;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;wavelet	Ardi Handojoseno;James M.

Using a capsule system with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), the pressure data of human colon can be monitored accurately. Preprocessing of colonic pressure signal was performed primarily by applying threshold processing and wavelet de-noising. Then, wavelet with six-layer decomposition was implemented based on Daubechies 5 wavelet basis. Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was used for analyzing the frequency spectrum of detail signals. Particularly, six features include the peak frequency of detail signal at level 3, the peak frequency of detail signal at level 4, the Lyapunov index, correlation dimension, Kolmogorov entropy, and box dimension of were extracted for diagnosis purposes based on HHT spectrum and chaos. Moreover, the features space of 20 subjects was used to build the probabilistic neural network (PNN). As a consequence, the classification accuracy of the other 11 subjects based on PNN reached 81.8% in total.	application-specific integrated circuit;artificial neural network;chaos theory;colon classification;correlation dimension;experiment;hilbert–huang transform;kolmogorov complexity;lyapunov fractal;measure-preserving dynamical system;minkowski–bouligand dimension;preprocessor;probabilistic neural network;spectral density;wavelet	Chao Zhou;Fei Xu;Chunjie Qiao;Weihua Dai	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2016.7603379	wavelet;database index;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;discrete wavelet transform;statistics;wavelet transform	Robotics	18.21626913435183	-90.15663852265453	60744
71f7fcfe435ccbf0861d35a992bcde79816aea7d	meta-activity recognition: a wearable approach for logic cognition-based activity sensing		Activity sensing has become a key technology for many ubiquitous applications, such as exercise monitoring and elder care. Most traditional approaches track the human motions and perform activity recognition based on the waveform matching schemes in the raw data representation level. In regard to the complex activities with relatively large moving range, they usually fail to accurately recognize these activities, due to the inherent variations in human activities. In this paper, we propose a wearable approach for logic cognition-based activity sensing scheme in the logical representation level, by leveraging the meta-activity recognition. Our solution extracts the angle profiles from the raw inertial measurements, to depict the angle variation of limb movement in regard to the consistent body coordinate system. It further extracts the meta-activity profiles to depict the sequence of small-range activity units in the complex activity. By leveraging the least edit distance-based matching scheme, our solution is able to accurately perform the activity sensing. Based on the logic cognition-based activity sensing, our solution achieves lightweight-training recognition, which requires a small quantity of training samples to build the templates, and user-independent recognition, which requires no training from the specific user. The experiment results in real settings shows that our meta-activity recognition achieves an average accuracy of 92% for user-independent activity sensing.	activity recognition;cognition;data (computing);edit distance;mental representation;quorum sensing;waveform;wearable computer	Lei Xie;Xu Dong;Wei Wang;Dawei Huang	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057209	raw data;coordinate system;edit distance;activity recognition;wearable computer;computer vision;waveform;cognition;computer science;artificial intelligence	Vision	4.309159481102041	-85.56068145705508	60808

The research presented in this paper is aimed at assessing a blind data-based classification between 'spontaneous' and 'voluntary' human cough on individual sound samples. Cough sounds were registered in the free acoustic field on 3 pathological and 9 healthy non-smoking subjects, all aged between 20 and 30. Each sound is represented by the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Different transformations of the cough PSD-vector are chosen as input features to the classification algorithm. An experimental error rate comparison between different neural and fuzzy classification networks is performed. All evaluated algorithms used the Euclidean metric. This resulted in a correct class-discrimination between 'spontaneous' and 'voluntary' cough for 96% of the cough database.

66e916a326986a4d06fc821211d3ad27c194980f	an eye tracker based computer system to support oculomotor and attention deficit investigations		Eye tracking is a non-invasive procedure to acquire eye-gaze data. The accuracy offered by the new eye tracking technologies gives to physicians and scientists a great opportunity to employ eye trackers to perform quantitative assessment of eye movements for diagnostic and rehabilitation purposes. However, eye trackers do not support physicians in their analysis, as they typically lack specific software solutions tailored to the diseases under investigation. For instance, ophthalmologists need to use eye trackers in tests such as visually guided saccades or smooth pursuit eye movements, while neuropsychiatrists need them in psychological tests to measure attention deficit. The development of a software tool for a specific test cannot be done by physicians (even using the high-level programming frameworks bundled with eye tracker devices) and needs to be carried out by expert computer programmers. Thus, in this paper we propose a general computer system for eye tracker &#x2013; based investigation, which allows physicians to easily customize experiments in different scenarios without the need of expert computer programmers. To demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the proposed system, we show how it was employed to support the investigation of eye movements for patients affected by a) glycogen storage disease, b) idiopathic congenital nystagmus and c) neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorders.	emoticon;experiment;eye tracking;general computer corporation;graphical user interface;high- and low-level;high-level programming language;programmer;programming tool;tracking system	Daniela Giordano;Carmelo Pino;Isaak Kavasidis;Concetto Spampinato;Massimo Di Pietro;Renata Rizzo;Anna Scuderi;Rita Barone	2017	2017 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)	10.1109/CBMS.2017.175	artificial intelligence;computer vision;data visualization;autism;computer science;software;bittorrent tracker;eye movement;eye tracking;psychological testing;smooth pursuit	Visualization	3.6442205656685736	-80.50200995215495	60992

When fully developed, this system should prove very useful for mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of functional brain activity of humans.	electroencephalography;experiment;prototype;real-time clock;real-time transcription;resonance	Clinton S.

In this paper, we present an automatic method for removal of muscle artifacts from ECG signals, based on four steps: decomposing ECG signal using sparse signal decomposition on mixed dictionaries; obtaining QRS complex signal; determining time-instants of R-peak; and removal of muscle artifacts from ECG signal. The noise reduction performance of the proposed method is tested and validated using ECG signals taken from a standard MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The reconstructed signals are assessed using both subjective quality assessment test and objective quality assessment metrics. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms other existing ECG denoising methods inadequately removing the muscle artifacts without significantly distorting the morphologies of P-wave, QRS-complex and T-wave of the ECG signals.	artifact (error);bounding interval hierarchy;dictionary;distortion;noise reduction;performance evaluation;sparse matrix	Udit Satija;Barathram Ramkumar;M.

A unified general framework is given for the application of sparse machine learning methods to multivariate signal processing. In particular, methods that enforce sparsity will be employed for reasons of computational efficiency, regularisation, and compressibility. The methods presented can be seen as modular building blocks that can be applied to a variety of applications. Application specific prior knowledge can be used in various ways, resulting in a flexible and powerful set of tools. The motivation for the methods is to be able to learn and generalise from a set of multivariate signals. In addition to testing on benchmark datasets, a series of empirical evaluations on real world datasets were carried out. These included: the classification of musical genre from polyphonic audio files; a study of how the sampling rate in a digital radar can be reduced through the use of Compressed Sensing (CS); analysis of human perception of different modulations of musical key from Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings; classification of genre of musical pieces to which a listener is attending from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain recordings. These applications demonstrate the efficacy of the framework and highlight interesting directions of future research.	benchmark (computing);compressed sensing;digital signal processing;electroencephalography;machine learning;magnetoencephalography;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	Thomas Robert Diethe	2010			speech recognition;computer science;data science;data mining	ML	22.39616781063821	-88.38080021184904	61289

It was built a completely mechanically and non-invasive system, designed as Vertebral Metrics, which is able to identify the position x, y and z of each spine apophysis, from the first cervical vertebra to the first sacral vertebra in standing position. The measuring part is the “body” of the instrument, and the “support”. This devise was applied in a pregnant woman in four moments of the pregnancy: 12; 20, 32 and 37 weeks. In the second moment of the evaluation of the spine the curvatures decrease when compared with the other moments of the evaluation, where an increase of these curvatures, related to rachialgie, is evident.	apophysis;incidence matrix	Cláudia Quaresma;Mário Forjaz Secca;João Goyri O'Neill;Jorge Branco	2010			computer science	Robotics	14.531112569860788	-84.05649914255758	61414

When a light stimulus is presented to a subject, the pupil response is not instantaneous because of the action of the sphincter muscle. A sequence of images will be caught by a pupillometer and each image of the sequence will be binarized; for each segmented image, a useful parameter will be considered, the major diameter that is the length (in pixels) of the major axis of the ellipse that has the same second moments of the pupil. The aim is the identification of the response time after a light stimulus, from the sequence of the major diameters. The considered signal is degraded because of the presence of the measurement noise, the natural fluctuation of the pupil (usually called ''pupil noise''), and the general health state of the subject. To enhance the significant part of this noisy signal a neural network is suitable trained. From the clean signal the identification of the response time of the pupil will be easier and a simple method will be proposed.	artificial neural network;image processing	Daniela Iacoviello	2007	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2006.05.022	computer vision;latency;machine learning;pupil function;optics;artificial neural network	ML	17.844941025604097	-86.84548823581207	61441

They are usually extracted by means of algebraic factorization algorithms able to capture the greatest communality of a set of electromyographic (EMG) signals. Usually EMG signals are pooled across different sub-movements (e.g., going forward and backward during reaching) in order to increase the complexity of the data set and, consequently, capture the maximum communality. Despite of these, this preliminary study was designed to investigate how the communality of EMG signals can be explained looking at narrow subset of recorded signals. Results corroborate the hypothesis that using a suitable subset of the whole dataset can significantly modify the values of weight coefficients. In this regard, further methodological investigations of algorithms adopted for synergy extraction are still required.	coefficient;electromyography;entity name part qualifier - adopted;extraction;movement;muscle;pooled sample;silo (dataset);subgroup;synergy;algorithm;biologic segmentation	Peppino Tropea;Vito Monaco;Silvestro Micera	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346751	simulation;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;machine learning;communication	DB	14.957352291798268	-91.68194082827871	61452

A total of 34 slope series were studied, 2 for each analysed lead: slopes between the peak of Q and R waves, and between the peak of R and S waves. Information of QRS slopes series was combined in order to increase the robustness of estimation. Evaluation is performed over a database containing ECG and respiratory signals simultaneously recorded in 17 subjects spontaneously breathing during a tilt table test. Respiratory rate estimation is performed with information of 4 different combinations of QRS slope series. The best results in respiratory rate estimation error terms are 0.72±4.34%(0.46±7.59 mHz). These results outperform those obtained with other known methods, motivating the use of QRS slopes to obtain reliable respiratory rate estimates.	database;electrocardiography;estimated;respiratory rate;tilt-table test;vectorcardiogram;slope	Jesús Lázaro;Alejandro Alcaine;Eduardo Gil;Pablo Laguna;Raquel Bailón	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610400	electronic engineering;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;engineering;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Visualization	17.520952494880206	-86.16268936522079	61716

Once acquired these electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been analyzed and the results has allowed to identify the responses generated by an individual during a test with high levels of stress.	neural oscillation	Christian Ubilluz;Ramiro Delgado;Diego Marcillo;Tatiana Noboa	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77712-2_81	brain–computer interface;brainwaves;human–computer interaction;electroencephalography;gesture;computer science	NLP	9.277810670330187	-91.90611034191707	61774
e2c26707b6f4e1e0931cc57ff22b68585618cb5d	a complete psychophysiological profile of a paralympic athlete in a ultraendurance: a case study		Psychophysiological response of athletes with spinal cord injurie has not been reported yet in scientific literature. The aim of this study is to analyze the specific psychophysiological response in a Paralympic athlete during competitive activities. We collected the following psychophysiological measurements: anxiety-trait, anxiety-state, locus of control, perceived psychological stress, stress-copying style, rate of perceived exertion, perceived muscle pain, body temperature, forced vital capacity, blood oxygen saturation, blood glucose and lactate concentrations, isometric hand strength, cortical arousal, heart rate variability, heart rate and velocities of a female Paralympic spinal cord injured athlete in a 11 hours and 44 minutes mountain ultraendurance event. An increase in sympathetic autonomous nervous system, heart rate, lactate, muscular pain and rated of perceived exertion and a decrease in cortical arousal and hand strength and inspiratory muscle fatigue. These results are consistent with the expected response during a highly stressful situation and consistent with previous findings in athletes without spinal cord injurie.	autonomous robot;heart rate variability;isometric projection;locus;scientific literature	Pedro Belinchon-deMiguel;Pablo Ruisoto;Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez	2018		10.1145/3284179.3284259		HCI	16.93200269692325	-80.67374760444017	61822
f9a983aa75cefd67c04f3f0f23ad72553a779ed0	using a system identification approach to investigate subtask control during human locomotion	phase dependent impulse response functions;sensorimotor control;human locomotion;harmonic transfer functions;subtask control	Here we apply a control theoretic view of movement to the behavior of human locomotion with the goal of using perturbations to learn about subtask control. Controlling one's speed and maintaining upright posture are two critical subtasks, or underlying functions, of human locomotion. How the nervous system simultaneously controls these two subtasks was investigated in this study. Continuous visual and mechanical perturbations were applied concurrently to subjects (n = 20) as probes to investigate these two subtasks during treadmill walking. Novel application of harmonic transfer function (HTF) analysis to human motor behavior was used, and these HTFs were converted to the time-domain based representation of phase-dependent impulse response functions (ϕIRFs). These ϕIRFs were used to identify the mapping from perturbation inputs to kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) outputs throughout the phases of the gait cycle. Mechanical perturbations caused an initial, passive change in trunk orientation and, at some phases of stimulus presentation, a corrective trunk EMG and orientation response. Visual perturbations elicited a trunk EMG response prior to a trunk orientation response, which was subsequently followed by an anterior-posterior displacement response. This finding supports the notion that there is a temporal hierarchy of functional subtasks during locomotion in which the control of upper-body posture precedes other subtasks. Moreover, the novel analysis we apply has the potential to probe a broad range of rhythmic behaviors to better understand their neural control.	behavior;body dysmorphic disorders;body position;cns disorder;displacement mapping;electromyography;entity handling - upright;poor posture;psychologic displacement;system identification;theory;transfer function;treadmill, device	David Logan;Tim Kiemel;John J.

Making sure that the patient is breathing well while pedaling is of primary concern for the remote clinician. One key requirement for in-home telerehabilitation is to make the system as simple as possible for the patients, avoiding, for instance, to have them wear sensors and devices. This paper presents a contact-free respiration rate monitoring system measuring temperature variations between inspired and expired air in the mouth-nose region using thermal imaging. The thermal camera is installed on a pan-tilt unit and coupled to a tracking algorithm, allowing the system to keep track of the mouth-nose region as the patient exercises. Results demonstrate that the system works in real time even when the patient moves or rotates its head while exercising. Recommendations are also made to minimize limitations of the system, such as the presence of people in the background or when the patient is talking, for its eventual use in in-home telerehabilitation sessions.	algorithm;recommender system;sensor;stationary process	Ronan Chauvin;Mathieu Hamel;Simon Brière;François Ferland;François Grondin;Dominic Létourneau;Michel Tousignant;François Michaud	2016	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2014.2336372	embedded system;detector;simulation;temperature measurement;engineering;tracking	Mobile	9.06120843785735	-87.30048177284496	61907

A WBAN consists of small, intelligent medical sensors which collect physiological parameters such as electrocardiogram, electroencephalography, and blood pressure. The recorded physiological signals are sent to a coordinator via wireless technologies, and are then transmitted to a healthcare monitoring center. One of the most widely used wireless technologies in WBANs is ZigBee because it is targeted at applications that require a low data rate and long battery life. However, ZigBee-based WBANs face severe interference problems in the presence of WiFi networks. This problem is caused by the fact that most ZigBee channels overlap with WiFi channels, severely affecting the ability of healthcare monitoring systems to guarantee reliable delivery of physiological signals. To solve this problem, we have developed an algorithm that controls the load in WiFi networks to guarantee the delay requirement for physiological signals, especially for emergency messages, in environments with coexistence of ZigBee-based WBAN and WiFi. Since WiFi applications generate traffic with different delay requirements, we focus only on WiFi traffic that does not have stringent timing requirements. In this paper, therefore, we propose an adaptive load control algorithm for ZigBee-based WBAN/WiFi coexistence environments, with the aim of guaranteeing that the delay experienced by ZigBee sensors does not exceed a maximally tolerable period of time. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm guarantees the delay performance of ZigBee-based WBANs by mitigating the effects of WiFi interference in various scenarios.	algorithm;capsule endoscopy;coexist (image);data rate units;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;interference (communication);lewy body disease;load management;medicine, east asian traditional;mobile health;occupational health services;personalization;reliable messaging;requirement;simulation;wireless technology;disease transmission;message;sensor (device)	Yena Kim;SeungSeob Lee;Sukyoung Lee	2016	IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/JBHI.2014.2387867	embedded system;neurfon;telecommunications;sensor;interference;computer network	Mobile	6.623034037650462	-88.34032815844135	61912
c1cfe91fdb407e4236ff4eecf75bb830f02f998a	a practical computer based vision system for posture and movement sensing in occupational medicine		Back pain and upper extremities injuries due to overexertion account for over twenty percent of leave days from work in the US. This explains why a vast amount of initiatives have been, to this date, carried out aiming at reducing the occurrence of such type of injuries. However, although such type of lesions are among the most studied in occupational medicine, no automatic detection and prevention technologies are pervasively available, to this date, at workplaces. Such deficiency is ascribable to the absence of any flexible and cost-effective tectaphnology that may play such role. This work aims at filling such gap: the contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a movement-posture computer-vision based system that, performing as a sensor, can detect overexertion movements, helping avoid the most common injuries that these cause. Such tasks are carried out with the use of a simple webcam, thus not requiring any expensive or specialized (e.g., Microsoft Kinect) hardware device. The proposed technology is, hence, easily affordable by any type of company and production plant throughout the world and easy adaptable to recognize and detect a wide set of movements and postures. The validity of such approach is demonstrated in realistic settings through a wide set of experiments.	angular defect;computer vision;emoticon;experiment;kinect;mind;poor posture;real-time clock;webcam	Gustavo Marfia;Marco Roccetti	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-3469-0	computer vision;simulation;computer security	HCI	8.85846747807204	-84.67023852101491	62165
fb7e4147ffe3f6ae5d4d8dfa3e8af9a167a8234f	dry-contact electrode ear-eeg		Objective: Ear-EEG is a recording method in which EEG signals are acquired from electrodes placed on an earpiece inserted into the ear. Thereby, ear-EEG provides a noninvasive and discreet way of recording EEG, and has the potential to be used for long-term brain monitoring in real-life environments. Whereas previously reported ear-EEG recordings have been performed with wet electrodes, the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate dry-contact electrode ear-EEG. Methods: To achieve a well-functioning dry-contact interface, a new ear-EEG platform was developed. The platform comprised actively shielded and nanostructured electrodes embedded in an individualized soft-earpiece. The platform was evaluated in a study of 12 subjects and four EEG paradigms: auditory steady-state response, steady-state visual evoked potential, mismatch negativity, and alpha-band modulation. Results: Recordings from the prototyped dry-contact ear-EEG platform were compared to conventional scalp EEG recordings. When all electrodes were referenced to a common scalp electrode (Cz), the performance was on par with scalp EEG measured close to the ear. With both the measuring electrode and the reference electrode located within the ear, statistically significant (p < 0.05) responses were measured for all paradigms, although for mismatch negativity, it was necessary to use a reference located in the opposite ear, to obtain a statistically significant response. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that dry-contact electrode ear-EEG is a feasible technology for EEG recording. Significance: The prototyped dry-contact ear-EEG platform represents an important technological advancement of the method in terms of user-friendliness, because it eliminates the need for gel in the electrode-skin interface.

In this approach, probability density functions of unlearned classes are incorporated in a hiddenMarkov model to classify undefined classes via model parameter estimation using given learning samples. The technique can be applied to various pattern recognition problems such as motion classification with electromyogram (EMG) signals and in support for disease diagnosis. In the experiments conducted, motion classification from EMG signals was implemented with three subjects for eight learned/unlearned forearm motions. The proposed method produced higher levels of classification performance (learned motions: 90.13%; unlearned motions: 91.25%) than previous approaches. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the technique.	anomaly detection;electromyography;estimation theory;experiment;forearm;hidden markov model;markov chain;motion;pattern recognition;population parameter;time series;type class;undefined behavior;user interface	Takayuki Mukaeda;Keisuke Shima	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036975	probability density function;anomaly detection;computer science;hidden markov model;estimation theory;a priori and a posteriori;speech recognition;pattern discrimination;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	Vision	16.80633220382226	-94.97066927959	62314
bb43dca5c4db245089f162d61e5568b2f1d675bd	adult age differences in subcortical myelin content are consistent with protracted myelination and unrelated to diffusion tensor imaging indices	brain;white matter;aging;multi exponential t 2 relaxation;fractional anisotropy;multi exponential t relaxation	Post mortem studies suggest protracted myelination of subcortical white matter into the middle age followed by gradual decline in the late adulthood. To date, however, establishing the proposed inverted-U pattern of age-myelin association proved difficult, as the most common method of investigating white matter, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), usually reveals only linear associations between DTI indices and age among healthy adults. Here we use a novel method of estimating Myelin Water Fraction (MWF) based on modeling the short spin-spin (T2) relaxation component from multi-echo T2 relaxation imaging data and assess subcortical myelin content within six white matter tracts in a sample of healthy adults (N=61, age 18-84 years). Myelin content evidenced a quadratic relationship with age, in accord with the pattern observed postmortem studies. In contrast, DTI-derived indices that are frequently cited as proxies for myelination, fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD), exhibited linear or null relationships with age. Furthermore, the magnitude of age differences in MWF varied across the white matter tracts. Myelin content estimated by MWF was unrelated to FA and correlated with RD only in the splenium. These findings are consistent with the notion that myelination continues throughout the young adulthood into the middle age. The results demonstrate that single-tensor DTI cannot serve as a source of specific proxies for myelination of white matter tracts.	autopsy;diffusion tensor imaging;estimated;fractional anisotropy;linear programming relaxation;mental association;middle aged;myelin;null value;numerous;proxy;radial (radio);radial basis function;ruby document format;sudarsky's gas giant classification;white matter;metal working fluid;myelination	Muzamil Arshad;Jeffrey A.

We significantly extend an existing technique for automatic cross-modal synchronization and evaluate its performance in a realistic experimental setting. Distinctive gestures, captured by a camera, are matched with recorded acceleration signal(s) using cross-correlation based time-delay estimation. PCA-based data pre-processing makes the procedure robust against orientation mismatches between the marking gesture and the camera plane. We evaluated five different marker gestures and report very promising results for actual use.	cross-correlation;data pre-processing;elan;ground truth;item unique identification;microphone;modal logic;open-source software;preprocessor;rattle gui;synchronization (computer science);wearable computer;wearable technology	Thomas Plötz;Chen Chen;Nils Y.

While most attempts at developing flow and differential pressure estimate models have involved purely empirical techniques, dimensional analysis utilizes theoretical principles of fluid mechanics that provides valuable insights into parameter relationships. Based on data obtained from a steady flow mock loop under a wide range of pump operating points and fluid viscosities, flow and differential pressure estimate models were thus obtained using dimensional analysis. The algorithm was then validated using data from two other VentrAssist IRBPs. Linear correlations between estimated and measured pump flow over a flow range of 0.5 to 8.0 L/min resulted in a slope of 0.98 (R 2 = 0.9848). The average flow error was 0.20 plusmn 0.14 L/min (mean plusmn standard deviation) and the average percentage error was 5.79%. Similarly, linear correlations between estimated and measured pump differential pressure resulted in a slope of 1.027 (R 2 = 0.997) over a pressure range of 60 to 180 mmHg. The average differential pressure error was 1.84 plusmn 1.54 mmHg and the average percentage error was 1.51%.	approximation error;blood substitute;implants;maxima and minima;mechanics;mock object;population parameter;rotary woofer;standard deviation;viscosity;algorithm;pump (device);torr	Emily Lim;Dean M.

Passive RFID tags and readers are used as the basic sensor modality to distinguish people and objects. An intelligent multiagent system with a distributed topology enables local decision making without the need for a centralized server or database. Rather than use predefined decision rules, we employ agents that extract behavior pattern of the residents from sensor data, use these patterns to identify abnormal events, and trigger actions to assist the residents. Because the system is implemented on a resource constrained platform, a light weight clustering algorithm is utilized to generate data models of the residents' daily activities. Finally, a set of local Markov chains enables future locations of the residents to be predicted.	agent-based model;algorithm;centralized computing;cluster analysis;data mining;data model;database;intelligent agent;markov chain;modality (human–computer interaction);multi-agent system;pattern recognition;radio-frequency identification;server (computing)	Chi Zhang;William A.

In exploration without movement constraints, participants repeat such indentation movements. We investigated how people modulate executed peak forces for different indentations depending on stimulus softness. Participants performed a 2AFC discrimination task for stimulus pairs from one of 4 softness categories. We assumed that movement control at different exploration moments is based on variations in the predictive and sensory signals available. We manipulated availability of predictive signals on softness category, by presenting either stimuli of the same category in a blocked fashion (high predictability) or by randomly mixing stimuli from different categories (low predictability). Effects of sensory signals were examined by contrasting first and last indentation, as sensory signals are hardly available when initiating exploration but gathered during exploration. The results show that participants systematically apply lower forces when sensory or predictive signals indicate softer objects as compared to harder objects. We conclude that softness exploration can be considered as a sensorimotor control loop, in which predictive and sensory signals determine movement control. Further, the results indicate a high importance of predictive processes throughout the entire exploration, as effects of predictive signals maintain in the last indentation.	control system;randomness;smart objects	Alexandra Lezkan;Knut Drewing	2015	2015 IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)	10.1109/WHC.2015.7177693	computer vision;simulation;computer science;systematics;force;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	13.767913656907577	-80.43125838749633	62893

The origin of the stimulus may be the result of direct and voluntary muscle contraction or in response to a triggered reflex activity. Using trans-perineal 2D ultrasound imaging we examined the characteristics of deformation and displacement of these organs in response to voluntary activity, contraction, straining, and fast reflex responses to stimuli such as coughing. The relative time sequence in movement was examined by serially segmenting the outline of these structures and mapping their temporal characteristics.		Christos E.

Those findings motivate our own work to develop """"smart toys,"""" objects embedded with wireless sensors that are safe and enjoyable for very small children, that allow detailed interaction data to be easily recorded. These sensor-enabled toys provide opportunities for autism research by reducing the effort required to collect and analyze a child’s interactions with objects. In the future, such toys may be a useful part of clinical and in-home assessment tools. In this paper, we discuss the design of a collection of smart toys that can be used to automatically characterize the way in which a child is playing. We use statistical models to provide objective, quantitative measures of object play interactions. We also developed a tool to view rich forms of annotated play data for later analysis. We report the results of recognition experiments on more than fifty play sessions conducted with adults and children as well as discuss the opportunities for using this approach to support video annotation and other applications."""	activity recognition;algorithm;domain-driven design;embedded system;experiment;interaction;modality (human–computer interaction);sensor;statistical model;support vector machine;toys	Tracy L.

Theses devices store records that may contain useful information in a criminal investigation, investigators could acquire from a range of smart health care devices to debate the users last movements. However, it is difficult to obtain this data, as there are currently no tools or methods. In this work we present a novel acquisition method, using BLE to collect records stored on smart Blood Pressure Monitors (BPM). We did further experiments to test the robustness and reliability of this method on two other BPMs. We identified a realistic use case on how this method can be useful in practice.	bluetooth;experiment;mobile device;trusted timestamping	Tina Wu;Andrew Martin	2018	2018 17th IEEE International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications/ 12th IEEE International Conference On Big Data Science And Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE)	10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00173	embedded system;blood pressure monitors;computer network;bluetooth low energy;robustness (computer science);health care;criminal investigation;memory acquisition;mobile device;computer science	Robotics	6.771590207420757	-88.9062017046728	63045

In the field of human-assistive robotics, these methods provide valuable information to provide effectively support to the user. However, their usability is strongly limited by the necessity of complex user-dependent and session-dependent calibration procedures, which confine their use to the laboratory environment. Nonetheless, an accurate estimate of muscle torque could be unnecessary to provide effective movement assistance to users. The natural ability of human central nervous system of adapting to external disturbances could compensate for a lower accuracy of the torque provided by the robot and maintain the movement accuracy unaltered, while the effort is reduced. In order to explore this possibility, in this paper we study the reaction of ten healthy subjects to the assistance provided through a proportional EMG control applied by an elbow powered exoskeleton. This system gives only a rough estimate of the user muscular torque but does not require any specific calibration. Experimental results clearly show that subjects adapt almost instantaneously to the assistance provided by the robot and can reduce their effort while keeping full control of the movement under different dynamic conditions (i.e., no alterations of movement accuracy are observed).	acclimatization;cns disorder;calibration;controllers;departure - action;electromyography;estimated;feedback;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;movement disorders;muscle;myalgia;power (psychology);powered exoskeleton;robot;robotics;torque;usability	Tommaso Lenzi;Stefano Marco Maria De Rossi;Nicola Vitiello;Maria Chiara Carrozza	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2198821	robot;control engineering;simulation;exoskeleton;computer science;engineering;physical therapy;biological pest control;torque;physics	Robotics	13.236165373084532	-82.67228937868168	63145

The model imposed a parametric relationship among lower limb joint motions (hips and knees) using the least number of parameters. An integration of different analysis tools such as harmonic analysis, principal component analysis, and artificial neural networks helped overcome high-dimensionality, temporal dependence, and nonlinear relationships of the gait patterns. The trained model was fed only two control parameters (cadence and stride length) for each gait cycle and predicted the corresponding gait waveforms. Based on the differences between predicted and actual gait waveforms, a coordination score, which ranged from 0 to 10, was defined at various walking speeds. The model was applied to eight patients with knee arthroplasty at different follow-ups as well as to eight healthy subjects, walking at three different speeds. The results showed that knee replacement and rehabilitation programs improved the coordination score. The technique provides an analytical tool that can be used as a routine test in the clinical evaluation of human gait abnormalities.	artificial neural network;congenital abnormality;gait disorders, neurologic;gait analysis;hip structure;knee replacement arthroplasty (procedure);lower extremity;malignant fibrous histiocytoma;nonlinear system;patients;principal component analysis;somnambulism;speed (motion);walking speed	Hooman Dejnabadi;Brigitte M.

This letter presents a general method for environment-driven variation of the length of the spatiotemporal window based on searching for the most significant localization hypothesis, to use as much context as is appropriate but not more. We evaluate this approach on benchmark datasets using visual and Wi-Fi sensor modalities and a variety of sensory comparison front-ends under in-order and out-of-order traversals of the environment. Our results show that the system greatly reduces the maximum distance traveled without localization compared to a fixed-length approach while achieving competitive localization accuracy, and our proposed method achieves this performance without deployment-time tuning.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);software deployment;window function	Jake Bruce;Adam Jacobson;Michael Milford	2017	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2017.2724146	simulation;software deployment;out-of-order execution;engineering;computer vision;sensory system;artificial intelligence	Robotics	-0.0011708282911967473	-82.039703540948	63330

One of important issues among the rehabilitation systems is how to continuously evaluate patient's performances from such systems. Without a proper measurement for patient's performance, therapists suffer from accurate decision making in patient treatments. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to develop a rehabilitation system that can minimize therapist supervision. To this end, we develop augmented reality-based rehabilitation system that can automatically capture patients' performance as well as visually monitor patients' progress. We also propose performance measurements of patients to improve decision making abilities of therapists. By analyzing performance data, we discover useful rules for further enhancement of the patients' treatment plan.	augmented reality;performance	Atif Alamri;Heung-Nam Kim;Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik	2010	2010 International Conference on Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, AIS 2010	10.1109/AIS.2010.5547014	games;augmented reality;decision model;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;remote patient monitoring;mathematical model;virtual reality	Robotics	3.6317721786025503	-80.23989524319379	63381

If we understand the relationship between these behavioral variables and haptic information gain (transfer entropy) during manual probing, we can improve the efficacy of soft robotic probes for soft tissue palpation, such as in tumor localization in minimally invasive surgery. Here, we recorded the muscle co-contraction activity of the finger using EMG sensors to address the question as to whether joint stiffness control during manual palpation plays an important role in the haptic information gain. To address this question, we used a soft robotic probe with a controllable stiffness joint and a force sensor mounted at the base to represent the function of the tendon in a biological finger. Then, we trained a Markov chain using muscle co-contraction patterns of human subjects, and used it to control the stiffness of the soft robotic probe in the same soft tissue palpation task. The soft robotic experiments showed that haptic information gain about the depth of the hard nodule can be maximized by varying the internal stiffness of the soft probe.	electromyography;experiment;haptic device component;haptic technology;information gain in decision trees;joint stiffness;kullback–leibler divergence;markov chain;minimally invasive surgical procedures;muscle;neoplasms;palpation;robot;robotic spacecraft;temporomandibular joint disorders;tendon structure;transfer entropy;detection of temperature stimulus involved in sensory perception of pain;sensor (device);soft tissue	Nantachai Sornkarn;Thrishantha Nanayakkara	2017	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2016.2615924	control engineering;computer vision;computer science;engineering	Robotics	13.824615925372814	-81.25950505012271	63615

Synthetic ECG signals corrupted with white Gaussian noise are employed and time series of various lengths are processed with EMD in order to extract the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A statistical significance test is implemented for the identification of IMFs with high-level noise components and their exclusion from denoising procedures. Simulation campaign results reveal that a decrease of processing time is accomplished with the introduction of preprocessing stage, prior to the application of EMD in biomedical time series. Furthermore, the variation in the number of IMFs according to the type of the preprocessing stage is studied as a function of SNR and time-series length. The application of the methodology in MIT-BIH ECG records is also presented in order to verify the findings in real ECG signals.	bounding interval hierarchy;electrocardiography;electromechanical dissociation;exclusion;high- and low-level;hilbert–huang transform;noise reduction;normal statistical distribution;p-value;preprocessor;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;stage is;time series	Alexandros Karagiannis;Philip Constantinou	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2010.2091648	speech recognition;data processing;computer science;time series;mathematics;statistics	ML	19.213757590991538	-88.6177769867275	63834
6a25f98d1c5df1217cd319d295b7ae150b6d35d6	estimation of lactate threshold with machine learning techniques in recreational runners		Lactate threshold is considered an essential parameter when assessing performance of elite and recreational runners and prescribing training intensities in endurance sports. However, the measurement of blood lactate concentration requires expensive equipment and the extraction of blood samples, which are inconvenient for frequent monitoring. Furthermore, most recreational runners do not have access to routine assessment of their physical fitness by the aforementioned equipment so they are not able to calculate the lactate threshold without resorting to an expensive and specialized center. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to create an intelligent system capable of estimating the lactate threshold of recreational athletes participating in endurance running sports. The solution here proposed is based on a machine learning system which models the lactate evolution using recurrent neural networks and includes the proposal of standardization of the temporal axis as well as a modification of the stratified sampling method. The results show that the proposed system accurately estimates the lactate threshold of 89.52% of the athletes and its correlation with the experimentally measured lactate threshold is very high (R=0,89). Moreover, its behaviour with the test dataset is as good as with the training set, meaning that the generalization power of the model is high. Therefore, in this study a machine learning based system is proposed as alternative to the traditional invasive lactate threshold measurement tests for recreational runners.

In this paper, we propose a cascade architecture to combine different seizure detection algorithms to optimize power and accuracy of the overall seizure detection system. The proposed architecture consists of a cascade of two seizure detection stages. In the first-stage detector, a lightweight (low-power) algorithm is used to detect seizure candidates with the understanding that there will be a high number of false positives. In the second-stage detector-and only for the seizure candidates detected in the first detector-a high-accuracy algorithm is used to eliminate the false positives. We show that the proposed cascade architecture can reduce power consumption of seizure detection by 80% with high accuracy, offering a suitable option for real-time implantable seizure detectors.	cascade device component;detectors;eighty;hyperpigmentation, familial progressive, 1;implants;low-power broadcasting;medical devices;real-time clock;real-time transcription;seizures;algorithm	Taehoon Kim;Nabi Sertac Artan;Ivan W.

Experiments are carried out on the largest footstep database collected to date, with almost 20,000 valid footstep signals and more than 120 people. Results show very similar performance for both spatial and temporal approaches (5 to 15 percent EER depending on the experimental setup), and a significant improvement is achieved for their fusion (2.5 to 10 percent EER). The assessment protocol is focused on the influence of the quantity of data used in the reference models, which serves to simulate conditions of different potential applications such as smart homes or security access scenarios.	agent-based model;biometrics;concatenation;contain (action);eighty;enhanced entity–relationship model;experiment;extraction;increment;largest;preparation;respiratory rate;simulation;speech recognition;test data;time series;sensor (device)	Rubén Vera-Rodríguez;John S.

Tau PET imaging may become a useful biomarker for clinical diagnosis and tracking of disease progression but there is no consensus yet on how tau PET signal is best quantified. The goal of the current study was to evaluate multiple whole-brain and region-specific approaches to detect clinically relevant tau PET signal. Two independent cohorts of cognitively normal adults and amyloid-positive (Aβ+) patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD-dementia underwent [18F]AV-1451 PET. Methods for tau tracer quantification included: (i) in vivo Braak staging, (ii) regional uptake in Braak composite regions, (iii) several whole-brain measures of tracer uptake, (iv) regional uptake in AD-vulnerable voxels, and (v) uptake in a priori defined regions. Receiver operating curves characterized accuracy in distinguishing Aβ- controls from AD/MCI patients and yielded tau positivity cutoffs. Clinical relevance of tau PET measures was assessed by regressions against cognition and MR imaging measures. Key tracer uptake patterns were identified by a factor analysis and voxel-wise contrasts. Braak staging, global and region-specific tau measures yielded similar diagnostic accuracies, which differed between cohorts. While all tau measures were related to amyloid and global cognition, memory and hippocampal/entorhinal volume/thickness were associated with regional tracer retention in the medial temporal lobe. Key regions of tau accumulation included medial temporal and inferior/middle temporal regions, retrosplenial cortex, and banks of the superior temporal sulcus. Our data indicate that whole-brain tau PET measures might be adequate biomarkers to detect AD-related tau pathology. However, regional measures covering AD-vulnerable regions may increase sensitivity to early tau PET signal, atrophy and memory decline.

The goal of the challenge is to recognize eight everyday activities including transit. Our team, JSI-Deep, utilized an AR approach based on combining multiple machine-learning methods following the principle of multiple knowledge. We first created several base learners using classical and deep learning approaches, then integrated them into an ensemble, and finally refined the ensemble's predictions by smoothing. On the internal test data, the approach achieved 96% accuracy, which is a significant leap over the baseline 60%.	activity recognition;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);deep learning;machine learning;real life;smoothing;test data	Martin Gjoreski;Vito Janko;Nina Resçiç;Miha Mlakar;Mitja Lustrek;Jani Bizjak;Gasper Slapnicar;Matej Marinko;Vid Drobnic;Matjaz Gams	2018		10.1145/3267305.3267515	human–computer interaction;smoothing;deep learning;machine learning;test data;hidden markov model;activity recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	2.865792521931733	-84.20126811328427	64550

Traditional non-intrusive activity recognition approaches are dependent on the use of various machine learning techniques to infer activities given the collected object usage data. Current activity recognition approaches are also based on knowledge driven techniques that require extensive modelling of the activities that needs to be inferred. These models can be seen as too restrictive, prescriptive and static as they are based on a finite set of activities. In this paper, we propose a novel """"top down"""" approach to recognising activities based on object usage data, which detects patterns associated with the activity-object relationship and utilizes web knowledge in order to build dynamic activity models based on the objects used to perform the activity.

However, psychotic symptoms are quantified by means of the scale for the assessment of positive and negative symptoms, but many investigations try to introduce new etiology for psychiatric disorders based on combination of biological, psychological and social causes. Classification between healthy and paranoid cases has been achieved by time, frequency, Hilbert–Huang (HH) and a combination between those features as a hybrid features. Those features extracted from the Hilbert–Huang transform for each intrinsic mode function (IMF) of the detrended time series for each healthy case and paranoid case. Short-term ECG recordings of 20 unmedicated patients suffering from acute paranoid schizophrenia and those obtained from healthy matched peers have been utilized in this investigation. Frequency features: very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and HF/LF (ratio) produced promising success rate equal to 97.82 % in training and 97.77 % success rate in validation by means of IMF1 and ninefolds. Time–frequency features [LF, HF and ratio, mean, maximum (max), minimum (min) and standard deviation (SD)] provided 100 % success in both training and validation trials by means of ninefolds for IMF1 and IMF2. By utilizing IMF1 and ninefolds, frequency and Hilbert–Hang features [LF, HF, ratio, mean value of envelope ( $$\bar{a}$$ a ¯ )] produced 96.87 and 95.5 % for training and validation, respectively. By analyzing the first IMF and using ninefolds, time and Hilbert–Hang features [mean, max, min, SD, median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), kurtosis, skewness, Shannon entropy, approximate entropy and energy, ( $$\bar{a}$$ a ¯ ), level of envelope variation ([ $$\dot{a}$$ a ˙ (t)]^2), central frequency $$(\bar{W})$$ ( W ¯ ) and number of zero signal crossing $$(\left| {\bar{W}} \right|)$$ ( W ¯ ) ] produced a 100 % success rate in training and 90 % success rate in validation. Time, frequency and HH features [energy, VLF, LF, HF, ratio and ( $$\bar{a}$$ a ¯ )] provided 97.5 % success rate in training and 95.24 % success rate in validation using IMF1 and sixfolds. However, frequency features have produced promising classification success rate, but hybrid features emerged the highest classification success rate than using features in each domain separately.	approximate entropy;entropy (information theory);heart rate variability;helicon filter;hilbert transform;hilbert–huang transform;maxima and minima;shannon (unit);time series	Mohamed Abdelkader Aboamer;Ahmad Taher Azar;Abdallah S.

In contrast to testing the significance of the measured experimental effect for a given model, unsupervised pattern recognition techniques, such as fuzzy clustering, often find unexpected behavior in addition to expected activations, allowing the exploitation of this element of surprise. The many artifact clusters often discovered might aid the experimenter in deciding whether the dataset is usable, whether some additional preprocessing step is required, or whether the one used has introduced spurious effects. However, clustering alone does not complete the analysis because the membership values that are generated are not indicative of the level of statistical significance with respect to the cluster activation patterns (centroids). This is of particular importance for fMRI datasets for which most time-series are """"noise"""", with no activation patterns. We propose that an initial partition step should precede the clustering step. Only time-series that meet a certain statistical criterion (using a scaled version of Fisher's g-order statistic) are selected for clustering; this typically represents <5% of the whole brain region. The purpose of clustering is to generate a set of cluster centers that are the possible activation patterns; these are used in forming a linear model of all the time-series. The model parameter is tested for significance in both the time and frequency domains. We present a novel method of conducting these tests, which limits the number of false positives. We call the three-step process of initial partition, clustering and the two-domain significance test as exploring regions of interest with cluster analysis (EROICA)."""		Mario Jarmasz;Ray L.

In this study, low-cost sensors have been used to collect gait signals and identify the features responsible for differentiating the gait phases (swing/stance). Dataset was obtained for a total of 160 trails with 5 gait cycles per trail from healthy volunteers $(\mathbf{n}=20)$. Torque involved during progressive gait was also estimated to model regulation of the body for maintaining balance in gait and posture. Additionally, we also investigated EEG and gait correlates by identifying the brain regions that are active during movement initiation and during stance and swing (a progressive gait) using electroencephalography. While identifying key biomarkers relevant for posture control and gait, this could enhance low-cost detection of movement related diseases in technically challenged regions.

3fa1f87d5c6eb9e32a1011933bb79954e5795273	deep learning based reliable early epileptic seizure predictor		Seizure prediction has a great influence on epileptic patients' quality of life. In this paper, a novel deep learning based patient-specific epileptic seizure predictor using electroencephalogram (EEG) is proposed. The presented method is based on detecting the preictal state and differentiating it from the predominant interictal state. EEG features extraction and classification are achieved in a single automated system that is able to extract the most discriminative features from the raw EEG. The proposed approach gains the benefit of the convolutional neural network in extracting the spatial features from the multichannel EEG signals and the bidirectional recurrent neural network in predicting the occurrence of the incoming seizure earlier than the current methods. High accuracy of 99.6%, low false alarm rate of 0.004 h-1and early seizure prediction of one hour make the proposed method the most efficient among the state of the art. Robustness of the system is verified using an effective test method.		Hisham G. Daoud;Magdy A.

This papers presents a detailed analysis of a public dataset of traces which employed five sensing points to characterize the user's mobility during the execution of ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) and emulated falls. The analysis is aimed at analysing two main factors: the importance of the election of the position of the sensor and the possible impact of the user's personal features on the statistical characterization of the movements. Results reveal the importance of the nature of the ADL for the effectiveness of the discrimination of the falls.	algorithm;biological anthropology;emulator;family computer disk system;sensor;testbed;tracing (software);wearable computer	Eduardo Casilari-Pérez;Jose-Antonio Santoyo-Ramón;José Manuel Cano-García	2018		10.1145/3266157.3266211	data mining;activities of daily living;wearable computer;accelerometer;bluetooth;computer science	Mobile	7.622137459164908	-85.64331743222705	65233
b46b54d3f03a770cc7a9004ceced21c0d92a97e6	neuroimage: special issue on multimodal data fusion		T 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 U N C O R R E C Let us start by trying to define the very theme of this Special Issue, Multimodal Data Fusion. As discussed in detail on Uludag and Roebroeck's paper, multimodal data fusion is usually conceived as the problem of bringing together data frommultiple modalities into a common reference frame. This has traditionally been performed mentally using anatomical references; for example, patient X underwent a CT scan some years ago following a head trauma, which showed a potential, small brain lesion in a certain location. Following an epileptic seizure a recent MRI scan revealed an abnormality in the same region. EEG revealed frequent epileptiform discharges with a field covering the same lobe as the structural abnormality. Although adequate in many circumstances, the limitations of this approach are clear for certain purposes: for example when tracking and quantifying a slowly evolving brain lesion or when wanting to combine multimodal measurements with voxelwise precision. Therefore multimodal data fusion in the modern sense is often taken to mean the integration of the multimodal imaging data (or information derived from the imaging data) in a common reference anatomical space through co-registration using computational image processing methods (or acquisitions with identical scanning matrices). However, voxel-wisematchingmay not be reasonable for themeaningful consideration of the multimodal data inter-relationships; for example, the study of the relationships between summary statistics extracted from (more or less precisely) homologous ROI acrossmodalities and network-wise multimodal correlations. The review by Sui et al. focusing on methods to elucidate structure–function relationships shows examples of this approach, along with voxel-based analyses. One of the main ideas put forward by this review is that combining different measurements, in addition to providing simply a greater mass of data, can help in differentiating patients, groups, and diseases based on the assumption that the measurements contain complementary information. Such approaches also provide a way to identify linked patterns in themultimodal datawhich are often very high dimensional, and thus help solve the ‘needle in a haystack’ problem while also incorporating information which can only be identified by a joint analysis of multiple datasets together. The empiricism of essentially all the methods presented is indicative of the exploratory, ‘new frontier’ nature of today's rapidly expanding data mass. These are focused on identifying relationships between the various datasets (again assuming a degree of comparability or homology); in essence, this is the stuff of pattern identification in spaces of increasing dimensionalities. In addition to spatial co-registration, the degree of acquisition synchrony is an important consideration in multimodal data fusion. In the same way that spatially fused data should bring together measurements that relate to the same brain region (‘bunch of neurons’), the fused multimodal data should relate to the same event or brain state (notwithstanding longitudinal studies).

4c66a046c2a6ced0d4648f6e72d6f24cbfdeacd0	wavelet-based sparse functional linear model with applications to eegs seizure detection and epilepsy diagnosis		In epilepsy diagnosis or epileptic seizure detection, much effort has been focused on finding effective combination of feature extraction and classification methods. In this paper, we develop a wavelet-based sparse functional linear model for representation of EEG signals. The aim of this modeling approach is to capture discriminative random components of EEG signals using wavelet variances. To achieve this goal, a forward search algorithm is proposed for determination of an appropriate wavelet decomposition level. Two EEG databases from University of Bonn and University of Freiburg are used for illustration of applicability of the proposed method to both epilepsy diagnosis and epileptic seizure detection problems. For this data considered, we show that wavelet-based sparse functional linear model with a simple classifier such as 1-NN classification method leads to higher classification results than those obtained using other complicated methods such as support vector machine. This approach produces a 100 % classification accuracy for various classification tasks using the EEG database from University of Bonn, and outperforms many other state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed classification scheme leads to 99 % overall classification accuracy for the EEG data from University of Freiburg.	comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;database;electroencephalography;epilepsy;feature extraction;linear model;ninety nine;search algorithm;seizures;sparse matrix;support vector machine;wavelet transform	Shengkun Xie;Sridhar Krishnan	2012	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-012-0967-8	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	AI	18.742095263943355	-91.00550913933655	65300
a17a094e136a2c68ff87eca68d8ad6987dbfc70f	wi-fire: device-free fire detection using wifi networks		Conflagration is one of the major disasters that threatens human life and property. If the proper action is not taken in detecting the symptom of conflagration events ahead of time, the number of such disasters will keep increasing. An effective solution in this context will alleviate many fire-related global problems to a great extent. Although fire detectors are not available in many places, WiFi networks are increasingly prevalent nowadays. Motivated by the previous works that used WiFi signals for the purpose of environment monitoring and activity recognition, we make an attempt to use WiFi signals to detect fire. Through several experiments, we find that fire influences the transmission of wireless signals uniquely, and consequently it affects the amplitude and phase of the resultant Channel State Information (CSI). Based on this observation, in this paper, we propose a device-free fire detection system, namely Wi-Fire, using commercial WiFi devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages CSI of radio frequency (RF) signal to detect fire events using existing wireless infrastructure without requiring any additional device. We implement our proposed system on desktop computers equipped with commercial 802.11n network interface cards (NICs). Comprehensive experiments have been conducted for different scenarios in different environments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed system. The results verify that the fire detection accuracy of this training-based system is up to 96.67% on average.	activity recognition;channel state information;desktop computer;experiment;fire-control system;network interface controller;radio frequency;random forest;resultant;sensor;supervised learning	Shuxin Zhong;Yongzhi Huang;Rukhsana Ruby;Lu Wang;Yu-Xuan Qiu;Kaishun Wu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997406	wireless sensor network;wireless;computer network;channel state information;real-time computing;the internet;activity recognition;computer science;fire detection;detector;network interface	Mobile	5.199628500547213	-83.19094765707257	65332

Therefore, in such cases, a targeted e-Health solution to safeguard patient long-term health could be a meaningful approach. Today's modern healthcare technologies, often built around electronic and computer-based equipment, require an access to a reliable electricity supply. Many healthcare technologies and products also presume access to the high speed internet is available, making them unsuitable for use in areas where there is no fixed-line internet connectivity, access is slow, unreliable, and expensive, yet where the most benefit to patients may be gained. In this paper, a full mobile sensor platform is presented, based around readily-purchased consumer components, to facilitate a low cost and efficient means of monitoring the health of patients with prosthetic lower limbs. This platform is designed such that it can also be operated in a standalone mode, i.e., in the absence of internet connectivity, thereby making it suitable to the developing world. Also, to counter the challenge of power supply issues in e-Health monitoring, a self-contained rechargeable solution to the platform is proposed and demonstrated. The platform works with an Android mobile device, in order to allow for the capture of data from a wireless sensor unit, and to give the clinician access to results from the sensors. The results from the analysis, carried out within the platform's Raspberry Pi Zero, are demonstrated to be of use for remote monitoring. This is specifically targeted for monitoring the tissue health of lower limb amputees. The monitoring of residual limb temperature and gait can be a useful indicator of tissue viability in lower limb amputees especially those suffering from diabetes. We describe a route wherein non-invasive monitoring of tissue health is achievable using the Gaussian process technique. This knowledge will be useful in establishing biomarkers related to a possible deterioration in a patient's health or for assessing the impact of clinical interventions.	android;gaussian process;internet access;landline;mobile device;power supply;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version);rechargeable battery;sensor	Neha Mathur;Greig Paul;James Irvine;Mohamed Abuhelala;Arjan Buis;Ivan Glesk	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622163	embedded system;the internet;simulation;gyroscope;telecommunications;sensor;electrical engineering;gait;elastomer;particle detector;computer security;accelerometer;biomarker;quantum mechanics	Mobile	9.457584859015881	-88.24362460210996	65545

This letter considers one of the most important aspects of the problem, namely the roles played by individuals interacting in different settings. In particular, this work proposes an automatic approach for the recognition of roles in both production environment contexts (e.g., news and talk-shows) and spontaneous situations (e.g., meetings). The experiments are performed over roughly 90 h of material (one of the largest databases used for role recognition in the literature) and show that the recognition effectiveness depends on how much the roles influence the behavior of people. Furthermore, this work proposes the first approach for modeling mutual dependences between roles and assesses its effect on role recognition performance.	database;deployment environment;experiment;feature extraction;interaction;mutual exclusion;spontaneous order	Hugues Salamin;Sarah Favre;Alessandro Vinciarelli	2009	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2009.2030740	normal distribution;computer vision;social network analysis;systems modeling;index term;letter;network analysis;telecommunications;feature extraction;behavioural sciences;computer science;artificial intelligence;data execution prevention;machine learning;multimedia;information management;helium;world wide web;difference set;social network	Web+IR	-4.245112784049573	-81.77926087468589	65546

Long-term training will change the musical perception, due to plasticity of the human brain. On the other hand, mental or neural disorders may affect musical perception. The aim of this study is to propose a musical perception experiment and the corresponding auditory evoked potentials (AEP) analysis strategy to distinguish musicians with long-term training, healthy controls and patients with psychiatric disorders. AEPs from 12 schizophrenia patients (defect), 12 musicians (enhancement) and 12 healthy people (regular) invoked by musical intervals and chords were recorded. AEP analysis results show that schizophrenia patients have reduced N1 and P2 amplitudes comparing with the other two groups. Musicians have enhanced N1, P2 and N1-P2 amplitudes. Basing on these observations, a two-layer hierarchical AEP classification method based on the linear discriminate analysis (LDA) is proposed to distinguish these different subject groups. Layer-1 classifies schizophrenia patients with others based on AEP elicited by musical intervals. Layer-2 distinguishes musicians and normal people based on stimuli of consonant intervals and chord. Accuracy of the proposed two-layer method can reach 91.63% through leave-one-out cross validation. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling musical perception by analyzing brain AEPs elicited by musical stimuli with different complexity and consonance. These results can be applied to the development of musical training evaluation and psychiatric disorders diagnosis systems in the future.	asymptotic equipartition property;auditory processing disorder;cognition;complexity;cross-validation (statistics);image scaling;linear discriminant analysis;microsoft windows;software bug	Tsung-Hao Hsieh;Ming-Jian Sun;Sheng-Fu Liang	2015	2015 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)	10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407066	psychology;speech recognition;developmental psychology;communication	AI	13.7776647382137	-91.23202945348407	65657

When physicians or coroners cannot explain the cause of death it is classified as sudden death. This paper reviews the related literature and proposes a mobile solution based on biofeedback monitoring that tries to prevent the sudden death in infants. The sudden death system uses real-time data collection from sensors to diagnose, in advance, baby health problems and prevent those are take care for a baby. When an issue is detected by this system (i.e., the sensors send abnormal data), it sends a warning to those responsible for the baby. It allows the access to data from sensors and their analysis in real-time (such as, the baby position and the crib). Signal processing algorithms are used in real-time to prevent a sudden death. Mobile devices (such as, smartphones or tablets) are used to process the sensed data and monitoring a baby performing alerts/warnings when an abnormal situation is detected. The proposed approach is evaluated and demonstrated through a prototype.	algorithm;bluetooth;information-theoretic death;known-plaintext attack;microphone;mobile device;prototype;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time data;real-time transcription;sensor;signal processing;smartphone;tablet computer	Angelo M.

43b91147f0b5ab900b29ea7943d58fe761f0e26b	robust parsimonious selection of dysphonia measures for telemonitoring of parkinson's disease symptom severity		(pd) symptom severity is typically quantified using the standard clinical metric Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (updrs) which spans the range 0-176 (0 denotes healthy). This assessment requires the patient's physical presence in the clinic, is time consuming, and relies on the clinical rater's subjective evaluation and experience; practice has shown that expert clinicians might differ by as much as 4-5 updrs points in their evaluations. We had previously developed a statistical machine learning framework which enables accurate and objective quantification of average pd symptom severity using exclusively speech signals. for this purpose, we evaluated 132 speech signal processing algorithms (dysphonia measures), which attempt to capture distinctive characteristics in PD subjects' voice. on a very large database of about 6,000 phonations, we could replicate the clinical experts' assessments within less than two UPDRS points' error. in this paper, we focus on identifying the most successful of the original 132 dysphonia measures in estimating updrs using five robust feature selection techniques. We demonstrate that we can improve on our previous findings using only 15 dysphonia measures, where the selected measures also tentatively indicate the most representative pathophysiological characteristics in male and female pd voices.	algorithm;feature selection;machine learning;occam's razor;rating scale;self-replicating machine;signal processing;speech processing	Athanasios Tsanas;Max A.

Signals that are generated by two separate neuronal sources often demonstrate a consistent phase-relationship in a particular frequency-band, i.e., they demonstrate rhythmic neuronal synchronization. This consistency is conventionally measured by the PLV (phase-locking value) or the spectral coherence measure. Both statistical measures suffer from significant bias, in that their sample estimates overestimate the population statistics for finite sample sizes. This is a significant problem in the neurosciences where statistical comparisons are often made between conditions with a different number of trials or between neurons with a different number of spikes. We introduce a new circular statistic, the PPC (pairwise phase consistency). We demonstrate that the sample estimate of the PPC is a bias-free and consistent estimator of its corresponding population parameter. We show, both analytically and by means of numerical simulations, that the population statistic of the PPC is equivalent to the population statistic of the squared PLV. The variance and mean squared error of the PPC and PLV are compared. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the method in actual neuronal data recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex of rats that engage in a two-odour discrimination task. We find a strong increase in rhythmic synchronization of spikes relative to the local field potential (as measured by the PPC) for a wide range of low frequencies (including the theta-band) during the anticipation of sucrose delivery in comparison to the anticipation of quinine delivery.	cns disorder;coherence (physics);computer simulation;estimated;lock (computer science);mean squared error;neural oscillation;neuroscience discipline;numerical analysis;odors;population parameter;primary peritoneal carcinoma;quinine;relevance;sample size;sample variance;somatosensory discrimination disorder;statistic (data);sucrose	Martin Vinck;Marijn van Wingerden;Thilo Womelsdorf;Pascal Fries;Cyriel M.

The characteristics of epigastric impedance change in terms of predictive model. The gastric emtying curve was fitted numerically by a Weilbull's model (GE(t>=GEo*exp(-t/Th>k) based on Gauss-Newton algorithm programed on a microcomputer. Moreover the inferior enveloppe of the noisy curve was separated for clear representation. A running spectrum analysis was also used in order to determine the regular gastric activity and its variation. INTRODUCTION Gastric emptying is one of the most important physiological function in the gastrointestinal tract. It limits the rate of absorption of nutriments by controlling delivery in the small intestine. During the last 30 years, associated with the development of methods to quantify gastric emptying, there has been a greatly increased understanding of both the diagnosis and treatment of gastric emptying disorders in humans [ 11. Many techniques have been used for measurement of gastric emptying : radigraphic examination procedures, intubation methods and more recently radionucleide scintigraphy, ultrasound and impedancemetry. The electrical resistance (impedance) of the upper abdomen increases rapidly when the stomach is filled by meals and continuously changes during the completion of emptying meals. Some worker reported that this non-invasive methode could be of value in order to determine some disorders of gastric emptying in certain conditions and analytical analysis of data [ 21. We have concentrated the present work on the analysis of impedance curve and gastric activity signal which is modulated on the curve. The numerical analysis in time domain has given a clear representation of the gastric emptying rate and some parameters which can be used statistically in further clinical investigation and treatment. Since the individual antral contractions also seem to give rise to impedance in a gastric rythme [ 2 ] , we have also studied the 10 CH2951-2/91/0000/0010$01.00 Q 1991 IEEE Track I : Clinical Assessment ana' Risk EvaluatwnlSession 1 11 impedance waveforms in frequency domain as one posible way to increase the sentivity of measurement. METHODS A Impedance measurements A tetrapolar epigastric impedance equipment was developed in our laboratory to measure the epigastric impedances change of 1-2 ohms occured after gastric filling. The band width of the channel was about 0.05-0.2 H z . A constant amplitude sinusoidal current of 24 mA p-p at 100 kHz form a isolated current source was applied between two pre-gelled cutaneous silver-silver chloride electrodes (3M red dot), one was placed anteriorly on abdomen and another was placed posteriorly on the back, but the volunteers were in the sitting position. Fluctuations of the current as it passed through the epigastric region were collected via a pair of similar electrodes and amplified. The activity was recorded continuously during 30-45 minutes after ingestion of 500 ml of 10% glucose via an isolation circuitry for volunteer safety. The signals were digitized at real-time with 1 Hz sample rate through a 1 2 bits A-to-D converter (DATA TRANSLATION DT 2801). The digital signals were stocked in a hard disk for further analysis. B Signal analysis 1 The study of Sutton [ 2 ] indicated that the rate of subsequent decline and its monoexponential pattern related to gastric emptying. Unfortunately the pattern obtained from measurements showed respiratory interferences and unevitable motion artifacts which reduced the accuracy of clinical study. These problems might be reduced by using a curve fitting method of the exponential functions in order to suppress noisy data. These useful mathematical tools did not only resolved the problem of modulating noise but also produced some parameters for the quantification of the curve which allowed the clinical use of epigastric impedance measurement. The signal recorded S(t) , a function of time t was defined as (1) G(t) = GE(t)+GA(t)+n(t) where GE(t) and GA(t) are the impedance variation corresponding to the gastric emptying and gastric myoelectric activity respectively and n( t ) is the noise of the record. 2 GE(t) is determined by fitting a Weilbull's model on G(t) . 12 Computer-Based Medical Systems: Fourth Annual IEEE Symposium An impedance-time curve show a sudden change when a meal which a resistivity different form that of the human body is ingested (Figure 1). A n exponential change following this deflection show the completion of emptying meal which can be described by an equation : {2> where A is the amplitude of the filling peak before declinning, Th and k are the first-order disposition rate constant. The objective is to estimate the parameters Th and k of the model in order to quantify the gastric emptying. The parameters are estimated by th method of least squares, ie by finding the value of the parameters which minimize th sum of squares residual (S) .

Most of these applications rely on synchronous tasks with different user's evaluations associated to correct and wrong events. Asynchronous detection during the continuous evaluation of the task, however, has to cope with background noise and an increased number of misdetections common in event-related potential detection. This paper studies a different characteristic that may carry additional information to be exploited by asynchronous ErrP detectors: brain connectivity coherence patterns appearing while the user monitors the continuous operation of a device. The results obtained with five subject revealed the presence of an error potential in an asynchronous reaching task an showed an increase in the coherency within the theta band.	brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;continuous operation;detectors;evaluation;experiment;feature extraction;frequency band;increment;large;list of http status codes;mean squared error;online and offline;onset (audio);travel	Jason Omedes;Iñaki Iturrate;Luis Montesano	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944500	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;communication	Visualization	13.754281895434515	-92.47562310435626	65901
31d644ffb17c869b72ec02e629232084afbecf71	subject and class specific frequency bands selection for multiclass motor imagery classification	brain computer interface;motor imagery classification;erd ers;frequency bands selection;electroencephalography	EEG-based discrimination among motor imagery states has been widely studied for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to the great potential for real-life applications. However, in terms of designing a motor imagery-based BCI system, a lot of research in the literature either uses a frequency band of interest selected manually based on the visual analysis of EEG data or is set to a general broad band, causing performance degradation in classification. In this article, we propose a novel method of selecting subject and class specific frequency bands based on the analysis of a channel-frequency matrix, which we call a channel-frequency map. We operate the classification process for each frequency band individually, i.e., spatial filtering, feature extraction, and classification, and determine a class label for an input EEG by considering the outputs from multiple classifiers together at the end. From our experiments on a public dataset of BCI Competition IV (2008) II-a that includes four motor imagery tasks from nine subjects, the proposed algorithm outperformed the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm in a broad band and a filter bank CSP algorithm on average in terms of cross-validation and session-to-session transfer rate. Furthermore, a considerable increase of classification accuracy has been achieved for certain subjects. We also would like to note that the proposed data-driven frequency bands selection method is applicable to other kinds of single-trial EEG classifications that are based on modulations of brain rhythms, by no means limited to motor imagery-based BCI applications. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This feature was carried out in response to the necessities defined by the application of a diagnostic identification methodology. This method was successfully applied to a public Mexican hospital and the issue identified was the mobility of elderly people and physically challenged individuals. The movement of these patients can be performed routinely or sporadically during their stay in a hospital. For patients who require a particular routine application of this action, the system includes an intelligent monitor system. This intelligent system allows medical experts to program the movements of the robotic bed considering the posture of the patients and the time in bed.

c967f1919234c3874d9c47023a8f33199a647fdd	detection of nocturnal slow wave sleep based on cardiorespiratory activity in healthy adults	time delay cardiorespiratory activity slow wave sleep feature smoothing spline fitting;sleep smoothing methods splines mathematics delay effects feature extraction standards electrocardiography	Human slow wave sleep (SWS) during bedtime is paramount for energy conservation and memory consolidation. This study aims at automatically detecting SWS from nocturnal sleep using cardiorespiratory signals that can be acquired with unobtrusive sensors in a home-based scenario. From the signals, time-dependent features are extracted for continuous 30-s epochs. To reduce the measuring noise, body motion artifacts, and/or within-subject variability in physiology conveyed by the features, and thus, enhance the detection performance, we propose to smooth the features over each night using a spline fitting method. In addition, it was found that the changes in cardiorespiratory activity precede the transitions between SWS and the other sleep stages (non-SWS). To this matter, a novel scheme is proposed that performs the SWS detection for each epoch using the feature values prior to that epoch. Experiments were conducted with a large dataset of 325 overnight polysomnography (PSG) recordings using a linear discriminant classifier and tenfold cross validation. Features were selected with a correlation-based method. Results show that the performance in classifying SWS and non-SWS can be significantly improved when smoothing the features and using the preceding feature values of 5-min earlier. We achieved a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.57 (at an accuracy of 88.8%) using only six selected features for 257 recordings with a minimum of 30-min overnight SWS that were considered representative of their habitual sleeping pattern at home. These features included the standard deviation, low-frequency spectral power, and detrended fluctuation of heartbeat intervals as well as the variations of respiratory frequency and upper and lower respiratory envelopes. A marked drop in Kappa to 0.21 was observed for the other nights with SWS time of less than 30 min, which were found to more likely occur in elderly. This will be the future challenge in cardiorespiratory-based SWS detection.	classification;coefficient;discriminant;epoch (reference date);experiment;extraction;heart rate variability;kappa calculus;lung consolidation;maxima and minima;memory disorders;morphologic artifacts;programmable sound generator;quantum fluctuation;respiratory rate;semiconductor consolidation;sinewave synthesis;sleep stages;sleep, slow-wave;smoothing (statistical technique);smoothing spline;spline (mathematics);standard deviation;physiological aspects;proteasome storage granule;sensor (device);triangulation	Xi Long;Pedro Fonseca;Ronald M.

98f8545747f64efe874531613c6f563b0f7f37d8	a novel microwave sensor to detect specific biomarkers in human cerebrospinal fluid and their relationship to cellular ischemia during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair	electromagnetic wave sensors;thoraco abdominal aneurysms;in situ monitoring;interdigitatedelectrode	Thoraco-abdominal aneurysms (TAAA) represents a particularly lethal vascular disease that without surgical repair carries a dismal prognosis. However, there is an inherent risk from surgical repair of spinal cord ischaemia that can result in paraplegia. One method of reducing this risk is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. We believe that the CSF contains clinically significant biomarkers that can indicate impending spinal cord ischaemia. This work therefore presents a novel measurement method for proteins, namely albumin, as a precursor to further work in this area. The work uses an interdigitated electrode (IDE) sensor and shows that it is capable of detecting various concentrations of albumin (from 0 to 100 g/L) with a high degree of repeatability at 200 MHz (R2 = 0.991) and 4 GHz (R2 = 0.975).	aortic aneurysm;aortic aneurysm, abdominal;biological markers;cerebrospinal fluid;computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis;experiment;fifty nine;forecast of outcome;forty nine;image resolution;ion-selective electrodes;ischemia;leuciscus idus;mandibular right second molar tooth;megahertz;microwave;neurotrophic electrode;paraplegia;real-time clock;real-time computing;repeatability;sensor;spinal cord;vascular diseases	M.

The aim of a music model is to analyze and represent the semantic content of music for purposes of classification, discovery, or clustering. The k-max pooling layer is used in the network to make it possible to pool the k most active features, capturing the semantic-rich and time-varying information about music. Our network takes an input music as a sequence of audio words, where each audio word is associated with a distributed feature vector that can be fine-tuned by backpropagating errors during the training. The architecture allows us to take advantage of the better trained audio word embeddings and the deep structures to produce more robust music representations.

2359235788fa23292700625a1ddb252c976cde36	signal quality assessment of f-waves in atrial fibrillation		Ambulatory ECG recordings are frequently corrupted by artifacts caused by, e.g., muscle activity or moving electrodes, which complicates the analysis of f-waves and motivates signal quality assessment to improve the reliability off-wave analysis. Although many methods have been developed for assessing the quality of ECG signals in general, no method deals specifically with f-waves. This study proposes a novel signal quality index (SQI), using a model-based approach for assessment off-wave signal quality. To evaluate the performance of the SQI, 189 5-s recordings of f-waves from AF patients are studied, as is the same number of recordings with motion artifacts and electrode movements taken from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database. The signal quality index is capable of discriminating between f-waves and noisy recordings with an accuracy of 98%. The results suggest that the proposed signal quality index correctly identifies noisy recordings, and can be used to improve the reliability off-wave analysis.	anisotropic filtering;artifact (software development);bounding interval hierarchy	Mikael Henriksson;Andrius Petrenas;Vaidotas Marozas;Frida Sandberg;Leif Sörnmo	2017	2017 Computing in Cardiology (CinC)		ambulatory ecg;signal quality index;atrial fibrillation;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	Robotics	17.487293421259114	-87.34418896227196	66635
d7744deb61e21ce8d4e9e623e643eb44f1a2b2d3	relationship between amplitude of resting-state fnirs global signal and eeg vigilance measures		Most of the prior studies of functional connectivity in both healthy and diseased brain utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a measure to represent the temporal synchrony in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals across brain regions. To eliminate the impact of widely distributed global signal component across the brain, many studies have adopted global signal regression (GSR) as a pre-processing approach to regress the global signal component out of BOLD signals followed by computing hemodynamic connectivity. However, the procedure of global signal regression has been debated as physiologically relevant component may be present in global signal. In this study, we aimed to address the controversy of global signal using functional non-invasive neuroimaging technology, i.e. functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which measures hemodynamic signals by probing local changes in oxygen consumption, a common imaging contrast measured by BOLD fMRI. In the current study, we acquired simultaneous EEG and fNIRS signals, both in high-density configuration and whole-brain coverage, in healthy individuals at eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state and at three different body positions. We explored the underlying relationship between fNIRS global signal and EEG vigilance, and have identified negative correlation between fNIRS global signal and EEG vigilance across the physiological variations of measurements.	body dysmorphic disorders;cell respiration;computation (action);electroencephalography;entity name part qualifier - adopted;eye;hemodynamics;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroimaging;oxygen consumption;periodicals;preprocessor;rest;resting state fmri;signal detection (psychology);spectroscopy, near-infrared;blood oxygen level dependent	Yuxuan Chen;Jesse Farrand;Julia H.

Since absolute values depend on imaging methods and magnetic field strengths, continuous evaluation of specific reference values remains requisite. Multi-echo turbo spin echo and multi-echo gradient recalled echo imaging sequences were applied to 66 healthy subjects (18-84years) at 3T to quantify the irreversible (R2), effective (R2*) and reversible (R2'=R2*-R2) transverse relaxation rates. Representative regions-of-interest (ROIs) were determined automatically in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) on T1-weighted scans. Phantom experiments of different sized iron-oxide particles were conducted to explore the correlation of R2' related to R2 for the evaluation of the size of iron deposits. R2 decreased with age for the majority of ROIs, but increased for putamen, head of caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens. R2* and R2' increased with age in deep GM structures except for the thalamus. R2* and R2' showed a distinct dependency on fiber orientation in exemplary WM regions. R2', R2 and R2* were strongly linear proportional to age-related iron content in deep GM with slopes of 0.88, 0.18 and 1.08 in [1/s/mg Fe per 100g wet tissue] and intercepts of 1.69, 9.25 and 10.69 in [1/s], respectively. Linear and non-linear curve fitting of R2' vs. R2 in phantoms revealed increased slopes with increasing particle size. In vivo, averaged R2' vs. R2 data points of patients with Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy were above the fitted curves of healthy subjects suggesting larger sized iron deposits in these neurodegenerative diseases. Decreased R2 with age may reflect physiological tissue degeneration, whereas increased R2* and R2' with age most likely denote physiological iron accumulation. The low intercept of R2' vs. iron content suggests a nearly sole sensitivity of R2' to iron in deep GM, potentially allowing a more specific estimation of the iron content than R2 or R2*. Since R2* and R2' depend on the fiber orientation, their feasibility to estimate iron content in WM is challenging. The analysis of R2' related to R2 may provide valuable information about the size of iron deposits.	abnormal degeneration;caudate nucleus structure;cell nucleus;curve fitting;data point;dietary iron;experiment;fiber to the x;field electron emission;gradient;gray matter;heat shock proteins;intercept substance;large;linear programming relaxation;magnetic fields;neurodegenerative disorders;nonlinear system;normal range;nucleus accumbens;numerous;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;particle size;patients;phantoms, imaging;progressive supranuclear palsy;quantitation;seizures;spin echo;structure of putamen;thalamic structure;tissue fiber;transverse wave;tree accumulation;video-in video-out;visual intercept;white matter;emotional dependency;slope	Jan Sedlacik;Kai Boelmans;U.

As a method of measuring time series complexity and predictability, multiscale entropy (MSE) has been widely applied in many fields. However, sample entropy, which is the fundamental component of MSE, measures the similarity of two subsequences of a time series with either zero or one, but without in-between values, which causes sudden changes of entropy values even if the time series embraces small changes. This problem becomes especially severe when the length of time series is getting short. For solving such the problem, we propose flexible multiscale entropy (FMSE), which introduces a novel similarity function measuring the similarity of two subsequences with full-range values from zero to one, and thus increases the reliability and stability of measuring time series complexity. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real time series, including white noise, 1/f noise and real vibration signals. The evaluation results demonstrate that FMSE has a significant improvement in reliability and stability of measuring complexity of time series, especially when the length of time series is short, compared to MSE and composite multiscale entropy (CMSE). The proposed method FMSE is capable of improving the performance of time series analysis based topology and traffic congestion control techniques.	anatomy, regional;arabic numeral 0;compomers;full-range speaker;network congestion;pink noise;sample entropy;similarity measure;solutions;state entropy:score:pt:cerebral cortex:qn:eeg;synthetic intelligence;time series analysis;white noise	Renjie Zhou;Chen Yang;Jian Wan;Wei Zhang;Bo Guan;Naixue N.

The goal is to simulate mapping across results from heterogeneous methods that might be used in different neuroscience research labs. The input to the mapping consists of two ERP datasets whose spatiotemporal characteristics are captured by alternative sets of features, that is, summary spatial and temporal measures capturing distinct neural patterns that are linked to concepts in an ERP ontology, called NEMO (Neural ElectroMagnetic Ontologies) [3, 6]. The feature value vector of each summary metric is transformed into a point-sequence curve, and ontology-based clustering is used to extract similar subsequences (clusters) representing the neural patterns that can then be aligned across datasets. Finally, the similarity between measures is derived by calculating the similarity between corresponding point-sequence curves. Experiment results showed that the proposed approach is robust and has achieved significant improvement on precision than previous algorithms.	algorithm;cluster analysis;erp;neural oscillation;ontology (information science);robustness (computer science);simulation;web ontology language	Haishan Liu;Gwen A.

We explored the differences in the range of spine angle based on gender, disability severity, the correlation between the spine angle range and the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, as well as the differences in standard deviations between the healthy and LBP subjects. We recruited thirty-nine LBP subjects and thirty-seven healthy people. They were asked to perform several movements from a standing position first and then from a sitting position. The motions were forward and backward bending, left and right lateral bending, as well as left and right axial rotation, respectively. Results show that for the most movements, the means of the spine angle changes in the females were larger than those in the males. In the LBP group, we observed much smaller spine angle values than those in the healthy subjects during exercise. With the increase of VAS score, a declining trend of the spine angle change was observed. There were significant differences in the spine angle range between standing and sitting positions when performing left and right axial rotation (p=0.000, p=0.002, respectively). We observed high correlations (with a max. result of r=0.804) for most movements, executed both from a standing and sitting position. We also found a wider range of standard deviation in the LBP subjects compared to healthy subjects. These results indicate that quantitative analysis of the spine angle range could provide an objective reference of the disability level, and allow for the progress assessment during the rehabilitation of low back pain patients.	belief propagation;lateral thinking;local binary patterns;sensor	Fei Peng;Huihui Li;Kamen Ivanov;Guoru Zhao;Fang Zhou;Wenjing Du;Lei Wang	2016	2016 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks (BSN)	10.1109/BSN.2016.7516247	physical medicine and rehabilitation;computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence;rehabilitation;backward bending;standard deviation;visual analogue scale;low back pain;sitting positions;sitting	HCI	14.328268095623427	-84.09787039227984	67116

However, due to the existence of noise and distortion, mapping between the fMRI signal and the actual neural activity is difficult. Because of the difficulty, differential pattern analysis of fMRI brain images for healthy and diseased cases is regarded as an important research topic. From fMRI scans, increased blood ows can be identified as activated brain regions. Also, based on the multi-sliced images of the volume data, fMRI provides the functional information for detecting and analyzing different parts of the brain.   METHODS In this paper, the capability of a hierarchical method that performed an optimization algorithm based on modified maximum model (MCM) in our previous study is evaluated. The optimization algorithm is designed by adopting modified maximum correlation model (MCM) to detect active regions that contain significant responses. Specifically, in the study, the optimization algorithm is examined based on two groups of datasets, dyslexia and healthy subjects to verify the ability of the algorithm that enhances the quality of signal activities in the interested regions of the brain. After verifying the algorithm, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to identify the difference between healthy and dyslexia subjects.   RESULTS We successfully showed that our optimization algorithm improves the fMRI signal activity for both healthy and dyslexia subjects. In addition, we found that DWT based features can identify the difference between healthy and dyslexia subjects.   CONCLUSION The results of this study provide insights of associations of functional abnormalities in dyslexic subjects that may be helpful for neurobiological identification from healthy subject.	algorithm;brain mapping;congenital abnormality;discrete wavelet transform;distortion;dyslexia;functional gastrointestinal disorders;mathematical optimization;mental association;multi-chip module;noise (electronics);numerous;pattern recognition;resonance;sensor;verifying specimen;fmri	Soo-Yeon Ji;Kevin Ward;Kayvan Najarian	2009	BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making	10.1186/1472-6947-9-S1-S6	computer simulation;health informatics;dyslexia;computer vision;speech recognition;medicine;computer science;artificial intelligence;magnetic resonance imaging;discrete wavelet transform;brain mapping;resting state fmri;wavelet transform	ML	20.545626947030637	-88.01238396407996	67176

However, medications like beta blockers which are prescribed to treat several cardiac conditions have a direct influence on the cardiovascular system and may impact the relationship between HR and energy expenditure during physical activity (AEE). This study proposes to estimate AEE from HR using mixed models (MIX-REG) by introducing a novel method to personalize the prediction equation. We selected as features to represent the individual random effect in the MIX-REG model those subject characteristics which minimized both estimation error (RMSE) and between-subjects error bias variability. Data from 17 patients post-myocardial infarction were collected during a laboratory protocol. AEE was measured using indirect calorimetry and HR using an innovative wrist worn activity monitor equipped with the Philips Cardio and Motion Monitoring Module (CM3-Generation-1), which is an integrated module including a photo-plethysmographic and accelerometer sensor. The presented method showed large AEE estimation accuracy (RMSE = 1.35 kcal/min) which was comparable to that of models personalized using data from laboratory calibration protocols (HR-FLEX) and was superior to multi-linear regression and MIX-REG models trained using a stepwise features selection procedure.	adrenergic beta-antagonists;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;cns disorder;calibration;calorimetry;computation;computational model;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;energy metabolism;exercise;fluorescent antibody technique, indirect;generalization (psychology);half rate;linear iga bullous dermatosis;mix;maxima and minima;mixed model;myocardial infarction;numerous;patients;personalization;protocols documentation;reg1a gene;random effects model;spatial variability;stepwise regression;wearable computer;accelerometers;kilocalorie;variable, characteristic, factor	Alberto G.

c43209d8cc37cb4a08029564da4297aeb8d4252e	exploration of a hybrid design based on eeg and eye movement		This study presents a novel hybrid interface based on both electroen‐ cephalography (EEG) and eye movement. The detection of combination EEG with eye movement provides a new means of communication for patients whose muscular damage are unable to communicate. And this method can translate some brain responses into actions. In this paper, based on the motor imagery, event related synchronization/desychronization (ERS/ERD) were tested by using timefrequency spectrum and brain topographic mapping. A features extraction algo‐ rithm is proposed based on common spatial pattern (CSP), then the support vector machine (SVM) were carried out to classificate data. An EEG recording device integrated with an eye tracker can be complementary to attain improved perform‐ ance and a better efficiency. The eye movement signals (via eye tracker of Tobbi) and EEG signals of ERS/ERD are as the input of hybrid BCI system simultane‐ ously while subjects follow movement of the arrows in each direction. The recog‐ nition accuracy of the entire system reaches to 86.1%. The results showed that the proposed method was efficient in the classification accuracy.	brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;electroencephalography;entity–relationship model;eye tracking;spatiotemporal pattern;support vector machine;topography	Junyou Yang;Yuan Hao;Dianchun Bai;Yinlai Jiang;Hiroshi Yokoi	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65289-4_20	engineering;support vector machine;brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;motor imagery;electroencephalography;synchronization;eye movement;computer vision;eye tracking;artificial intelligence	HCI	14.269351585608229	-92.35737127856883	67403
730d068e10ed8fe689e507ec49ec4785c0838da4	detecting hybrid and electric vehicles using a smartphone	smartphone sensing;electric vehicles;hybrid vehicles	Pedestrians have difficulty noticing hybrid vehicles (HVs) and electrical vehicles (EVs) quietly approaching from behind. We propose a vehicle detection scheme using a smartphone carried by a pedestrian. A notification of a vehicle approaching can be delivered to wearable devices such as Google Glass. We exploit the high-frequency switching noise generated by the motor unit in HVs and EVs. Although people are less sensitive to these high-frequency ranges, these sounds are prominent even on a busy street, and it is possible for a smartphone to detect these signals. The ambient sound captured at 48 kHz is converted to a feature vector in the frequency domain. A J48 classifier implemented on a smartphone can determine whether an EV or HV is approaching. We have collected a large amount of vehicle data at various locations. The false-positive and false-negative rates of our detection scheme are 1.2% and 4.95%, respectively. The first alarm was detected as early as 11.6 s before the vehicle approached the observer. The scheme can also determine the vehicle speed and vehicle type.	extended validation certificate;feature vector;glass;sensor;smartphone;wearable technology	Masaru Takagi;Kosuke Fujimoto;Yoshihiro Kawahara;Tohru Asami	2014		10.1145/2632048.2632088	embedded system;simulation;computer security	HCI	5.875813379129257	-84.16402224922858	67443

The main attractive feature of this system is its stand-alone operation which makes it independent of a computer for signal processing and visual stimuli presentation.

In this study, we evaluated a new acoustic monitoring system for the detection of OLI.   METHODS Lung sounds were collected from 24 adult surgical patients scheduled for routine surgical procedures. Four piezoelectric microphones attached to the patients' backs were used to sample lung sounds during induction of anesthesia and endotracheal tube positioning. To achieve OLI, the endotracheal tube was inserted and advanced down the airway so that diminished or no breath sounds were heard on the left side of the chest. The tube was then withdrawn stepwise until equal breath sounds were heard. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy confirmed the tube's final position. Acoustic analyses were preformed by a new algorithm which assumes a Multiple Input Multiple Output system, in which a multidimensional Auto-Regressive model relates the input (lungs) and the output (recorded sounds) and a classifier, based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test, indicates the number of ventilated lungs without reconstructing the original lung sounds from the recorded samples.   RESULTS This algorithm achieved an OLI detection probability of 95.2% with a false alarm probability of 4.8%.   CONCLUSION Higher detection values can be achieved at the price of a higher incidence of false alarms.	acoustic cryptanalysis;back;bronchoscopy;fiberoptic device component;incidence matrix;intubation;lung diseases;microphone;operative surgical procedures;optical fiber;patients;piezoelectricity;respiratory sounds;schedule (document type);stepwise regression;structure of parenchyma of lung;williams tube;algorithm	Shai Tejman-Yarden;A.

To develop the multi-parametric feature of HRV, we used the statistical and classification techniques. This study analyzes the linear and the non-linear properties of HRV for three recumbent positions, namely the supine, left lateral and right lateral position. Interaction effect between recumbent positions and groups (normal and patients) was observed based on the HRV indices and the extracted HRV indices used to classify the CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) group from the normal people. We have carried out various experiments on linear and non-linear features of HRV indices to evaluate several classifiers, e.g., Bayesian classifiers, CMAR, C4.5 and SVM. In our experiments, SVM outperformed the other classifiers.	heart rate variability	Heon Gyu Lee;Kiyong Noh;Keun Ho Ryu	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-77018-3_23	interaction;heart rate variability;naive bayes classifier;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	16.347374331852993	-90.18158066135383	67823

Extraction of various features from the electroencephalogram (EEG), the electro-oculogram (EOG) and the electromyogram (EMG) processed in the frequency and time domains was achieved using a database of 47 night sleep recordings obtained from healthy adults in laboratory settings. Multiple iterative feature selection and supervised classification methods were applied together with a systematic statistical assessment of the classification performances. Our results show that using a simple set of features such as relative EEG powers in five frequency bands yields an agreement of 71% with the whole database classification of two human experts. These performances are within the range of existing classification systems. The addition of features extracted from the EOG and EMG signals makes it possible to reach about 80% of agreement with the expert classification. The most significant improvement on classification accuracy is obtained on NREM sleep stage I, a stage of transition between sleep and wakefulness. # 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

55a2b6bec9dd6220fb6536334069cfeaa3e4db15	deep affect recognition from r-r intervals		Affect recognition is an important task in ubiquitous computing, in particular in health and human-computer interaction. In the former, it contributes to the timely detection and treatment of emotional and mental disorders, and in the latter, it enables indigenous interaction and enhanced user experience. We present an inter-domain study for affect recognition on seven different datasets, recorded with six different sensors, three different sensor placements, 211 subjects and nearly 1000 hours of labelled data. The datasets are processed and translated into a common spectro-temporal space. The data represented in the common spectro-temporal space is used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for arousal recognition that benefits from the large amounts of data even when the data are heterogeneous (i.e., different sensors and different datasets). The DNN approach outperforms the classical machine-learning approaches in six out of seven datasets.	artificial neural network;deep learning;human–computer interaction;inter-domain;machine learning;sensor;ubiquitous computing;user experience	Martin Gjoreski;Hristijan Gjoreski;Mitja Lustrek;Matjaz Gams	2017		10.1145/3123024.3125608	ubiquitous computing;transfer of learning;computer science;artificial neural network;user experience design;artificial intelligence;machine learning	HCI	3.3571469349641117	-85.32602700826004	67834

Since sEMG is temporal and spatially distributed and is influenced by various factors, muscle fatigue and its related sEMG becomes of importance. This study is an effort to spectrally analyze the sEMG signal during progression of muscle fatigue. The sEMG is captured from the arms of healthy subjects during muscle fatiguing experiments for dynamic and static force levels. Filtered sEMG signal is segmented in five parts with 75% overlap between adjacent segments. The analysis is done using different classical (fast Fourier transform, Welch's averaged modified periodogram), model-based (Yule-Walker, Burg, Covariance and Modified Covariance autoregressive (AR) method), and eigenvector methods (Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and eigenvector spectral estimation method) in frequency domain. Results show that the classical and eigenvector based methods are more sensitive than the model-based methods to fatigue related changes in sEMG signals.	algorithm;amiga walker;autoregressive model;coat of arms;color gradient;electromagnetically induced grating;electromyography;experiment;fast fourier transform;music (algorithm);overlap–add method;spectral density estimation;spectral method;spectrum analyzer;weatherstar;welch's method	Parmod Kumar;Anish Sebastian;Chandrasekhar Potluri;Yimesker Yihun;Madhavi Anugolu;Jim Creelman;Alex Urfer;D.

The approach associates signal processing methods into a situated, reactive, cooperative and decentralized implementation. The objective is to identify and locate the various interictal and ictal epileptiform events (pathological and/or normal) contained in intracerebral EEG signals (one hundred recording channels in general) recorded in patients suffering from partial temporal lobe epilepsy. This approach associates some signal processing methods (spectral analysis, causality measurements, detection, classification) in a multi-agent system.

Although for that purpose a variety of linear methods have been applied to the electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, nonlinear analysis has recently revealed novel and more useful insights about the brain behavior under different emotional states. This work briefly reviews the main progresses in this context, also highlighting the main challenges that will have to be mandatory tackled in future.

5517bdef5087a297929c13bfb04a7b901960ae6c	design of a low-false-positive gesture for a wearable device	wearable device;gesture recognition	As smartwatches are becoming more widely used in society, gesture recognition, as an important aspect of interaction with smartwatches, is attracting attention. An accelerometer that is incorporated in a device is often used to recognize gestures. However, a gesture is often detected falsely when a similar pattern of action occurs in daily life. In this paper, we present a novel method of designing a new gesture that reduces false detection. We refer to such a gesture as a low-false-positive (LFP) gesture. The proposed method enables a gesture design system to suggest LFP motion gestures automatically. The user of the system can design LFP gestures more easily and quickly than what has been possible in previous work. Our method combines primitive gestures to create an LFP gesture. The combination of primitive gestures is recognized quickly and accurately by a random forest algorithm using our method. We experimentally demonstrate the good recognition performance of our method for a designed gesture with a high recognition rate and without false	algorithm;experiment;gesture recognition;international conference on functional programming;least fixed point;random forest;smartwatch;touchpad;wearable technology	Ryo Kawahata;Atsushi Shimada;Takayoshi Yamashita;Hideaki Uchiyama;Rin-ichiro Taniguchi	2016		10.5220/0005701905810588	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;gesture recognition	HCI	4.975108412457493	-84.09052605323794	68158
124c17a3818671bc595b635fa4eb43e21505bb17	manometric recordings bring out post-stimulus refractory states in the anal canal in neonates		Anorectal manometry is a diagnostic technique used to investigate the correct mechanical performance of the internal anal sphincter (IAS). By distending the rectal ampulla while recording changes in the luminal pressure, this method allows for characterizing the anorectal reflex. It can also provide, indirectly, information about the electrical activity of the IAS. In this study, seventeen neonates having 24-hour delayed passage of meconium or presenting distal intestinal obstruction symptoms underwent anorectal manometry to discard Hirschsprung’s disease. All patients had normal anorectal reflex. The time delay between stimulation of the rectal ampulla and the relaxation of the anal canal was studied. The average period of the pressure fluctuations was 5.44 ± 0.13s. The overall duration of the relaxation time was 9.71 ± 0.21s. The maximum lag between the onset of the stimulus and the relaxation of the IAS was 2.90 s, and was achieved when the stimulus was applied following a local maximum of the pressure wave. The existence of a refractory period during the suprathreshold depolarization of smooth muscle cells can explain the evidence of a temporal delay between the stimulus and the mechanical response. In occasions, relaxation appeared first distally. This phenomenon can be explained by the arrangement and morphology of bipolar cells, which may evidence the anisotropic propagation of the mechanical activity. These data may contribute to depict the alterations in excitability underlying the relaxation reflex by means of manometric recording of the anal canal.	24-hour clock;anal canal;anus;bipolar disorder;broadcast delay;comstock–needham system;digital single-lens reflex camera;excited state;ianal;infant, newborn;internal anal sphincter;internet authentication service;intestinal obstruction;linear programming relaxation;manometry;mathematical morphology;maxima and minima;myocytes, smooth muscle;onset (audio);patients;phenobarbital;propagation delay;rectal dosage form;reflex action;stmn1 gene;smooth muscle (tissue);software propagation;specimen type - meconium;structure of sphincter ani muscle;diagnostic procedure	Manuel Lopez-Alonso;Juan Ribas;Alejandro Barriga-Rivera	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513161	computer vision;reflex;refractory period;rectal ampulla;anal canal;artificial intelligence;internal anal sphincter;stimulus (physiology);anorectal manometry;depolarization;computer science;cardiology;internal medicine	Visualization	18.59487435406822	-82.77709885171332	68257
f6b60d6b8880ec95d905fa7d6c21002fbfb5da6d	multimodal vigilance estimation with adversarial domain adaptation networks		Robust vigilance estimation during driving is very crucial in preventing traffic accidents. Many approaches have been proposed for vigilance estimation. However, most of the approaches require collecting subject-specific labeled data for calibration which is high-cost for real-world applications. To solve this problem, domain adaptation methods can be used to align distributions of source subject features (source domain) and new subject features (target domain). By reusing existing data from other subjects, no labeled data of new subjects is required to train models. In this paper, our goal is to apply adversarial domain adaptation networks to cross-subject vigilance estimation. We adopt two kinds of recently proposed adversarial domain adaptation networks and compare their performance with those of several traditional domain adaptation methods and the baseline without domain adaptation. A publicly available dataset, SEED-VIG, is used to evaluate the methods. The dataset includes electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals, as well as the corresponding vigilance level annotations during simulated driving. Compared with the baseline, both adversarial domain adaptation networks achieve improvements over 10% in terms of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. In addition, both methods considerably outperform the traditional domain adaptation methods.	align (company);artificial neural network;baseline (configuration management);coefficient;domain adaptation;electroencephalography;electrooculography;moe;multimodal interaction	He Li;Wei-Long Zheng;Bao-Liang Lu	2018	2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489212	machine learning;labeled data;adversarial system;feature extraction;domain adaptation;electrooculography;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science;vigilance (psychology)	ML	14.852189549534696	-94.78372432230088	68355
2749865018827ecaf61bb160a89b8311c0ba551d	modulation of low-frequency pulsed magnetic field on hippocampal neural oscillation in depression rats		Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has been approved for some medication-resistant depression by the United States Food and Drug Administration. However, the majority of these studies have focused on the effects of high-frequency TMS, and little is known about low-frequency TMS in depression treatment. Furthermore, the potential electroneurophysiology mechanisms of TMS on the improvement of and function of the brain remain poorly understood. In the present study, a depression rat model was established by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Rats were exposed to low-frequency pulsed magnetic field (LFPMF) (1Hz, 20mT) for 14 days, one hour per day, then elevated plus-maze test was assessed and local field potentials (LFPs) in hippocampus were recorded. In order to analyze LFPs, sample entropy was calculated to make complexity analysis, while phase locked value and phase-amplitude coupling modulation index were used to figure out the correlation of oscillations. Our data showed that LFPMF significantly relieved CUS-induced depression-behaviors and improved the undesirable changes of the identical-frequency synchronization and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in CUS rats. These findings indicated that the antidepressive-like effects of LFPMF might be associated with the LFPMF-induced improvement in neural oscillation.	analysis of algorithms;antidepressive agents;behavior;ca1 field;ca3 field;deep brain stimulation;depressive disorder;hippocampus (brain);magnetic fields;magnetic resonance imaging;modulation;neural oscillation;sample entropy;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Ling Wang;Jiajia Yang;Ling Wang;Peng Zhou;Kun Wang;Dong Ming	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512192	neural oscillation;transcranial magnetic stimulation;neuroscience;hippocampus;electronic engineering;local field potential;hippocampal formation;computer science;low frequency;modulation index;sample entropy	SE	18.35020394850382	-81.18918517107639	68426

For autonomic nerves, this can be done by analysing the inflexions in the rising phases of the evoked junction potentials (EIPs) recorded from smooth muscle. Since these inflexions contain time-varying frequency information, we have applied recent methods of time-frequency analysis based upon wavelet transforms on ElPs to characterize autonomic neuronal function. We find that these methods allow accurate and convenient charaderization of individual release sites, and that their probability of release falls between 0.002 and 0.003. These results are compared with those reported earlier using analogue filtering techniques. The present method is advantageous as regards automation, accuracy and suppression of noise.	action potential;autonomic computing;frequency analysis;image noise;junction grammar;texture filtering;time–frequency analysis;wavelet transform;zero suppression	Priya J.

bc88bd5eb868fb83a6c8ceb3575b82919600cea9	how to reduce classification error in erp-based bci: maximum relative areas as a feature for p300 detection		Currently, one of the challenges in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies is the improvement real-time event-related potential (ERP) detection. Variability and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) impair detection methods. We hypothesized that if in a P300-based BCI we find the electrodes with the maximum relative voltage area (the “maximum relative” term refers to the area within each trial, but not between trials) where a P300 can be located, we will improve the performance of a classifier and reduce the number of trials necessary to achieve 100% success. We propose a method that calculates successively the maximum relative voltage areas in the P300 region of the EEG signal for each stimulus. In this way, differences between a target and a non-target stimulus are maximized. This method was tested with a linear classifier (LDA), known for its good performance and low computational cost. We observed that a single electrode with maximum relative voltage area in a P300 region can give more information than the traditional 4 electrode measurement. The preliminary results show that by detecting appropriate characteristics in the EEG signal, we can reduce the error by trial as well as the number of electrodes. The detection of the maximum relative voltage area in the EEG electrodes is a characteristic that can contribute to increase the SNR and decrease the prediction error with the smallest number of trials in the P300-based BCI systems. This type of methods that seek specific characteristics in the signals can also contribute to the management of the variability present in the BCI systems. This method can be used both for an online and offline analysis.	brain–computer interface;erp	Vinicio Changoluisa;Pablo Varona;Francisco B.

However, the identification methods of PNP from gait patterns were not sufficiently investigated from a technical perspective. In this study an automated classification method was developed to discriminate the neuropathic gait from both young healthy and old healthy gait using artificial neural network (ANN). A robust markerless gait detection system was employed and experiments were conducted in normal clinical conditions on 10 young, 10 old and 10 neuropathy patients. Four types of gait features, namely temporal features, kinematic joint trajectories in time domain, the Fourier transform of joint angles in frequency domain, and the symmetry indexes, were extracted. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed as a statistical analysis tool and feature selection method. Each type of features and the selected features obtained from ANOVA were served as the input of a two-layer-feed-forward neural network separately. A twofold cross validation method with enhanced generalization was utilized to evaluate the accuracy of classification. The ground truth information for the result validation was provided by the medical experts involved in the study. The outcome of individual feature set showed that the kinematic features in time domain reached the highest classification accuracies of 94.2%, 94.8% and 94.8% for three classes, while the symmetric features yielded the lowest. Combining two sets of features can improve the performance slightly and the best performance was achieved by using the selected significant features with accuracies of 96.2%, 97.0% and 96.9% respectively.	artificial neural network;cross-validation (statistics);design pattern;experiment;feature selection;feedforward neural network;ground truth;legacy plug and play	Xingchen Wang;Olena Kuzmicheva;Matthias Spranger;Axel Gräser	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings	10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145172	speech recognition;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	14.835686958416565	-90.5909274434596	68589

ECG parameters included Heart rate (HR), corrected QT interval (QTeC), PR interval, corrected RT interval (RTC) and corrected TpTe interval (TpTeC). Blood glucose levels were used to classify glycemic states in subjects as hypoglycemic state (≤ 60 mml/l, Hypo), as normoglycemic state (80 to 110 mmol/l, Normo), and as hyperglycemic state (150 mml/l, Hyper). The results indicated that hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic states produce significant inverse changes on those ECG parameters.	blood glucose;chomsky hierarchy;diabetes mellitus;heart failure;hyperactive behavior;hyperglycemia;hypoglycemic agents;labview;large;patients;qt interval feature (observable entity);right heart strain;station hypo;tpte gene;tachycardia, ventricular;millimole	LinhLan Nguyen;Steven Su;Hung T.

32d4cdf7f0186585497c8234c91c0dddd5d0751c	online guest detection in a smart home using pervasive sensors and probabilistic reasoning.		Smart home environments equipped with distributed sensor networks are capable of helping people by providing services related to health, emergency detection or daily routine management. A backbone to these systems relies often on the system’s ability to track and detect activities performed by the users in their home. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition in smart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the number of occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known. Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains a challenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which are based on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home are often very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of the situation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to infer useful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents a probabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in the environment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, an estimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensor network and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a Hidden Markov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related to the sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested and validated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration and demonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.

The aim of this study was to determine normal values of fetal left ventricular (LV) Tei Index (TI) for measuring systolic performance and K-Index (KI) for diastolic performance in early (<32 weeks), Mid (32–35 weeks) and late trimester (35–41 weeks) normal fetuses and fetuses with congenital heart diseases (CHD). Simultaneous recordings of Doppler Ultrasound Signal (DUS) of the LV outflow tracts and fetal electrocardiogram signals were obtained in 57 normal and 14 fetuses with CHD. CHDs were categorized in two types (conduction pathway abnormalities [8 cases] and structural anomalies [6 cases]). The LV isovolumic contraction time (ICT), isovolumic relaxation time (IRT), ventricular ejection time (VET) and ventricular filling time (VFT) were measured from amplitudes and peaks of high frequency component of DUS signals by an automated model. The TI and the new index were calculated by using the formula (ICT + IRT)/VET and (ICT + IRT)/VFT respectively. The TI did not show any significant change from CHD (conduction) to CHD (structural) fetuses (0.72± 0.09 vs 0.76±0.02; NS). On the other hand, KI showed significant decline in values (0.82±0.24 vs 0.49±0.34; p<0.05) during normal development period and CHD with structural anomalies particularly. The correlation of KI with gestational ages was found to be negative and significant (r=− 0.29; p=0.025). Both TI and KI can be easily obtained in the fetus from DUS recording without the need for precise anatomic imaging. In conclusion, KI may be a useful tool to explore the healthy development of fetal myocardial function and identify fetuses with CHD (structural). More research is needed to check if KI could recognize the compromised fetuses from normal ones in future.	2d doppler echocardiography;binary prefix;body mass index;categorization;choline dehydrogenase, mitochondrial;congenital abnormality;diastole;duane retraction syndrome;electrocardiography;fetal heart;fetal tissue;fetus;gene regulatory network;gestational age;heart diseases;heart valve disease;inverted index;isovolumic relaxation time;item response theory;linear programming relaxation;logical volume management;myocardium;premature ventricular contractions;pulse-doppler radar;ultrasonography;ventricular dysfunction, left	Ahsan H.

Synchronization of the data sources of information is achieved by synchronising the clocks of computers connected in a Local Area Network (LAN) by means of NTP. The added time-stamp is used to playback the data in a synchronised way. Although the proposed system is valid for any medical application in which data synchronisation is needed, it has been specifically used to capture, process, and analyse data generated by electromyographs, lumbar equipment, isotracks and video.

Source separation has often been suggested to solve this problem. In this paper, blind source separation (BSS), by means of singular value decomposition (SVD) and independent component analysis (ICA), was used for noise reduction in MCG data to improve the signal to noise ratio. Special techniques, based on statistical parameters, for identifying noise and disturbances, have been introduced to automatically eliminate noise-related and disturbance-related components before reconstructing cleaned data sets. The results show that ICA and SVD can detect and remove a variety of noise and artefact sources from MCG data, as well as from stress MCG.	blind signal separation;cleaning (activity);image noise;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetocardiography;morphologic artifacts;noise reduction;post-traumatic stress disorder;prelingual deafness-blindness;signal-to-noise ratio;singular value decomposition;source separation	D.

Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder which often goes undiagnosed and leads to serious problems like stroke, heart attacks etc. Conventional diagnosis of sleep apnea is done by continuous recording of physiological signals for 6 to 7 hrs during sleep and then manually marking the events. This process is expensive and not affordable to people in rural areas. In this work we show that detection of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be automated using machine learning techniques. We used heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory rate variability (RRV) parameters derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory effort signals (RES) respectively as input to the support vector machine (SVM) backend classifier. In a healthy person without apnea, there would be a rhythm in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This rhythm will change in patients with OSA, even when no sleep disorder related events are clinically visible. We use HRV and RRV features as indicators of this rhythm. Based on this, our automated system for OSA detection (ASOSAD) detects OSA without waiting for any events to happen. We used the signals in rapid eye movement (REM) state of the sleep, as the chances of occurrence of apneas are more due to complete loss of muscle tone in REM. The REM state was detected using the chin EMG signal. 80% classification accuracy was obtained for the baseline system developed with time domain (TD) and frequency domain (FD) features of HRV and RRV as input. We found 10% absolute improvement in performance while using only the TD HRV features for developing the system. By analyzing the individual TD HRV and TD RRV based systems we found a complementarity in decisions. Subsequently We combined the decisions of the two systems by fusing the scores at the output of each system with weight which is calculated empirically using calibration data. For the fused system we obtained a performance improvement of 10% compared the best individual system, resulting in no error in OSA detection in REM stage. We are also exploring the possibility of developing a sleep stage independent system and the results will be reported in due course of time.	autonomic computing;baseline (configuration management);bonjour sleep proxy;complementarity theory;electromyography;heart rate variability;item unique identification;machine learning;sleep mode;support vector machine;time series;wake-sleep algorithm	Anju Prabha;Akta Trivedi;A.

However, the volumetric quantification of pneumothoraces has not routinely been performed in clinics. In this paper, we introduced an automated computer-aided volumetry (CAV) scheme for quantification of volume of pneumothoraces in chest multi-detect CT (MDCT) images. Moreover, we investigated the impact of accurate volume of pneumothoraces in the improvement of the performance in decision-making regarding CTD in the management of traumatic pneumothoraces. For this purpose, an occurrence frequency map was calculated for quantitative analysis of the importance of each clinical parameter in the decision-making regarding CTD by a computer simulation of decision-making using a genetic algorithm (GA) and a support vector machine (SVM). A total of 14 clinical parameters, including volume of pneumothorax calculated by our CAV scheme, was collected as parameters available for decision-making. The results showed that volume was the dominant parameter in decision-making regarding CTD, with an occurrence frequency value of 1.00. The results also indicated that the inclusion of volume provided the best performance that was statistically significant compared to the other tests in which volume was excluded from the clinical parameters. This study provides the scientific evidence for the application of CAV scheme in MDCT volumetric quantification of pneumothoraces in the management of clinically stable chest trauma patients with traumatic pneumothorax.

1c6720bc139eb19724aa2e2c9ea57bf1bbb9ba71	single sensor techniques for sleep apnea diagnosis using deep learning		A large number of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cases are under-diagnosed due unavailability, inconvenience or expense of sleep labs. Hence, an automated detection by applying computational techniques to multivariate signals has already become a well-researched subject. However, the best-known techniques that use various features have not achieved the gold standard of polysomnography (PSG) tests. In this paper, we substantiate the medical conjecture that OSA directly impacts body parameters such as Instantaneous Heart Rate (IHR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). We then use a deep learning technique called LSTM-RNN (long short-term memory recurrent neural networks) to experimentally prove that OSA severity detection can be solely based on either IHR or SpO2 signals, which can be easily, obtained using off-the-shelf non-intrusive wearable single sensors. The results obtained from LSTM-RNN model shows an area under curve (AUC) of 0.98 associated with very high accuracy on a dataset of more than 16,000 apnea non-apnea minutes. These results have encouraged our collaborating doctors to further come up with a diagnostic protocol that is based on LSTM-RNN, SpO2, and IHR, thereby increasing the chances of larger adoption among medical community.	artificial neural network;computation;deep learning;experiment;long short-term memory;programmable sound generator;random neural network;recurrent neural network;sensor;sleep mode;unavailability;wake-sleep algorithm;wearable computer	Rahul Krishnan Pathinarupothi;J DharaPrathap;Ekanath Srihari Rangan;E.

f09000d99418e7d6f1864d736f6b2d5bd49e1dd9	learning datum-wise sampling frequency for energy-efficient human activity recognition		Continuous Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an important application of smart mobile/wearable systems for providing dynamic assistance to users. However, HAR in real-time requires continuous sampling of data using built-in sensors (e.g., accelerometer), which significantly increases the energy cost and shortens the operating span. Reducing sampling rate can save energy but causes low recognition accuracy. Therefore, choosing adaptive sampling frequency that balances accuracy and energy efficiency becomes a critical problem in HAR. In this paper, we formalize the problem as minimizing both classification error and energy cost by choosing dynamically appropriate sampling rates. We propose DatumWise Frequency Selection (DWFS) to solve the problem via a continuous state Markov Decision Process (MDP). A policy function is learned from the MDP, which selects the best frequency for sampling an incoming data entity by exploiting a datum related state of the system. We propose a method for alternative learning the parameters of an activity classification model and the MDP that improves both the accuracy and the energy efficiency. We evaluate DWFS with three real-world HAR datasets, and the results show that DWFS statistically outperforms the state-of-the-arts regarding a combined measurement of accuracy and energy efficiency.	activity recognition;adaptive sampling;bellman equation;emergence;geodetic datum;loss function;markov chain;markov decision process;optimization problem;real-time clock;real-time computing;reinforcement learning;sampling (signal processing);sensor;smart device;statistical classification;wearable computer	Weihao Cheng;Sarah M.

debf1419a5dc486e562a3dff6c20af91a854e099	wavelet coherence-based clustering of eeg signals to estimate the brain connectivity in absence epileptic patients		In this paper, the need of novel methods to extract diagnostic information from the Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of epileptic patients was addressed. A novel method, based on Wavelet Coherence (WC) between EEG signals and Hierarchical Clustering (HC), was proposed to estimate the EEG network connectivity density in Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE) patients. The EEG recordings of four patients affected by CAE were partitioned into non overlapping windows and WC was estimated window by window. The behaviour of WC was analysed over the time, for every couple of EEG electrodes. The ictal states (seizures) resulted associated to increased WC levels, thus reflecting an increased synchronization between electrodes during the seizure. A WC-based dissimilarity index was then defined and HC was fed with the dissimilarity indices between every pair of electrodes with the aim of finding possible correlations between changes in electrode clustering and changes in the brain state. For every window under analysis, a dendrogram was constructed, the corresponding set of electrode clusters was determined and the subsequent network density values were calculated. Seizures resulted typically associated to increased network density, reflecting an increased connectivity during the ictal states.	cluster analysis;dendrogram;electroencephalography;hierarchical clustering;microsoft windows;wavelet;writing commons	Cosimo Ieracitano;Jonas Duun-Henriksen;Nadia Mammone;Fabio La Foresta;Francesco Carlo Morabito	2017	2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966002	pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;wavelet;epilepsy;cluster analysis;electroencephalography;ictal;computer science;hierarchical clustering;childhood absence epilepsy;coherence (physics)	ML	20.892615789757667	-84.5016641475012	69425

Two affective EEG databases are presented in this paper. Two experiments are conducted to set up the databases. Audio and visual stimuli are used to evoke emotions during the experiments. The stimuli are selected from IADS and IAPS databases.14 subjects participated in each experiment. Emotiv EEG device is used for the data recording. The EEG data are rated by the participants with arousal, valence, and dominance levels. The correlation between powers of different EEG bands and the affective ratings is studied. The results agree with the literature findings and analyses of benchmark DEAP database that proves the reliability of the two databases. Similar brain patterns of emotions are obtained between the established databases and the benchmark database. A SVM-based emotion recognition algorithm is proposed and applied to both databases and the benchmark database. Use of a Fractal Dimension feature in combination with statistical and Higher Order Crossings (HOC) features gives us results with the best accuracy. Up to 8 emotions can be recognized. The accuracy is consistent between the established databases and the benchmark database.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);database;device independence;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;emotiv systems;experiment;fractal dimension	Yisi Liu;Olga Sourina	2013	2013 International Conference on Cyberworlds	10.1109/CW.2013.52	computer vision;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;affective computing	DB	13.827100271823625	-93.9202354062491	69452

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a minimally-invasive technology that has the requested temporal resolution to substitute BG references for such a scope, but still lacks of precision and accuracy. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that retrospectively reconstructs a reliable continuous-time BG profile for the aforementioned purposes, by simultaneously exploiting the high accuracy of (possibly sparse) BG references and the high temporal resolution of CGM data. The algorithm performs a constrained semiblind deconvolution in two steps: first, it estimates the unknown parameters of a model accounting for plasma-interstitum diffusion and sensor inaccurate calibration; then, it estimates BG performing a regularized deconvolution of CGM data, subject to the additional constraint that the reconstructed BG profile has to lay within the confidence interval of the available BG references. The algorithm was tested on 24 datasets collected in a 20 h clinical trial where CGM records and a median of 13 BG samples per day were available. Mean absolute relative deviation was reduced (from 15.71% to 8.84%) with respect to unprocessed CGM and so did the error in the evaluation of the outcomes metrics (e.g., halved the error in the time-in-hypo assessment). The reconstructed BG profile, in view of its improved accuracy and precision, is suitable for clinical trial assessment, modeling and other offline applications.	bibliographic reference;blood substitute;calibration;confidence intervals;curve fitting;deconvolution;estimated;hematological disease;job control (unix);online and offline;plasma active;request - action;sparse matrix;station hypo;algorithm;preprotein binding	Simone Del Favero;Andrea Facchinetti;Giovanni Sparacino;Claudio Cobelli	2014	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2013.2293531	econometrics;calibration;medicine;computer science;remote patient monitoring;biological engineering;statistics	Visualization	12.742268271906674	-86.18765811956479	69619

The motion of ankle joint would be limited with support taping for ankle inversion. In order to clarify the effects of the ankle taping and to examine characteristics of the taping, we had constructed a system to measure the distance between the metatarsus first head and the floor with 3D motion analysis system, and to measure the planter pressure patterns during the ankle inversion with pressure monitoring system. When the eight subjects were instructed to inverse their ankles as much as possible with and without taping, there was a difference in the distances between taping and no taping.

d99684a92b8d44e4423c8f870aa9abc74a17020b	transcriptomic characterization of mri contrast with focus on the t1-w/t2-w ratio in the cerebral cortex	cortex;gene expression;molecular neuroanatomy;myelin map;transcriptomics	Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain are of immense clinical and research utility. At the atomic and subatomic levels, the sources of MR signals are well understood. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the macromolecular correlates of MR signal contrast. To address this gap, we used genome-wide measurements to correlate gene expression with MR signal intensity across the cerebral cortex in the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We focused on the ratio of T1-weighted and T2-weighted intensities (T1-w/T2-w ratio image), which is considered to be a useful proxy for myelin content. As expected, we found enrichment of positive correlations between myelin-associated genes and the ratio image, supporting its use as a myelin marker. Genome-wide, there was an association with protein mass, with genes coding for heavier proteins expressed in regions with high T1-w/T2-w values. Oligodendrocyte gene markers were strongly correlated with the T1-w/T2-w ratio, but this was not driven by myelin-associated genes. Mitochondrial genes exhibit the strongest relationship, showing higher expression in regions with low T1-w/T2-w ratio. This may be due to the pH gradient in mitochondria as genes up-regulated by pH in the brain were also highly correlated with the ratio. While we corroborate associations with myelin and synaptic plasticity, differences in the T1-w/T2-w ratio across the cortex are more strongly linked to molecule size, oligodendrocyte markers, mitochondria, and pH. We evaluate correlations between AHBA transcriptomic measurements and a group averaged T1-w/T2-w ratio image, showing agreement with in-sample results. Expanding our analysis to the whole brain results in strong positive T1-w/T2-w correlations for immune system, inflammatory disease, and microglia marker genes. Genes with negative correlations were enriched for neuron markers and synaptic plasticity genes. Lastly, our findings are similar when performed on T1-w or inverted T2-w intensities alone. These results provide a molecular characterization of MR contrast that will aid interpretation of future MR studies of the brain.	advance directive - proxy;allen brain atlas;axon;cerebral cortex;cervical atlas;cortical implant;diameter (qualifier value);gene expression;gene ontology term enrichment;glycolysis;gradient;immune system;inverted index;item unique identification;marker interface pattern;mental association;microglia;myelin;neuron;neuronal plasticity;oligodendroglia;resonance;subatomic particle;synaptic package manager;transcription (software);x-ray computed tomography;delta ph;inflammatory disease	Jacob Ritchie;Spiro P.

Beamformers are well-established source-localization tools for MEG/EEG signals, being employed in source connectivity studies both in time and frequency domain. However, it has been demonstrated that beamformers suffer from a localization bias due to correlation between source time courses. This phenomenon has been ascertained by means of theoretical proofs and simulations. Nonetheless, the impact of correlated sources on localization outputs with real data has been disputed for a long time. In this paper, by means of a phantom, we address the correlation issue in a realistic MEG environment. Localization performances in the presence of simultaneously active sources are studied as a function of correlation degree and distance between sources. A linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer is applied to the oscillating signals generated by the current dipoles within the phantom. Results show that high correlation affects mostly dipoles placed at small distances (1, 5 centimeters). In this case the sources merge. If the dipoles lie 3 centimeters apart, the beamformer localization detects attenuated power amplitudes and blurred sources as the correlation level raises.	beamforming;distance;electroencephalography;imaging phantom;interaction;linear iga bullous dermatosis;lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus;magnetoencephalography;performance;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;resting state fmri;sample variance;simulation;centimeter	Paolo Belardinelli;Erick Ortiz;Christoph Braun	2012		10.1155/2012/190513	neuroscience;speech recognition;electroencephalography;mathematics;communication;magnetoencephalography	Metrics	22.077471528620965	-83.29959570187141	69936
3f75ef4a8df77f1c5e167c07548d47ca86de0e23	application of cluster analysis for determination of the oxidative stress decompensation criteria		This case-control study was conducted on 73 male patients with combined thoracic injuries. The main goal of the current study was to investigate oxidative damage of proteins and lipids in patients with the severe combined thoracic trauma on the first days after injury. The second aim was to evaluate the possibility of outcome prediction through oxidative stress markers determination. Concentrations of malonic dialdehyde and proteins carbonyl groups were determined according to spectrophotometric methods. As there were no differences between survival and nonsurvival groups of patients for oxidative stress markers, cluster analysis was performed for stratification of patients’ population by both oxidative stress markers simultaneously. It was found that oxidative stress develops from 1-2-nd day after the severe combined thoracic trauma and generally its level can be reliably estimated through determination of relative concentrations of both malonic dialdehyde and proteins carbonyl groups. The degree of oxidative stress is proportional to the severity of injury and patients’ state on admission (traumatic shock) and does not depends on patients’ age and concomitant alcohol exposure. Also its progression is not linear as the result of severe drop of the oxidative stress markers` concentration in premorbid phase of wound dystrophy. Cluster analysis is useful tool for analyzing medical and biological data from investigations when synergistic multifactorial relations are present between pathophysiological processes that are determined by interactions with compensatory and adaptive mechanisms directed at homeostasis saving during critical states.	chest;cluster analysis;color gradient;ethanol;forecast of outcome;homeostasis;inosine dialdehyde;interaction;malonic acidemia:imp:pt:bld.dot:nom;oxidative stress;patients;post-traumatic stress disorder;shock, traumatic;stratification;synergy;thoracic injuries;thoracic outlet syndrome;dystrophy	Myroslav Stupnytskyi;Viktor Zhukov;Oleksii Biletskii;Michal Greguš	2018				NLP	16.122655721759607	-82.55013698676643	69946

749ea506e7ada5c81fc0f18addce9b250b6a1574	gamified 3d orthopaedic rehabilitation using low cost and portable inertial sensors		This work introduces an innovative gamified 3D rehabilitation application intended for patients that have undergone Total Knee Replacement surgery, in collaboration with the General Hospital in Chania, Crete, Greece. The application uses a single custom-made, light, portable and low-cost sensor node consisting of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached on a lower limb in order to capture its orientation in space in real-time, while the patient is completing a physiotherapy protocol. The aim is to increase patient engagement during physiotherapy by motivating the user to participate in a serious game. The proposed sensor node attached on the lower limb drives a graphical image of the patient's limb motion as part of a 3D computer graphics scene displayed on a tablet or phone. It then classifies the exercise performed during physiotherapy as accurately performed or not and increases patient compliance via a reward system. Our goal is to reduce the need for the physical presence of a physiotherapist by aiding the efficient performance of exercise at any location, e.g. indoors and outdoors by just utilizing a light sensor and an Android device. A novel algorithm is proposed that automatically classifies an exercise in real-time. It is shown that patient engagement is enhanced when dynamically connected with a gamified app.	3d computer graphics;algorithm;android;gamification;graphical user interface;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;sensor node;tablet computer	Gregory Kontadakis;Dimitrios Chasiouras;Despeina Proimaki;Katerina Mania	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Virtual Worlds and Games for Serious Applications (VS-Games)	10.1109/VS-GAMES.2017.8056590	android (operating system);inertial measurement unit;sensor node;3d computer graphics;rehabilitation;embedded system;virtual rehabilitation;engineering	Visualization	5.864288249527188	-89.52571985288753	70085

6782a5f0c88a1c39c0ef75ec308faf9f795b415d	grammar-based, posture- and context-cognitive detection for falls with different activity levels	context information;body sensor networks;information extraction;fall detection;context free grammar;personal monitoring;false positive;high sensitivity;body sensor network	Falls are dangerous for the aged population as they result in serious detrimental consequences. Therefore, many fall detection methods have been proposed. Most of these methods characterize falls by large accelerations and fast body orientation changes. However, certain activities like sitting down quickly, vigorous gaits, and jumping, also show these characteristics, and thus are hard to distinguish from real falls. Moreover, many falls in the elderly are slow falls which show lower activity levels. Existing work fails to detect slow falls effectively because they only identify falls with high activity levels.  In this paper, we present a grammar-based fall detection framework which not only better distinguishes fall-like activities from real falls, but also emphasizes the detection of slow falls. We utilize posture information extracted from on-body sensors and context information collected from sensors deployed in the house to reduce false positives. A fall in our framework is detected as a sequence of sensor events. We provide a context-free grammar to define these sequences so that the framework can be easily extended to detect more kinds of falls. Our case study shows that our method can distinguish various fall-like activities from real falls and can also effectively detect both fast falls and slow falls. The integration evaluation shows that our method achieves both high sensitivity and high specificity.	context-free grammar;context-free language;poor posture;sensitivity and specificity;sensor	Qiang Li;John A.

5bf996c02f8d015b758862979171f297cbd816e2	quantitative measurement of parkinsonian gait from walking in monocular image sequences using a centroid tracking algorithm	centroid tracking algorithm cta;parkinson s disease pd;gait analysis	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that results from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Abnormal gait begins in the early stage and becomes severe as the disease progresses; therefore, the assessment of gait becomes an important issue in evaluating the progression of PD and the effectiveness of treatment. To provide a clinically useful gait assessment in environments with budget and space limitations, such as a small clinic or home, we propose and develop a portable method utilizing the monocular image sequences of walking to track and analyze a Parkinsonian gait pattern. In addition, a centroid tracking algorithm is developed and used here to enhance the method of quantifying kinematic gait parameters of PD in different states. Twelve healthy subjects and twelve mild patients with PD participate in this study. This method requires one digital video camera and subjects with two joint markers attached on the fibula head and the lateral malleolus of the leg. All subjects walk with a natural pace in front of a video camera during the trials. Results of our study demonstrate the stride length and walking velocity significantly decrease in PD without drug compared to PD with drug in both proposed method and simultaneous gait assessment performed by GAITRite® system. In gait initiation, step length and swing velocity also decrease in PD without drug compared to both PD with drug and controls. Our results showed high correlation in gait parameters between the two methods and prove the reliability of the proposed method. With the proposed method, quantitative measurement and analysis of Parkinsonian gait could be inexpensive to implement, portable within a small clinic or home, easy to administer, and simple to interpret. Although this study is assessed Parkinsonian gait, the proposed method has the potential to help clinicians and researchers assess the gait of patients with other neuromuscular diseases, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke patients.	brain injuries;cns disorder;cerebrovascular accident;cognitive function: initiation;color gradient;digital video;dopamine hydrochloride;dopaminergic neurons;gait disorders, neurologic;gait analysis;head of fibula structure;lateral thinking;limited stage (cancer stage);motor neuron disease;neurodegenerative disorders;neuromuscular diseases;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;steady state;substantia nigra structure;traumatic brain injury;velocity (software development);algorithm	Sheng-Huang Lin;Shih-Wei Chen;Yu-Chun Lo;Hsin-Yi Lai;Chich-Haung Yang;Shin-Yuan Chen;Yuan-Jen Chang;Chin-Hsing Chen;Wen-Tzeng Huang;Fu-Shan Jaw;You-Yin Chen;Siny Tsang;Lun-De Liao	2015	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-015-1335-2	psychology;simulation;gait analysis;medicine;physical therapy;surgery	AI	13.170900078769396	-83.51422130926728	70316

This review describes the evolution of multi-echo acquisition from high-speed MRSI to multi-echo EPI and beyond. It highlights milestones in the development of multi-echo acquisition methods, such as the discovery of considerable gains in fMRI sensitivity when combining echo images, advances in quantification of the BOLD effect using analytical biophysical modeling and interleaved multi-region shimming. The review conveys the insight gained from combining fMRI and MRSI methods and concludes with recent trends in ultra-fast fMRI, which will significantly increase temporal resolution of multi-echo acquisition.	acclimatization;gain;linear programming relaxation;magnetic resonance imaging;numerous;quantitation;shims;fmri;magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging	Stefan Posse	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.057	psychology;radiology;medicine;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging;nuclear medicine;brain mapping;medical physics	ML	21.996791482279672	-80.47285013731126	70371

There are substantial shortcomings of this approach, specifically spotting performance is hampered when patterns or sensor noise level changes. In this work an unsupervised sensitivity adaptation mechanism is proposed for activity event spotting based on expected activity event rates. The expected event rate for activity spotting was derived from the generalisation metric used in information retrieval. To illustrate generalisation effects and depict relations of spotting performance and event rate, different event rates were simulated and their precision-recall spotting performance analysed. Subsequently, the sensitivity adaptation concept is presented and evaluated. For this purpose two large datasets from personal healthcare applications were considered to explore benefits and limitations of this adaptation approach: recognition of drinking motions from inertial sensors and chewing strokes from sound. Results showed up to 28% spotting performance increase for event rate adapted operation, confirming performance benefits for sensitivity adaptation. The approach will be most applicable in situations, where estimated event rate statistics show low variance and long monitoring durations allow effective sensitivity adaptations.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive system;control system;event (computing);event-driven architecture;image noise;information retrieval;instability;noise (electronics);pattern language;sensor	Oliver Amft	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Sensor Networks, Ubiquitous, and Trustworthy Computing	10.1109/SUTC.2010.63	adaptive filter;algorithm design;speech recognition;wearable computer;sensitivity;computer science;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;machine learning;pattern recognition;feedback;ubiquitous computing;hidden markov model	Mobile	1.315044623734454	-84.95264372137953	70405

Beyond these core symptoms, additional problems such as absence of gender differences identification, interactional distortions of environmental and family responses are often present. Taking into account these emotional and behavioral problems researchers and clinicians are focusing on the design of innovative therapeutic approaches aimed to improve social capabilities of subjects with ASD. Thanks to the technological and scientific progresses of the last years, nowadays it is possible to create human-like robots with social and emotional capabilities. Furthermore it is also possible to analyze physiological signals inferring subjects' psycho-physiological state which can be compared with a behavioral analysis in order to obtain a deeper understanding of subjects reactions to treatments. In this work a preliminary evaluation of an innovative social robot-based treatment for subjects with ASD is described. The treatment consists in a complex stimulation and acquisition platform composed of a social robot, a multi-parametric acquisition system and a therapeutic protocol. During the preliminary tests of the treatment the subject's physiological signals and behavioral parameters have been recorded and used together with the therapists' annotations to infer the subjects' induced reactions. Physiological signals were analyzed and statistically evaluated demonstrating the possibility to correctly discern the two groups (ASD and normally developing subjects) with a classification percentage higher than 92%. Statistical analysis also highlighted the treatment capability to induce different affective states in subjects with ASDs more than in control subjects, demonstrating that the treatment is well designed and tuned on ASDs deficits and behavioral lacks.

In the present study, a novel QRS complex detection approach based on differential threshold method was proposed, which was designed as three analysis steps of an improved differential processor, a detector of the R wave, and a detector of the Q and S waves. The QRS complex detection performance of the proposed algorithm was further evaluated with clinical ECG records in patients coming from the widely recognized Massachusetts Institute of Technology Database (MIT-BIH DB). As a result, 67,167 beats were correctly determined with the proposed approach from a total of 67,197 QRS beats (30 ECG records in variant rhythms, 30 minutes for each), while the numbers of false positives and false negatives were 251 and 208, respectively. The summarized sensitivity and positive predictivity of the proposed method were obtained as 99.69% and 99.63%, respectively. Meanwhile, the computing time of the proposed algorithm for a ECG record of 30 min is only 1.40 seconds, which shows a distinct advantage on computation requirement compared with previous works. In conclusion, the proposed straightforward algorithm for QRS complex detection would potentially be implemented easily for portable monitoring applications with both a better performance and a lower computation requirement.	algorithm;binaural beats;bounding interval hierarchy;computation;maxima and minima;real-time clock	Dakun Lai;Fei Zhang;Cong Wang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251844	electronic engineering;speech recognition;computer science;algorithm	EDA	16.351383148003308	-88.02475558516677	70573

There is a growing interest in applying diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to the evaluation of spinal cord microarchitecture. The current study sought to compare the organization of longitudinal nerve fibers between healthy and myelopathic spinal cords using entropy-based analysis of principal eigenvector mapping. A total of 22 subjects were recruited, including 14 healthy subjects, seven cervical myelopathy (CM) patients with single-level compression, and one patient suffering from multi-level compression. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord were obtained using a pulsed gradient, spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with a 3T MR system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually to cover the spinal cord, and Shannon entropy was calculated in principal eigenvector maps. The results revealed no significant differences in orientation entropy values along the whole length of cervical spinal cord in healthy subjects (C2-3: 0.73±0.05; C3-4: 0.71±0.07; C4-5: 0.72±0.048; C5-6: 0.71±0.07; C6-7: 0.72±0.07). In contrast, orientation entropy values in myelopathic cord were significantly higher at the compression site (0.91±0.03), and the adjacent levels (above: 0.85±0.03; below: 0.83±0.05). This study provides a novel approach to analyze the orientation information in diffusion MR images of healthy and diseased spinal cord. These results indicate that orientation entropy can be applied to determine the contribution of each compression level to the overall disorganization of principal nerve tracts of myelopathic spinal cord in cases with multi-level compression.	cervical myelopathy;cervical segment of spinal cord;compression;diffusion tensor imaging;echo-planar imaging;entropy (information theory);gradient;map;microarchitecture;multi-level cell;neck;nerve fibers;numerous;patients;peripheral nerves;region of interest;resonance;shannon (unit);spin echo;spinal cord diseases	Jiao-Long Cui;Chun-Yi Wen;Yong Hu;Kin-Cheung Mak;Ka-Hung Henry Mak;Keith D.

This paper presents a characterization of knee motion patterns from Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals, measured in the Erector spinae (ES) muscle. Feature extraction (mean absolute value, waveform length and auto-regressive model) and pattern classification methods (Linear Discrimination Analysis, K-Nearest Neighborhood and Support Vector Machine) are applied for recognition of eight-movement classes. Additionally, several channels setup are analyzed to obtain a suitable electrodes array. The results were evaluated based on signals measured from lower limb using quantitative metric such as error rate, sensitivity, specificity and predictive positive value. A high accuracy (> 95%) was obtained, which suggest that it is possible to detect the knee motion intention from ES muscle, as well as to reduce the electrode number (from 2 to 3 channels) to obtain an optimal electrodes array. This implementation can be applied for myoelectric control of lower limb active exoskeletons.	amiga walker;array data structure;assistive technology;class;electroencephalography;feature extraction;feature vector;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;limb structure;linear discriminant analysis;lower extremity;mathematical optimization;muscle weakness;muscular dystrophy, duchenne;online and offline;orthotic devices;preparation;robot kit;sensitivity and specificity;skeletal muscle structure of trunk;stage level 1;statistical classification;structure of erector spinae muscle;support vector machine;surface electromyography;walkers;waveform;word error rate;electrode;exoskeleton;nervous system disorder;sensor (device)	Alberto López Delis;Denis Delisle Rodríguez;Ana Cecilia Villa-Parra;Teodiano Freire Bastos Filho	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318925	engineering;physical therapy;anatomy;surgery	Robotics	14.456133186011822	-90.50234388989362	70743

The extraction of MUAP templates is carried out using a symbolic representation of waveforms, a common technique in signature verification applications. The assignment of MUAPs to their specific trains is achieved by means of repeated template matching passes using pseudocorrelation, a new matched-filter-based similarity measure. Identified MUAPs are peeled off and the residual signal is analyzed using shortened templates to facilitate the resolution of superimpositions. The program was tested with simulated data and with experimental signals obtained using fine-wire electrodes in the biceps brachii during isometric contractions ranging from 5% to 30% of the maximum voluntary contraction. Analyzed signals were made of up to 14MUAP trains. Most templates were extracted automatically, but complex signals sometimes required the adjustment of 2 parameters to account for all the MUAP trains present. Classification accuracy rates for simulations ranged from an average of 96.3% plusmn 0.9%(4 trains) to 75.6% plusmn 11.0%(12 trains). The classification portion of the program never required user intervention.

79e75e27aa0221ccd70c0497cc01a4831b0255aa	voluntary phantom hand and finger movements in transhumerai amputees could be used to naturally control polydigital prostheses		An arm amputation is extremely invalidating since many of our daily tasks require bi-manual and precise control of hand movements. Perfect hand prostheses should therefore offer a natural, intuitive and cognitively simple control over their numerous biomimetic active degrees of freedom. While efficient polydigital prostheses are commercially available, their control remains complex to master and offers limited possibilities, especially for high amputation levels. In this pilot study, we demonstrate the possibility for upper-arm amputees to intuitively control a polydigital hand prosthesis by using surface myoelectric activities of residual limb muscles (sEMG) associated with phantom limb movements, even if these residual arm muscles on which the phantom activity is measured were not naturally associated with hand movements before amputation. Using pattern recognition methods, three arm amputees were able, without training, to initiate 5–8 movements of a robotic hand (including individual finger movements) by simply mobilizing their phantom limb while the robotic hand was mimicking the action in real time. This innovative control approach could offer to numerous upper-limb amputees an access to recent biomimetic prostheses with multiple controllable joints, without requiring surgery or complex training; and might deeply change the way the phantom limb is apprehended by both patients and clinicians.	amputation;amputees;biomimetics;finger injuries;imaging phantom;neuroprosthetics;patients;pattern recognition;phantom limb syndrome;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;prosthesis implantation;robot;sema5b gene;limb movement	Nathanaël Jarrassé;Caroline Nicol;Florian Richer;Amélie Touillet;Noël Martinet;Jean Paysant;Jozina B.

Much of the development work to-date has used high-field 4 T MRI and specialized pulse sequences. In the current study, we utilized conventional 3 T MRI and a commonly applied gradient-echo-planar imaging sequence to evaluate white matter (WM) fMRI sensitivity within a common framework. Functional WM activity was replicated in target regions of interest within the corpus callosum, at the group and individual levels. As expected there was a reduction in overall WM activation sensitivity. Individual analyses revealed that 8 of the 13 individuals showed white matter activation, showing a lower percentage of individuals with WM activation detected. Importantly, WM activation results were sensitive to analyses that applied alternate hemodynamic response functions, with an increase in the group level cluster when hemodynamic response function (HRF) onset slope was reduced. The findings supported the growing evidence that WM activation is detectable, with activation levels are closer to thresholds used for routine 3T MRI studies. Optimization factors, such as the HRF model, appear to be important to further enhance the characterization of WM activity in fMRI.	3 tesla magnetic resonance imaging;body of uterus;corpus callosum;echo-planar imaging;frequency response;gradient;hemodynamics;onset (audio);region of interest;sensor;tesla - unit;white matter;fmri	Matthew J.

The scheme described within uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to process four channels of myoelectric signal, with the task of discriminating six classes of limb movement. The HMM-based approach is shown to be capable of higher classification accuracy than previous methods based upon multilayer perceptrons. The method does not require segmentation of the myoelectric signal data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. The computational complexity of the HMM in its operational mode is low, making it suitable for a real-time implementation. The low computational overhead associated with training the HMM also enables the possibility of adaptive classifier training while in use.	adaptive grammar;articular system;class;computational complexity theory;embedded system;embedding;hidden markov model;interface device component;interrupt;limb structure;markov chain;movement disorders;multi-function printer;multilayer perceptron;muscle;overhead (computing);power (psychology);prosthesis;real-time clock;response time (technology);upper extremity	Adrian D.

However, due to the large number of parameters associated with the neural expression of emotion, there is still a lot of unknowns on the specific spatial and spectral correlation of the EEG signal and the affective states expression. To investigate on such correlation, two types of semi-supervised deep learning approaches, stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and deep belief networks (DBN), were applied as application specific feature extractors for the affective states classification problem using EEG signals. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed semi-supervised approaches, a subject-specific affective states classification experiment were carried out on the DEAP database to classify 2-dimensional affect states. The DBN based model achieved averaged F1 scores of 86.67%, 86.60% and 86.69% for arousal, valence and liking states classification respectively, which has significantly improved the state-of-art classification performance. By examining the weight vectors at each layer, we were also able to gain insights on the spatial or spectral locations of the most discriminating features. Another main advantage of applying the semi-supervised learning methods is that only a small fraction of labeled data, e.g., 1/6 of the training samples, were used in this study.	algorithm;artificial neural network;autoencoder;bayesian network;deep belief network;deep learning;electroencephalography;feature extraction;human–computer interaction;noise reduction;personalization;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;supervised learning	Haiyan Xu;Konstantinos N.

An enhanced version of a tongue-operated robotic rehabilitation system is presented for accelerating the rate of improvement in the upper extremity motor functions for patients with severe hemiparesis following stroke. A new rehabilitation robot, called Hand Mentor ProTM (HM), was utilized by reading its pressure and joint angle sensors, combined with control commands from the Tongue Drive System (TDS) to enable both isometric and isotonic target-tracking tasks in a coordinated tongue-hand rehabilitation paradigm. Preliminary results in 3 healthy subjects who performed a sinusoidal target tracking task demonstrated the TDS-HM system functionality in hand-operated isometric, hand-operated isotonic, tongue-operated isotonic discrete control and tongue-operated isotonic proportional control modes with average normalized root-mean-square errors of 0.058±0.023, 0.043±0.011, 0.184±0.087, and 0.148±0.075, respectively.	isometric projection;isotonic regression;programming paradigm;rehabilitation robotics;robot;sensor	Z.

a8c487e18e3fbe88fcc54fd6f8223bcfe1200d38	feature subset selection and classification of intracardiac electrograms during atrial fibrillation		Abstract Several approaches have been adopted for the identification of arrhythmogenic sources maintaining atrial fibrillation (AF). In this paper, we propose a classifier that discriminates between four classes of atrial electrogram (EGM). We delved into the relation between levels of fractionation in EGM signals and the fibrillation substrates in simulated episodes of chronic AF. Several feature extraction methods were used to calculate 92 features from 429 real EGM records acquired during radiofrequency ablation of chronic AF. We selected the optimal subset of features by using a genetic algorithm, followed by K -nearest neighbors (K-NN) classification into four levels of fractionation. Sensitivity of 0.90 and specificity of 0.97 were achieved. Subsequently, the results of the classification were extrapolated to signals of a 3D human atria model and a 2D model of atrial tissue. The 3D model simulated an episode of AF maintained by a rotor in the posterior wall of the left atrium and the 2D model simulated an AF episode with one stable rotor. We used the K-NN classifier trained on a given set of real EGM signals to detect a specific class of signals presenting the highest level of fractionation located near the rotoru0027s vortex. This method needs to be tested on real clinical data to provide evidence that it can support ablation therapy procedures.		S. I.

828e03e396cd774b79199faed660b6bb0742bedd	automated eeg-based epileptic seizure detection using deep neural networks		Millions of people around the world suffer from epilepsy. It is very important to provide a method to efficiently monitor the seizures and alert the caregivers to help patients. It is proven that EEG signals are the best markers for diagnosis of the epileptic seizures. In this paper, we used the frequency domain features (normalized in-band power spectral density) to extract information from EEG signals. We applied a deep learning technique based on multilayer perceptrons to improve the accuracy of seizure detection. The results indicate that our nonlinear technique is able to efficiently and automatically detect seizure and non-seizure episodes with an F-measure accuracy of around 95%.	artificial neural network;deep learning;electroencephalography;f1 score;frequency band;multilayer perceptron;nonlinear system;spectral density	Javad Birjandtalab;Mehrdad Heydarzadeh;Mehrdad Nourani	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)	10.1109/ICHI.2017.55	perceptron;frequency domain;epileptic seizure;artificial neural network;feature extraction;electroencephalography;epilepsy;deep learning;machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	16.959301317449203	-89.79214469085696	71597

However, it has been shown that, through good management of blood glucose levels (BGLs), the associated and costly complications can be reduced significantly. In this pilot study, Elman recurrent artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to make BGL predictions based on a history of BGLs, meal intake, and insulin injections. Twenty-eight datasets (from a single case scenario) were compiled from the freeware mathematical diabetes simulator, AIDA. It was found that the most accurate predictions were made during the nocturnal period of the 24 hour daily cycle. The accuracy of the nocturnal predictions was measured as the root mean square error over five test days (RMSE5 day) not used during ANN training. For BGL predictions of up to 1 hour a RMSE5 day of (±SD) 0.15± 0.04 mmol/L was observed. For BGL predictions up to 10 hours, a RMSE5 day of (±SD) 0.14± 0.16 mmol/L was observed. Future research will investigate a wider range of AIDA case scenarios, real-patient data, and data relating to other factors influencing BGLs. ANN paradigms based on real-time recurrent learning will also be explored to accommodate dynamic physiology in diabetes.	24-hour clock;artificial neural network;blood substitute;compiler;global serializability;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;mean squared error;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;recurrent neural network;simulation	Gavin Robertson;Eldon D.

Increasingly, susceptibility-based contrast is being exploited to investigate brain tissue microstructure and to detect abnormal levels of brain iron as these have been implicated in a variety of neuro-degenerative diseases. However, it remains unclear to what extent magnetic susceptibility-related contrast at high field relates to actual brain iron concentrations. In this study, we performed susceptibility weighted imaging as a function of field strength on healthy brains in vivo and post-mortem brain tissues at 1.5 T, 3 T and 7 T. Iron histology was performed on the tissue samples for comparison. The calculated susceptibility-related parameters R(2)(*) and signal frequency shift in four iron-rich regions (putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, and thalamus) showed an almost linear dependence (r>or=0.90 for R(2)(*); r>or=0.83 for phase, p<0.01) on field strength, suggesting that potential ferritin saturation effects are not relevant to susceptibility-weighted contrast for field strengths up to 7 T. The R(2)(*) dependence on the putative (literature-based) iron concentration was 0.048 Hz/T/ppm. The histological data from brain samples confirmed the linear dependence of R(2)(*) on field strength and showed a slope against iron concentration of 0.0099 Hz/T/ppm dry-weight, which is equivalent to 0.05 Hz/T/ppm wet-weight and closely matched the calculated value in vivo. These results confirm the validity of using susceptibility-weighted contrast as an indicator of iron content in iron-rich brain regions. The absence of saturation effects opens the way to exploit the benefits of MRI at high field strengths for the detection of iron distributions with high sensitivity and resolution.	abnormal degeneration;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;brain;ferritin;globus pallidus;hertz (hz);neurodegenerative disorders;resonance;sarcoma;signal frequency;thalamic structure;tissue sample;video-in video-out;benefit;part per million (ppm)	Bing Yao;Tie-Qiang Li;Peter van Gelderen;Karin Shmueli;Jacco A. de Zwart;Jeff H.

The system is fully integrated, transparently combining the collection, processing, and presentation of real time data sources, including all physiological monitoring functions, with non real time functions and extensive online database information. Workstations are mounted in instrumentation racks and configured with appropriate electronics to support various data acquisition tasks including electroencephalograms (EEGs), electromyograms (EMGs), and multimodality evoked potentials. Multiple racks can be used in parallel on the same case if the number of variables to be monitored exceeds the capacity of a single tack.

The simulator incorporates five contact pressure sensors located in key anatomical landmarks. Two 32-state fully connected MMs are used, one for each skill level. Each state corresponds to a unique five-dimensional signature of contact pressures. Statistical distances measured between models representing subjects with different skill levels are sensitive enough to provide an objective measure of medical skill level. The method was tested with 41 expert subjects and 41 novice subjects in addition to the 30 subjects used for training the MM. Of the 82 subjects, 76 (92%) were classified correctly.

The features are classified using cost-sensitive support vector machines by the double cross-validation methodology. The proposed algorithm has been applied to ECoG recordings of 18 patients in the Freiburg EEG database, totaling 80 seizures and 437-hour-long interictal recordings.

The system simultaneously generates multiple amplitude-modulated and/or frequency-modulated auditory stimuli, acquires electrophysiological responses to these stimuli, displays these responses in the frequency-domain, and determines whether or not the responses are significantly larger than background electroencephalographic activity. The operator can print out the results, store the data on disk for more extensive analysis by other programs, review stored data, and combine results. The system design follows clear principles concerning the generation of acoustic signals, the acquisition of artifact-free data, the analysis of electrophysiological responses in the frequency-domain, and the objective detection of signals in noise. The instrument uses a popular programming language (LabVIEW) and a commercial data acquisition board (AT-MIO-16E-10), both of which are available from National Instruments.		M. S. John;T. W.

So far the touchscreen and the accelerometer are commonly used to infer finger tap events. However, the touchscreen consumes a significant amount of power and is not always accessible (i.e., when the device is used as a running assistant). The accelerometer can be power efficient but can’t differentiate well between a variety of contexts and positions. To address these limitations, we present TouchSpeaker, a novel technique for finger tap detection on mobile devices using the built-in speakers as primary sensors. We show that a combination of the speakers with other built-in sensors can distinguish between 9 different tap events with an accuracy of 98.3%, outperforming the state of the art. In addition, a robust version is implemented resulting in a false positive rate below 1%. For power constrained devices, we propose a configuration consisting of only the speakers and the accelerometer, achieving an accuracy of 95.2%.

According to statistics, the disease prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more than 3% of the total population and even up to 25% for 40-aged men. More and more clinical evidences showed that obstructive sleep apnea is highly associated with hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, nocturnal enuresis, and even depression. If we can detect the potential OSA patients early, and offering them appropriate treatments, it is worth not only promoting the quality of patient's life, but also reducing the possible serious complications and medical costs. Mobile phones are now playing an ever more crucial role in people's daily lives. The latest generation of smart phones is increasingly viewed as handheld computers rather than as phones, due to their powerful on-board computing capability, capacious memories, large screens and open operating systems that encourage applications (Apps) development. In this study, an intelligent """"OSA prediction App"""" on Android Smart phone has been developed based on medical decision rules from a clinical large dataset. The proposed application can provide an easy and efficient way to quickly pre-screen high-risk groups of OSA potential patients, aid medical works to achieve early diagnosis and treatment purposes, prevent the occurrence of complications, and thus reach the goal of preventive medicine."""	android;computer;data mining;decision tree;download;external bus interface 2;mobile device;mobile phone;on-board data handling;operating system;programming paradigm;sleep (system call);sleep mode;smartphone;ubiquitous computing;zx interface 1	Ming-Hseng Tseng;Hsueh-Chen Hsu;Che-Chia Chang;Hua Ting;Hui-Ching Wu;Ping-Hung Tang	2012	2012 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 9th International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing	10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.89	simulation;decision theory;computer science;decision tree;circulatory system;decision rule;sleep;mobile computing;statistics	Mobile	6.408477454234382	-87.69813911595769	73325

Some of the abnormal conditions of heart could be detected by the heart sound. For example, heart murmur is one of the conditions possibly resulting from the illness of heart valves. In this work, we propose a new template family used in the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to assess the degree of normality of the heart sound. Not only the rating of normality is generated but also an intuitive visual feedback with abnormal interval highlighted is outputted. In this way, the condition like heart murmur is well-identified by inspecting the matching residue. Comparison with previous work which adopts different template family is also given. Experiment results indicate that the proposed family is more effective to matching the normal heart sound to achieve better assessing result.	area striata structure;clinical use template;cloud computing;elegant degradation;equilibrium;experiment;heart sounds;heart valves;heart failure;load balancing (computing);matching pursuit;murmurhash;negative feedback;normality unit;overall well being;qt interval feature (observable entity);run time (program lifecycle phase);status epilepticus;algorithm	Hong-Hui Chen;Tung-Chien Chen;Liang-Gee Chen	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346574	simulation;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;engineering;mathematics;iterative method;communication;quantum mechanics	DB	17.230484627011503	-85.98638387398269	73368
a46333c78664af4c25db701235f6f08e934feddb	automatic event-based synchronization of multimodal data streams from wearable and ambient sensors	sensor system;large dataset;data stream;motion tracking;activity recognition	A major challenge in using multi-modal, distributed sensor systems for activity recognition is to maintain a temporal synchronization between individually recorded data streams. A common approach is to use well defined ‘synchronization actions’ performed by the user to generate, easily identifiable pattern events in all recorded data streams. The events are then used to manually align data streams. This paper proposes an automatic method for this synchronization. We demonstrate that synchronization actions can be automatically identified and used for stream synchronization across widely different sensors such as acceleration, sound, force, and a motion tracking system. We describe fundamental properties and bounds of our event-based synchronization approach. In particular, we show that the event timing relation is transitive for sensor groups with shared members. We analyzed our synchronization approach in three studies. For a large dataset of 5 users and totally 308 data stream minutes we achieved a synchronization error of 0.3 s for more than 80% of the stream.	activity recognition;algorithm;align (company);ambient occlusion;experiment;instruction path length;modal logic;multimodal interaction;sensor;synchronization (computer science);tracking system;wearable computer	David Bannach;Oliver Amft;Paul Lukowicz	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04471-7_11	embedded system;computer vision;match moving;real-time computing;computer science;data mining;data synchronization;frame synchronization;activity recognition	Mobile	7.420475031848933	-87.15631048494569	73448

Such tests last up to 4 hours. The authors have developed an allergy detection system based on the heart rate variability, which is monitored through electrocardiogram sensors. The detector is based on the correlation between variations of the heart rate and allergic reactions. However, heart rate variations are also due to the patient's physical activity, being necessary to discriminate them. The pocket navigation system will be used to enhance the performance of the allergy detection algorithm, as it is able to identify different physical activities. Additionally, the patient can walk out of the testing room because a 3D localization solution is possible. The experiments described in this article show that it is possible identifying the most important patient's physical activities to avoid false allergic reaction alarms. Moreover, the patient is allowed to move within the hospital during the allergy tests and can be located in case of a severe allergic reaction occurs. The experiments show also long duration walks to assess that our unaided inertial-based navigation system is suited to this particular medical application.	algorithm;dynamic language runtime;experiment;heart rate variability;microsoft outlook for mac;odometry;sensor	Estefania Munoz Diaz;Raquel Gutierrez-Rivas;Juan Jesús García	2015	2015 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2015.7346781	simulation;medicine;communication;surgery	Robotics	9.72076364536054	-85.8073864543272	73455

A user determines the connections between feature patterns and motions, and training data are generated. These training data are employed for the classification of the user's intended motions. It is necessary to determine the number of feature patterns required for motion classification. Therefore, we verify appropriate thresholds which determine the number of feature patterns with consideration of classification rate and learning time.	cluster analysis;electromyography;futures studies;organizing (structure);self-organization;test set	Kahori Kita;Ryu Kato;Hiroshi Yokoi	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913176	training set;self-organization;speech recognition;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Robotics	14.157185762757125	-90.69615306487609	73514

However, the benefits of deep learning and accompanying architectures have been largely unknown for BCI applications. In motor imagery-based BCI, an energy-based feature, typically after spatial filtering, is commonly used for classification. Although this feature corresponds to the estimate of event-related synchronization/desynchronization in the brain, it neglects energy dynamics which may contain valuable discriminative information. Because traditional classiication methods, such as SVM, cannot handle this dynamical property, we proposed an architecture that inputs a dynamic energy representation of EEG data and utilizes convolutional neural networks for classification. By combining this network with a static energy network, we saw a significant increase in performance. We evaluated the proposed method and compared with SVM on a multi-class motor imagery dataset (BCI competition dataset IV-2a). Our method outperforms SVM with static energy features significantly (p <; 0.01).	artificial neural network;brain–computer interface;computer vision;convolutional neural network;deep learning;dynamical system;electroencephalography;outline of object recognition;speech recognition	Siavash Sakhavi;Cuntai Guan;Shuicheng Yan	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362882	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	14.972529454031562	-94.69684810816692	73883

We define “gaitography” as the analysis of such COP trajectories during walking (the “gaitograms”). It is currently unknown, however, if gaitography can be employed to characterize pathological gait, such as lateralized gait impairments. We therefore registered gaitograms for a heterogeneous sample of persons with a trans-femoral and trans-tibial amputation during treadmill walking at a self-selected comfortable speed. We found that gaitograms directly visualize between-person differences in prosthetic gait in terms of step width and the relative duration of prosthetic and non-prosthetic single-support stance phases. We further demonstrated that one should not only focus on the gaitogram’s shape but also on the time evolution along that shape, given that the COP evolves much slower in the single-support phase than in the double-support phase. Finally, commonly used temporal and spatial prosthetic gait characteristics were derived, revealing both individual and systematic differences in prosthetic and non-prosthetic step lengths, step times, swing times, and double-support durations. Because gaitograms can be rapidly collected in an unobtrusive and markerless manner over multiple gait cycles without constraining foot placement, clinical application of gaitography seems both expedient and appealing. Studies examining the repeatability of gaitograms and evaluating gaitography-based gait characteristics against a gold standard with known validity and reliability are required before gaitography can be clinically applied.	bone structure of tibia;embedded system;embedding;gait disorders, neurologic;genetic heterogeneity;lateral thinking;registration;repeatability;source-to-source compiler;treadmill, device;tretinoin;sensor (device);width	Melvyn Roerdink;Andrea Giovanni Cutti;Aurora Summa;Davide Monari;Davide Veronesi;Mariëlle W. van Ooijen;Peter J.

We analyze both clean and corrupt PPG data in the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, skew and kurtosis measures of the signal are used as distinguishing metrics between clean and motion- corrupted data. In the frequency domain, the presence of random components due to motion artifact is analyzed using a frequency domain kurtosis measure. Additionally, bispectral analysis of PPG data indicates the presence of strong quadratic phase coupling (QPC) and more specifically self coupling in the case of clean PPG data. Though quadratic phase coupling is found in data corrupted by motion artifact, the self coupling feature is absent. A Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection rule is formulated for each of the measures. Additionally, treating each of the measures as observations from independent sensors, the Varshney-Chair rule is used to fuse individual decisions to form a global system decision.	algorithm;artifact (error);coupling (physics);frame (networking);pearson hashing;pearson–anson effect;quantum point contact;sensor;time series	Rajet Krishnan;Balasubramaniam Natarajan;Steve Warren	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517684	computer vision;speech recognition;time domain;computer science;mathematics;frequency domain;receiver operating characteristic;statistics	Robotics	19.34552495554934	-86.38098397779584	74015

In the field of prosthetics for amputees, sensors can be used to monitor the activity of remaining muscle and ultimately control prosthetic limbs. In this work, we present an approach to identify the location of intramuscular electromyograph sensors percutaneously implanted in extrinsic muscles of the forearm controlling the fingers and wrist during single digit movements. A major challenge is to confirm whether each sensor is placed in the targeted muscle, as this information can be critical in developing and implementing control systems for prosthetic limbs. We propose an automated approach, based on artificial neural networks, to identify the correct placement of an individual sensor.

This system enables the direct brain control of upper limbs to achieve motor rehabilitation. The EEG signals based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) were used in the BCI. The classifier of linear discriminant analysis was applied to deal with the frequency domain characteristics and recognize intentions. The identified intentions were transformed into instructions to trigger FES which was controlled with iterative learning control method to stimulate the relevant muscles of upper limbs for motor recovery. Results show that the integration of BCI with an upper-extremity FES is feasible with an average accuracy of about 73.9% over five able-bodied subjects.	bios;brain–computer interface;control theory;electroencephalography;functional electrical stimulation;iterative method;linear discriminant analysis;shin megami tensei: persona 3;simulation;steady state;system camera	Yaqi Chu;Xingang Zhao;Jianda Han;Yiwen Zhao;Jun Yao	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014)	10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090671	robot;visualization;electroencephalography;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;trajectory;accuracy and precision;statistics	Robotics	13.820357314488666	-91.83895136382053	74319

It is shown that EEG signals recorded under different brain states in healthy as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients may be understood as distinct, statistically significant realizations of the model. EEG signals recorded during resting eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting conditions in a pilot study with AD patients and age-matched healthy control subjects (CTL) are employed. An optimization scheme is then utilized to match the output of the stochastic Duffing-van der Pol double oscillator network with EEG signals recorded during each condition for AD and CTL subjects by selecting the model physical parameters and noise intensity. The selected signal characteristics are power spectral densities in major brain frequency bands Shannon and sample entropies. These measures allow matching of linear time varying frequency content as well as non-linear signal information content and complexity. The main finding of the work is that statistically significant unique models represent the EC and EO conditions for both CTL and AD subjects. However, it is also shown that the inclusion of sample entropy in the optimization process, to match the complexity of the EEG signal, enhances the stochastic non-linear oscillator model performance.	alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;angle closure glaucoma;bands;brain diseases;electroencephalography phase synchronization;eye;fractures, open;frequency band;large;matching;mathematical optimization;network model;nonlinear system;oscillator device component;patients;rest;sample entropy;self-information;shannon (unit);time complexity;van der pol oscillator;density	Parham Ghorbanian;Subramanian Ramakrishnan;Hashem Ashrafiuon	2015		10.3389/fncom.2015.00048	psychology;entropy;text mining;neuroscience;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;stochastic;statistics	ML	19.709032780034022	-83.56578704634293	74371

Although the elderly have wisdom and wealth gathered from their life experiences, they require special assistance, higher health insurance costs, and even constant monitoring. By utilizing information process and communications technology, ambient assisted living (AAL) communications open up a new way to address such needs for the aged and the sick. Specifically, AAL uses ambient technologies, including data sensing, processing, transmission, and artificial intelligence, to enable new products, services, and processes that help to provide safe, healthy lives for the aged and disabled. It also supports improved social connections and accessibility to the external world. With the growth of AAL environment, the accessibility gets more challenging for the complex data structure.	atm adaptation layer;accessibility;artificial intelligence;care-of address;data structure;experience	Joel Jos&#x00E9; P.

d26e5212502f28ad07608452cc13dac0f6596535	electronics for a safe direct current stimulator	direct current;electrical stimulation;implants;neural engineering;prosthetics	Commercially available neuroprostheses, while successful and effective, are limited in their functionality by their reliance on pulsatile stimulation. Direct current (DC) has been shown to have great potential for the purposes of neuromodulation; however, direct current cannot be applied directly to neurons due to the charge injection thresholds of electrodes. We are developing a Safe Direct Current Stimulator (SDCS) that applies ionic direct current (iDC) without inducing toxic electrochemical reactions. The current design of the SDCS uses a series of eight valves in conjunction with four electrodes to rectify ionic current in microfluidic channels. This paper outlines the design, implementation, and testing of the electronics of the SDCS. These electronics will ultimately be interfaced with a separate microfluidic circuit in the device prototype. Testing the outputs of the electronics confirmed adherence to its design requirements. The completion of the SDCS electronics enables the further development of iDC as a mechanism for neuromodulation.	ionic;microfluidics;neuromodulation (medicine);neuroprosthetics;outlines (document);prototype;requirement;direct current;electrode;neuroprosthesis	Patrick Ou;Gene Y.

The aim of this study was to evaluate noninvasive identification of AF sources by solving the inverse problem. Realistic mathematical models of atria and torso anatomy with different DF patterns of AF were used. For these models inverse-computed electrograms EGMs were compared to intracardiac EGMs in terms of their voltage, phase and frequency spectrum errors. In models without added noise, atrial spectrums were estimated with lower relative errors than phases (3.8±3.8 vs 41±17 % respectively, p<;0.01) and after noise addition differences between relative errors of spectrums and phases were more pronounced (5.5±4.1 vs 48±14 %, respectively p<;0.01). Non-invasive location of the highest DF during AF showed a better accuracy than in the phase and voltage domain, being a promising clinical tool for identification of sources prior to ablation.	anisotropic filtering;computation;direction finding;mathematical model;relative atrial index;spectral density;terminate (software)	Jorge Pedrón-Torrecilla;Andreu M.

Three training algorithms are investigated: SpikeProp (using both incremental and batch processing), QuickProp, and RProp. Since the epilepsy and epileptic seizure detection problem requires a large training dataset the efficacy of these algorithms is investigated by first applying them to the XOR and Fisher iris benchmark problems. Three measures of performance are investigated: number of convergence epochs, computational efficiency, and classification accuracy. Extensive parametric analysis is performed to identify heuristic rules and optimum parameter values that increase the computational efficiency and classification accuracy. The result is a remarkable increase in computational efficiency. For the XOR problem, the computational efficiency of SpikeProp, QuickProp, and RProp is increased by a factor of 588, 82, and 75, respectively, compared with the results reported in the literature. EEGs from three different subject groups are analyzed: (a) healthy subjects, (b) epileptic subjects during a seizure-free interval, and (c) epileptic subjects during a seizure. It is concluded that RProp is the best training algorithm because it has the highest classification accuracy among all training algorithms specially for large size training datasets with about the same computational efficiency provided by SpikeProp. The SNN model for EEG classification and epilepsy and seizure detection uses RProp as training algorithm. This model yields a high classification accuracy of 92.5%.	artificial neural network;electroencephalography;spiking neural network	Samanwoy Ghosh-Dastidar;Hojjat Adeli	2007	Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering	10.3233/ica-2007-14301	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	17.181812809036263	-92.45168180376275	74701

In addition, for sleep apnea syndrome diagnosis, snoring sounds are also monitored. The present study was aimed at synchronous detection of all three sound components (cardiac, respiratory, and snoring) from a single spot. The sounds were analyzed with respect to the cardiorespiratory activity, and to the detection and classification of apneas. Sound signals from 30 subjects including 10 apnea patients were detected by means of a microphone connected to a chestpiece which was applied to the heart region. The complex nature of the signal was investigated using time, spectral, and statistical approaches, in connection with self-defined time-based and event-based characteristics. The results show that the obstruction is accompanied by an increase of statistically relevant spectral components in the range of 300 to 2000 Hz, however, not within the range up to 300 Hz. Signal properties are discussed with respect to different breathing types, as well as to the presence and the type of apneas. Principal component analysis of the event-based characteristics shows significant properties of the sound signal with respect to different types of apneas and different patient groups, respectively. The analysis reflects apneas with an obstructive segment and those with a central segment. In addition, aiming for an optimum detection of all three sound components, alternative regions on the thorax and on the neck were investigated on two subjects. The results suggest that the right thorax region in the seventh intercostal space and the neck are optimal regions. It is concluded that for patient assessment, extensive acoustic analysis offers a reduction in the number of required sensor components, especially with respect to compact home monitoring of apneas.	acoustic cryptanalysis;auscultation;chest;heart diseases;heart sounds;hertz (hz);microphone device component;obstruction;patients;principal component analysis;respiratory distress syndrome, adult;respiratory sounds;sleep (system call);sleep apnea syndromes;snoring	Eugenijus Kaniusas;Helmut Pfützner;Bernd Saletu	2005	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2005.856294	neuroscience;speech recognition;medicine;acoustics;pathology;remote patient monitoring;sleep;physics;bioacoustics;principal component analysis	Visualization	17.029316451938403	-87.34846845392974	74703

A total of 12,186 ECGs were used: 8,528 in the public training set and 3,658 in the private hidden test set. Due to the high degree of inter-expert disagreement between a significant fraction of the expert labels we implemented a mid-competition bootstrap approach to expert relabeling of the data, levering the best performing Challenge entrants' algorithms to identify contentious labels. A total of 75 independent teams entered the Challenge using a variety of traditional and novel methods, ranging from random forests to a deep learning approach applied to the raw data in the spectral domain. Four teams won the Challenge with an equal high F1 score (averaged across all classes) of 0.83, although the top 11 algorithms scored within 2% of this. A combination of 45 algorithms identified using LASSO achieved an F1 of 0.87, indicating that a voting approach can boost performance.	anisotropic filtering;cardiology discipline;class;computation (action);deep learning;f1 score;forests;lasso;patients;random forest;test set;won;algorithm;teams	Gari D.

Previously such effects have been investigated by a variety of linear regression type methods but these are not well suited for developing adaptive systems. We investigate the method on a qualitative and quantitative dataset with ages spanning from seven to 79 years under indoor and outdoor experimental settings. The results show that the method is indeed a suitable candidate for quantification of, in this instance vibrotactile information, and for the future design of user-adaptive vibrotactile displays. More generally the model shows potential for designing a variety of adaptive systems.	adaptive system;file spanning;logistic regression	Hans Jørgen Andersen;Ann Morrison;Lars Knudsen	2012		10.1145/2399016.2399092	computer vision;method;simulation;computer science;logistic regression	HCI	8.090291675974228	-93.02394227982383	74828

The HRV is an important phenomenon which reflects the functional state of the autonomous nervous system (ANS), although there are some doubts concerning the actual interpretation of spectral components of HRV and their postulated balance. The assessment of the functional state of the ANS is the task of paramount importance in risk stratification of cardiological patients. HRV is considered to depend mainly on the properties of the sinus node (SN), which achieves neurohumoral input from the ANS. Interestingly, there is growing evidence that the relation between the heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) is really strong. The variety of breathing-related effects that are present in HRV is very rich, including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), cardiorespiratory synchronization and vivid heart rate response to breathing disorders. If the mean frequency of any of rhythms is changed, the other rhythm adjusts itself. This provokes the question on the actual source of the dynamics observed in the HRV. Is it possible that we observe mainly the dynamics of the respiratory rhythm which is just transduced by the heart effector? What might be the role of the intrinsic dynamics of this effector? Is the RSA a product of neural regulation or rather a by-product: what is its teleological role? In consequence: if we concentrate on the sinus node and its properties in order to understand the nature of the HRV — are we questioning the right suspect? The reasoning is supplied by suitable choice of literature and by the analysis of the computational model.

This paper proposed an automatic physical bullying detection method with movement sensors to protect teenagers. Four features were extracted from acceleration and gyro data, and an Instance-Based classifier was applied upon them. Altogether eight kinds of activities, including three bullying kinds and five daily-life kinds, were acted by role playing. Simulations were performed on these data, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm could recognize physical bullying events and distinguish them from daily-life ones at an average accuracy of 80%. This showed a promise in automatic school bullying prevention with activity recognition techniques.	activity recognition;algorithm;computer simulation;gyro;sensor	Liang Ye;Hany Ferdinando;Tapio Seppänen;Tuija Huuki;Esko Alasaarela	2015	2015 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2015.7289284	simulation;computer science;computer security;activity recognition	HCI	5.750358986064134	-85.317858634272	75180

In this study, the immune clonal algorithm (ICA) is employed to perform automatic feature selection, reducing the number of features the classifier deals with and improving the classification accuracy. In the experiment, EEG signal was decomposed into five sub-band components by a discrete wavelet transform. Features were extracted as input to train three classifiers (NB, SVM, KNN and LDA) to judge whether the EEG signal was epileptic or not. Then, ICA was introduced to select a feature subset to train the classifiers. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy based on selected features is significantly higher than that on original features. We also analyzed the relative importance of each feature.	discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalography;feature selection;independent computing architecture;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;naive bayes classifier;support vector machine	Yong Peng;Bao-Liang Lu	2012	2012 11th International Conference on Information Science, Signal Processing and their Applications (ISSPA)	10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310672	wavelet;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;wavelet packet decomposition	ML	17.51495057328923	-90.77243291556378	75263
e33bd952b3434071c15b43101d1e1628391f4f33	temporal alignment improves feature quality: an experiment on activity recognition with accelerometer data		Activity recognition has been receiving significant attention from a variety of research areas such as human performance enhancement, health promotion, and human computer interaction. However, recognizing activities from accelerometer data still remains a challenging problem due to sensitivity to sampling rates, misalignment of data, and increased variability in activities among clinically relevant populations. In order to solve these issues, we adopt methods from functional analysis, which consider non-elastic rate variations in movement. The overall framework factors out temporal variability within activity classes, before leveraging robust machine learning pipelines for a given end-use. The proposed approach has been evaluated on 7 classes of everyday activities with 50 subjects. The results indicate that proposed approach achieves improved performance with the improvements observed in separating similar classes that differ in temporal rates, and also demonstrate higher robustness to change in window lengths. These results suggest that temporal alignment should be considered a core part of activity recognition pipelines.		Hongjun Choi;Qiao Wang;Meynard John Toledo;Pavan K. Turaga;Matthew P.

Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) paradigm has many appealing features, aiming at implementing BCI-enabled communication-control applications. In this paper, we present a complete signal processing chain for a self-paced, SSVEP-based BCI. The proposed approach mostly focuses at reducing the user effort in dealing with BCI, featuring no need of user-specific calibration or training. In this paper, the classification algorithm is introduced and first validated on offline waveforms, aiming at improving classification accuracy and minimizing the false positive rate. Then, implementation of an online, self-paced SSVEP BCI is illustrated. The scheme refers to a four-way choice and exploits discrimination between intentional control states and nocontrol ones. Good performance is achieved, both in terms of true positive rate (>94%), as well as low false positive rate (0.26 min-1), even in experiments carried out outside lab-controlled conditions.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;algorithm;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;calibration;electroencephalography;experiment;interface device component;online and offline;plug (physical object);programming paradigm;sensitivity and specificity;signal processing;speech discrimination tests;steady state;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Niccolò Mora;Ilaria De Munari;Paolo Ciampolini	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319801	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;communication	Robotics	13.62012594095708	-92.73460283200927	75549

Current state-of-the-art technology for diagnosing and assessing sleep apnea is obtrusive, expensive, and lacks integration/analysis of important cardiovascular and respiratory parameters. This paper evaluates a novel unobtrusive multiparameter sleep apnea monitor, namely, the Biopeak chest belt monitor, and describes a collection of associated algorithms for the detection of sleep apnea and assessment of the extent of the resulting physiological disturbance. The system uses dry electrodes to acquire electrocardiogram, respiratory, and stroke volume data and analyzes multiple physiological parameters from it. In a pilot investigation on eight healthy subjects simulating a total of 66 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) events with Mueller maneuvers, the proposed system achieves an accuracy of 95.6%, a specificity of 97.2%, and a sensitivity of 93.8% for identifying these events. Moreover, the response of the simulated OSA events on the multiple physiological parameters conforms to earlier published work. We thus conclude that the proposed chest belt system has potential to be used for reliable sleep apnea detection and comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular and respiratory parameters in sleep apnea.	embedded system;emoticon;human factors and ergonomics;receiver operating characteristic;resident monitor;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;simulation;sleep mode;unobtrusive javascript;wake-sleep algorithm;wearable computer	Saif Ahmad;Izmail Batkin;Owen Kelly;Hilmi R.

We tested whether independent component analysis (ICA) is a necessary preprocessing tool to determine fractal properties of amplitudes of decomposed EEG records in theta, alpha, beta and gamma oscillations. The subjects were required to track a moving spot on a city map displayed on a computer screen by pushing forward a joystick in two experimental conditions: the spot moved in steps either with constant or fractal time intervals. The wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) method was applied to estimate the local fractal dimensions D(h) for recovered EEG via reduced independent components (ICs) localized inside and outside the brain. The measure of fractality, i.e. the Hoelder exponent hDmax, was statistically estimated among experimental conditions. We established multifractality for extracted IC per se, specific for filtered oscillations in both experimental conditions: long-range correlation for theta and alpha, and anticorrelation for beta and gamma. Similar results were obtained for filtered versions of recovered EEG. Multifractal scaling, specific for lower and higher EEG oscillations, proved to be very stable intrinsic feature for the activity of large brain areas. The external events (task conditions) and the extended number of ICs, including those at the boundary line of the brain, did not have influence upon the scaling, although their effects might be statistically different for a given filtered oscillation.	electroencephalography;independent component analysis;multifractal system	D.

The assessment of wavelet transform (WT) as a feature extraction method was used in representing the electrophysiological signals. Considering that classification is often more accurate when the pattern is simplified through representation by important features, the feature extraction and selection play an important role in classifying systems such as neural networks. The PPG, ECG, EEG signals were decomposed into time-frequency representations using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution.

This paper consists of three steps to classify motor imagery. In the first step, wavelet transform is performed to filter noises from signals. In the second step, twenty-four numbers of input features are extracted by wavelet-based features from filtered signals by wavelet transform. In the final step, NEWFM classifies motor imagery using twentyfour numbers of input features that are extracted in the second step. In this paper, twenty-four numbers of input features are selected for generating the fuzzy rules to classify motor imagery. NEWFM is tested on the Graz BCI datasets that were used in the BCI Competitions of 2003. The accuracy of NEWFM is 83.51%.	artificial neural network;brain–computer interface;fuzzy rule;membership function (mathematics);wavelet transform	Sang-Hong Lee;Joon S.

However, the complexities of brain activity in EOS are still lacking. To address this issue, a multi-scale sample entropy (MSE) method was used to investigate the role of brain signal complexity in EOS. We recruited 39 patients with EOS (age from 12 to 18), 31 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Reduced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) complexity was observed in the superior temporal sulcus and cuneus. Increased BOLD complexity was observed in the middle frontal gyrus, superior partial lobule, precuneus and cingulate gyrus. Furthermore, we found the complexity changes in cingulate gyrus were associated with clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. These results suggested that the changes of complexity are crucial to understand the pathomechanism of schizophrenia.	onset (audio);resting state fmri	Xiao Wang;Yan Zhang;Shaoqiang Han;Jingping Zhao;Huafu Chen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67777-4_52	precuneus;neuroscience;middle frontal gyrus;brain activity and meditation;resting state fmri;schizophrenia;superior temporal sulcus;cuneus;gyrus;medicine	Vision	18.6390413928285	-80.77082128572516	75948

Since they sometimes induce the serious accidents caused by incorrect medication, we propose iMec System to promote correct medication. The system is composed of iMec (intelligent medicine case), the Ubiquitous Sensors, iMec Server, and the Home Robot. The iMec detects medicine in its storage space and evaluates the adequacy of dose about type, quantity and timing. The Ubiquitous Sensors measures the living activities of a recipient and assists the iMec in confirming the timing. The iMec Server accumulates the adequacy into its database and provides a web interface for telemonitoring. And, the Home Robot warns the recipient of incorrect medication by voices and gestures if the adequacy is low. By using iMec System, caretakers can check the adequacy via the server and can remind the recipient to take medicine. We used background subtraction method for confirming quantity and simple fuzzy inference method for confirming timing. We confirmed that iMec System was able to confirm the quantity and timing by experiments.	background subtraction;domestic robot;email;experiment;sensor;server (computing);user interface	Takuo Suzuki;Yasushi Nakauchi	2010	19th International Symposium in Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598706	robot;embedded system;estimation;the internet;simulation;background subtraction;computer science;sensor;artificial intelligence;population ageing;data mining;user interface;geriatrics;server	Robotics	7.641403619723321	-88.02170039125328	75955

We employed Time Encoded Signal Processing And Recognition (TESPAR), a time-domain signal processing technique, in combination with multi-layer perceptrons to identify DOA levels. The presented system learns to discriminate between five DOA classes assessed by human experts whose judgements were based on EEG mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEPs) and clinical observations. We found that our system closely mimicked the behavior of the human expert, thus proving the utility of the method. Further analyses on the features extracted by our technique indicated that information related to DOA is mostly distributed across frequency bands and that the presence of high frequencies (> 80 Hz), which reflect mostly muscle activity, is beneficial for DOA detection.

In prior work, a mobile app to document chronic wounds and wound care, specifically pressure ulcers (bedsores) was developed for Android smartphones and tablets. One feature of the mobile app allowed users to take images of the wound using the smartphone or tablet's integrated camera. In a user trial with nurses at a personal care home, this feature emerged as a key benefit of the mobile app. This paper developed image analysis algorithms that facilitate noncontact measurements of irregularly shaped images (e.g., wounds), where the image is taken with a sole smartphone or tablet camera. The image analysis relies on the sensors integrated in the smartphone or tablet with no auxiliary or add-on instrumentation on the device. Three approaches to image analysis were developed and evaluated: 1) computing depth using autofocus data; 2) a custom sensor fusion of inertial sensors and feature tracking in a video stream; and 3) a custom pinch/zoom approach. The pinch/zoom approach demonstrated the strongest potential and thus developed into a fully functional prototype complete with a measurement mechanism. While image analysis is a very well developed field, this paper contributes to image analysis applications and implementation in mHealth, specifically for wound care.	add-ons for firefox;adobe flash;algorithm;android;application programming interface;color;expert system;focal (programming language);image analysis;light field;mhealth;mobile app;motion estimation;multi-touch;prototype;sensor;sensor web;smartphone;streaming media;tablet computer	Paul J.

When coupled with data-driven mathematical models, CGM data can be used for short-term prediction of glucose concentrations in diabetic patients. In this study, we present a real-time implementation of a previously developed offline data-driven algorithm. The implementation consists of a Kalman filter for real-time filtering of CGM data and a data-driven autoregressive model for prediction. Results based on CGM data from 3 different studies involving 34 type 1 and 2 diabetic patients suggest that the proposed real-time approach can yield ∼10-min-ahead predictions with clinically acceptable accuracy and, hence, could be useful as a tool for warning against impending glucose deregulation episodes. The results further support the feasibility of “universal” glucose prediction models, where an offline-developed model based on one individual's data can be used to predict the glucose levels of any other individual in real time.	algorithm;autoregressive model;diabetes mellitus;glucose metabolism disorders;kalman filter;mathematical model;mathematics;online and offline;patients;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Yinghui Lu;Srinivasan Rajaraman;W.

07658a21ebe50c36b35b7f85f909ff9b2ff61a1b	the sphere challenge: activity recognition with multimodal sensor data		This paper outlines the Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in Residential Environment (SPHERE) project and details the SPHERE challenge that will take place in conjunction with European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery (ECML-PKDD) between March and July 2016. The SPHERE challenge is an activity recognition competition where predictions are made from video, accelerometer and environmental sensors. Monitory prizes will be awarded to the top three entrants, with e1,000 being awarded to the winner, e600 being awarded to the first runner up, and e400 being awarded to the second runner up. The dataset can be downloaded from the University of Bristol’s data servers 3 [?]. 1 Background and Summary In this section we first describe the SPHERE project, then the SPHERE challenge is described, and outline of the remainder of the paper. 1.1 The SPHERE Project Obesity, depression, stroke, falls, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease are some of the biggest health issues and fastest-rising categories of health-care costs. The financial expenditure associated with these is widely regarded as unsustainable and the impact on quality of life is felt by millions of people in the UK each day. Smart technologies can unobtrusively quantify activities of daily living, and these can provide long-term behavioural patterns that are objective, insightful measures for clinical professionals and caregivers. To this end the EPSRC-funded “Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in Residential Environment (SPHERE)” Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) 3 https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/8gccwpx47rav19vk8x4xapcog 4 http://www.irc-sphere.ac.uk/ ar X iv :1 60 3. 00 79 7v 3 [ cs .C Y ] 1 7 M ar 2 01 6 [11,12,3] has designed a multi-modal sensor system driven by data analytics requirements. The system is under test in a single house, and will be deployed in a general population of 100 homes in Bristol (UK). The data sets collected will be made available to researchers in a variety of communities. Data is collected from the following three sensing modalities: 1. wrist-worn accelerometer; 2. RGB-D cameras (i.e. video with depth information); and 3. passive environmental sensors. With these sensor data, we can learn patterns of behaviour, and can track the deterioration/progress of persons that suffer or recover from various medical conditions. To achieve this, we focus activity recognition over multiple tiers, with the two main prediction tasks of SPHERE including: 1. prediction of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (e.g. tasks such as meal preparation, watching television); and 2. prediction of posture/ambulation (e.g. walking, sitting, transitioning). Reliable predictions of ADL allows us to model behaviour and of residents over time, e.g. what does a typical day consist of, what times are particular activities performed etc. Prediction of posture and ambulation will complement ADL predictions, and can inform us about the physical well-being of the participant, how mobile/responsive is the participant, how activie/sedintary, etc. 1.2 The SPHERE Challenge The task for the SPHERE challenge is to predict posture and ambulation labels given the sensor data from the recruited participants. We will henceforth refer to posture/ambulation as ‘activity recognition’ for brevity. It is worth noting that the term activity recognition has different interpretations when viewed from accelerometer, video, and environmental sensor perspectives. The definition of activities used in challenge most closely aligns to the terminology used in the field of accelerometer-based prediction. For this task, accelerometer, RGB-D and environmental data is provided. Accelerometer is samplled at 20 Hz and given in its raw format (see Section 2.1). Raw video is not given in order to preserve anonymity of the participants. Instead, extracted features that relate to the centre of mass and bounding box of the identified persons are provided (see Section 2.2). Environmental data consists of Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensors, and these is given in raw format (see Section 2.3). Twenty (posture/ambulation) activities labels are annotated in our dataset, and these are enumerated below together with short descriptions:	activity recognition;behavioral pattern;ecml pkdd;fastest;internet relay chat;machine learning;minimum bounding box;modal logic;multimodal interaction;passive optical network;poor posture;requirement;sensor	Niall Twomey;Tom Diethe;Meelis Kull;Hao Song;Massimo Camplani;Sion L.

Previous work has shown that there are remarkably strong cues to mental illness in short samples of the voice. These cues are evident in severe forms of illness, but it would be most valuable to make earlier diagnoses from a richer feature set. Furthermore there is an abstraction gap between these voice cues and the diagnostic cues used by practitioners. We believe that by closing this gap, we can build more effective early diagnostic systems for mental illness. In order to develop improved monitoring, we need to translate the high-level cues used by practitioners into features that can be analyzed using signal processing and machine learning techniques. In this paper we describe the elicitation process that we used to tap the practitioners' knowledge. We borrow from both AI (expert systems) and HCI (contextual inquiry) fields in order to perform this knowledge transfer. The paper highlights an unusual and promising role for HCI - the analysis of interaction data for health diagnosis.	closing (morphology);contextual inquiry;expert system;high- and low-level;human–computer interaction;machine learning;signal processing	Keng-hao Chang;Matthew K.

Although restoration of hand opening stands importantly in patient's daily life, it is difficult to distinguish the voluntary finger extension from thumb adduction and finger flexion using stroke patients' electroencephalography (EMG) on single muscle activity. We propose to implement corticomuscular coherence analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) and EMG signals on Extensor Digitorum to extract their intention involved in hand opening. EEG and EMG signals of 8 subjects are simultaneously collected when executing 4 hand movement tasks (finger extension, thumb adduction, finger flexion, and rest). We explore the spatial and temporal distribution of the coherence and observe statistically significant corticomuscular coherence appearing at left motor cortical area and different patterns within beta frequency range for 4 movement tasks. Linear discriminate analysis is applied on the coherence pattern to distinguish finger extension from thumb adduction, finger flexion, and rest. The classification results are greater than those by EEG only. The results indicate the possibility to detect voluntary hand opening based on coherence analysis between single muscle EMG signal and single EEG channel located in motor cortical area, which potentially helps active hand rehabilitation for stroke patients.	cache coherence;cerebrovascular accident;circuit restoration;electroencephalography phase synchronization;electromyography;frequency band;linear discriminant analysis;muscle;patients;stroke rehabilitation;thinking, function;executing - querystatuscode	Xinxin Lou;Siyuan Xiao;Yu Qi;Xiaoling Hu;Yiwen Wang;Xiaoxiang Zheng	2013		10.1155/2013/908591	psychology;computational biology;movement;stroke;young adult;electroencephalography;physical therapy;communication;surgery	ML	17.199949538266065	-80.55818331163164	76243

In the video, experiments demonstrating the control of robot using a brain computer interface are shown. This is done using “actemes”. Actemes are fundamental units of action. The actemes can be combined to perform complex tasks. The user who performs the tasks imagines the complex actions as an ordered combination of actemes. The EEG of the user during the process is collected and classified in real-time using independent component analysis (ICA)[1, 2] and a neural network classifier[3, 4] to identify the actemes. This ordered set of actemes can be considered to be meaningful sentence in a language. The order in which the complex action is constructed is called the grammar. Two such tasks are demonstrated using these experiments. The first task involves insertion of round peg into a hole and rotating the peg inorder to simulate the insertion of a screw into threaded hole. The actemes involved are “insert” and “rotate”. The second task is a point-to-point movement of a peg in which the peg is to be moved from a circular zone at the bottom right to the circular zone centered at the cross hair at the top left of the screen.

A real-time patient monitoring and feedback system is one of the solutions to help patients with diabetes and their healthcare professionals monitor health-related measurements and provide dynamic feedback. However, data-driven methods to dynamically prioritize and generate tasks are not well investigated in the domain of remote health monitoring. This paper presents a wireless health project (WANDA) that leverages sensor technology and wireless communication to monitor the health status of patients with diabetes. The WANDA dynamic task management function applies data analytics in real-time to discretize continuous features, applying data clustering and association rule mining techniques to manage a sliding window size dynamically and to prioritize required user tasks. The developed algorithm minimizes the number of daily action items required by patients with diabetes using association rules that satisfy a minimum support, confidence and conditional probability thresholds. Each of these tasks maximizes information gain, thereby improving the overall level of patient adherence and satisfaction. Experimental results from applying EM-based clustering and Apriori algorithms show that the developed algorithm can predict further events with higher confidence levels and reduce the number of user tasks by up to 76.19 %.	adverse event;approximation algorithm;apriori algorithm;association rule learning;assumed;blood glucose;cessation of life;cluster analysis;computer science;correspondence problem;diabetes mellitus;discretize;electron microscopy;first-order logic;first-order predicate;hematological disease;information gain in decision trees;kullback–leibler divergence;machine learning;microsoft windows;multitier architecture;normal statistical distribution;patients;quantization (signal processing);reading (activity);real-time locating system;real-time transcription;rule (guideline);sensor;task management function;confirmation - responselevel;statistical cluster	Myung-kyung Suh;Jonathan Woodbridge;Tannaz Moin;Mars Lan;Nabil Alshurafa;Lauren Samy;Bobak J.

However, existing algorithms for classification of hearts sounds have been constrained by limited idealized training sets and methodological issues with validation. As part of the 2016 PhysioNet Challenge competition, we present an algorithm for automated heart sound classification sthat uses Hilbert-envelope and wavelet features to attempt to capture the qualities of the heart sounds that physicians are trained to interpret. We perform a two-step classification of heart sounds into poor quality, normal or abnormal with sensitivity of 0.7958 and specificity of 0.7459.	algorithm;machine learning;sensitivity and specificity;television;wavelet	Tanmay A.

Using continuous neurofeedback, through the use of EEG techniques, people can learn how to train and alter their brain electrical activity. A software platform that puts together the proposed rehabilitation methodology has been developed: a digital game protocol that supports neurofeedback training of alpha and theta rhythms, by reading the EEG activity and presenting it back to the subject, interleaved with neurocognitive tasks such as n-Back and Corsi Block-Tapping. This tool will be used as a potential rehabilitative platform for age-related memory impairments.	dec alpha;effective method;electroencephalography;neurofeedback;theta model	Ana Maria Portugal;Daniela Silva Ferreira;Joana Santos Reis;Francisco Pinho;Nuno Sérgio Mendes Dias	2013	2013 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH)	10.1109/SeGAH.2013.6665310	psychology;cognitive psychology;hemoencephalography;developmental psychology;communication	Robotics	9.635738300873331	-91.76533839405013	76478

The system consisted of neural stimulators, muscular stimulators, a radio transceiverequipped microcontroller and a microbattery. Flight initiation, cessation and elevation control were accomplished through neural stimulus of the brain which elicited, suppressed or modulated wing oscillation. Turns were triggered through the direct muscular stimulus of either of the basalar muscles. We believe this type of technology will open the door to in-flight perturbation and recording of insect flight responses.	cyborg;microcontroller;modulation;neural oscillation;pneumatic artificial muscles;remote control	Michel M.

Deriving and integrating the gestural activities (such as talking, coughing, and deglutition etc.) along with activity recognition approaches can not only help identify the daily activities or social interaction of the older adults but also provide unique insights into their long-term health care, wellness management and ambulatory conditions. Gestural activities (GAs), in general, help identify fine-grained physiological symptoms and chronic psychological conditions which are not directly observable from traditional activities of daily living. In this paper, we propose GeSmart, an energy efficient wearable smart earring based GA recognition model for detecting a combination of speech and non-speech events. To capture the GAs we propose to use only the accelerometer sensor inside our smart earring due to its energy efficient operations and ubiquitous presence in everyday wearable devices. We present initial results and insights based on a C4.5 classification algorithm to infer the infrequent GAs. Subsequently, we propose a novel change-point detection based hybrid classification method exploiting the emerging patterns in a variety of GAs to detect and infer infrequent GAs. Experimental results based on real data traces collected from 10 users demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of GAs classification by over 23%, compared to previously proposed pure classification-based solutions. We also note that the accelerometer sensor based earrings are surprisingly informative and energy efficient (by 2.3 times) for identifying different types of GAs.	activity recognition;c4.5 algorithm;dynamic bayesian network;ground truth;information;motion detector;observable;overhead (computing);sensor;smart device;software deployment;software release life cycle;statistical classification;tracing (software);uncontrolled format string;wearable computer;wearable technology	Mohammad Arif Ul Alam;Nirmalya Roy	2014	2014 International Conference on Smart Computing	10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2014.7043858	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;communication	HCI	5.588381375825214	-86.01062148420127	76794

The identified changes are cyclic with a period of approximately 24 hours – this is Circadian Rhythm of Activity, CAR. In the event that we correlate CAR with information about the type of room and activities envisaged in this room, we can define the circadian rhythm (CR).

9fc2298bfad5630a7b9d3f04f7512b9ad071ac9f	a real-time embedded fpga processor for a stand-alone dual-mode assistive device		This paper presents a stand-alone Dual-mode Tongue DriveSystem (sdTDS) which is designed for people with severedisabilities to control their environment using their tonguemotion and speech. The sdTDS detects user's tongue motion using a magnetic tracer placed on tongue and an array of magnetic sensors embedded in a wireless headset and at the same time it can capture the user's voice using a small microphone embedded in the same headset. A real-time FPGA-based local processor is proposed which can perform all required signal processing at sensor side, rather than sending all raw data out to a PC or smartphone. The proposed sdTDS significantly reduces the transmitter power consumption and subsequently increases the battery life.	assistive technology;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;headset (audio);microphone;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sensor;signal processing;smartphone;transmitter	Ali Jafari;Maysam Ghovanloo;Tinoosh Mohsenin	2017	2017 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM)	10.1109/FCCM.2017.55	field-programmable gate array;raw data;wireless;battery (electricity);microphone;headset;transmitter;computer hardware;embedded system;signal processing;computer science	Embedded	10.182931533008135	-89.48279083682883	77154

This study proposes a new gait symmetry index (GSI) to quantify gait symmetry with one 3D accelerometer at L3 (GSIL3). GSIL3 was evaluated with 16 post stroke patients and nine healthy controls in the Six-Minute-Walk-Test (6-MWT). Discriminative power was evaluated with Wilcoxon test and the effect size (ES) was computed with Cliff's Delta. GSIL3 estimated during the entire 6-MWT and during a short segment straight walk (GSIL3straight) have comparable effect size to one another (ES = 0.89, p < 0.001) and to the symmetry indices derived from feet sensors (|ES| = [0.22, 0.89]). Furthermore, while none of the indices derived from feet sensors showed significant differences between post stroke patients walking with a cane compared to those able to walk without, GSIL3 was able to discriminate between these two groups with a significantly lower value in the group using a cane (ES = 0.70, p = 0.02). In addition, GSIL3 was strongly associated with several symmetry indices measured by feet sensors during the straight walking cycles (Spearman correlation: |ρ| = [0.82, 0.88], p < 0.05). The proposed index can be a reliable and cost-efficient post stroke gait symmetry assessment with implications for research and clinical practice.	cane, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tip;cerebrovascular accident;conceptualization (information science);correction of hearing impairment;cost efficiency;data curation;digital curation;foot;futures studies;gait apraxia;gait analysis;grid security infrastructure;gyroscope;patients;accelerometers;effect size;sensor (device)	Wei Zhang;Mathew Smuck;Catherine Legault;Ma A.

947a2f1de9bfcd2b5e723a22265822ddc7b2a4a7	hand gesture recognition based on deep learning method		The classical classification method usually consists preprocessing, windowing, feature extraction and classification. Despite the promising performance have been shown in recent researcher, the greatest disadvantage of those classical methods is that some useful information may be discarded when extracting feature. In this paper, a novel model based on deep learning is proposed to improve the accuracy of EMG-based hand gesture recognition. A parallel architecture with five convolution layers is adopted. The results show a slight improvement when using convolution neural network. Meanwhile, the effect of preprocessing on CNN-based method has also been evaluated.	artificial neural network;convolution;deep learning;electromyography;feature extraction;gesture recognition;parallel computing;preprocessor;statistical classification	Kai Xing;Zhen Ding;Shuai Jiang;Xueyan Ma;Kai Yang;Chifu Yang;Xiang Li;Feng Jiang	2018	2018 IEEE Third International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC)	10.1109/DSC.2018.00087	convolutional neural network;gesture recognition;feature extraction;deep learning;architecture;preprocessor;convolution;pattern recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	18.161551452517095	-93.17243739423049	77635

The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize how different antipsychotics influence short-term cardiovascular couplings (CVC) in acute SZO. In this study CVC of 42 unmedicated (UNMED), 42 medicated (MED) patients suffering from SZO and 42 age and gender matched healthy subjects (CON) was analyzed applying the High Resolution Joint Symbolic Dynamics. We found decreased CVC in SZO (UNMED, MED) characterized by CVC patterns that were less predominant and more distributed in comparison to CON and mainly dominated by a greater amount of slow increasing, slow decreasing, alternating and fluctuating systolic blood pressure in combination with invariable heart rate responses. The impairment of the cardiovascular system in SZO was much more formed in MED and seems to be due to the anti-cholinergic effects of antipsychotics. Especially, a subgroup of MED treated with clozapine, quetiapine and amisulpride had the strongest influence on CVC than those treaded with olanzapine. These results might contribute to an optimal selection of therapy strategies minimizing cardiovascular pro-arrhythmic effects in SZO and thus to a more individual patient adapted therapy.	cardiovascular and interventional radiological society of europe;medline	Steffen Schulz;Jens Haueisen;Karl-Jürgen Bär;Andreas Voss	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014		psychiatry;medicine;anesthesia;diabetes mellitus	HCI	17.70414492862854	-82.08666668480758	77714

Whilst a man rests on the chair, this sensor which is sensitive to force gives us a single electrical signal containing components reflective of cardiac-ballistocardiogram (BCG), respiratory, and body movements related motion. Among different measurements of body activities, BCG has the interesting property that no electrodes are needed to be attached to the body during recording, suitable to evaluate man heart condition in any place such as home, car, or his office. This paper describes briefly our developed HDD system and especially a combined intelligent signal processing method to detect, extract features and finally cluster BCG cycles for assisting medical doctors to diagnose heart diseases of person under test. Indeed, it is a fully automatic system which is not very sensitive to the BCG latency as well as non-linear disturbance. It uses high resolution Biorthogonal wavelet transforms to extract essential BCG features and to cluster those using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Some evaluations using recordings from normal young, normal old and abnormal old volunteers indicated that our combined method is reliable and has high performance. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However critical events such as unplanned extubations are considered as not predictable. This paper seeks to evaluate the ability of automated prediction systems based on feature space embedding and time series methods to predict unplanned extubations in paediatric intensive care patients. We try to exploit the trends in the physiological signals such as Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, Systolic Blood Pressure and Oxygen saturation levels in the blood using signal processing aspects of a frame-based approach of expanding signals using a nonorthogonal basis derived from the data. We investigate the significance of the trends in a computerised prediction system. The results are compared with clinical observations of predictability. We will conclude by investigating whether the prediction capability of the system could be exploited to prevent future unplanned extubations.	anomaly detection;baseline (configuration management);decision support system;feature vector;inference engine;signal processing;time series	B.

METHOD Cardiotocograms from a population of 59 healthy and 61 IUGR fetuses from the 30th gestation week matched for gestational age were included. APRS and DPRS analysis was compared to the standard linear and nonlinear cCTG parameters. Statistical analysis was performed through the t-test, ANOVA test, Pearson correlation test and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves (p < 0, 05).   RESULTS APRS and DPRS showed high performance to discriminate between Healthy and IUGR fetuses, according to gestational week. A linear correlation with the fetal pH at birth was found in IUGR. The area under the ROC curve was 0.865 for APRS and 0.900 for DPRS before the 34th gestation week.   CONCLUSIONS APRS and DPRS could be useful in the identification and management of IUGR fetuses and in the prediction of the neonatal outcome, especially before the 34th week of gestation.	area under curve;convergence insufficiency;deceleration;fetal growth retardation;fetal heart;fetus;fifty nine;intrauterine;nonlinear system;onset (audio);placental insufficiency;pregnancy;receiver operator characteristics;receiver operating characteristic;structure of ductus venosus;tomography, emission-computed;tracing (software);interest;t test	Salvatore Tagliaferri;Andrea Fanelli;Giuseppina Esposito;Francesca Giovanna Esposito;Giovanni Magenes;Maria G.

34912edb1cf0576ff36ca9c4f651237f9115deed	musical instrument recognition in user-generated videos using a multimodal convolutional neural network architecture		This paper presents a method for recognizing musical instruments in user-generated videos. Musical instrument recognition from music signals is a well-known task in the music information retrieval (MIR) field, where current approaches rely on the analysis of the good-quality audio material. This work addresses a real-world scenario with several research challenges, i.e. the analysis of user-generated videos that are varied in terms of recording conditions and quality and may contain multiple instruments sounding simultaneously and background noise. Our approach does not only focus on the analysis of audio information, but we exploit the multimodal information embedded in the audio and visual domains. In order to do so, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which combines learned representations from both modalities at a late fusion stage. Our approach is trained and evaluated on two large-scale video datasets: YouTube-8M and FCVID. The proposed architectures demonstrate state-of-the-art results in audio and video object recognition, provide additional robustness to missing modalities, and remains computationally cheap to train.	artificial neural network;automatic sounding;baseline (configuration management);convolutional neural network;cross-correlation;embedded system;feature learning;human reliability;image noise;information retrieval;machine learning;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;network architecture;outline of object recognition;user-generated content	Olga Slizovskaia;Emilia Gómez;Gloria Haro	2017		10.1145/3078971.3079002	modalities;music information retrieval;computer science;machine learning;artificial intelligence;convolutional neural network;robustness (computer science);architecture;computer vision;background noise;exploit;multimedia information retrieval	AI	-3.7343645247282273	-88.03805034714236	78618

To study the safety of extracts squeezed from A. blazei fruit-body, we examined 30 healthy persons that were 40-60 years old (14 males and 16 females, averaged age 46.4). The subjects were divided into two groups, one group was taken 50mL/day (the amount of normal during a day) of A. blazei extracts and the other group was taken 150mL/day (3 times of the normal) of it for 4 weeks. No abnormal clinical findings were observed from the physical examination, blood analysis and interviews in all subjects. These results suggested that A. blazei extracts of 50-150mL at a daily is safe in healthy persons.

AALO applies data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings so that each cluster represents instances of the same activity. Users only need to label each cluster as an activity as opposed to labeling all instances of all activities. Once the clusters are associated to their corresponding activities, our system can recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocesses raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. The evaluation of activity recognition performance on a 26-day dataset shows that compared to Naive Bayesian (NB), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Hidden Semi Markov Model (HSMM) based activity recognition systems, our average time slice error (24.15%) is much lower than NB (53.04%), and similar to HMM (29.97%) and HSMM (26.29%). Thus, our active learning based approach performs as good as the state of the art supervised techniques (HMM and HSMM).	activity recognition;bayesian network;data mining;ground truth;hidden markov model;hidden semi-markov model;ibm notes;markov chain;ntsc;naive bayes classifier;preemption (computing);preprocessor;usability	Enamul Hoque;John A.

3e4291043c940d19961dbc7a188e8fee68dc6769	automated recognition of hypertension through overnight continuous hrv monitoring		Hypertension is a common and chronic disease, caused by high blood pressure. Since hypertension often has no warning signs or symptoms, many cases remain undiagnosed. Untreated or sub-optimally controlled hypertension may lead to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, along with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Therefore, it could be quite valuable to predict or provide early warnings about hypertension. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis has emerged as the most valuable non-invasive test to assess autonomic nervous system function, and has great potential for detecting hypertension. However, HRV indicators may be subtle and present at random, resulting in two challenges: how to support continuous monitoring for hours at a time while being unobtrusive, and how to efficiently analyze the collected data to minimize data collection and user burden. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach for detecting hypertension, using a waist belt continuous sensing system that is worn overnight. Using 24 hypertension patients and 24 healthy controls, we demonstrate that our approach can differentiate hypertension patients from healthy controls with 93.33% accuracy. This represents a promising approach for performing hypertension classification in the field, and also we would improve its performance based on a large number of hypertensive subjects monitored by the proposed pervasive sensors.

The basic framework was presented in our previous work [1]. The method decomposes a non-stationary neural response into a number of oscillatory modes varying in information content. After the spectral information analysis only few modes, taking part in stimulus coding, are retrieved for further analysis. The improvements and enhancement have been proposed for the steps involved in information quantification and modes extraction. An investigation has also been carried out for compression of retrieved informative modes of the neural signal in order to achieve a lower bit rate using the proposed framework. Experimental results are presented.

4bbaeacc75cf860812201f20b5c6f3806e7c6a5e	using embedded sensors in smartphones to monitor and detect early symptoms of exercise-induced asthma		This paper describes work in progress on integrated design architecture for monitoring and detecting early symptoms of asthma attack using smartphone as sensors’ platform for data capturing, processing, presentation and feedback. We present an application scenario of exercise-induced asthma where a patient wears a smartphone equipped with built-in sensors which are capable of providing clinical data and context on detection of any anomaly in the monitored vital signs. Our design architecture extends the functionality of “Nine-degree of Freedom” (9-DoF) sensor fusion model and context recognition using expert system frameworks. The design centers on the idea of creating a simple and portable asthma monitoring system that is able to detect asthma vital signs, perform signal analysis and context generation; and also send information to other mobile devices worn by caregivers and physicians. This approach removes the need to have external monitoring sensors patched on the user’s body, thereby enhancing the usability and reliability of the system in providing timely information on the state of a patient’s health.	anomaly detection;automatic identification and data capture;embedded system;expert system;mobile device;sensor;signal processing;smartphone;usability	Chinazunwa Uwaoma;Gunjan Mansingh	2014		10.5220/0004806901450150	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation	HCI	5.968584608716438	-88.89055769841619	79066

In this paper a Block-based Neural Network (BBNN) has been used as the classifier. The BBNN is created from 2-D array of blocks which are connected to each other. The internal structure of each block depends on the number of incoming and outgoing signals. The overall construction of the network is determined by the moving of signals through the network blocks. The Network structure and the weights are optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The input of the BBNN is a vector which its elements are the features extracted from the ECG signals. In this paper Hermit function coefficient and temporal features which atient specific CG signal classification have been extracted from ECG signals, create the input vector of the BBNN. The BBNN parameters have been optimized by PSO algorithm which can overcome the possible changes of ECG signals from time-totime and/or person-to-person variations. Therefore the trained BBNN has an unique structure for each person. The performance evaluation using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database shows a high classification accuracy of 97%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Typical MRI measures of disease burden in MS demonstrate modest to poor correlation with disability. Functional MRI and DTI-based fiber tracking were used to define the interhemispheric white matter pathway connecting bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA) in 16 MS patients sand 16 control subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), longitudinal (lambda(1)) and transverse diffusivity (lambda(2)) were measured along this pathway in all subjects. Mean FA was 0.587 +/- 0.032 for patients and 0.608 +/- 0.020 for controls (P < 0.02). Mean MD was (0.821 +/- 0.055) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for patients and (0.770 +/- 0.020) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for controls (P < 0.004). Mean lambda(1) values were (1.462 +/- 0.099) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for patients and (1.400 +/- 0.034) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for controls (P < 0.02). Mean lambda(2) values were (0.500 +/- 0.047) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for patients and (0.454 +/- 0.027) x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) for controls (P < 0.001). In addition, the correlation between the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) and transverse diffusivity was -0.341 (P < 0.05). The component test of the MSFC most related to the SMA pathway studied with our MRI method (Nine-hole Peg Test) showed significant correlation with transverse diffusivity (r = 0.392, P < 0.02), indicating that probing functional pathways with MRI measures can lead to a better reflection of disease status.	bilateral filter;diffusion tensor imaging;fractional anisotropy;gene regulatory network;molecular dynamics;motor cortex;multiple sclerosis;myelitis, transverse;patients;tissue fiber;transverse wave;unit testing;white matter;supplemental motor area proper	Mark J.

Following this approach, an Android™ smart phone device is proposed as a mobile monitoring terminal to observe and analyze ECG (electrocardiography) waveforms from wearable ECG devices in real time under the coverage of a wireless sensor network (WSN). The exploitation of WSN in healthcare is able to substitute the complicated wired technology, moving healthcare away from a fixed location setting.

The paper therefore presents elements of a system structure for lifestyle monitoring and shows how this structure can incorporate a range of approaches to interpretation and analysis, illustrating this with reference to practical trials involving numeric, analytic and statistical methods as well as a machine learning based approach.

8ea2a1f4052fd1563fb86628cfb091128349d7c8	wireless respiratory monitoring and coughing detection using a wearable patch sensor network		Wireless body sensors are increasingly used by clinicians and researchers, in a wide range of applications such as sports, space engineering and medicine. Monitoring vital signs in real time can dramatically increase diagnosis accuracy and enable automatic curing procedures, e.g. detect and stop epilepsy or narcolepsy seizures. Breathing parameters are critical in oxygen therapy, hospital and ambulatory monitoring, while the assessment of cough severity is essential when dealing with several diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this paper, a real-time low-power wireless respiratory monitoring system with cough detection is proposed to measure the breathing rate and the frequency of coughing. This system uses wearable wireless multimodal patch sensors, designed using low power off the shelf components. These wearable sensors use a low-power 9-axis inertial measurement unit to measure the respiratory frequency, and a MEMs microphone to perform cough detection. The architecture of the wireless patch-sensor is presented. The acquisition unit, the wireless communication unit and the data processing algorithms are described. The proposed network performance is presented for experimental tests with a freely behaving user.	algorithm;ct pulmonary angiogram;low-power broadcasting;microelectromechanical systems;microphone;multimodal interaction;network performance;radio frequency;real-time clock;sensor;shutdown (computing);wearable computer	Tamer Elfaramawy;Cheikh Latyr Fall;Martin Morissette;Francois Lellouche;Benoit Gosselin	2017	2017 15th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2017.8010139	inertial measurement unit;computer science;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;wireless;breathing;respiratory monitoring;wearable computer;microphone;network performance	Mobile	9.672277482659995	-88.33500070350028	79672

Sleep monitoring by itself is a difficult problem due to both privacy and technical considerations.  The proposed system uses a combination of non-invasive sensors to assess and report sleep patterns and breathing activity: a contact-based pressure mattress and a non-contact 2D image acquisition device. To evaluate our system, we used real data collected in Heracleia Lab's assistive living apartment. Our system uses Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques to automatically analyze the collected data, recognize sleep patterns and track the breathing behavior. It is non-invasive, as it does not disrupt the user's usual sleeping behavior and it can be used both at the clinic and at home with minimal cost. Going one step beyond, we developed a mobile application for visualizing the analyzed data and monitor the patient's sleep status remotely.	behavioral pattern;computer vision;machine learning;mobile app;multimodal interaction;privacy;sensor;tire-pressure monitoring system	Michalis Papakostas;James Staud;Fillia Makedon;Vangelis Metsis	2015		10.1145/2769493.2769585	simulation;computer science;machine learning	HCI	6.751856242429474	-86.96341404009759	79732

Recently, a simple method has been proposed for the evaluation of the local aortic stiffness (AoStiff) using a non-invasive bioelectrical impedance (BI) technique. This approach relies on a novel interpretation of the arterial stiffness where AoStiff is computed from the measurement of two new BI variables: (1) the local aortic flow resistance (AoRes) exerted by the drag forces onto the flow; (2) the local aortic wall distensibility (AoDist). Herein, we propose to detail and compare these three indices with the reference pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement and the direct assessment of the aortic drag forces (DF) and distensibility (DS) obtained by the magnetic resonance imaging technique. Our results show a significant correlation between AoStiff and PWV (r = 0.79; P < 0.0001; 120 patients at rest; mean age 44 ± 16 years), and also between AoRes and DF (r = 0.95; P = 0.0011) and between AoDist and DS (r = 0.93; P = 0.0022) on eight patients at rest (mean age 52 ± 19 years). These first results suggest that local aortic stiffness can be explored reliably by the BI technique.	aortic stiffness;bioelectrical impedance;characteristic impedance;direction finding;imaging techniques;kerrison predictor;magnetic resonance imaging;morbidity - disease rate;para-aortic node;patients;pulse wave velocity;quantitative impedance;the wall street journal;velocity (software development);physical hard work	Mathieu Collette;Alain Lalande;Serge Willoteaux;Georges Leftheriotis;Anne Humeau-Heurtier	2011	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-011-0741-3	electronic engineering;radiology;medicine;engineering;magnetic resonance imaging;drag;nuclear magnetic resonance;physics;surgery	ML	15.026079844648075	-84.50303868837703	79789

db158fb3d13955fd9ec453de1e1e09c25734cc6e	rhythm and quality classification from short ecgs recorded using a mobile device		Introduction: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Its prevalence is 12% of the general population and it is associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Methods: The AliveCor mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) device was used to collect data. The Physionet Challenge aimed to create an intelligent algorithm for automated rhythm and quality classification. A database of 8528 single lead ECG was used for training and a closed database of3658 ECG recordings was used for testing the participants algorithms on the Challenge server. The RR interval time-series was first estimated using a R-peak detector. Signal quality was estimated on a second-by-second basis and the continuous sub-segment with the highest quality was selected for further analysis. A number of features were estimated: heart rate variability (time domain based, fragmentation, coefficient of sample entropy etc.), ECG morphology (QRS length, QT interval etc.) and the presence of ectopic beats. The features were used to train support vector machine classifiers in a one-vs.-rest approach. Results: For the final score of the challenge we obtained an overall F ι measure on the test set of 0.80. Conclusion: The feature based machine learning approach showed high performance in distinguishing between the different rhythms represented in the Challenge. This opens the horizon for computer automated interpretation of single lead mobile ECG.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;coefficient;fragmentation (computing);heart rate variability;machine learning;mathematical morphology;mobile device;precision rectifier;rapid refresh;relative atrial index;sample entropy;server (computing);support vector machine;test set;time series	Joachim A.

A 10-fold cross-validation on all three methods was applied and the results were compared to expert performance. The results indicate that the multilayer perceptron had significantly higher specificity (correctly classified normals) than both the other classifiers and experts.

Sleep analysis is a necessary process for the majority of sleep disorders diagnosis. In this work we propose to analyze brain activity through Electroencephalogram analysis in order to identify sleep stages variation. We focus on the classification phase. Most works in sleep stages classification are based on prior experts signal scoring which is a hard task. So many available unlabeled data remain unused. To explore more these data and enrich the study of sleep classification, we propose a hybrid approach based on learning classifier systems and artificial neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using real electroencephalography data. Good results were reached comparing to supervised learning methods usually used. The proposed approach provides also, an explicit model that could be analyzed a posteriori by experts.	artificial neural network;electroencephalography;learning classifier system;statistical classification;supervised learning	Abdelhamid Ouanes;Lilia Rejeb	2016		10.1145/2908812.2908910	orbital hybridisation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;artificial neural network	AI	16.010395730990105	-90.0263438625049	80287

In the lack of an objective method to assess this moment, the development of a new methodology is needed. In this observational study, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures that were associated with the moment of LOC are examined as a starting point, so as to create a robust model for tracking the dynamic changes between conscious and unconscious states. The data from 12 patients under general anesthesia for neurosurgical procedures with remifentanil and propofol, are used is this study. Multitaper spectrograms were computed to observe the dynamics of EEG oscillations before and after LOC. At LOC, a decrease in gamma power and an increase in delta and alpha bands were identified.	altered level of consciousness;antivirus software;dec alpha;electroencephalography;electronic signature;spectrogram	Ana L.

d6f72c5cfd1700187856e5627a5f5484c4e22ed3	effect of age on human-computer interface control via neck electromyography		The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of age on visuomotor tracking using submental and anterior neck surface electromyography (sEMG) to assess feasibility of computer control via neck musculature, which allows people with little remaining motor function to interact with computers. Thirty-two healthy adults participated: sixteen younger adults aged 18 - 29 years and sixteen older adults aged 69 - 85 years. Participants modulated sEMG to achieve targets presented at different amplitudes using real-time visual feedback. Root-mean-squared (RMS) error was used to quantify tracking performance. RMS error was increased for older adults relative to younger adults. Older adults demonstrated more RMS error than younger adults as a function of increasing target amplitude. The differential effects of age found on static tracking performance in anterior neck musculature suggest more difficult translation of human-computer-interfaces controlled using anterior neck musculature for static tasks to older populations.	application program interface;area striata structure;computer control company;deglutition disorders;human–computer interaction;modality (human–computer interaction);modulation;population;rms;real-time clock;rhabditoides regina;root mean square;root-finding algorithm;set of muscles;sixteen;sixty nine;skeletal muscle structure of neck;surface electromyography;teleogryllus emma;thraustochytrium sp. kl2;tooth root structure;alpha-linolenic acid	Gabrielle L.

This study presents the true random number generation from bioelectrical signals like EEG, EMG, and EOG and physical signals, such as blood volume pulse, GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), and respiration. The signals used in the random number generation were taken from BNCIHORIZON2020 databases. Random number generation was performed from fifteen different signals (four from EEG, EMG, and EOG and one from respiration, GSR, and blood volume pulse datasets). For this purpose, each signal was first normalized and then sampled. The sampling was achieved by using a nonperiodic and chaotic logistic map. Then, XOR postprocessing was applied to improve the statistical properties of the sampled numbers. NIST SP 800-22 was used to observe the statistical properties of the numbers obtained, the scale index was used to determine the degree of nonperiodicity, and the autocorrelation tests were used to monitor the 0-1 variation of numbers. The numbers produced from bioelectrical and physical signals were successful in all tests. As a result, it has been shown that it is possible to generate personally identifiable real random numbers from both bioelectrical and physical signals.	authentication;autocorrelation;database;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;exclusive or;galvanic skin response;galvanic isolation;key generation;logistic map;pulse;random number generation;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action	Seda Arslan Tuncer;Turgay Kaya	2018		10.1155/2018/3579275	machine learning;logistic map;autocorrelation;sampling (statistics);normalization (statistics);random number generation;statistics;artificial intelligence;skin conductance;electroencephalography;pulse (signal processing);computer science	ML	18.80546518540941	-88.2987862682971	80809

In the future, machine will be able to understand human intention and communicate with human even though there is no explicit expression such as speech, gesture, etc. In this study, a new experiment design is proposed to understand human intention by using electroencephalography (EEG). Two types of stimulus are given to the subjects; affirmative and negative sentences. Each sentence was separated by two blocks which are contents and sentence end. Subjects were asked to make a decision of agreement or disagreement after sentence end is shown. Based on the EEG analysis, intention to the sentences was found while seeing contents, i.e., before giving an explicit answer. It is shown that decision making is done before the end of the sentence, and answering “Yes” or “No” is determined only up to the sentence end. This study shows the relationship of implicit intention and average event-related potentials (ERPs) at the frontal sites and how to predict implicit intention based on the central frontal ERPs using support vector machine (SVM).	design of experiments;electroencephalography;gesture recognition;human computer;human–computer interaction;speech recognition;support vector machine	Suh-Yeon Dong;Soo-Young Lee	2012	The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252753	natural language processing;support vector machine;speech recognition;electroencephalography;computer science;machine learning	AI	11.255884754221919	-92.3648188755633	80876

Of the world's /spl sim/50 million people with epilepsy, fully 1/3 have seizures that are not controlled by anti-convulsant medication. The field of seizure prediction, in which engineering technologies are used to decode brain signals and search for precursors of impending epileptic seizures, holds great promise to elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying the disorder, as well as to enable implantable devices to intervene in time to treat epilepsy. There is currently an explosion of interest in this field in academic centers and medical industry with clinical trials underway to test potential prediction and intervention methodology and devices for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. This invited paper presents an overview of the application of signal processing methodologies based upon the theory of nonlinear dynamics to the problem of seizure prediction. Broader application of these developments to a variety of systems requiring monitoring, forecasting and control is a natural outgrowth of this field.	cerebrovascular accident;convulsants;epilepsy;implants;mood disorders;nonlinear dynamics;projections and predictions;seizures;signal processing;united states food and drug administration	Leon D.

A generalized classifier using few subject specific sample will ease the real world implementation of motor imagery based BCI. At first, this paper applies an improved active transfer learning (ATL) on motor imagery based BCI. Then, it proposes a noble method of transferring selective instances (selected by few new subject specific data) from other subjects to new subject combining with selecting most informative subject specific data determined by active learning. Experimental results on BCI competition IV 2B dataset show that improved ATL works well on six out of nine subjects and proposed SIITAL method overcomes ATL limitation for other subjects. This means, it can achieve similar or better accuracy with a lower quantity of subject specific training data. Thus, it reduces the calibration effort.	active learning (machine learning);algorithm;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;information;naive bayes classifier	Ibrahim Hossain;Abbas Khosravi;Saeid Nahavandi	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727726	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	14.081146426239906	-92.86192542447344	81174
334dc234b52d5b05151968e295c4653a97795af6	automatic detection of epilepsy and seizure using multiclass sparse extreme learning machine classification		An automatic detection system for distinguishing normal, ictal, and interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is of great help in clinical practice. This paper presents a three-class classification system based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the nonlinear sparse extreme learning machine (SELM) for epilepsy and epileptic seizure detection. Three-level lifting DWT using Daubechies order 4 wavelet is introduced to decompose EEG signals into delta, theta, alpha, and beta subbands. Considering classification accuracy and computational complexity, the maximum and standard deviation values of each subband are computed to create an eight-dimensional feature vector. After comparing five multiclass SELM strategies, the one-against-one strategy with the highest accuracy is chosen for the three-class classification system. The performance of the designed three-class classification system is tested with publicly available epilepsy dataset. The results show that the system achieves high enough classification accuracy by combining the SELM and DWT and reduces training and testing time by decreasing computational complexity and feature dimension. With excellent classification performance and low computation complexity, this three-class classification system can be utilized for practical epileptic EEG detection, and it offers great potentials for portable automatic epilepsy and seizure detection system in the future hardware implementation.	apricot kernel oil;classification;computation (action);computational complexity theory;conflict (psychology);discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsy;feature extraction;feature vector;learning disorders;lifting scheme;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;oddworld: abe's oddysee;performance;polynomial kernel;seizures;silo (dataset);simulation;sparse matrix;standard deviation	Yuanfa Wang;Zunchao Li;Lichen Feng;Chuang Zheng;Wenhao Zhang	2017		10.1155/2017/6849360	wavelet;machine learning;epileptic seizure;electroencephalography;computer science;feature vector;computational complexity theory;ictal;extreme learning machine;speech recognition;discrete wavelet transform;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	ML	18.42764141025114	-91.05902182252079	81247

To improve the rehabilitation effect of fine motor function of forearms, a couple of recent studies focused on methods that try to decode the limb motion intent of patients through physical exercises. However, there exist a few studies on real-time active rehabilitation method for the classification of multiple hand movements. In the current investigate, a pattern-recognition based rehabilitation environment was set up using high-density surface electromyogram (HD-sEMG) and the real-time classification performance of 21 forearm motions was investigated with eight healthy subjects. The results showed that the average motion completion rate across all subjects was 91.17% + 2.86%, which suggests the potential of intention-initiated approach in assistive rehabilitation technique.	assistive technology;electromyography;existential quantification;pattern recognition;real-time clock;real-time locating system	Yue Wei;Yanjuan Geng;Wenlong Yu;Oluwarotimi Williams Samuel;Naifu Jiang;Hui Zhou;Xingjie Guo;Xiaoqiang Lu;Guanglin Li	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR)	10.1109/RCAR.2017.8311868	physical medicine and rehabilitation;upper limb;forearm;rehabilitation;computer science;electromyography	Robotics	12.359047774149749	-91.84969363371232	81271
d67bb9e4e555af0b6ac6e66313e26504dcf62f1a	application of the relative wavelet energy to heart rate independent detection of atrial fibrillation	articulo;relative wavelet energy;atrial fibrillation;automatic detection;stationary wavelet transform;electrocardiogram	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a growing healthcare burden worldwide. It is often asymptomatic and may appear as episodes of very short duration; hence, the development of methods for its automatic detection is a challenging requirement to achieve early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The present work introduces a novel method exploiting the relative wavelet energy (RWE) to automatically detect AF episodes of a wide variety in length.   METHODS The proposed method analyzes the atrial activity of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), i.e., the TQ interval, thus being independent on the ventricular activity. To improve its performance under noisy recordings, signal averaging techniques were applied. The method's performance has been tested with synthesized recordings under different AF variable conditions, such as the heart rate, its variability, the atrial activity amplitude or the presence of noise. Next, the method was tested with real ECG recordings.   RESULTS Results proved that the RWE provided a robust automatic detection of AF under wide ranges of heart rates, atrial activity amplitudes as well as noisy recordings. Moreover, the method's detection delay proved to be shorter than most of previous works. A trade-off between detection delay and noise robustness was reached by averaging 15 TQ intervals. Under these conditions, AF was detected in less than 7 beats, with an accuracy higher than 90%, which is comparable to previous works.   CONCLUSIONS Unlike most of previous works, which were mainly based on quantifying the irregular ventricular response during AF, the proposed metric presents two major advantages. First, it can perform successfully even under heart rates with no variability. Second, it consists of a single metric, thus turning its clinical interpretation and real-time implementation easier than previous methods requiring combined indices under complex classifiers.

The new system estimates stress level in real time using heart rate variability and patient activity cycles, and provides relaxation exercises instantaneously to help manage stress. The system relies on a wearable sensor to collect data (i.e., heart rate and respiration rate) and transmits data to Smartphones using Bluetooth to further process data. We also introduce a new breathing template matching algorithm to identify the best breathing exercise for users. A 2D visualization display shows that stress can be effectively relieved by the proposed stress management system.	algorithm;bluetooth;heart rate variability;linear programming relaxation;mobile device;mobile operating system;sensor;smartphone;template matching;wearable computer;wearable technology	Kemeng Chen;Wolfgang Fink;Janet Roveda;Richard D.

The RSVP task is advantageous because it can be performed at a high temporal rate. The rate of the RSVP sequence is controlled by the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between subsequent stimuli. When used within the context of a BMI, an RSVP task with short SOA could increase the information throughput of the system while also allowing for stimulus repetitions. However, reducing the SOA also increases the perceptual degradation caused by presenting two stimuli in close succession, and it decreases the target-to-target interval (TTI), which can increase the cognitive demands of the task. These negative consequences of decreasing the SOA could affect on the EEG signal measured in the task and degrade the performance of the BMI. Here we systematically investigate the effects of SOA and stimulus repetition (r) on single-trial target detection in an RSVP task. Ten healthy volunteers participated in an RSVP task in four conditions that varied in SOA and repetitions (SOA=500 ms, r=1; SOA=250 ms, r=2; SOA=166 ms, r=3; and SOA=100 ms, r=5) while processing time across conditions was controlled. There were two key results: First, when controlling for the number of repetitions, single-trial performance increases when the SOA decreases. Second, when the repetitions were combined, the best performance (AUC=0.967) was obtained with the shortest SOA (100 ms). These results suggest that shortening the SOA in an RSVP task has the benefit of increasing the performance relative to longer SOAs, and it also allows a higher number of repetitions of the stimuli in a limited amount of time.	adult-onset still disease;area striata structure;asynchronous i/o;brain neoplasms;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography phase synchronization;elegant degradation;onset (audio);perseveration;short;succession;throughput	Hubert Cecotti;Miguel P.

407c06f6ab37d56863a54b43319f6cd209b40702	a distributed architecture for multimodal emotion identification		This paper introduces a distributed multiagent system architecture for multimodal emotion identification, which is based on simultaneous analysis of physiological parameters from wearable devices, human behaviors and activities, and facial micro-expressions. Wearable devices are equipped with electrodermal activity, electrocardiogram, heart rate, and skin temperature sensor agents. Facial expressions are monitored by a vision agent installed at the height of the human’s head. Also, the activity of the user is monitored by a second vision agent mounted overhead. The emotion is refined as a cooperative decision taken at a central agent node denominated “Central Emotion Detection Node” from the local decision offered by the three agent nodes called “Face Expression Analysis Node”, “Behavior Analysis Node” and “Physiological Data Analysis Node”. This way, the emotion identification results are outperformed through an intelligent fuzzy-based decision making technique.	distributed computing;multimodal interaction	Marina V.

Such training involves two interacting processes: the patient trying to move and the robot applying forces to the patient's arm. A fundamental principle of motor learning is that movement practice improves motor function; the role of applied robotic forces in improving motor function is still unclear. This article reviews our work addressing this question. Our pilot study using the Assisted Rehabilitation and Measurement (ARM) Guide, a linear robotic trainer, found that mechanically assisted reaching improved motor recovery similar to unassisted reaching practice. This finding is inconclusive because of the small sample size (n = 19), but suggest that future studies should carefully control the amount of voluntary movement practice delivered to justify the use of robotic forces. We are optimistic that robotic forces will ultimately show additional therapeutic benefits when coupled with movement practice. We justify this optimism here by comparing results from the ARM Guide and the Mirror Image Movement Enabler robotic trainer. This comparison suggests that requiring a patient to generate specific patterns of force before allowing movement is more effective than mechanically completing movements for the patient.

Past research showed that monitoring patient breathing can lower the associated mortality rates for long-term bedridden patients. Nowadays, in-bed sensors consisting of pressure sensitive arrays are unobtrusive and are suitable for deployment in a wide range of settings. Such systems aim to extract respiratory signals from time-series pressure sequences. However, variance of movements, such as unpredictable extremities activities, affect the quality of the extracted respiratory signals. BreathSens, a high-density pressure sensing system made of e-Textile, profiles the underbody pressure distribution and localizes torso area based on the high-resolution pressure images. With a robust bodyparts localization algorithm, respiratory signals extracted from the localized torso area are insensitive to arbitrary extremities movements. In a study of 12 subjects, BreathSens demonstrated its respiratory monitoring capability with variations of sleep postures, locations, and commonly tilted clinical bed conditions.	alcohol-related disorders;body position;bonjour sleep proxy;deploy;extraction;how true feel alert right now;image resolution;limb structure;movement;patients;respiration;sample variance;sleep apnea syndromes;systems design;textiles;time series;trunk structure;unobtrusive javascript;algorithm;notification;sensor (device)	Jason J.

Mechanical devices are often expensive, cumbersome, patient specific and hand specific, while tracking-based devices are not affected by these limitations but, especially if based on a single tracking sensor, could suffer from occlusions. In this paper, the implementation of a multi-sensors approach, the Virtual Glove (VG), based on the simultaneous use of two orthogonal LEAP motion controllers, is described. The VG is calibrated and static positioning measurements are compared with those collected with an accurate spatial positioning system. The positioning error is lower than 6 mm in a cylindrical region of interest of radius 10 cm and height 21 cm. Real-time hand tracking measurements are also performed, analysed and reported. Hand tracking measurements show that VG operated in real-time (60 fps), reduced occlusions, and managed two LEAP sensors correctly, without any temporal and spatial discontinuity when skipping from one sensor to the other. A video demonstrating the good performance of VG is also collected and presented in the Supplementary Materials. Results are promising but further work must be done to allow the calculation of the forces exerted by each finger when constrained by mechanical tools (e.g., peg-boards) and for reducing occlusions when grasping these tools. Although the VG is proposed for rehabilitation purposes, it could also be used for tele-operation of tools and robots, and for other VR applications.	cerebrovascular accident;lvm;motion controller;numerous;obstruction;patients;positioning system;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;reflections of signals on conducting lines;region of interest;robot (device);telephone number;telerehabilitation;television;vr - veterans rand health survey;virtual reality;physical hard work;sensor (device)	Giuseppe Placidi;Luigi Cinque;Matteo Polsinelli;Matteo Spezialetti	2018		10.3390/s18030834	positioning system;electronic engineering;region of interest;computer vision;rehabilitation;virtual reality;engineering;artificial intelligence	Visualization	9.077589215325567	-83.66609573446935	82444

Modern Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) systems, especially applications designed for user training and assessment (e.g., educational or smart-rehabilitation systems), should be able to track and monitor those signals and adapt their parameters accordingly in order to optimally facilitate the special needs of each individual. Towards this end, we propose a passive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), using a wireless non-intrusive EEG sensor under a robot assisted training task designed for cognitive assessment. As part of this ongoing work, we demonstrate our initial results on predicting user's task performance, from the EEG signals, before task completion. Our findings highlight the potentials of our hypotheses as we achieve a maximum accuracy rate equal to 74% when evaluated on 69 real subjects.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;feature vector;gradient boosting;human–computer interaction;muse;real-time locating system;robot;smart tv;user interface;wearable technology	Michalis Papakostas;Konstantinos Tsiakas;Theodoros Giannakopoulos;Fillia Makedon	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	10.1109/BigData.2017.8258478	streams;machine learning;artificial intelligence;feature extraction;computer science;wearable technology;electroencephalography;cognitive assessment system	Robotics	12.294633425000915	-92.16702750264015	82472
70d35f054353b449948f5ffd2fdfaf3ab76d4e9a	a wearable device for online and long-term ecg monitoring		We present a prototype wearable device able to perform online and long-term monitoring of ECG signals, and automaticallydetect anomalous heartbeats such as arrhythmias. Our solution is based on userspecific dictionaries which characterizes the morphology of normal heartbeats and are learned every time the device is positioned. Anomalies are detected via an optimized sparse coding procedure, which assesses the conformance of each heartbeat to the user-specific dictionary. The dictionaries are adapted during online monitoring, to track heart rate variations occurring during everyday activities. Perhaps surprisingly, dictionary adaptation can be successfully performed by transformations that are user-independent and learned from large datasets of ECG signals.

The proposed solution is most effective if there is scarcity of healthcare providers or if putting them in the field expose them into a high risk environment such as fighting epidemics. In addition, the proposed system will also benefit routine checks in quarantine wards of hospitals where human reluctance of performing routine task by the healthcare providers can be avoided. Finally, it can also assist a doctor as a decision support system by using machine’s capability of number crunching while it examines through patient’s complete history, goes through every medical test reports and then applies data mining for catching possible ailments from his/her symptoms.	cloud computing;robotics;sensor	Arijit Sinharay;Arpan Pal;Snehasis Banerjee;Rohan Banerjee;Soma Bandyopadhyay;Parijat Deshpande;Ranjan Dasgupta	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-47063-4_59	computer security;medical test;scarcity;robot;cloud computing;computer science;decision support system;health care;robotics;internet of things;artificial intelligence	Robotics	4.967830357972831	-88.18849426927905	82524

This paper investigates for the first time the use of Permutation Entropy (PE) as a feature for automated epileptic seizure detection. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify segments of normal and epileptic EEG based on PE values. The proposed system utilizes the fact that the EEG during epileptic seizures is characterized by lower PE than normal EEG. It is shown that average sensitivity of 94.38% and average specificity of 93.23% is obtained by using PE as a feature to characterize epileptic and seizure-free EEG, while 100% sensitivity and specificity were also obtained in single-trial classifications.

2e4823977c619201c5e2ba1477116dd9e9797856	wavelet-based detection on muaps decomposed from semg under different levels of muscle isometric contraction		Decomposition of EMG (electromyography), in which the MUAPs (Motor Units Action Potentials) are extracted from the original EMG signals, is a useful approach for evaluating the physiological properties of muscles and studying the neural mechanism of human motions. Existing decomposition methods usually extracted the MUAPs via the waveform matching between the detected spikes and MUAP templates. However, those methods always involve too many artificial parameters and have no generally mathematical expression, which make them inflexible in practical applications and also cause poor robustness under interference. With respect to the problem, in this paper, a wavelet-based decomposition method is proposed to detect the “true” MUAPs from sEMG. Two standard Gaussian wavelets are firstly defined as the basic MUAP expressions; then, wavelet transform is performed to describe scales and magnitudes of different MUAPs from different nerve fibers. Experiments were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method, where MUAPs decomposed from sEMG under different levels of muscle contraction can be effectively detected by the method.	action potential;electromyography;experiment;image scaling;interference (communication);isometric projection;robustness (computer science);waveform;wavelet transform	Ziyou Li;Qichuan Ding;Xingang Zhao;Jianda Han;Guangjun Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324542	wavelet;wavelet transform;decomposition method (constraint satisfaction);robustness (computer science);control theory;engineering;gaussian;expression (mathematics);waveform;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;electromyography	Robotics	19.275181070722077	-90.11178027912324	82632

A three-layer lattice structure has been proposed, which can be used to combine the mass functions derived from sensors along with sensor context. The proposed model can be used to infer activities. Following evaluation of the proposed methodology it has been demonstrated that the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence can incorporate the uncertainty derived from the sensor errors and the sensor context and subsequently infer the activity using the proposed lattice structure. The results from this study show that this method can detect a toileting activity within a smart home environment with an accuracy of 88.2%.	activity recognition;categories;crystal structure;home automation;human activities;inference;multitier architecture;reading (activity);real-time clock;real-time computing;revision procedure;silo (dataset);smart environment;anatomical layer;sensor (device)	Jing Liao;Yaxin Bi;Chris D.

Noise of physiological origin that is present in the voxel time course is a prohibitive factor in the detection of small activation-induced BOLD signal changes. If the physiological noise contribution dominates over the temporal fluctuation contribution in the imaging voxel, further increases in the voxel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will have diminished corresponding increases in temporal signal-to-noise (TSNR), resulting in reduced corresponding increases in the ability to detect activation induced signal changes. On the other hand, if the thermal and system noise dominate (suggesting a relatively low SNR) further decreases in SNR can prohibit detection of activation-induced signal changes. Here we have proposed and called the """"suggested"""" voxel volume for fMRI the volume where thermal plus system-related and physiological noise variances are equal. Based on this condition we have created maps of fMRI suggested voxel volume from our experimental data at 3T, since this value will spatially vary depending on the contribution of physiologic noise in each voxel. Based on our fast EPI segmentation technique we have found that for gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) brain compartments the mean suggested cubical voxel volume is: (1.8 mm)3, (2.1 mm)3 and (1.4 mm)3, respectively. Serendipitously, (1.8 mm)3 cubical voxel volume for GM approximately matches the cortical thickness, thus optimizing BOLD contrast by minimizing partial volume averaging. The introduced suggested fMRI voxel volume can be a useful parameter for choice of imaging volume for functional studies."""	addresses (publication format);anatomical compartments;cerebrospinal fluid;coil device component;detectors;epilepsy, temporal lobe;gradient;gray matter;johnson–nyquist noise;map;multi-compartment model;population parameter;quantum fluctuation;resonance;signal-to-noise ratio;thickness (graph theory);voxel;white matter;biologic segmentation;blood oxygen level dependent;fmri	Jerzy Bodurka;Fei Ye;Natalia Petridou;Kevin Murphy;Peter A.

217cb4befa70a8d1553a5fcb2fc9d2bcb87828a3	feature selection evaluation for light human motion identification in frailty monitoring system		In order to plan and deliver health care in a world with increasing number of older people, human motion monitoring is a must in their surveillance, since the related information is crucial for understanding their physical status. In this article, we focus on the physiological function and motor performance thus we present a light human motion identification scheme together with preliminary evaluation results, which will be further exploited within the FrailSafe Project. For this purpose, a large number of time and frequency domain features extracted from the sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) and concatenated to a single feature vector are evaluated in a subject dependent cross-validation setting using SVMs. The mean classification accuracy reaches 96%. In a further step, feature ranking and selection is preformed prior to subject independent classification using the ReliefF ranking algorithm. The classification model using feature subsets of different size is evaluated in order to reveal the best dimensionality of the feature vector. The achieved accuracy is 97% which is a slight improvement compared to previous approaches evaluated on the same dataset. However, such an improvement can be considered significant given the fact that it is achieved with lighter processing using a smaller number of features.	algorithm;concatenation;cross-validation (statistics);end system;end-to-end principle;feature selection;feature vector;gyroscope;identification scheme;kinesiology;personalization;sequential minimal optimization	Evangelia Pippa;Iosif Mporas;Vasileios Megalooikonomou	2016		10.5220/0005912200880095	computer vision;pattern recognition;statistics	ML	4.5536165420245265	-84.5002180695643	82987

There is a need to increase the satisfaction level of hearing-aid users by adopting better strategies that involve modern technological advancements.   AIM To design and develop a decision support Software Intelligent System (SIS) that performs audiological investigations to assess the degree of hearing loss and to suggest appropriate hearing-aid gain values.   METHODS SIS is developed based on the study conducted in the Government General Hospital, Chennai, India, between 2013 and 2015. In the study period, audiological investigations were performed on 368 subjects, using the clinical audiometer (Inventis-Piano, Italy) and the SIS. Gain suggestions were recommended for hearing-aid users (Siemens Intuis life & Intuis-SP) using standard prescriptive procedures, alterations made by the audiologists, and by the SIS. It was developed with artificial neural network-based gain predictions.   RESULTS Of the tested subjects, 256 were identified as hearing-impaired. The calculated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the computerised audiometer incorporated in the SIS are 93%, 85% and 90% respectively. Furthermore, 86% of the hearing-impaired subjects were satisfied during their first hearing-aid trial with the gain recommendations from SIS.   CONCLUSION The findings suggest that the proposed SIS could be used to perform audiological screening tests and to recommend appropriate hearing-aid gain values to the hearing-impaired subjects. This could eventually be helpful for audiologists in the areas where routine mass audiological screening and fast hearing-aid solution is required.	aim alliance;audiometer;anatomic structures;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;congenital neurologic anomalies;decision support techniques;decision theory;pdgfb wt allele;sensitivity and specificity;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);solutions;units of measure - siemens;hearing impairment;physiological aspects	S.

Currently, the cares of elders and children existed some problems of management for several years. Therefore, the IoT is expanded to position and monitor walks of elders and children in a local area. However, the proposed positioning or monitoring systems have high costs and power consumption. In addition, most proposed systems are demanded to match up a smartphone, but the smartphones bring other problems for elders and children. Therefore, a wearable device positioning system, in this study, is proposed. This study main aims at addressing the challenges for those proposed systems to develop a low cost and power consumption system by wearable devices and raspberry pi boards through Bluetooth low energy (BLE) transmission.

Here we examine how practice in mental or manual (virtual) rotation, affects performance on mental and manual rotation tasks, compared to a control condition. Experiment 1 examined improvement on a mental rotation task following practice in mental or manual rotation. Both mental and manual rotation practice led to more efficient posttest performance. Experiment 2 examined improvement on a manual rotation task. Practice in manual but not mental rotation led to improved performance. Analyses of the manual rotation trajectories revealed no evidence of strategy differences. These results suggest that manual rotation may require additional processes outside of those needed for mental rotation.

One of the main applications in this field is foetal electrocardiogram (ECG) recovery by means of automatic methods. Evident problems found in the literature are the limited number of available registers, the lack of performance indicators, and the limited use of non-linear adaptive methods. In order to circumvent these problems, we first introduce the generation of synthetic registers and discuss the influence of different kinds of noise to the modelling. Second, a method which is based on numerical (correlation coefficient) and statistical (analysis of variance, ANOVA) measures allows us to select the best recovery model. Finally, finite impulse response (FIR) and gamma neural networks are included in the adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) scheme in order to provide highly non-linear, dynamic capabilities to the recovery model. Neural networks are benchmarked with classical adaptive methods such as the least mean squares (LMS) and the normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithms in simulated and real registers and some conclusions are drawn. For synthetic registers, the most determinant factor in the identification of the models is the foetal-maternal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, as the electromyogram contribution becomes more relevant, neural networks clearly outperform the LMS-based algorithm. From the ANOVA test, we found statistical differences between LMS-based models and neural models when complex situations (high foetal-maternal and foetal-noise SNRs) were present. These conclusions were confirmed after doing robustness tests on synthetic registers, visual inspection of the recovered signals and calculation of the recognition rates of foetal R-peaks for real situations. Finally, the best compromise between model complexity and outcomes was provided by the FIR neural network. Both the methodology for selecting a model and the introduction of advanced neural models are the main contributions of this paper.	algorithm;artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);biological neural networks;coefficient;dhrystone;electrocardiography;electromyography;finite impulse response;international normalized ratio;least mean squares filter;least-squares analysis;neural network simulation;neural tube defects;neural network software;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;processor register;sample variance;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;visual inspection	Gustavo Camps-Valls;Marcelino Martínez-Sober;Emilio Soria-Olivas;José Rafael Magdalena Benedito;Javier Calpe-Maravilla;Juan Guerrero-Martínez	2004	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2004.03.005	adaptive filter;speech recognition;nonlinear system;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	20.25149776146464	-90.21717267978154	83139

In the quest to receive feedback from the users in an unobtrusive manner, the combination of facial and hand gestures with prosody information allows us to infer the users’ emotional state, relying on the best performing modality in cases where one modality suffers from noise or bad sensing conditions. In this paper, we describe a multi-cue, dynamic approach to detect emotion in naturalistic video sequences. Contrary to strictly controlled recording conditions of audiovisual material, the proposed approach focuses on sequences taken from nearly real world situations. Recognition is performed via a ‘Simple Recurrent Network’ which lends itself well to modeling dynamic events in both user’s facial expressions and speech. Moreover this approach differs from existing work in that it models user expressivity using a dimensional representation of activation and valence, instead of detecting discrete ‘universal emotions’, which are scarce in everyday human-machine interaction. The algorithm is deployed on an audiovisual database which was recorded simulating human-human discourse and, therefore, contains less extreme expressivity and subtle variations of a number of emotion labels.	algorithm;artificial neural network;cognitive dimensions of notations;decision support system;human-centered computing;human–computer interaction;machine learning;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;neural networks;recurrent neural network;semantic prosody;sensor;simulation;unobtrusive javascript;williams tube	Kostas Karpouzis;George Caridakis;Loïc Kessous;Noam Amir;Amaryllis Raouzaiou;Lori Malatesta;Stefanos D.

The results of this validation confirm that the Kinect is well-suited for determining general parameters of a walking sequence (a Spearmans Correlation Coefficient (SCC) of 0.94 for average step length and 0.75 for average step time per walk), but we furthermore show that determining accurate results for single steps is more difficult (SCC of 0.74 for step length and 0.43 for step time for each step), making it harder to measure more complex gait parameters such as e.g. gait symmetry.	algorithm;coefficient;gait analysis;ground truth;kinect	Greet Baldewijns;Geert Verheyden;Bart Vanrumste;Tom Croonenborghs	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944976	effect of gait parameters on energetic cost;simulation;medicine;engineering;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;forensic engineering;computer security	Vision	11.778433802677625	-85.36664942001816	83180

Nevertheless, most current BCI systems rely on cues or tasks to which the subject has to react (i.e., synchronous BCIs). Such systems have limited applications in the real world. It is more desirable for the user to decide himself, when he likes to control a device. However, these so-called asynchronous BCI systems, that rely on electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements show the demand for higher accuracy and stability. Previously, hybrid BCI systems, relying on simultaneous EEG and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements, have been shown to increase the classification performance of (synchronous) motor imagery (MI) tasks. Here we present the first asynchronous hybrid BCI with encouraging results.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;modal logic	Min-Ho Lee;Siamac Fazli;Jan Mehnert;Seong-Whan Lee	2013	2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ACPR.2013.132	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;communication	Robotics	13.235791946055713	-92.57749851842019	83462

While the signal quality obtained by this device is as high as elaborate table- and bed-based BCG systems discussed previously in the literature, the standing posture required by this system may lead to undesired motion induced noise in the signal, particularly for elderly patients. Electromyogram (EMG) signals from the feet are proposed as a noise reference for the standing BCG measurement. The correlation between these signals and the BCG noise is quantified for a case with low (eyes open) and higher (eyes closed) involuntary movement on the scale. For the six subjects considered in this trial, the foot EMG appears to be a valuable reference for BCG movement noise estimation. Additionally, the fact that many bathroom scales have electrodes on the feet for various body fat percentage estimates makes the measurement highly practical for future implementations.	electromyography;poor posture	Omer T.

d38aff346ef6feb140ad36e2000990ecbca4744c	real-time gesture recognition using a particle filtering approach		In this paper we present an approach for real-time gesture recognition using exclusively 1D sensor data, based on the use of Particle Filters and Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging (DBA). In a training phase, sensor records of users performing different gestures are acquired. For each gesture, the associated sensor records are then processed by the DBA method to produce one average record called template gesture. Once trained, our system classifies one gesture performed in real-time, by computing -using particle filtersan estimation of its probability of belonging to each class, based on the comparison of the sensor values acquired in real-time to those of the template gestures. Our method is tested on the accelerometer data of the Multimodal Human Activities Dataset (MHAD) using the Leave-One-Out cross validation, and compared with state-ofthe-art approaches (SVM, Neural Networks) adapted for real-time gesture recognition. It manages to achieve a 85.30% average accuracy and outperform the others, without the need to define hyper-parameters whose choice could be restrained by real-time implementation considerations.	apache axis;dynamic time warping;experiment;gesture recognition;hyper-threading;multimodal interaction;neural networks;particle filter;quad flat no-leads package;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robustness (computer science);sensor;test set	Frédéric Li;Lukas Köping;Sebastian Schmitz;Marcin Grzegorzek	2017		10.5220/0006189603940401	computer vision;speech recognition	HCI	3.548458011927307	-85.47239299410106	83585

The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive criteria of the size of nodal metastases with SPIO-enhanced MR imaging in breast cancer, with histopathologic findings as reference standard.   METHODS This study included 150 patients with breast cancer. The patterns of SPIO uptake for positive sentinel nodes were classified into three; uniform high-signal intensity, partial high-signal intensity involving ≥50% of the node, and partial high-signal intensity involving <50% of the node. Imaging results were correlated with histopathologic findings.   RESULTS Thirty-three pathologically positive sentinel nodes from 30 patients were evaluated. High-signal intensity patterns that were uniform or involved ≥50% of the node were observed in 23 nodes that contained macro-metastases and no node that contained micro-metastases, while high-signal intensity patterns involving <50% of the node were observed in 2 nodes that contained macro-metastases and 8 nodes that contained micro-metastases. When the area of high-signal intensity was compared with the pathological size of the metastases, a pathologic >2 mm sentinel node metastases correlated with the area of high-signal intensity, however, a pathologic ≤2 mm sentinel node metastases did not.   CONCLUSIONS High-signal intensity patterns that are uniform or involve ≥50% of the node are features of nodes with macro-metastases. The area of high-signal intensity correlated with the pathological size of metastases for nodes with metastases >2 mm in this series.	anatomic node;cmos;classification;contain (action);histopathology;lymphangiography;mammary neoplasms;node - plant part;patients;reference standards;spio nanoparticle;sentinel node;ferric oxide;ferumoxides	Kazuyoshi Motomura;Tetsuta Izumi;Souichirou Tateishi;Hiroshi Sumino;Atsushi Noguchi;Takashi Horinouchi;Katsuyuki Nakanishi	2013		10.1186/1471-2342-13-32	risk assessment;radiology;medicine;pathology;prevalence;magnetic resonance imaging;medical physics	HPC	21.926051363266286	-81.65978900325496	83643

These pathologic EEG waveforms, once detected, often necessitate accute clinincal interventions, but these events are typically rare, highly variable between patients, and often hard to separate from background, making them difficult to reliably detect. We show that Deep Belief Nets (DBNs), a type of multi-layer generative neural network, can be used effectively for such EEG anomaly detection. We compare this technique to the state-of-the-art, a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), showing that the DBN outperforms the SVM by the F1 measure for our EEG dataset. We also show how the outputs of a DBN-based detector can be used to aid visualization of anomalies in large EEG data sets and propose a method for using DBNs to gain insight into which features of signals are characteristically anomalous. These findings show that Deep Belief Nets can facilitate human review of large amounts of clinical EEG as well as mining new EEG features that may be indicators of unusual activity.	anomaly detection;artificial neural network;deep belief network;electroencephalography;electronic signature;f1 score;layer (electronics);noise shaping;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;sensor;support vector machine;test set	Drausin Wulsin;Justin A.

3b691ca890a0694a5e1effb0e2fbd56d7abe67c2	towards adaptive deep brain stimulation in parkinson's disease: lfp-based feature analysis and classification		Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have applied the closed-loop control (adaptive DBS or aDBS) using feedback from local field potential (LFP) signals. However, current aDBS practices focus on simple feedback like beta band power and thresholding, without optimized control or classification algorithms. In this work, we study the capacity of several classifiers including automatic shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to predict motor impairment. We use 20 features extracted from both monopolar and bipolar LFPs in 12 PD patients. In our best setting, we achieve a median accuracy of 70.2%, sensitivity of 81.2% and prediction lead time of 0.1 s across patients. By including relevant features other than beta power, a 13.6% improvement in accuracy is achieved. Moreover, the Hjorth parameters and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) features perform best according to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) p-value and classifier weights. These results suggest a great potential to improve current aDBS system for PD, by implementing a classifier with multiple features.	algorithm;control theory;deep brain stimulation;direct-broadcast satellite;hjorth parameters;hybrid fibre-optic;least fixed point;linear discriminant analysis;thresholding (image processing)	Taige Wang;Mahsa Shoaran;Azita Emami-Neyestanak	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462472	pattern recognition (psychology);artificial intelligence;hjorth parameters;feature extraction;thresholding;deep brain stimulation;classifier (linguistics);pattern recognition;statistical classification;linear discriminant analysis;computer science	Visualization	16.045816508871855	-89.96103465636443	83751
3153df65bd3db0e0cac4eee856483f758ae3f4cb	task-generic mental fatigue recognition based on neurophysiological signals and dynamical deep extreme learning machine		Abstract The electroencephalography (EEG) based machine-learning model for mental fatigue recognition can evaluate the reliability of the human operator performance. The task-generic model is particularly important since the time cost for preparing the task-specific training EEG dataset is avoid. This study develops a novel mental fatigue classifier, dynamical deep extreme learning machine (DD-ELM), to adapt the variation of the EEG feature distributions across two mental tasks. Different from the static deep learning approaches, DD-ELM iteratively updates the shallow weights at multiple time steps during the testing stage. The proposed method incorporates the both of the merits from the deep network for EEG feature abstraction and the ELM autoencoder for fast weight recompuation. The feasibility of the DD-ELM is validated by investigating EEG datasets recorded under two paradigms of AutoCAMS human–machine tasks. The accuracy comparison indicates the new classifier significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art mental fatigue estimators. By examining the CPU time, the computational burden of the DD-ELM is also acceptable for high-dimensional EEG features.

Current methods are based on spontaneous EEG providing only indirect information on the reactivity of the brain. Measurement of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) has been shown to have additional potential for evaluation of the level of consciousness. Unfortunately, compact and easy-to-use devices are not commercially available. In this study a portable battery-powered device for clinical auditory ERP measurements was designed, constructed and validated. The device consists of a five-channel data logger and a 16-bit stereo audio stimulator. The signals are digitized with a 22-bit sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converter and stored to a PC Card hard disk. Prior to the in vivo application, the device was validated with extensive technical tests. Importantly, the RMS noise amplitude of the EEG channels was found to be less than 1 mivroV and the delivered auditory stimulus intensity corresponded accurately the settings (mean difference 0.2+/-0.5 dB). In addition to technical tests the device was successfully validated in vivo. To summarize, a novel portable instrument for measurement of auditory event-related potentials in intensive care environment is introduced.	16-bit;accident and emergency department;altered level of consciousness;analog;analog-to-digital converter;audio media;computer hard disc;converter device component;data logger;delta-sigma modulation;erp;electroencephalography;hard disk drive;hearing problem;less than;mobile device;pc card;power (psychology);sedation procedure;spontaneous order;video-in video-out;intensive care unit	Pekka Tiihonen;Jukka Kinnunen;Juha Töyräs;Esa Mervaala;Ari Pääkkönen	2008	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2007.10.010	event-related potential;speech recognition;computer science	ML	9.873738221197888	-89.45050113110008	84057
3d21d456165b6be71efd5fd440b874b7124be256	cochlear implants in the second and third millennia.	cochlear implant	Much has been achieved in the Second Millennium in the development of cochlear implants for profoundly deaf people, but further advances in the Third Millennium should result in most severely to profoundly deaf people being able to communicate effectively in a hearing community. 1. THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT The cochlear implant or Bionic Ear as illustrated in Fig. 1 is an electronic device that replaces the inner ear when it does not function in severely-to-profoundly deaf people. It consists of a directional microphone which sends information to a speech processor which is worn on the belt or behind the ear. The speech processor extracts information of importance to speech understanding, produces a code for the signal and transmits it by radiowaves to the receiverstimulator implanted in the mastoid bone. The receiverstimulator decodes the signal and produces a pattern of electrical stimulus currents in an array of electrodes inserted around the basal turn of the inner ear. Figure 1: A diagram of the University of Melbourne/Nucleus (Cochlear Limited) multiple-channel cochlear prosthesis. a microphone; b cable; c speech processor; d transmitter coil; e receiver stimulator; f electrode array; g cochlea; h auditory nerve (1). 2. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM In is now hard to realise that only in the 1960Õs and 1970Õs many scientists and clinicians said successful cochlear implants were not possible in the foreseeable future. The fundamental objections, which were reasonable, were as follows: · The first objection was that the cochlear hair cells and their nerve connections were too complex and numerous to be replaced by a small number of electrodes. This objection was partly answered by research to see how well electrical stimulation could reproduce the temporal and place coding of frequency in normal and deafened ears. It was found that rate of electrical stimuli could not reproduce discriminable pitch above about 300 Hz which is much less than the 3000 Hz needed for speech understanding. However, the research showed that for certain modes of stimulation electrical current could be localized to discrete groups of nerve fibres for the place coding of frequency. · The second objection was that there would not be enough residual hearing nerves in the cochlea after die back due to deafness for speech information to be transmitted. This objection was partly overcome through studies on the experimental animal where it was found that varying populations of spiral ganglion cells had no significant effect on the discrimination of rate of stimulation. Furthermore, studies on patients comparing various aetiologies, which have different mean ganglion cell numbers, have not shown a significant relationship between cell numbers and speech results. · The third objection was that implanting electrodes in the cochlea would destroy the very nerves it was hoped to stimulate. Studies had shown that damage of the basilar membrane could result in nearly total loss of the spiral ganglion cells in the vicinity of the injury. This objection was overcome by showing that the gentle insertion of electrodes with the right bio-mechanical properties did not lead to loss of ganglion cells nor did charge-balanced electrical stimulation. 5th International Conference on Spoken Language Processing (ICSLP 98) Sydney, Australia November 30 -December 4, 1998 ISCA Archive http://www.isca-speech.org/archive · The fourth objection was that speech was too complex to be presented to the nervous system for speech understanding to occur. This objection was resolved when it was appreciated that due to the limitations of reproducing the temporal and place coding of frequency because of an electroneural ÒbottleneckÓ, some form of pre-processing of speech was required. It was also established that speech information was best transmitted through the Òbottle-neckÓ if the electrical currents were not presented simultaneously to electrodes. Simultaneous stimulation led to an interaction of electrical fields which produced unpredictable variations in loudness. While attempting to determine the pre-processing of speech required it was noted that the patient reported vowel sounds rather than simple sounds when each electrode was stimulated, and the vowels varied according to the electrode stimulated. It was also realised that single formant vowels were perceived when similar locations in normal hearing people, were excited. As the second formant carries the most intelligibility a speech processing strategy was developed which extracted this second formant, and used the current level to stimulate the electrode closest to that frequency area in the cochlea. Voicing was presented as rate of stimulation, as it is low in frequencies that could be discriminated (Fig. 2) Figure 2: A diagram of the Second formant (F2)/ Fundamental frequency (F0) speech processing strategy for the word /wit/. This strategy enabled the first patient, who was postlinguistically deaf, to understand running speech when combined with lip-reading, and some speech using electrical stimulation alone. Further research has also shown that the extraction of additional formants or the outputs from band pass filters, and their presentation on a place coding basis, resulted in improved speech perception scores as shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3: CID open-set sentence scores for electric stimulation alone for the F0/F2, F0/F1/F2, Multipeak, SPEAK strategies on unselected patients at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Cochlear Implant Clinic three months postoperatively. The speech processor which presents the strategies is shown following the strategy (1). The improved results obtained by progressively increasing the amount of information presented on a place coding basis, as well as the way the information is extracted from speech, have now produced results that enable a majority of profoundly and post-linguistically deaf adults to understand significant amounts of running speech using electrical stimulation alone. The results are also comparable to those from severely deaf people with some residual hearing and a powerful hearing aid. · the fifth objection was that children born deaf or deafened early in life would not have developed or be able develop the right neural connections for hearing to be reproduced. This objection was resolved in Melbourne after establishing the benefits of the cochlear implant in adults. We implanted our first three children in 1985 and 1986. This also led to an international trial to determine whether the multiple-electrode cochlear implant would benefit children who became deaf during their early life or were born deaf. The trial showed that 60% of children born deaf were able to understand some open-set speech, and the majority of the others had significant help in lipreading. The FDA approved the device as safe and effective for children two years of age and above in 1990. It thus became the first major advance for deaf children unable to obtain assistance with a hearing aid since sign language of the deaf was discovered in Paris 200 years ago. A subsequent analysis of data on children in Melbourne has shown there is considerable variability in results Fig. 4. The data also emphasises that the results are better the younger the child, and if extrapolated back may even be better if the child is younger than two years of age. Figure 4: BKB open-set sentence scores for electrical stimulation alone versus age at implantation. Before deciding to operate on children under two it was necessary, however, to undertake a series of biological studies to ensure that operating on a young child was safe. Young children of this age have special problems. These are firstly the effects of head growth, secondly frequent bouts of middle ear infection which could lead to inner ear complications, and thirdly the effects of electrical stimulation on the developing nervous system This research was part of a special five year contract to the US National Institutes of Health, and showed no cause for concern for operations on young children. 3. RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR THE THIRD MILLENNIUM There are a number of research goals for the Third Millennium to further improve the cochlear implant performance and extend its benefits to as many hard of hearing people as possible. These have been reviewed by Clark (2). · the first research goal is to provide better reproduction of the way the brain codes sounds. Already research is contributing answers to these questions. Electrical stimulation has helped provide evidence that the temporal coding of frequency is not just through the timing of responses in single fibres, but an interaction between the timing and spatial distribution of the nerve connections to cells in the brain (Fig.5). When nerve fibres converge on a brain cell each fibre carries some but not all of the timing information in response to the sound waves. It is the role of the brain cells to correctly identify the frequency relayed by the group of fibres, and it may do so by using a time window so that the cells only fire if a certain number of appropriate time intervals of the arriving responses are within that time window. Figure 5: A diagramatic representation of the unit responses in an ensemble of fibres for a low to mid acoustic frequency. (a) Nerve action potentials in a population of neurons, (b) Pure tone acoustic stimulus (3). Research in the Third Millennium should aim to provide patterns of electrical stimuli in small groups of nerve fibres that are similar to those of sound. To achieve this fine temporal and spatial pattern of responses a new electrode array will be required with many more electrodes to stimulate small groups of auditory nerve fibres (Fig.6).

Our study aims at analyzing the BRS at rest and during different exercise stages and altitudes. Twenty-one young, healthy subjects underwent experimental trials near sea level, and two times at high altitude. BRS was calculated using the sequence method (spontaneous trends of three or more inter-beat interval and systolic blood pressure) in order to analyze the baroreflex response at rest and during incremental exercise. Results show that BRS exponentially decreases during exercise at all altitudes. Moreover, BRS decays much faster with acute hypoxia (ALT1), indicating that the baroreceptors respond with a quick loss of sensitivity when exercising. After 16 days at high altitude (ALT16), BRS at rest resets to smaller values but the evolution of BRS during exercise has the same behavior as at SL, indicating BRS acclimation to altitude.	brs/search;sl (complexity);sensitivity and specificity;spontaneous order	Sasan Yazdani;Nicolas Bourdillon;AltitudeOmics Group;Jean-Marc Vesin	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		geography;physical therapy;anesthesia;diabetes mellitus	SE	16.80981467071328	-84.4681996046228	84186

These descriptors extract various audio features such as temporal features, energy features, harmonic features, perceptual and spectral features. Two feature selection methods are used and the results are compared. One method is based on comparing the effect of using all of a group features together and another method compares the effect of using features one by one. The selected features are used to classify selected children into autistic and non-autistic ones. The results show 96.17 percent accuracy. After feature selection, we classified data using S.V.M classifier for recognizing two types of input data.	algorithm;feature selection;naive bayes classifier;pattern recognition	Seyyed Hamid R.

Previous mapping methods based on the event related power spectrum are prone to noise. To improve the robustness of cortical function mapping, general linear model (GLM), which has been widely used in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is applied to bandpass filtered ECoG signals from each electrode. For a specific task, electrodes with best fitting parameters of the signal are identified, and the statistical significance of the fitting is mapped on the standard 3D brain model to provide a personalized map of sensorimotor functions. With the analysis of four patients' data, the proposed approach yields consistent results with those obtained by electrical cortical stimulation (ECS), while showing promising performance against noise.	cerebral cortex;electroconvulsive therapy;electrocorticography;general linear model;generalized linear model;image noise;magnetic resonance imaging;p-value;patients;personalization;spectral density;electrode;fmri	Tianyi Qian;Wei Wu;Wenjing Zhou;Shangkai Gao;Bo Hong	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090656	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;noise;electrode;mathematics;band-pass filter;statistical significance;biological engineering;spectral density;neurophysiology;foot;statistics;general linear model	Visualization	19.887169755051637	-83.06483251930948	84700

According to one hypothesis, AD is caused by the reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are considered to be an effective therapy. For clinicians, however, AChE inhibitors are not a predictable treatment for individual patients. We aimed to disclose the difference by biosignal processing. In this study, we used multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis, which can disclose the embedded information in different time scales, in electroencephalography (EEG), in an attempt to predict the efficacy of AChE inhibitors. Seventeen newly diagnosed AD patients were enrolled, with an initial minimental state examination (MMSE) score of 18.8 ± 4.5. After 12 months of AChE inhibitor therapy, 7 patients were responsive and 10 patients were nonresponsive. The major difference between these two groups is Slope 2 (MSE6 to 20). The area below the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of Slope 2 is 0.871 (95% CI = 0.69-1). The sensitivity is 85.7% and the specificity is 60%, whereas the cut-off value of Slope 2 is -0.024. Therefore, MSE analysis of EEG signals, especially Slope 2, provides a potential tool for predicting the efficacy of AChE inhibitors prior to therapy.	acetylcholine;alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;dementia;electroencephalography phase synchronization;embedded system;embedding;neurotransmitters;patients;receiver operating characteristic;receiver operator characteristics;sensitivity and specificity	Ping-Huang Tsai;Shih-Chieh Chang;Fang-Chun Liu;Jen-Ho Tsao;Yung-Hung Wang;Men-Tzung Lo	2015		10.1155/2015/953868	psychology;cholinesterase;entropy;neuroscience;developmental psychology;medicine;electroencephalography;computer science;receiver operating characteristic;algorithm;surgery	ML	18.04955569352296	-84.35055156117035	84779

However, the cardiac and respiratory acoustic sounds interfere in time as well as in spectral contents, which hampers the diagnostibility of the classical stethoscope. We propose a method for smart auscultation by blindly recovering the original cardiac and respiratory sounds from a single observation mixture. We decompose the spectrogram of the mixture into independent, non-redundant components, by employing non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). To group the decomposed components into original sources, a new unsupervised technique is proposed. Time-frequency masking is used to recover the original sources. This smart auscultation method is successfully applied to actual data collected from different subjects in different clinical settings. Our method demonstrates excellent results even in noisy clinical environments.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithmic efficiency;cluster analysis;non-negative matrix factorization;smart pascal;spectrogram;unsupervised learning	Ghafoor Shah;Constantinos B.

Methods: We characterize SAHS in single-channel airflow (AF) signals from 317 subjects by the extraction of spectral and nonlinear features. Relevancy and redundancy analyses are conducted through the fast correlation-based filter to derive the optimum set of features among them. These are used to feed classifiers based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression trees (CART). LDA and CART models are sequentially obtained through AB, which combines their performances to reach higher diagnostic ability than each of them separately. Results: Our AB-LDA and AB-CART approaches showed high diagnostic performance when determining SAHS and its severity. The assessment of different apnea-hypopnea index cutoffs using an independent test set derived into high accuracy: 86.5% (5 events/h), 86.5% (10 events/h), 81.0% (15 events/h), and 83.3% (30 events/h). These results widely outperformed those from logistic regression and a conventional event-detection algorithm applied to the same database. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AB applied to data from single-channel AF can be useful to determine SAHS and its severity. Significance: SAHS detection might be simplified through the only use of single-channel AF data.	adaboost;algorithm;anisotropic filtering;anterior descending branch of left coronary artery;boosting (machine learning);carpal tunnel syndrome;decision tree learning;linear discriminant analysis;logistic regression;nonlinear system;performance;redundancy (information theory);relevance;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep apnea, obstructive;statistical classification;test set;trees (plant);wolff-parkinson-white syndrome;airflow	Gonzalo C.

The overriding purpose of this paper is to propose two algorithms (probabilistic and non-probabilistic) that iteratively track stress states to compute a wellness index in terms of the stress levels. This paper adopts the physiological view-point that high stress is accompanied with large deviations in biometrics such as body temperature, heart rate, etc., and the proposed algorithms iteratively track these fluctuations to compute a personalized wellness index that is correlated to the engagement levels of the tasks performed by the user. In essence, this paper presents a quantitative relationship between temperature, occupational stress, and wellness during different tasks. The simplicity of the statistical inference algorithms make them favorable candidates for implementation on mobile platforms such as smart phones in the future, thereby providing users an inexpensive application for self-wellness monitoring for a healthier lifestyle.

b3dbd6e1539d5a01bb335a36d42b95cf40305fee	effective emg denoising using a hybrid model based on wat and garch		Abstract EMG is the recording of electrical activity of the muscles that can be used in diagnosing muscular diseases like myopathy and neuropathy and in generating control signals for operating artificial prosthetic arms and limbs. Various forms of artifacts get introduced into the EMG during the acquisition process that limits its proper analysis and characterization. This paper proposes a novel noise suppression method for EMG signals employing orthogonal Wave Atom Transform (WAT) followed by statistical modelling of wavelet coefficients by using a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model with maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimator for signal recovery from noisy EMG signals. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on signals taken from the standard Physionet ATM database that was manually corrupted by different levels of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) noise. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is studied using the standard metrics namely, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB, and Percent Root Mean Square Deviation (PRD). Results indicate that the hybrid denoising scheme was able to reduce noise from EMG signals more effectively quantified by average SNR of 22.98 dB and PRD of 0.00029, across different datasets, in comparison with the currently employed noise reduction algorithms.	electromyography;noise reduction	Ruby K.

The HAMS system consists of a wireless chest band, a wireless wearable sensor node and a base station. The RRi signal is processed using the SPINE framework at the base station side through a time-domain analysis of HRV.

When patients receive assistance during an exercise, they exhibit a persistent tendency to reduce their own contribution to that exercise. This phenomenon was first coined ’slacking’ in the context of robot-mediated therapy, where controller design continues to involve prediction and mitigation of slacking. In this pilot study, 14 individuals in the chronic stage of stroke participated in a visuomotor tracking task during which they produced isometric grip forces. Visual feedback displayed on a monitor helped participants track eight distinct forces ranging effort level from 4 to 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). A specialized method of toggling between veridical and nonveridical visual feedback isolated each participant’s realtime slacking rate at each of the eight effort levels, with both their contralesional and ipsilesional hand. Below 10–15% MVC, participants did not slack. At higher effort levels, participants slacked, and their slacking rate increased non-linearly with effort. Slacking took the form of smooth reductions in grip force. On average, across participants, slacking rates were remarkably similar between hands, just marginally faster with the contralesional hand. However, individualized slacking rates varied from almost zero to approximately double the acrossparticipant average. The paradigm for measuring slacking rate, used here, might be incorporated into robot-mediated therapy to maintain an accurate, individualized estimate of a patient’s slacking rate at various force levels and ensure the robot provides assistance only as needed.	arabic numeral 0;area striata structure;cerebrovascular accident;exercise;isometric projection;model–view–controller;patients;persistence (computer science);phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg oral tablet;programming paradigm;rehabilitation therapy;robot;slack variable	J.

In our current research, the n:m phase synchronization index (n:m PSI ) is of special interest. We prove the existence of stable and unstable synchronies dependent upon the analysis frequencies and show that they lie closely together in the frequency domain. Thus, a plot of the time-frequency plane of the n:m PSI automatically violates the sampling theorem and accordingly, the method cannot be considered as a black box. A frequency-tiling approach is presented that can detect robust synchronies while ignoring the unstable ones. The improved synchrony detection is evaluated in numerical experiments on using both simulated and real-life data. It can be demonstrated that the transient synchronization events between MEG oscillations in distant frequency ranges can be detected and that compactly textured EEG synchronization patterns can be reliably characterized.	black box;cell division phases;control theory;electroencephalography;experiment;magnetoencephalography;mitosis;numerical analysis;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;propylene glycol;real life;resting state fmri;simulation;tiling window manager;unstable medical device problem	Matthias Wacker;Herbert Witte	2011	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2010.2063028	electronic engineering;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;communication;oscillation;neurophysiology;frequency domain;physics;quantum mechanics;magnetoencephalography	Visualization	20.321085768530057	-85.41977477786384	85458
b58f4d677a374a04e0c538c79c92992263cc210c	cassification of movement quality in a weight-shifting exercise		In exercise games, it is often possible to gain rewards, i.e. points, by only partly completing an intended movement, which can undermine the effect of using such games for exercise. To ensure usability and reliability of exergames, correct movements must be accurately identified. Aim of the current study was to evaluate performance of machine learning models in classifying weightshifting movements as correct or incorrect. Eleven healthy elderly (6 F) performed a stepping exercise in a correct (with weight shift) and an incorrect (without weight shift) version. A 3D Motion Capture (3DMoCap) system calculated joint center positions (JCPs); 2270 repetitions (1133 correct) were recorded. Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models were built. Evaluation: 10fold leave-one-group-out cross validation (CV), repeated for all persons. Results showed high accuracy and recall in all classifiers. Average accuracy and recall was RF = 0.989, k-NN = 0.949, SVM = 0.958. Highest was RF on all JCPs, and SVM on shoulder JCPs (both 0.996). Lowest was k-NN on ankle JCPs (0.879). This study shows that all three models can distinguish correct and incorrect repetitions with high accuracy and recall, also by using selected JCPs. RF consistently outperformed the other models.	cross-validation (statistics);java community process;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;motion capture;radio frequency;random forest;stepping level;support vector machine;usability	Elise Klaebo Vonstad;Xiaomeng Su;Beatrix Vereijken;Jan Harald Nilsen;Kerstin Bach	2018			machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	HCI	11.587576233985876	-90.68629377083609	85581

In this work, an automatic system for monitoring the breathing is presented. The system uses the acoustic signal recorded by a standard microphone placed in the area of the nostrils. The system is based on a low-complex signal parameterization performed on non-overlapped frames. From this parameterization, a reduced set of real parameters is obtained frame-to-frame. These parameters feed a classifier that performs a classification in three stages: inspiration, transition or retention and expiration providing a fine monitoring of the respiration process. As all of those algorithms are of low complexity and the auxiliary equipment required could only be a standard microphone from a conventional Bluetooth Headset, the system could be able to run in a smartphone device.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Pere Martí-Puig;Jordi Solé i Casals;Gerard Masferrer;Esteve Gallego-Jutglà	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38847-7_17	speech recognition;simulation;breathing;microphone;computer vision;computer science;headset;bluetooth;artificial intelligence;linear discriminant analysis	ECom	11.075568513308154	-89.3267511913983	85637
6b6943a138938c31b285c1bb11213b87404feddf	multiple instance learning-based birdsong classification using unsupervised recording segmentation		Traditional techniques for monitoring wildlife populations are temporally and spatially limited. Alternatively, in order to quickly and accurately extract information about the current state of the environment, tools for processing and recognition of acoustic signals can be used. In the past, a number of research studies on automatic classification of species through their vocalizations have been undertaken. In many of them, however, the segmentation applied in the preprocessing stage either implies human effort or is insufficiently described to be reproduced. Therefore, it might be unfeasible in real conditions. Particularly, this paper is focused on the extraction of local information as units –called instances– from audio recordings. The methodology for instance extraction consists in the segmentation carried out using image processing techniques on spectrograms and the estimation of a needed threshold by the Otsu’s method. The multiple instance classification (MIC) approach is used for the recognition of the sound units. A public data set was used for the experiments. The proposed unsupervised segmentation method has a practical advantage over the compared supervised method, which requires the training from manually segmented spectrograms. Results show that there is no significant difference between the proposed method and its baseline. Therefore, it is shown that the proposed approach is feasible to design an automatic recognition system of recordings which only requires, as training information, labeled examples of audio recordings.	acoustic cryptanalysis;baseline (configuration management);experiment;image processing;information privacy;multiple instance learning;otsu's method;population;preprocessor;spectrogram;temporal logic;unsupervised learning	José Francisco Ruiz-Muñoz;Mauricio Orozco-Alzate;Germán Castellanos-Domínguez	2015			computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition	AI	-3.289537826652598	-89.61060696984153	85678

We acquired sound signals from six bovine tibial bones that were being drilled with a surgical drill. We investigated various classifiers including logistic regression, support vector machine SVM, random forest RF, and hidden Markov model. We explored different time and frequency features, and considered two training/testing scenarios: leave-one bone-out LOBO and bone-specific BSP. Moreover, we conducted a survey of practicing surgeons to provide a baseline measure for assessing whether our proposed algorithm could improve the ability of surgeons to identify hard- and soft-bone tissues based on drilling sounds. The average accuracies for LOBO and BSP were 79.1% and 84.3%, respectively. In both scenarios, the feature that resulted in the highest accuracy of classification was wavelet packet transform coefficients. Moreover, RF and SVM produced the highest accuracies for LOBO and BSP, respectively. In the survey, the surgeons were unsure on 29.2% of questions, and had an average accuracy of 51.4% on their judged answers. In conclusion, the drilling in hard and soft bones could be automatically identified with good accuracy based on the drilling sounds. Several of the algorithms tested were generalizable across specimens and their accuracy significantly exceeded surgeons’ performance. The significance is that these algorithms can potentially be used to reduce challenges associated with bone-drilling procedures.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;baseline (configuration management);bone tissue;bone structure of tibia;cattle;coefficient;hidden markov model;logistic regression;markov chain;network packet;operative surgical procedures;radio frequency;random forest;skeletal bone;specimen;support vector machine;wavelet packet decomposition	Vahid Zakeri;Antony J.

We propose a framework based on patterns to evaluate surgical performance and provide feedback during simulated ear (temporal bone) surgery in a 3D virtual environment. Temporal bone surgery is composed of a number of stages with distinct aims and surgical techniques. To provide context-appropriate feedback we must be able to identify each stage, recognise when feedback is to be provided, and determine the nature of that feedback. To achieve these aims, we train pattern-based models using data recorded by a temporal bone simulator. We create one model to predict the current stage of the procedure and separate stage-specific models to provide human-friendly feedback within each stage. We use 27 temporal bone simulation runs conducted by 7 expert ear surgeons and 6 trainees to train and evaluate our models. The results of our evaluation show that the proposed system identifies the stage of the procedure correctly and provides constructive feedback to assist surgical trainees in improving their technique.	feedback;real-time clock;simulation;virtual reality	Yun Zhou;James Bailey;Ioanna Ioannou;Sudanthi N.

Very often even the binary (YES/NO) intention of a PNI child cannot be determined because responses are made at the wrong time and conflicting signals are sent. We propose that it is possible to determine intention using significant streaks of successful responses found in the noisy responses. We can use two measures among others to determine intention; the maximum streak size attained in a test run with a device, and the sum of the significant streaks in the test run. The maximum streak size measures consecutive successes and the sum of streaks gives an indication measure of re-attempts. This work is part of a larger study to increase accessibility of PNI children to a cognitive test through the use of new non-hand held devices that interact with a computer. Using the proposed two measures, we are able to compare more closely the performance of the less capable and the more capable PNI children. The results show that the children who are more capable re-attempt in that test when they fail to achieve a target. Conversely the less able children divide into two groups: those that do re-attempt the target and those that do not re-attempt the target dependent however on the device being used. These results provide two measures that are potentially useful for determining the intention of the child undertaking the cognitive test.	accessibility;mobile device;peering	Hock C. Gan;Ray J.

However, costs frequently restrict the number of subjects employed, and this makes the dimensionality of the collected data far higher than the available samples. This paper applies discriminant analysis algorithms to the classification of patients with different types of foot lesions, in order to establish an association between foot motion and lesion formation. With primary attention to small sample size situations, we compare different types of Bayesian classifiers and evaluate their performance with various dimensionality reduction techniques for feature extraction, as well as search methods for selection of raw kinematic variables. Finally, we propose a novel integrated method which fine-tunes the classifier parameters and selects the most relevant kinematic variables simultaneously. Performance comparisons are using robust resampling techniques such as Bootstrap 632+ and k-fold cross-validation. Results from experimentations with lesion subjects suffering from pathological plantar hyperkeratosis, show that the proposed method can lead to /spl sim/96% correct classification rates with less than 10% of the original features.	algorithm;bayesian network;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;hyperkeratosis;linear discriminant analysis;naive bayes classifier;pathological fracture;patients;pedobarography;plantar - anatomical location;tracking system	John Yannis Goulermas;Andrew H.

This novel technique has great potential for lots of applications, e.g., smart space, smart home, and security safeguard. One fundamental question of DFLAR is how to design discriminative features to characterize the raw wireless signal. Existing works manually design handcraft features, e.g., mean and variance of the raw signal, which is not universal for different activities. Inspired by the deep learning theory, we explore to learn universal and discriminative features automatically with a deep learning model. By merging the learned new features into a softmax regression based machine learning framework, we develop a deep learning based DFLAR system. Experimental evaluations with an 8 wireless nodes testbed confirms that compared with traditional handcraft features, DFLAR system with the learned features could achieve better performance.	activity recognition;algorithm;deep learning;home automation;machine learning;multinomial logistic regression;pattern recognition;softmax function;testbed	Xiao Zhang;Jie Wang;Qinghua Gao;Xiaorui Ma;Hongyu Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457118	embedded system;feature learning;speech recognition;wireless sensor network;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;active learning;wireless	Robotics	4.150196384936376	-84.52558105451976	86459

It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.	bluetooth;cloud computing;computer terminal;congenital abnormality;data collection;file server;graphical user interface;http;heart diseases;internet;mqtt;mobile app;node - plant part;operating system;protocols documentation;real-time clock;server (computer);server (computing);software diagnosis;time complexity;united states public health service;usability;wearable computer;web application;disease transmission;electrode	Zhe Yang;Qihao Zhou;Lei Lei;Kan Zheng;Wei Xiang	2016	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-016-0644-9	embedded system;computer security	AI	6.130481481553637	-88.43876450173717	86550

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive fMRI technique that uses arterial water as an endogenous tracer to measure CBF. ASL provides reliable absolute quantification of CBF with higher spatial and temporal resolution than other techniques. And yet, the routine application of ASL has been somewhat limited. In this review, we start by highlighting theoretical complexities and technical challenges of ASL fMRI for basic and clinical research. While underscoring the main advantages of ASL versus other techniques such as BOLD, we also expound on inherent challenges and confounds in ASL perfusion imaging. In closing, we expound on several exciting developments in the field that we believe will make ASL reach its full potential in neuroscience research.		Ajna Borogovac;Iris Asllani	2012	Int. J.

Normally the requirement to build this kind of Healthcare application arises when we need a standalone application which can work without Physician. To build this application we studied several existing application and ongoing projects and tried to build a application which can give some diagnostic message for some specific information for ECG, Spo2, Body temperature etc. We studied different kind of application and their data like ECG, Spo2 etc, with their available application, their features and how to process all those data. The most difficult phase was to build such algorithm which can work independently without physician. We also try to implement and enhance pan- Tompkins PQRST algorithm go get some specific diagnosis. In this paper we try to analyze the requirement to build such application and after that implement that on short scale. This application can be very useful for daily computer user to measure their daily common healthcare measurement like ECG, Spo2 etc. In this paper we tried to make more concern on ECG analysis and give an introduction other features. To build this application we use J2EE and oscilloscope. We also modified the oscilloscope (java Program) according to our requirement. We also try to build a whole architecture which can work as a independent unit in personal healthcare system with analyze of some common known healthcare standard which are working on this field like HIMSS, OpenEHR, HL7 etc too.	algorithm;health level 7;information system;java platform, enterprise edition;user (computing)	Mangal Sain;Hoon-Jae Lee;Nguyen Trung Hau	2009	2009 Fifth International Joint Conference on INC, IMS and IDC	10.1109/NCM.2009.347	embedded system;real-time computing;data processing;computer science;operating system;data mining;database;computer security;oscilloscope	SE	7.230299687595064	-88.6198242819478	87053

In this work, we propose for the first time the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for automated cardiac auscultation and detection of abnormal heartbeat detection. The application of RNNs for this task is compelling since RNNs represent the deep learning technique most adept at dealing with sequential or temporal data. We explore the use of various RNNs models and show through our experimental results that RNN delivers the best-recorded score with only 2.37% error on test set for automated cardiac auscultation task.	artificial neural network;deep learning;experiment;futures studies;long short-term memory;neural networks;random neural network;recurrent neural network;test set	Siddique Latif;Muhammad U.

The ligand for monoaminergic vesicles (+)-[(11)C]dihydrotetrabenazine (+DTBZ) had a mean binding potential (pB) of 1.4 in striatum of the healthy young monkeys, which was reduced by 20% in putamen of the old monkeys. The catecholamine transporter ligand (+)-[(11)C]methylphenidate (+MP) had a mean pB of 1.3 in striatum of the young monkeys, which was reduced by 40% in caudate and putamen of the old monkeys. The DOPA decarboxylase substrate [(18)F]fluoro-l-DOPA (FDOPA) had a mean decarboxylation coefficient (k(3)(S)) of 0.4 h(-1) in striatum of the young group, and was not significantly reduced in the aged group. Of the three ligands, only +DTBZ pB was significantly reduced in striatum of the small group of animals with mild unilateral lesions. In the group with systemic MPTP lesions, the mean reduction of the binding of the three ligands was 80% in the caudate and putamen. However, the decline in +MP pB in the ventral striatum (-75%) exceeded the declines of +DTBZ pB and FDOPA k(3)(S) in that region (-65%), suggesting that compensatory down-modulation of uptake sites may occur in the striatal regions with the least dopamine depletion. Binding of all three ligands was reduced by 50% in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the thalamus, suggesting toxicity of MPTP for extrastriatal catecholamine innervations. +DTBZ binding in the hypothalamus, presumably mainly in serotonin fibers, was unaffected by systemic MPTP treatment. Of the three tracers, +DTBZ was most sensitive for detecting MPTP-induced dopamine depletion in monkey striatum.		Doris J. Doudet;Pedro Rosa-Neto;Ole Lajord Munk;Thomas J.

Traditional pig weight detections usually require direct contact with pigs, which are limited by its low efficiency and result in a lot of stresses even to death. The non-contact detection of pig body weight has become a challenge in pig production for decades. Digital image analysis and machine vision method enable the real time estimation of pig live weight by detecting pig critical body dimensions without any contact. This article elucidated the advantages and limitations of each detection method of pig body weight by comparing the system framework and estimation models. The research trends of contactless pig weight estimation were analyzed as well.	machine vision	Zhuo Li;Cheng Luo;Guanghui Teng;Tonghai Liu	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-54341-8_5	computer vision	AI	10.237578423350056	-84.44080824919159	87151

Evidences of therapy effectiveness have been assessed in gross motor function rehabilitation in children affected by cerebral palsy (CP) and in subjects affected by spinal lesions. However a quantitative and progressing assessment of such results is still lacking because of the intrinsic difficulty of collecting objective data 'on the riding camp'. Typically, the enhancements are evaluated by physicians in the lab, at the end of the rehabilitation cycles, by means of standard postural analysis protocols. This work proposes a multi-parametric method for the objective assessment of the effectiveness of equestrian rehabilitation. In particular a system to evaluate the level of """"activity"""" of the rider with respect to the horse movements is illustrated. The time evolution of this parameter is assumed as an indicator of the enhancement in muscle tone and co-ordination of the patient, hence as an estimate of the therapy efficacy. Preliminary experiments conducted on the riding camp are presented. The results are encouraging, though a full validation of the method will require the involvement of a suitable sample of patients and an evaluation of the reliability and repeatability of the results, based on standard postural analysis protocols."""	addendum;algorithm;cross-correlation;electromyography;experiment;fundamental interaction;inductive reasoning;norsk data;online and offline;personalization;point-to-point (telecommunications);poor posture;real-time transcription;repeatability	Roberto Nerino;Domenico Bergero;Francesco Bertolo;Caterina Guiot;Laura Contin;Paolo Garbin	2011	2011 International Conference on Body Sensor Networks	10.1109/BSN.2011.21	acceleration;muscle;gravity;computer science;biomechanics;physiology;accelerometer	Robotics	12.953922503855058	-84.18460203613436	87186

We propose and validate a novel activity recognition model.We examine the power of ensemble of classifiers approach experimentally.The model uses J48, Logistic Regression, and MLP.Proposed recognition model is superior to MLP-based recognition model suggested in a previous study.We suggest researchers to focus on ensemble of classifiers approach for activity recognition. Activity recognition aims to detect the physical activities such as walking, sitting, and jogging performed by humans. With the widespread adoption and usage of mobile devices in daily life, several advanced applications of activity recognition were implemented and distributed all over the world. In this study, we explored the power of ensemble of classifiers approach for accelerometer-based activity recognition and built a novel activity prediction model based on machine learning classifiers. Our approach utilizes from J48 decision tree, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Logistic Regression techniques and combines these classifiers with the average of probabilities combination rule. Publicly available activity recognition dataset known as WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) which includes information from thirty six users was used during the experiments. According to the experimental results, our model provides better performance than MLP-based recognition approach suggested in previous study.

The Low education group had significantly high alpha power at Fz and Cz locations comparing the High education group in the case of standard stimuli, where as remarkable increased alpha power was found in the same group in the case of target stimuli at Pz area. We concluded that the distributed origin of event-related alpha oscillations has the relationship with educational experience.	neural oscillation;wavelet transform	T. Begum;Faruque Reza;A. L.

e9f5e097fd4c4b8fe5835947c8adae3943e29ba0	adiposity is associated with structural properties of the adolescent brain		Obesity, a major risk factor for cardiometabolic disease, is associated with variations in a number of structural properties in the adult brain, as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional relationship between visceral fat (VF), total body fat (TBF) and three MRI parameters in the brains of typically developing adolescents: (i) T1-weighted (T1W) signal intensity; (ii) T1W signal contrast between white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM); and (iii) magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). In a community-based sample of 970 adolescents (12-18 years old, 466 males), VF was quantified using MRI, and total body fat was measured using a multifrequency bioimpedance. T1W images of the brain were used to determine signal intensity in lobar GM and WM, as well as WM:GM signal contrast. A magnetization transfer (MT) sequence of MT(ON) and MT(OFF) was used to obtain MTR in GM and WM. We found that both larger volumes of VF and more TBF were independently associated with higher signal intensity in WM and higher WM:GM signal contrast, as well as higher MTR in both GM and WM. These relationships were independent of a number of potential confounders, including age, sex, puberty stage, household income and height. Our results suggest that both visceral fat and fat deposited elsewhere in the body are associated independently with structural properties of the adolescent brain. We speculate that these relationships suggest the presence of adiposity-related variations in phospholipid composition of brain lipids.	adolescent (age group);brain;cross-sectional data;fat1 protein, human;fat measurement;gray matter;large;lewy body disease;mtr;magnetic resonance imaging;obesity;phospholipids;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;puberty;quantity;visceral fat;white matter	Deborah H.

Meanwhile, systems in which citizens report local issues to the government by posting them on websites such as """"Chiba-Repo"""" and """"FixMyStreet"""" have started to operate worldwide. In these systems, a large volume of information on problems with infrastructure (e.g., broken paving slabs, fly tipping, graffiti, potholes) found by citizens is collected. The information collected by citizens is expected to be utilized for infrastructure maintenance. However, information gathered by citizens has deviations in the spatial dimension and in its content. This research proposes to complement deviating but voluminous information provided by citizens by combining smartphone videos of roads. In order to identify and establish the level of defects on roads from photos taken by smartphones, this research uses a photo processing method that utilizes deep learning to create a model that automatically identifies road defects. As a result, the model is able to spot road damage with an accuracy of more than 93%. In addition, this model shows the possibility of categorizing voluminous photo data provided by citizens."""	categorization;deep learning;fixmystreet;smartphone	Hiroya Maeda;Yoshihide Sekimoto;Toshikazu Seto	2016		10.1145/2962735.2962738	simulation;engineering;world wide web;computer security	HCI	1.2692356756016026	-81.7095288386473	87998

By combining embedded sensing, signal processing and modeling techniques we create a scientific tool capable of quantifying high-level measures. The system monitors walking behavior and uses an instability assessment model to generate quantitative value with episodes of activity identified by the physician as important. The model incorporates variability and correlation of features extracted during ambulation that have been identified by geriatric motion study experts as precursors to instability, balance abnormality and possible fall risk. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our model and the complimentary role our system can play by providing longterm monitoring of patients outside a hospital setting at a reduced cost, with greater user convenience, and inference capabilities that meet physicians and researchers needs.	color balance;embedded system;experiment;heart rate variability;high- and low-level;instability;reduced cost;signal processing;smart shoe;time and motion study	Hyduke Noshadi;Shaun Ahmadian;Hagop Hagopian;Jonathan Woodbridge;Foad Dabiri;Navid Amini;Majid Sarrafzadeh;Nick Terrafranca	2010			simulation;computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence;instability	Robotics	7.579906777169789	-85.62823148153844	88027

More than a third of elderly people fall each year. When an elderly person falls, the social costs will be high since falls can yield bone fractures and even death. The gait of the elderly is strongly associated with multiple factors including fatigue, balance, and speed. People at high risk of falls tend to show high gait variability, and a key determiner of this variability, physical fatigue, is difficult to for the user to understand by himself. We are targeting the distribution of the center of pressure (COP) of the foot as a fatigue metric. Experiments measure normal and fatigued gait. COP analysis elucidates the changes that occur when we are fatigued. In addition, there is the possibility of estimating the degree of fatigue. By using a wearable foot pressure sensor, gait data can be continuously gathered in everyday life, and the fall risk can be fed back to the user.	experiment;heart rate variability;pedobarography;wearable computer	Shuhei Terada;Dai Hanawa;Kimio Oguchi	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/BHI.2012.6211622	physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;physical therapy;surgery	HCI	9.804241156281082	-85.79509351473735	88052

ce1f1f04f8e9f56ae88c7c6c5e81c2e7808f1586	an in-vivo study on intra-day variations in vascular stiffness using artsens pen		This work presents investigations on intraday variations in arterial stiffness. For this purpose, an in-vivo study was conducted on five subjects over a duration of five consecutive days. Five stiffness index ($\beta $) measurements were obtained per day for each individual. Our clinically validated ARTSENS device was used to perform fully automated reliable stiffness measurements on the carotid artery. For each measurement, two trials were performed and averaged. These trials were observed to be repeatable with the coefficient of variation $< 0.72$%. For each day, one measurement that was performed immediately after the lunch was subject to intervention due to the consumed food, which significantly $( \mathrm {p}< 0.001)$ deviated from the mean baseline $\beta $ of the day. Such significant deviations were not observed for the rest measurements that were performed in the absence of an intervention. Two subjects who consumed caffeinated beverages during the lunch exhibited an increment in $\beta $ measurement (taken immediately after lunch) as compared to mean baseline $\beta $ of the day. Further, there was no significant (p $=$ 0.97) difference between the mean baseline $\beta $ measured over a day and the mean baseline $\beta $ measured over the entire course of the study. Results obtained from the present study demonstrated that the arterial stiffness does not vary significantly over a short period but varies progressively. However, significant temporary variations in stiffness could be observed due to dietary interventions.	3 ml insulin lispro 100 unt/ml pen injector [humalog];arterial stiffness;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);beverages;cerebrovascular disorders;coefficient;increment;video-in video-out	V.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining on EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the signal underlying information content illustration by representing time-frequency patterns on Wavelet Coherence qualitative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions on time-frequency spectrum during the specified task on BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns were classified using a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). This innovative characteristic of the process justify the feasibility of the proposed approach on another data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches on this field and researches on different non-stationary time series analysis.	algorithm;artificial neural network;brain–computer interface;complex wavelet transform;continuous wavelet;data mining;discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalography;microsoft windows;pattern recognition;radial (radio);radial basis function;self-information;signal processing;spectral density;stationary process;synapomorphy;time series;writing commons	Thiago Bassani;Júlio C.

In the context of connected vehicles, this work extends current infrastructure to include real-time driver monitoring and feedback. Rather than leaving the driver out of the process, the goal is to obtain a vehicle where the degree of autonomy is continuously changed in real-time as a function of uncertainty ranges for driver biological state and behavior. The evolution and dissemination of mobile technology has created exceptional opportunities for highly detailed and personalized data collection in a far more granular and cost effective way. However, turning this potential into practice requires algorithms and methodologies to transform these raw data into actionable information. We have developed a robust driver monitoring platform consisting of automotive sensors (i.e. OBD-II) that capture the real-time information of the vehicle and driving behavior as well as a heterogeneous wearable body sensor network that collects the driver biometrics (e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)). Accurate synchronization and storage of such multi-source heterogeneous data were also developed and validated. Finally, The task of characterizing driver distraction using EEG signals was investigated in two different road conditions as a proof of concept.	algorithm;autonomous robot;autonomy;biometrics;electroencephalography;multi-source;next-generation network;personalization;real-time clock;real-time data;semiconductor industry;sensor;wearable computer	Omid Dehzangi;Cayce Williams	2015		10.1145/2750511.2750527	simulation;engineering;world wide web;computer security	HCI	6.706178950859364	-90.04583623355133	88190

Furthermore, in many cases, the rather unrealistic assumption is made that the subject carries out only one activity at a time. In this paper, we describe the use of Markov logic as a declarative framework for recognizing interleaved and concurrent activities incorporating both input from pervasive light-weight sensor technology and common-sense background knowledge. In particular, we assess its ability to learn statistical-temporal models from training data and to combine these models with background knowledge to improve the overall recognition accuracy. To this end, we propose two Markov logic formulations for inferring the foreground activity as well as each activities' start and end times. We evaluate the approach on an established dataset. where it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for activity recognition.	activity recognition;algorithm;markov chain;markov logic network;pervasive informatics;statistical model	Rim Helaoui;Mathias Niepert;Heiner Stuckenschmidt	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)	10.1109/PERCOM.2011.5767586	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;markov process;hidden markov model;statistics	Vision	1.1347044624635296	-84.48480701398286	88353

Most of the adaptations are programmed as rules derived from human experience in making environments comfortable and efficient. Preparing sufficient rules, however, is difficult because oversights and exceptional contexts are inevitable. In this paper, we focus on sensor data fluctuations and calculate probabilities that indicate the frequency of such sensor data fluctuations. The results help us find previously unnoticed situations that the context-aware applications should cope with. We applied this method to log data captured in our office in order to evaluate the methods' capabilities and then considered the feasibility of abstracting these situations into rules.	entropy (information theory);experiment;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;sensor;shape context	Kaoru Hiramatsu;Takashi Hattori;Tatsumi Yamada;Takeshi Okadome	2006	20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)	10.1108/17427371011066392	probabilistic analysis of algorithms;simulation;design methods;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;artificial intelligence;operating system;data mining;automatic identification and data capture	Robotics	1.0917285525933078	-85.43455135234039	88444

We propose that cochlear implant users are better able to perceive speech when these frequency bands are desynchronized, as occurs in the normal cochlea. The first part of this study was a computational investigation of across-frequency delays on the stimulation patterns generated by the advanced combination encoder (ACE) sound-processing strategy. By offsetting frequency bands from each other, fewer stimuli were discarded from voiced speech by maxima selection. Background noise, however, was not affected in this way. The second part of this study was an assessment of speech perception with across-frequency delays in cochlear implant users with the ACE strategy. In the perception of sentences in noise, three subjects improved with delays, four showed no change and one was worse. For words in quiet, four subjects had improved word recognition and four showed no change. A significant group improvement (P<0.05) was seen for speech in quiet. These results are encouraging for cochlear implant sound processing because across-frequency delays can be incorporated easily and efficiently into existing sound-processing strategies.	ace;audio signal processing;bands;baseline (configuration management);cochlear implants;cochlear nerve;cochlear implant;encoder device component;frequency band;maxima;muscle weakness;personnameuse - assigned;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;randomness;signal-to-noise ratio;speech discrimination tests;speech disorders;speech recognition;sentence;travel	Daniel A.

Digital VLS recordings, acoustic voice assessment, calculation of dysphonia severity index (DSI) and registration of voice range profile (VRP) were performed for 206 individuals: 50 healthy and 156 patients with mass lesions of vocal folds and paralysis. 90 of lesions were unilateral, 66 – bilateral. VLS parameters were derived using objective measures made from a single image taken from the VLS recording of a sustained vowel: glottal areas, glottal widths and distances, vocal fold angles. As the result of Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis, 11 VLS measurements were identified to be relevant distinguishing between normal and pathological voice groups. Correlations between the VLS parameters and results of acoustic voice analysis parameters, DSI and VRP measurements were tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The correlations of VLS variables and acoustic voice measurements were moderate and statistically significant. In pathological voices numerical values of VLS parameters measured reveal significant deviances from these in normal voice; therefore quantification of VLS parameters appears to be sensitive and specific distinguishing normal and pathological voices patients groups. Analysis of correlations between the quantitative measurements obtained via VLS and acoustic voice parameters provides more versatile approach into the pathophysiology of phonation and suggests the documented and measurable evidence of complex mechanisms of vocal function. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Advances in computer technology and data analysis techniques have contributed greatly to the progress of this field. Gait analysis has become a valuable tool in the clinical setting. The ability to objectively quantify motion is essential to our understanding of normal and abnormal movement patterns and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness. This paper will discuss the various experimental and analytical techniques currently used for performing clinical gait analyses at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.	dyskinetic syndrome	Victoria L.

The CB1 binding (expressed as the distribution volume; V(T)) was highest in the globus pallidus and the cortex in both controls and patients with schizophrenia. Controls showed a correlation with the known distribution of CB1 and decline of [(11)C]OMAR binding with age, most significantly in the globus pallidus. Overall, we observed elevated mean binding in patients with schizophrenia across all regions studied, and this increase was statistically significant in the pons (p<0.05), by the Students t-test. When we ran a regression of the control subjects V(T) values with age and then compared the patient data to 95% prediction limits of the linear regression, three patients fell completely outside for the globus pallidus, and in all other regions there were at least 1-3 patients outside of the prediction intervals. There was no statistically significant correlations between PET measures and the individual Brief Psychiatry Rating Score (BPRS) subscores (r=0.49), but there was a significant correlation between V(T) and the ratio of the BPRS psychosis to withdrawal score in the frontal lobe (r=0.60), and middle and posterior cingulate regions (r=0.71 and r=0.79 respectively). In conclusion, we found that [(11)C] OMAR can image human CB1 receptors in normal aging and schizophrenia. In addition, our initial data in subjects with schizophrenia seem to suggest an association of elevated binding specific brain regions and symptoms of the disease.	acoustic lobing;cannabinoids;cerebral vasospasm;chronic disease;globus pallidus;gyrus cinguli;illness (finding);jhu 75528;kinetics internet protocol;lorenz cipher;name binding;neural binding;occipital lobe;patients;polyethylene terephthalate;pontine structure;positron-emission tomography;preclinical imaging;psychiatry specialty;psychotic disorders;quantitation;receptors, serotonin, 5-ht2;regression analysis;schizophrenia;subtype (attribute);tracer;video-in video-out;cannabinoid receptor;drug distribution volume;frontal lobe;nervous system disorder;t test	Dean F.

Often techniques are compared through computation of required sample size estimates for future clinical trials. However interpretation of such comparisons is rendered complex because, despite using the same publicly available cohorts, the various techniques have been assessed with different data exclusions and different statistical analysis models. We created the MIRIAD atrophy challenge in order to test various capabilities of atrophy measurement techniques. The data consisted of 69 subjects (46 Alzheimer's disease, 23 control) who were scanned multiple (up to twelve) times at nine visits over a follow-up period of one to two years, resulting in 708 total image sets. Nine participating groups from 6 countries completed the challenge by providing volumetric measurements of key structures (whole brain, lateral ventricle, left and right hippocampi) for each dataset and atrophy measurements of these structures for each time point pair (both forward and backward) of a given subject. From these results, we formally compared techniques using exactly the same dataset. First, we assessed the repeatability of each technique using rates obtained from short intervals where no measurable atrophy is expected. For those measures that provided direct measures of atrophy between pairs of images, we also assessed symmetry and transitivity. Then, we performed a statistical analysis in a consistent manner using linear mixed effect models. The models, one for repeated measures of volume made at multiple time-points and a second for repeated """"direct"""" measures of change in brain volume, appropriately allowed for the correlation between measures made on the same subject and were shown to fit the data well. From these models, we obtained estimates of the distribution of atrophy rates in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control groups and of required sample sizes to detect a 25% treatment effect, in relation to healthy ageing, with 95% significance and 80% power over follow-up periods of 6, 12, and 24months. Uncertainty in these estimates, and head-to-head comparisons between techniques, were carried out using the bootstrap. The lateral ventricles provided the most stable measurements, followed by the brain. The hippocampi had much more variability across participants, likely because of differences in segmentation protocol and less distinct boundaries. Most methods showed no indication of bias based on the short-term interval results, and direct measures provided good consistency in terms of symmetry and transitivity. The resulting annualized rates of change derived from the model ranged from, for whole brain: -1.4% to -2.2% (AD) and -0.35% to -0.67% (control), for ventricles: 4.6% to 10.2% (AD) and 1.2% to 3.4% (control), and for hippocampi: -1.5% to -7.0% (AD) and -0.4% to -1.4% (control). There were large and statistically significant differences in the sample size requirements between many of the techniques. The lowest sample sizes for each of these structures, for a trial with a 12month follow-up period, were 242 (95% CI: 154 to 422) for whole brain, 168 (95% CI: 112 to 282) for ventricles, 190 (95% CI: 146 to 268) for left hippocampi, and 158 (95% CI: 116 to 228) for right hippocampi. This analysis represents one of the most extensive statistical comparisons of a large number of different atrophy measurement techniques from around the globe. The challenge data will remain online and publicly available so that other groups can assess their methods."""	aging;alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;atrophic;blinded;booting;bootstrapping (statistics);brain implant;cerebral ventricles;cerebral atrophy;computation;dementia;estimated;evaluation procedure;follow-up report;global variable;ground truth;heart ventricle;heart rate variability;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;lateral computing;lateral thinking;lateral ventricle structure;left ventricular structure;neurodegenerative disorders;norm (social);repeatability;requirement;sample size;scanning;silo (dataset);sixty nine;small;spatial variability;statistical model;vertex-transitive graph	David M.

026ce5ca6c6a50b2ae53e98bd1136b34d4031ff8	deep residual networks for automatic sleep stage classification of raw polysomnographic waveforms		We have developed an automatic sleep stage classification algorithm based on deep residual neural networks and raw polysomnogram signals. Briefly, the raw data is passed through 50 convolutional layers before subsequent classification into one of five sleep stages. Three model configurations were trained on 1850 polysomnogram recordings and subsequently tested on 230 independent recordings. Our best performing model yielded an accuracy of 84.1% and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.746, improving on previous reported results by other groups also using only raw polysomnogram data. Most errors were made on non-REM stage 1 and 3 decisions, errors likely resulting from the definition of these stages. Further testing on independent cohorts is needed to verify performance for clinical use.	algorithm;artificial neural network;disk staging;global variable;memory cell (binary);neural network simulation;phrase structure grammar;polysomnography;programmable sound generator;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep stages;spectrogram;stage level 1;algorithm;anatomical layer;cell transformation	Alexander Neergaard Olesen;Poul Jennum;Paul E.

d1a1de6ee623dd19f2b5b3969fdb7af19dca3c35	development of emg-based speller	speller;emg;physiologic computing;nci	Physiological computing is a paradigm of computing that uses physiological data of users as input during computing tasks. By monitoring, analyzing and responding to such inputs, Physiological Computing Systems (PCS) are able to monitor, diagnose and respond to the cognitive, emotional and physical states of users in real time. A specific case of PCS is Neural Computer Interface (NCI), which uses electrical signals governing muscular activity (EMG data) of a user to establish a direct pathway between the user and a computer. In this paper, we analyze and develop a speller application based on the EMG interface. We present taxonomy of speller application parameters, propose a model of PCS, and describe the development of a speller. Finally, we evaluate the performance and usability of the developed speller using empirical (accuracy, information transfer speed, input speed) metrics.	electromyography;gene regulatory network;list of device bit rates;nc (complexity);programming paradigm;usability	Mindaugas Vasiljevas;Rutenis Turcinas;Robertas Damaševičius	2014		10.1145/2662253.2662260	embedded system;speech recognition;human–computer interaction;computer science	HCI	8.631343885256886	-91.72429836657874	89114

However, individual variations in this pattern occur. This paper uncovers a coarse classification of such sleep patterns into types described by varying balances among all-night summary variables such as sleep efficiency and the fraction of sleep period time spent in each of the sleep stages N1, N2, N3/4, and REM. Unsupervised expectation-maximization (EM) clustering is used over data obtained from 244 all-night polysomnographic sleep studies, revealing several naturally occurring sleep type clusters. It is found that sleep efficiency plays a major role in differentiating among sleep types, with time in deep sleep further refining the sleep type classification. Associations are found between sleep type on the one hand, and variables that describe health history and habits on the other. These findings suggest that the discovered sleep types describe medically meaningful groups of sleep behaviors that may be useful in future sleep research.	bonjour sleep proxy;cluster analysis;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;interrupt	Amro Khasawneh;Sergio A.

This paper presents a stressor-specific evaluation model conducted between stress levels and electroencephalogramEEG features. The overall complexity, chaos of EEG signals, and spectrum power of certain EEG bands from pre-frontal lobeFp1, Fp2 and Fpz was analyzed. The results showed that different stressors can lead to varying degree of changes of frontal EEG complexity. Future study will build the stressor-specific evaluation model under considering the effects of gender and age.	electroencephalography	Na Li;Bin Hu;Jing Chen;Hong Peng;Qinglin Zhao;Mingqi Zhao	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-42042-9_64	complexity;computer science;stress;stressor	HCI	17.385103043741275	-81.75423180067064	89208
7e829d9a9719caf0a5d18abd1f877bccd937c492	outlier detection in non-intrusive ecg biometric system		A recent trend in the field of biometrics is the use of Elec- trocardiographic (ECG) signals. One of the main challenges of this new paradigm is the development of non-intrusive and highly usable setups. Fingers and hand palms for example, allow the ECG acquisition at much more convenient locations than the chest, commonly used for clinical sce- narios. These new locations lead to an ECG signal with lower signal to noise ratio, and more prone to noise artifacts. In this paper, we propose an outlier removal system to eliminate noisy segments, and enhance the performance of non-intrusive ECG biometric systems. Preliminary re- sults show that this system leads to an improvement on the recogni- tion rates, helping to further validate the potential of ECG signals as complementary biometric modality.	anomaly detection;biometrics	André Lourenço;Hugo Silva;Carlos Carreiras;Ana L.

Customization of assistive technology by end-users is necessary for technology adoption and retention. We introduce MNFL, the Monitoring and Notification Flow Language, developed over the past several years to allow lay people without programming experience, but with some technical acumen, to effectively program customized monitoring and notification systems. MNFL is a graphical flow language having intuitive yet sufficiently powerful execution semantics and built-in constructs for assistive monitoring. We describe the language's semantics and built-in constructs, demonstrate the language's use for customizing several common assistive monitoring tasks, and provide results of initial usability trials showing that lay people with almost no training on MNFL can more than 50% of the time and in just a few minutes select and connect the right 1-2 blocks to complete basic applications that have 4-5 blocks total.	assistive technology;programming language;requirement;sensor;usability	Alex D.

One of the main challenges is to understand, decode and model the physiological process linking the stimulating parameters to the visual sensations produced in the visual field of a blind volunteer. We propose to use adaptive neural techniques. Two prediction models are investigated. The first one is a grey-box model exploiting the neurophysiological knowledge available up to now. It combines a neurophysiological model with artificial neural networks, such as multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis function networks, in order to predict the features of the visual perceptions. The second model is entirely of the black-box type. We show that both models provide satisfactory prediction tools and achieve similar prediction accuracies. Moreover, we demonstrate that significant improvement (25%) was gained with respect to linear statistical methods, suggesting that the biological process is strongly non-linear.	accommodation phosphene disorder;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;black box;esapent;esthesia;estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques;gain;interaction;iterative reconstruction;layer (electronics);linear model;long terminal repeat;michel hénon;multilayer perceptron;national fund for scientific research;nevus sebaceous;nonlinear system;numerous;optic nerve (gchq);optics;part dosing unit;patients;performance;physiological processes;prosthesis implantation;rp (complexity);radial (radio);radial basis function;retinitis pigmentosa;simulation software;stimulation (motivation);system identification;visual perception;visual prosthesis;funding grant;neurological system process;recurrent childhood visual pathway glioma	Cédric Archambeau;Jean Delbeke;Claude Veraart;Michel Verleysen	2004	Artificial intelligence in medicine	10.1016/j.artmed.2004.02.004	visual perception;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;predictive modelling;multilayer perceptron;biological process;radial basis function network;artificial neural network;cross-validation	ML	22.8800211883167	-89.23638670550066	89300

The transient post-synaptical potential could be observed from the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Properties derived from time domain and frequency domain such as event-related motor potential and suppression in band power could be useful EEG features. In this report, lateralised motor potential (LMP) and band power ratio (BPR) are used to classify cued left-fingers and right-fingers movements. Two classifiers are employed in this experiment: minimum distance classifier (MDC) and normal density Bayes classifier (NDBC). The results show that the features from LMP has more discriminative power than band power ratio. They also show that NDBC has a perfect performance in this task.

a3478f9b8678da04b993ce0387aebbd002097bd3	detection and classification of sleep apnea using genetic algorithms and svm-based classification of thoracic respiratory effort and oximetric signal features		Sleep apnea is a relatively prevalent breathing disorder characterized by temporary interruptions in airflow during sleep. There are 2 major types of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when air cannot flow through the upper airway despite efforts to breathe. Central sleep apnea occurs when the brain fails to signal to the muscles to maintain breathing. The standard diagnostic test is polysomnography, which is expensive and time consuming. The aim of this study was to design an automatic diagnostic and classifying algorithm for sleep apneas employing thoracic respiratory effort and oximetric signals. This algorithm was trained and tested applying a database of 54 subjects who had undergone polysomnography. A feature extraction stage was conducted to compute features. An optimal genetic algorithm was applied to select optimal features of these 2 kinds of signals. The classification technique was based on the support vector machine classifier to classify the selected features in 3 classes as healthy, obstructive, and central sleep apnea events. The results show that our automated classification algorithm can diagnose sleep apnea and its types with an average accuracy level of 90.2% (87.5-95.8) in the test set and 90.9% in the validation set with high acceptable accuracy.

Further, we evaluate the security and practicality of using brain wave in identity recognition and anticounterfeiting authentication and describe use cases of several machine learning methods in brain wave signal processing. Afterwards, we survey the critical issues of characteristic extraction, classification, and selection involved in brain wave signal processing. Finally, we propose several brain wave-based identity recognition techniques for further studies and conclude this paper.	algorithm;authentication;biometrics;brain implant;dimensionality reduction;electroencephalography;electromyography;electrooculography;feature selection;machine learning;neural oscillation;preprocessor;requirement;sensor;signal processing;supervised learning	Wei Liang;Liang Cheng;Mingdong Tang	2016	J.

For this purpose, this paper proposes the three types of agents, i.e., the sleep monitoring agent, the care plan design agent, and the care worker support agent. To provide the comfortable and healthy life for aged persons, the proposed system estimates the sleep stage of aged persons to evaluate it from the viewpoint of the deep and stable sleep. Such a daily evaluation can be done by storing dairy personal data as a big data and by converting them into meaningful knowledge (e.g., the heartbeat and body movement data of the personal big data are converted into the sleep stage in our system). Human subject experiments of our system introduced in the care house have revealed the following implications from the sleep viewpoint: (1) the sleep monitoring agent succeeds to estimate the sleep stage without connecting any devices to human’s body and its estimation accuracy is higher than 90% by allowing one stage difference; (2) the care plan design agent can design the care plan (i.e., rough schedules in a day) that provides nine years younger sleep in the healthy aged persons and seven years younger sleep in dementia persons; and (3) the care worker support agent can guess the way aged persons feel.

However, there might exist great variability of gesture dynamics among gesture sequences within the same emotion, which form a major obstacle to detect emotion from body motion in general interpersonal interactions. In this paper, we propose a graph-based framework for modeling gesture dynamics towards attitude recognition. We demonstrate that the dynamics derived from a weighted graph based method provide a better separation between distinct emotion classes and maintain less variability within the same emotion class. This helps capture salient dynamic patterns for specific emotions by removing interaction-dependent variations. In this framework, we represent each gesture sequence as an undirected graph of connected gesture units and use the graph-based transform to generate features to describe gesture dynamics. In our experiments, we apply the graph-based dynamics for attitude recognition, i.e., classifying the attitude of an individual as friendly or conflictive. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach.	experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);heart rate variability;interaction;spatial variability	Zhaojun Yang;Antonio Ortega;Shrikanth (Shri) Narayanan	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025303	attitude;computer vision;motion capture;speech recognition;computer science;gesture recognition	Robotics	0.6168375933963455	-89.51122221563004	89663

This study investigates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of multi-class MI-EEG signals. Augmented common spatial pattern (ACSP) features are generated based on pair-wise projection matrices, which covers various frequency ranges. We propose a frequency complementary feature map selection (FCMS) scheme by constraining the dependency among frequency bands. Experiments are conducted on BCI competition IV dataset IIa with 9 subjects. Averaged cross-validation accuracy of 68.45% and 69.27% is achieved for FCMS and all feature maps, respectively, which is significantly higher (4.53% and 5.34%) than random map selection and higher (1.44% and 2.26%) than filter-bank CSP (FBCSP). The results demonstrate that the CNNs are capable of learning discriminant, deep structure features for EEG classification without relying on the handcrafted features.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bands;baseline (configuration management);brain–computer interface;common spatial pattern;convolutional neural network;cross-validation (statistics);discriminant;electroencephalography;electroencephalography;experiment;filter bank;frequency band;guided imagery;map;neural network simulation;numerous;randomness;silo (dataset);spatiotemporal pattern;uruguay faciocardiomusculoskeletal syndrome;vena cava filters;emotional dependency;triangulation	Huijuan Yang;Siavash Sakhavi;Kai Keng Ang;Cuntai Guan	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318929	computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	15.515296871256508	-93.31718332687754	89691
474f13bd9a780e75adc063936a638de2f2943a76	spatial relations of mammographic density regions and their association with breast cancer risk		Abstract   We present a new approach for characterising the shape and the spatial relationships of different categories of density in mammograms. Descriptions of regions are encoded using a forces histogram method and across-image variation is captured using functional principal component analysis. We evaluate the association of the features with breast cancer based on a pilot case- control study using logistic regression with percent density, age, and body mass index included as adjustment variables. The spatial relations were significantly associated with breast cancer status (p= 0.009). Our approach can provide insights into the role of different density regions in the development of breast cancer.

8dfc80f556fef964158f0b18eb212f1cd8f9ac77	an annotation technique for in-home smart monitoring environments		Advances in multimedia technologies have led to the emergence of smart home applications. In fact, mobile multimedia technologies provide the infrastructure to adopt smart solutions and track inhabitants’ activities. In-home activity recognition significantly enhances the performance of healthcare-monitoring and emergency-control applications for elderly and people with special needs. Developing and validating data models for such applications requires training sets that reflect a ground truth in the form of labeled or annotated data. With the accelerated development of Internet-of-Things applications, automated annotation processes have emerged understanding resident behavior in terms of activities. This paper presents a methodology for automatic data annotation by profiling sensing nodes. Our proposed methodology models activities based on spatially recognized actions, with every activity expected to have a direct relationship with a specific set of locations. Furthermore, the proposed technique validates the assignment of labels based on the temporal relations among consecutive actions. We performed experiments to evaluate our proposed methodology on CASAS data sets, which indicated that the proposed methodology achieved better performance, to a statistically significant extent, than the state-of-the-art methodologies presented in the literature.	activity recognition;data model;emergence;experiment;ground truth;home automation	Mohammed Gh.

8857f04c11b5c5c5fec7c5d7a8ad9cd24a9e6859	continuous vigilance estimation using lstm neural networks		In this paper, we propose a novel continuous vigilance estimation approach using LSTM Neural Networks and combining Electroencephalogram (EEG) and forehead Electrooculogram (EOG) signals. We combine these two modalities to leverage their complementary information using a multimodal deep learning method. Moreover, since the change of vigilance level is a time dependent process, temporal dependency information is explored in this paper, which significantly improves the performance of vigilance estimation. We introduce two LSTM Neural Network architectures, the F-LSTM and the S-LSTM, to encode the time sequences of EEG and EOG into a high level combined representation, from which we can predict the vigilance levels. The experimental results demonstrate that both of the two LSTM multimodal structures can improve the performance of vigilance estimation models in comparison with the single modality models and non-temporal dependent models.	deep learning;encode;electroencephalography;electrooculography;high-level programming language;long short-term memory;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;neural networks	Nan Zhang;Wei-Long Zheng;Wei Liu;Bao-Liang Lu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46672-9_59	artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network;pattern recognition;electroencephalography;deep learning;computer science;vigilance (psychology);recurrent neural network	AI	-2.985878352966446	-85.80126807017112	89905

However, the current manual sleep scoring is time-consuming as it is a crude discretization in time and stages. This study changes Esbroeck and Westover's [1] latent sleep staging model into a global model. The proposed data-driven method trained a topic mixture model on 10 control subjects and was applied on 10 other control subjects, 10 iRBD patients and 10 Parkinson's patients. In that way 30 topic mixture diagrams were obtained from which features reflecting distinct sleep architectures between control subjects and patients were extracted. Two features calculated on basis of two latent sleep states classified subjects as “control” or “patient” by a simple clustering algorithm. The mean sleep staging accuracy compared to classical AASM scoring was 72.4% for control subjects and a clustering of the derived features resulted in a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 80%. This study demonstrates that frequency analysis of sleep EEG can be used for data-driven global sleep classification and that topic features separates iRBD and Parkinson's patients from control subjects.

Special attention was directed to the phase spectrum and its potential to clarify the contribution of reflex mechanisms to physiological tremor. The phase spectra are investigated assuming that the electromyogram (EMG) synchronization was caused by a reflex or a central oscillator. Comparing these results to phase spectra of measured data, we found a significant contribution of reflexes. But reflexes only modify existing peaks in the power spectrum. The main agents of physiological tremor are an efferent pace and the resonant behavior of the biomechanical system.	electromyography;essential tremor;muscle;oscillator device component;reflex action;spectral density;time series	Jens Timmer;M.

The model for the sEMG is developed as a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. In order to represent dynamical characteristics of sEMG when multichannel observation sequence are given, a stochastic dynamic process is included in it based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle. By using the EM algorithm, the hidden model parameters and the feature of the signal can be identified easily. Ten people of different time series data sets of different hand grasps and in-hand manipulations captured from different subjects are collected. The two different classifiers were used to recognize these hand manipulation signal. Compared with time and time-frequency domains and their combination feature, the proposed algorithm of the inferred model gain better performance and demonstrate the effectiveness. The average identification accuracy rate is 93% and the maximum classification ratio is 100%.	electromyography;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;fits;hidden markov model;knowledge base;markov chain;time series	Yang Lu;Zhaojie Ju;Yurong Liu;Yuxuan Shen;Honghai Liu	2015	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.05.058	computing;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;hidden markov model	ML	16.551548037793495	-95.2225113972836	90397

0b241e632484e424e0eb37c2a06254bc6555650b	multi-lead fusion detection of t-wave alternans using dezert-smarandache theory		T-Wave alternans (TWA) is a cardiac phenomenon regarded as an index of high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Although a number of methods have been proposed for TWA detection, their final decision always fully depends on one single lead which is usually picked out for its strongest TWA detection result among all the other leads. That is to say that lots of useful information have been unused and wasted. To our best knowledge, no method that fuses TWA detection results independently obtained by each lead to do comprehensive decision has been introduced. In this paper, a novel multi-lead method for TWA fusion detection is proposed. This method combines Dezert-Smarandache theory (DSmT) with Laplacian likelihood ratio method (LLR) to gain higher detection rate. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with standard LLR method by means of a simulation study, in which extracted TWA waveform and clean background ECG from real records were used to synthetize simulated data with different types of simulated or physiological noises. These methods were also applied to real records from PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The results are presented by constructing receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves. All test results show that the proposed method has a larger margin of separability and higher detection rate than traditional methods. A more accurate and robust TWA detection method has great value to predict the risk of sudden cardiac death(SCD).	linear separability;lucas–lehmer–riesel test;newton's method;receiver operating characteristic;simulation;waveform	Changrong Ye;Guojun Li;Yang Bao;Jinliang Qiao;Deping Zhang	2017	2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009791	robustness (computer science);computer science;principal component analysis;statistics;waveform;t wave alternans;phenomenon	Robotics	19.408182393341693	-90.39875352448176	90486

A new algorithm for subject-selection based on clustering covariance matrices on a Riemannian manifold is proposed. After unsupervised selection of the subsets of relevant subjects, data in a cluster is mapped to a tangent space at the mean point of covariance matrices in that cluster and an SVM classifier on labeled data from relevant subjects is trained. Experiment on an EEG seizure database shows that the proposed method increases the accuracy over state-of-the-art from 86.83% to 89.84% and specificity from 87.38% to 89.64% while reducing the false positive rate/hour from 0.8/hour to 0.77/hour.	algorithm;cluster analysis;electroencephalography;sensitivity and specificity;signal processing;spatial variability	Samaneh Nasiri Ghosheh Bolagh;Gari D.

Higuchiu0027s fractal dimension (HFD), which calculates FD directly in time domain, was preferred as a nonlinear signal analysis method. EEG recordings of 6 males were collected for dataset. Results showed that HFD values of pleasant and unpleasant odor EEGs were not in normal distribution and variances between independent variables were not homogeneous in all EEG channels. HFD values of pleasant odors were significantly different from unpleasant ones in O2 (right occipital) and T7 (left temporal) channels. There was a strong correlation between frontal lobes (F3-F4) for all class of odors. HFD values of unpleasant odors were higher than pleasant odors. It showed that unpleasant odor EEGs have more complex patterns than pleasant ones.

Measuring stress- and fatigue-induced emotional responses by means of a wireless, wearable system would be useful for potentially averting roadway tragedies. The focus of this study was to develop and verify an emotional response-monitoring paradigm for drivers, derived from electromyography signals of the upper trapezius muscle, photoplethysmography signals of the earlobe, as well as inertial motion sensing of the head movement. The relevant sensors were connected to a microcontroller unit equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled low-energy module, which allows the transmission of those sensor readings to a mobile device in real time. A mobile device application was then used to extract the data from the sensors and to determine the driver's current emotion status, via a trained support vector machine (SVM). The emotional response paradigm, tested in ten subjects, consisted of 10 min baseline, 5 min prestimulus, and 5 min poststimulus measurements. Emotional responses were categorized into three classes: relaxed, stressed, and fatigued. The analysis integrated a total of 36 features to train the SVM model, and the final stimulus results revealed a high accuracy rate (99.52%). The proposed wearable system could be applied to an intelligent driver's safety alert system, to use those emotional responses to prevent accidents affecting themselves and/or other innocent victims.	baseline (configuration management);bluetooth;categorization;device driver;electromyography;maxima and minima;microcontroller;mobile device;programming paradigm;sensor;support vector machine;wearable computer	Boon Giin Lee;Teak Wei Chong;Boon-Leng Lee;Hee-Joon Park;Yoon Nyun Kim;Beomjoon Kim	2017	IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems	10.1109/THMS.2017.2658442	simulation;real-time computing;wearable computer;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;mobile device	Mobile	7.06939152159241	-86.2424015265891	90947

Our proposed system calculates the toilet timing in consideration with both their outing schedule and the amount of body water of them, and recommends going to a restroom sufficiently before they feel the need of urinating. In order to implement the system, we've come up with the physiological formula for non-invasive estimation of the amount of body water, and based on the estimation, the toilet timing is calculated. Also, we've devised the suggestion method of the toilet timing to the elderly in order both not to interfere their things to do while their outing and not to be ignored by them. In this paper, we describe our proposed system, and show the experimental result for evaluating both the toilet timing calculation and the suggestion method.	do while loop	Airi Tsuji;Tomoko Yonezawa;Hirotake Yamazoe;Shinji Abe;Noriaki Kuwahara;Kazunari Morimoto	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing	10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311144	simulation;medicine;operations management;surgery	Robotics	10.557377330203984	-85.17546695076902	91270

The measurements we use are clinically relevant kinematic signals, namely the variation during a locomotion gait cycle of the angles the knee makes with respect to the three-dimensional (3D) planes of flexion/extension, internal/external rotation, and abduction/adduction. Three groups of participants were used: a set of 24 workers exposed to knee straining postures (KS workers) acting as a test group, a control group of 25 non-KS posture workers, and a reference knee OA group of 29 subjects. We compared the kinematic data of KS workers to those of knee OA patients and non-KS subjects using the Bayes decision theory. The results shows that, using the 3D data taken together or the abduction/adduction data, the KS workers resembles often to the OA patients. The analysis on the transverse plane and on sagittal plane, i.e., the flexion/extension and the internal/external rotation, are not conclusive as the similarities are not significant. The kinematic gait analysis by Bayes decision rule shows the similarity of workers exposed to knee straining postures to OA gait pattern and justifies further prospective studies of KS workers in order to assess if gait pattern could be modified even before the onset of the disease.	abductive reasoning;color gradient;decision theory;function overloading;gait analysis;inverse kinematics;onset (audio);poor posture;prospective search;signal processing;technical support;transverse wave;windows legacy audio components	Neila Mezghani;Nathaly Gaudreault;Amar Mitiche;Leila Ayoubian;Youssef Ouakrim;Nicola Hagemeister;Jacques A. de Guise	2015	Artif.

ae51a9e6b99803ce2f89a1a11263db22e655d9f9	human behavior analysis from smartphone data streams		In the past decade multimedia systems have started including diverse modes of data to understand complex situations and build more sophisticated models. Some increasingly common modes in multimedia are intertwined data streams from sensor modalities such as wearable/mobile, environmental, and biosensors. These data streams offer new information sources to model and predict complex world situations as well as understanding and modeling humans. This paper makes two contributions to the modeling and analysis of multimodal data in the context of user behavior analysis. First, it introduces the use of a concept lattice based data fusion technique for recognizing events. Concept lattices are very effective when enough labeled data samples are not available for supervised machine learning algorithms, but human knowledge is available to develop classification approaches for recognition. Life events encode activities of daily living, and environmental events encode states and state transitions in environmental variables. Second, it introduces a framework that detects frequent co-occurrence patterns as sequential and parallel relations among events from multiple event streams. We show the applicability of our approach in finding interesting human behavior patterns by using longitudinal mobile data collected from 23 users over 1–2 months.	smartphone	Laleh Jalali;Hyungik Oh;Ramin Moazeni;Ramesh Jain	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46843-3_5	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	1.4418942591034762	-84.70604108639627	91346
6686c8affd423778baaa6ce2646cb16ceeb2224c	feasibility of detecting adhd patients' attention levels by classifying their eeg signals		Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), characterized by the lack of attention and focus, is one of the most spread cognitive disorders. Since electroencephalogram (EEG) signals carry extensive information about cognition skills, which include attention, then the potential of using EEG signals for people with low attention span can be quite significant. EEG can be read using the new wireless EEG reading devices often used by Brain-computer Interface (BCI) researchers. In parallel, serious games have been recently utilized for rehabilitating various cognitive and emotional deficits. In this paper, we put the two things together, and we investigate the integration of an EEG-controlled serious game that trains and strengthens patients' attention ability while using machine learning to detect their attention level. Our preliminary experiments with healthy individuals show an accuracy of up to 96% in classifying the EEG data to detect the correct attention state during gameplay. This promising result serves as motivation to test our models with actual ADHD patients in the future.	artificial neural network;auditory processing disorder;brain–computer interface;cognition;electroencephalography;experiment;machine learning;personalization;sensor	Alaa Eddin Alchalabi;Mohamed Elsharnouby;Shervin Shirmohammadi;Amer Nour Eddin	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2017.7985895	cognitive psychology;electroencephalography;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;cognition;attention span;psychology	ML	9.67654708985165	-91.81774116687853	91424

Noninvasive measurement of arterial stiffness is based on the measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), where PWV correlates with arterial stiffness. PWV depends on blood pressure and other physiological conditions. The aim of our study was to measure and analyze the effect of changes in airway pressure to PWVs between the chest and limbs. Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers and spontaneous breathing were used. We measured 30 healthy, non-smoking subjects aged between 21 and 35 years. Simultaneous measurements of whole body impedance, blood pressure and ECG were taken in a supine position. The relative changes in PWV values (mean ± standard deviation) during the Valsalva maneuver were: 0.82 ± 0.11 (thigh); 0.87 ± 0.10 (calf); 0.64 ± 0.19 (arm); O. 75 ± 0.16 (forearm); during the Mueller maneuver they were: 0.92 ± 0.11 (thigh); 0.91±0.09 (calf); 0.76±0.19 (arm); 0.81±0.14 (forearm). PWVs were lower during maneuvers than during spontaneous breathing. Changes in PWV during breathing maneuvers were more reflected nearer to the chest. Our results show PWV reference values between various parts of the human body during changes in airway pressure demonstrated by the Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers.	characteristic impedance;radek maneuver;spontaneous order;velocity (software development)	Magdalena Matejkova;Vlastimil Vondra;Josef Halámek;Ladislav Soukup;Filip Plesinger;Ivo Viscor;Pavel Jurák	2014	Computing in Cardiology 2014		medicine;diabetes mellitus;surgery;cardiology	HCI	14.907500643294256	-84.55209946528379	91501

We here propose some algorithms, based on signal bispectrum and bispectral entropy, to determine the unique features of independent actigraphy signals. Experiments were carried out on 20 randomly chosen actigraphy samples of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) database, with no information other than their aperiodicity. The Pearson correlation coefficient matrix and the histogram correlation matrix were computed to study the similarity of movements during sleep. The results obtained allowed us to explore the connections between certain sleep actigraphy patterns and certain pathologies.

e58fba2829a1e95b9d66bbececc27df10275c4e8	damage detection using time-frequency decay-rate based features		Some automotive components, for instance a clutch housing, need to fit the assembly (dimensional constraint), and must be perfectly weight balanced for proper functioning (functional fidelity), which could be achieved by removing material from the body (relaxed geometry). While such mission critical components require 100% inspection, current non-destructive methods are often inadequate, trying to trade-off cycle time with inspection thoroughness. In this paper, a non-destructive global structural damage detection method has been demonstrated at its infancy, to be fast, accurate, and immune to inconsistent resonant frequencies which is an outcome of relaxed geometry. This method requires a traditional wide band exogenous acoustic excitation of the component being evaluated, followed by a joint time-frequency characterization of the response such that it is immune to dominant modal frequencies. A quadratic discriminant analysis on the time-frequency features successfully detected all damaged samples and falsely identified 1 among the 6 healthy samples available for testing, as damaged.	acoustic cryptanalysis;linear discriminant analysis;mission critical;modal logic;quadratic classifier	Portia Banerjee;Debejyo Chakraborty;Teresa Rinker	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	10.1109/ICPHM.2017.7998319	feature extraction;time–frequency analysis;spectrogram;quadratic classifier;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;engineering;electronic engineering	Robotics	11.11000757119339	-95.64571644107588	91813

For simple data sets, cross-correlograms may reveal the coupling dynamics. But when dealing with high-dimensional multivariate data there is no such measure as the cross-correlogram. We propose a simple algorithm based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (kCCA) that computes a multivariate temporal filter which links one data modality to another one. The filters can be used to compute a multivariate extension of the cross-correlogram, the canonical correlogram, between data sources that have different dimensionalities and temporal resolutions. The canonical correlogram reflects the coupling dynamics between the two sources. The temporal filter reveals which features in the data give rise to these couplings and when they do so. We present results from simulations and neuroscientific experiments showing that tkCCA yields easily interpretable temporal filters and correlograms. In the experiments, we simultaneously performed electrode recordings and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in primary visual cortex of the non-human primate. While electrode recordings reflect brain activity directly, fMRI provides only an indirect view of neural activity via the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) response. Thus it is crucial for our understanding and the interpretation of fMRI signals in general to relate them to direct measures of neural activity acquired with electrodes. The results computed by tkCCA confirm recent models of the hemodynamic response to neural activity and allow for a more detailed analysis of neurovascular coupling dynamics.	algorithm;coefficient;coherence (physics);electroencephalography;experiment;francis;geeqie;hemodynamics;independent computing architecture;matlab;marc blank;matrix regularization;maximal set;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;phil bernstein;resonance;resting state fmri;simulation;smoothing;supervised learning;time series	Felix Bießmann;Frank C.

As the scales of studies increase, sensor orientation placement errors have become one of the most commonly seen difficulties for such systems. Assuming patients to wear sensors at the correct orientation is unrealistic and will result in a large amount of data loss or distortion. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a double layer classification model. The first layer, not assuming correct sensor orientation, uses orientation-invariant accelerometer magnitude to construct a highly conservative walking detection model. The detected walking beacons from this layer are used to compare to the training template to obtain the true sensor orientation. Then proper rotation matrix can be applied to the whole day data, and fed into the second layer of a finer classifier where orientation-variant features are used. In order to show validity of this method, we hired 7 healthy subjects and 2 stroke patients in the rehab process to wear the sensors for two days and at least 6 hours each day. Ground truth are labeled manually with a Matlab GUI tool. Precision and recall for walking detection in each day are reported and discussed.	activity recognition;distortion;graphical user interface;ground truth;matlab;machine learning;multiclass classification;performance;precision and recall;sensor;traffic collision avoidance system	Xiaoxu Wu;Xiaoyu Xu;Yan Wang;William J.

BCI provides a non-muscular communication channel and therefore it assumes a crucial importance for individuals with motor functions severely affected. The evaluation of BCI by individuals with severe disabilities is of utmost importance to understand the BCI feasibility as an assistive technology. This paper summarizes some of the results achieved in our research lab, with different BCIs tested by individuals with severe motor disabilities, focusing on some practical aspects of BCI evaluation, and on the target population.	brain–computer interface	Gabriel Pires;Urbano Nunes;Miguel Castelo-Branco	2012		10.1016/j.procs.2012.10.032	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science	HCI	8.655185157654383	-91.6017457778815	92001

Automatic emotion recognition enables the HCI to become more intelligent and user friendly. Although numerous studies have been performed in this field, emotion recognition is still an extremely challenging task, especially in real-world practice usage. In this work, probabilistic neural network (PNN), with advantage of simple, efficient, and easy to train, was employed to recognize emotions elicited by watching music videos from scalp EEG. The publicly available DEAP emotion database was used to validate our algorithms. The powers of 4 frequency bands of EEG were extracted as features. The results show that the mean classification accuracy of PNN is 81.21% for valence(≥5 and <5) and 81.26% for arousal(≥5 and <5) across 32 subjects, similar with the results of SVM. In addition, they demonstrate that higher frequency bands (beta and gamma) play more important role in emotion classification than lower ones (theta and alpha). For the purpose of practical emotion recognition system, we proposed a ReliefF-based channel selection algorithm to reduce the number of used channels for convenience in practical usage. The results show that while using PNN, the 98% of the maximum classification accuracy can be obtained with only 9 (for valence) and 8 (for arousal) best channels, however, 19 (for valence) and 14 (for arousal) channels are needed while using SVM.	artificial neural network;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;frequency band;human–computer interaction;ibm notes;probabilistic neural network;real-time locating system;selection algorithm;statistical classification;usability	Jianhai Zhang;Ming Chen;Sanqing Hu;Yu Cao;Robert Kozma	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844584	support vector machine;speech recognition;electroencephalography;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;probabilistic logic	Robotics	9.048030497568572	-94.2667319902391	92053

The motor response to smell was found to be abnormal in an animal model of cerebral palsy following fetal hypoxia-ischemia. We hypothesized that fetal hypoxia-ischemia causes long-lasting and selective olfactory tract injury. A population of newborn rabbits with motor deficits was selected after spontaneous delivery following uterine ischemia at 22 days gestation (E22, 70% term). MnCl(2), 20 mg/kg, was administered in both nostrils at postnatal day 1 (E32). One nostril was occluded to control for smell augmentation through the other open nostril by intermittent amyl acetate stimulation for 6 h. T1-weighted MRI images were obtained on newborn rabbits. Amyl acetate exposure increased augmentation of Mn(2+) uptake in olfactory epithelium on the open side in control group but the augmentation was decreased after hypoxia. The proportion of animals with a greater enhancement in the open side increased in controls after amyl acetate, but not in hypoxia. Mn(2+) took longer to arrive at the olfactory bulbs and the rate of subsequent increase was slower in hypoxia. Concomitantly, the thickness of olfactory epithelium and the number of mature olfactory neurons, detected on olfactory marker protein immunostaining, were significantly less in the hypoxic group. Functional MRI studies are superior to neurobehavioral smell testing in the rabbit kits as they are more sensitive and quantifiable measures and do not depend upon the motor response.

Because of the complexity of cardiovascular system, it is difficult to research the internal principle completely. Consequently, it is usual to study by modeling and simulation. In this article, the cardiovascular system model was established by using Matlab/Simulink. According to the functional test and the evaluation, the results of the model are highly similar to the clinical data, so it can be used widely to simulate various diseases and accidents. Based on the results, we mainly use the model to analyze the effective factors on pressure-volume loop of left ventricle, including preload, after-load and myocardial contractility. In a cardiac cycle, the pressure-volume (P-V) loop of left ventricle will always be in a series of dynamic changes. The pressure-volume relationship of left ventricle is a closed loop that could be used to evaluate the left ventricle's function. Preload, after-load and myocardial contractility always influence the cardiac outputs; the P-V loop will be changed as these factors change. The research focuses on the changes of these three factors and the corresponding changes of the P-V loop.	functional testing;matlab;preload (software);simulation;simulink	Yonghua Lao;Hongke Ji;Yuming Huang;Junwei Liang;Yueshan Huang;Yuhe Li;Zhenyu Zhu;Zhiguan Huang	2015	2015 8th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2015.7401517	intensive care medicine;preload;mathematical model;mathematics;statistics;cardiology	SE	15.436580636618187	-83.83362253190509	92144

A home bathroom scale is an example of such a device, typically used to measure body weight and very often its composition (e.g. body water/fat percentage). In this paper, we analyzed a potential use of the bathroom scale to measure electrocardiogram (ECG) from electrodes located on the scale's tile. In particular we used both, simulations and real measurements to analyze the possibility of a such approach. We originally created a simple finite element model to analyze a role of a vector cardiogram projected on the foot-foot lead. We also analyzed results obtained during experiments in which took part (in total) 13 healthy volunteers. They were examined both, in sitting and standing positions. As a result we showed that the quality of the recorded ECG signal from feet is highly related to the electrical vector orientation of the individual's heart. We additionally compared the detected QRS complexes from hands-and feet-sampled ECG for sitting and standing positions. Results showed that for the sitting position the difference was only for 3.6% of all QRS complexes, while for standing one about 24.9%.

A template-based approach calls for a sound processing of the manifold sensor signals in order to perform the needed comparisons reasonably.

90fa2aaf264ff41403eb8113da62f3e022026344	screening of pathological voice from ars using neural networks		These days there are many attempts to diagnose patient’s voice by only acoustic voice signal. The major purpose of such experiments are screening the possible patients and lead them to the early diagnosis and treatment. [1][2][3][4][5] Acoustic screening of patient's voice is important in terms of many aspects. It is important for both doctors, who is not an expert of vocal diseases and the patient who want to check their voice without going to the clinic. If such a test is done on the public telephone network, more non-expert doctors and more patient can diagnose their voice without going to the hospital. Of course the purpose of this kind of approach is not to give them an exact diagnosis or treatment. It is only to give them the warnings to visit the hospital and to let them find vocal diseases earlier. The background of this kind of research is that most of the patient who come with severe vocal disease are too late when they arrived to the hospital. Even though there are some previous researches about discrimination of pathological voice, those were based on pre-recorded ones from the hospital. So the usage was limited to the patients who visit the hospital. If such kind of diagnostic information is provided through the telephone network, it will be much efficient. But the problem when trying to use the telephone network is that the quality of voice from the telephone is not as good as normal high quality recordings. In previous researches wide-band(25KHz) signal was used. [2][3] So we tried to investigate the change of acoustical characteristics and tried classification based on the result in parallel. In the following sections it is described how the collection, analysis and classification is performed using ARS voice. Also the acoustical differences between ARS voice and DAT voice are measured.	acoustic cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;display resolution;experiment;intel dynamic acceleration;statistical classification	Cheol-Woo Jo;Kwangin Kim;Dae-Hyun Kim;Soo-Geon Wang	2001			artificial neural network;speech recognition;computer science	ML	15.78900704538303	-88.96724040933825	92359

Both approaches are evaluated in terms of specificity and sensitivity as well as their applicability for a real-time implementation. One approach is solely based on the frequency distribution of a windowed time series, while the second approach utilizes commonly employed features found in the literature (e.g. FFT, entropy, peak frequency, correlation). The two algorithms detect tremor at rest in windowed time series. The effects of varying window lengths and detection thresholds are studied. The results indicate that an SVM with a linear kernel, in combination with the frequency distribution, may already be enough to accurately and reliably detect tremor in windowed time series. The approach, after being trained with a first dataset of signals obtained from 12 patients, achieved a sensitivity of 88.4% and specificity of 89.4% in a second dataset from 64 PD patients.	algorithm;entropy (information theory);fast fourier transform;linear algebra;real-time clock;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;time series;window function	Claas Ahlrichs;Albert Samà	2014		10.4108/icst.pervasivehealth.2014.254928	embedded system;support vector machine;inertial measurement unit;speech recognition;computer science;operating system;machine learning;accelerometer	HCI	15.092008310467671	-89.72216790388072	92388

It is the common denominator in various recognition tasks, such as signature verification, person identification based on keystroke dynamics, detection of cardiovascular diseases and brain disorders (e.g. early stage of Alzheimer disease or dementia). This tutorial aims to give an introduction to the most prominent challenges, methods, evaluation protocols and biomedical applications related to time series classification. Besides the """"conventional"""" time series classification task, early classification and semi-supervised classification will be considered. Both preprocessing techniques -- FFT, SAX, etc. -- and wide-spread classifiers -- such as similarity-based, feature-based, motif/shaplet-based classifiers and convolutional neural networks -- will be covered. As dynamic time warping (DTW) is the one of the key components of many time series classifiers, including recent ones based on deep learning, we will describe this technique in detail.

a6c034cfecea02d265dbcf128ac03a0c8de8a305	heart rate variability as a predictive biomarker of thermal comfort		Thermal comfort is an assessment of one’s satisfaction with the surroundings; yet, most mechanisms that are used to provide thermal comfort are based on approaches that preclude physiological, psychological and personal psychophysics that are precursors to thermal comfort. This leads to many people feeling either cold or hot in an environment that was supposed to be thermally comfortable to most users. To address this problem, this paper proposes to use heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort status. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we conjectured that people’s thermal comfort could be more accurately estimated based on their heart rate variability (HRV). To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral, and nonlinear HRV indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a cold, a neutral, and a hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is distinctively different depending on the thermal environment and that it is possible to reliably predict each subject’s thermal state (cold, neutral, and hot) with up to a 93.7% accuracy. The result of this study suggests that it could be possible to design automatic real-time thermal comfort controllers based on people’s HRV.	heart rate variability	Kizito Nkurikiyeyezu;Yuta Suzuki;Guillaume Lopez	2018	J.

ffce732d18c4b4d48499302acc7b4e8437bd68a6	neuronal activity significantly reduces water displacement: dwi of a vital rat spinal cord with no hemodynamic effect		Changes in the diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) signal were observed to be correlated with neuronal activity during chemically induced brain activity, epileptic seizures, or visual stimulation. These changes suggest a possible reduction in water displacement that accompanies neuronal activity, but were possibly affected by other physiological mechanisms such as blood oxygenation level and blood flow. We developed an imaging experiment of an excised and vital newborn rat spinal cord to examine the effect of neuronal function on the displacement of water molecules as measured by DWI signal. This approach provides a DWI experiment of a vital mammalian CNS tissue in the absence of some of the systemic sources of noise. We detected a significant and reproducible drop with an average value of 19.5 ± 1.6% (mean ± SE) upon activation. The drop repeated itself in three orthogonal directions. ADC values corresponded to an oblate anisotropy. This result was validated by high resolution DWI of a fixed tissue, imaged with an ultra-high field MRI. The results support our working hypothesis that water displacement is affected by neuronal activation. These results further imply that water displacement might serve as a potential marker for brain function, and that, although commonly viewed as wholly electrochemical, neuronal activity includes a significant mechanical dimension that affects water displacement.	anisotropy;cns;cell respiration;diffusion weighted imaging;displacement mapping;electroencephalography;epilepsy;hemodynamics;image resolution;infant, newborn;photic stimulation;psychologic displacement;seizures;spinal cord;status epilepticus	Nitzan Tirosh;Uri Nevo	2013	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.02.065	pathology;anatomy;surgery	HCI	20.407000084750862	-81.20653376143906	93117

These devices are significantly more affordable than their medical counterparts, and are mainly used to measure levels of engagement, focus, relaxation and stress. This information is sought after for marketing research and games. However, these EEG devices have the potential to enable users to interact with their surrounding environment using thoughts only, without activating any muscles. In this paper, we present preliminary results that demonstrate that despite reduced voltage and time sensitivity compared to medical-grade EEG systems, the quality of the signals of the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset is sufficiently good in allowing discrimination between imaging events. We collected streams of EEG raw data and trained different types of classifiers to discriminate between three states (rest and two imaging events). We achieved a generalisation error of less than 2% for two types of non-linear classifiers.	control system;epoc (operating system);electroencephalography;emotiv systems;experiment;generalization error;human computer;human–computer interaction;linear classifier;linear programming relaxation;mental state;neurofeedback;nonlinear system;peripheral	Manisha Senadeera;Frédéric Maire;Andry Rakotonirainy	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26350-2_44	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	ML	11.776444887932144	-92.37842469606707	93267
23c9e9996144320413bc32a11537575afc74b571	practical one-dimensional measurements of age-related brain atrophy are validated by 3-dimensional values and clinical outcomes: a retrospective study	imaging radiology	BACKGROUND Age-related brain atrophy has been represented by simple 1-dimensional (1-D) measurements on computed tomography (CT) for several decades and, more recently, with 3-dimensional (3-D) analysis, using brain volume (BV) and cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV). We aimed to show that simple 1-D measurements would be associated with 3-D values of age-related atrophy and that they would be related to post-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).   METHODS Patients ≥60 years with head trauma were classified with central atrophy (lateral ventricular body width >30 mm) and/or cortical atrophy (sulcus width ≥2.5 mm). Composite atrophy was the presence of central or cortical atrophy. BV and CSFV were computed using a Siemens Syngo workstation (VE60A).   RESULTS Of 177 patients, traits were age 78.3 ± 10, ICH 32.2%, central atrophy 39.5%, cortical atrophy 31.1%, composite atrophy 49.2%, BV 1,156 ± 198 mL, and CSFV 102.5 ± 63 mL. CSFV was greater with central atrophy (134.4 mL), than without (81.7 mL, p < 0.001). BV was lower with cortical atrophy (1,034 mL), than without (1,211 mL; p < 0.001). BV was lower with composite atrophy (1,103 mL), than without (1,208 mL; p < 0.001). CSFV was greater with composite atrophy (129.1 mL), than without (76.8 mL, p < 0.001). CSFV÷BV was greater with composite atrophy (12.3%), than without (6.7%, p < 0.001). Age was greater with composite atrophy (80.4 years), than without (76.3, p = 0.006). Age had an inverse correlation with BV (p < 0.001) and a direct correlation with CSFV (p = 0.0002) and CSFV÷BV (p < 0.001). ICH was greater with composite atrophy (49.4%), than without (15.6%; p < 0.001; odds ratio = 5.3). BV was lower with ICH (1,089 mL), than without (1,188 mL; p = 0.002). CSFV÷BV was greater with ICH (11.1 %), than without (8.7%, p = 0.02). ICH was independently associated with central atrophy (p = 0.001) and cortical atrophy (p = 0.003).   CONCLUSIONS Simple 1-D measurements of age-related brain atrophy are associated with 3-D values. Clinical validity of these methods is also supported by their association with post-injury ICH. Intracranial 3-D software is not available on many CT scanners and can be cumbersome, when available. Simple 1-D measurements, using the study methodology, are a practical method to objectify the presence of age-related brain atrophy.	atrophic;ct scan;cerebral atrophy;classification;cortical implant;craniocerebral trauma;electrocorticography;groove;intracranial hemorrhages;lateral thinking;odds ratio;patients;spinal cerebrospinal fluid leak;structure of body of lateral ventricle;trait;traumatic intracranial hemorrhage;units of measure - siemens;workstation;brain volume;width	C.

512aa534e69312791f5e6a1f02ca75c600fb5f96	measuring physical activity of older adults via smartwatch and stigmergic receptive fields		Physical activity level (PAL) in older adults can enhance healthy aging, improve functional capacity, and prevent diseases. It is known that human annotations of PAL can be affected by subjectivity and inaccuracy. Recently developed smart devices can allow a non-invasive, analytic, and continuous gathering of physiological signals. We present an innovative computational system fed by signals of heartbeat rate, wrist motion and pedometer sensed by a smartwatch. More specifically, samples of each signal are aggregated by functional structures called trails. The trailing process is inspired by stigmergy, an insects’ coordination mechanism, and is managed by computational units called stigmergic receptive fields (SRFs). SRFs, which compute the similarity between trails, are arranged in a stigmergic perceptron to detect a collection of micro-behaviours of the raw signal, called archetypes. A SRF is adaptive to subjects: its structural parameters are tuned by a differential evolution algorithm. SRFs are used in a multilayer architecture, providing further levels of processing to realize macro analyses in the application domain. As a result, the architecture provides a daily PAL, useful to detect behavioural shift indicating initial signs of disease or deviations in performance. As a proof of concept, the approach has been experimented on three subjects.	algorithm;application domain;british informatics olympiad;computation;differential evolution;discriminator;emergence;general-purpose modeling;pal;perceptron;physical review a;sensor;smart device;smartwatch;stigmergy	Antonio L.

861796656b6ed80a08744ff8fbe64c25c7e299a8	the advantages of wearable green reflected photoplethysmography	green light;heat stress;photoplethysmography;infrared light;reflection	This report evaluates the efficacy of reflected-type green light photoplethysmography (green light PPG). Transmitted infrared light was used for PPG and the arterial pulse was monitored transcutaneously. The reflected PPG signal contains AC components based on the heartbeat-related signal from the arterial blood flow and DC components, which include reflectance and scattering from tissue. Generally, changes in AC components are monitored, but the DC components play an important role during heat stress. In this study, we compared the signal of green light PPG to infrared PPG and ECG during heat stress. The wavelengths of the green and infrared light were 525 nm and 880 nm, respectively. Experiments were performed on young healthy subjects in cold (10°C), hot (45°C), and normal environments. The pulse rates were compared among three measurement devices and the AC and DC components of the PPG signal were evaluated during heat stress. The pulse rates obtained from green light PPG were strongly correlated with the R–R interval of an electrocardiogram in all environments, but those obtained from infrared light PPG displayed a weaker correlation with cold exposure. The AC components were of similar signal output for both wavelengths during heat stress. Also, the DC components for green light PPG were similar during heat stress, but showed less signal output for infrared light PPG during hot exposure. The main reason for the reduced DC components was speculated to be the increased blood flow at the vascular bed. Therefore, reflected green light PPG can be useful for pulse rate monitoring because it is less influenced by the tissue and vein region.	coefficient;electrocardiography;experiment;heat stress disorders;immunoglobulin lambda-chains;indocyanine green;infrared rays;photoplethysmography;pulse rate;srgn gene;skin temperature;wearable technology;disease transmission;wavelength	Yuka Maeda;Masaki Sekine;Toshiyo Tamura	2010	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-010-9506-z	reflection;infrared;photoplethysmogram	HCI	24.222646247215295	-84.65208027897724	93520

Our mathematical model fits measured heart rate and galvanic skin response during intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal pressure elevation, simulates the baroreflex and estimates parameters that should quantify mean autonomic tone of parasympathetic activity (MATpar), maximal autonomic tone of parasympathetic activity (MATpar, total autonomic tone of sympathetic activity (TATsym) and autonomic tone balance (ATB) on 5 healthy subjects. An extended statistical analysis including multivariable linear regression analysis and correlation analysis was performed in order to study patterns of variation of our model-based estimates and possible relationships with time–frequency markers of heart rate variability during the tachycardia phase 2 and bradycardia phase 4 of the VM. It was found that, MATpar significantly decreased by 32 ± 8% (p < 0.001) from 0.87 ± 0.02 n.u. (normalized unit) in phase 1 to 0.58 ± 0.05 n.u. in phase 2 and was found to be significantly correlated to HF (R = 0.87, p < 0.05) that decreased from 0.5 ± 0.21 n.u. to 0.1 ± 0.01 n.u. Meanwhile TATsym increased by 2135 ± 711% (p < 0.001) from 0.14 ± 0.05 n.u. to 2.89 ± 0.7 n.u. and was significantly correlated to LF (R = 0.95, p < 0.05) that increased from 0.49 ± 0.21 n.u. to 0.89 ± 0.01. MATpar significantly increased by 87 ± 63% (p < 0.001) from 0.53 ± 0.18 n.u. in phase 3 to 0.89 ± 0.02 n.u. in phase 4 and was found to be significantly correlated to RMSSD (R = 0.91, p < 0.05) that increased from 18.61 ± 5.23 ms to 36.31 ± 7.02 ms. Meanwhile TATsym significantly decreased by 82 ± 13% (p < 0.01) from 1.46 ± 1.4 n.u. to 0.14 ± 0.05 n.u. and was significantly correlated to SDNN (R = 0.91, p < 0.05) that decreased from 28.79 ± 8.17 ms to 22.62 ± 9.63 ms. An additional Wilcoxon sign test suggested the following markers that might provide the most significant assessment of autonomic nervous activity in a given phase of VM: SDNN in phases 0 & 5, TATsym in phases 1 & 2 and ATB in phases 3 & 4 for sympathetic activity assessment; RMSSD in phases 0 & 5, MATpar in phases 1 & 2, MATpar in phases 3 & 4 for parasympathetic activity assessment. Results suggest that statistical quantities derived from mathematical models of cardiovascular control provide useful information for assessing the distinct contribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches on heart rate variability during the Valsalva Maneuver.	autonomic computing;fits;galvanic isolation;heart rate variability;in-phase and quadrature components;mathematical model;maximal set;mean squared error;z/vm	Michel Kana;Jirí Holcík	2011	Biomed.

EEG signals associated with imagined fists and feet movements were filtered and processed using wavelet transform analysis for feature extraction. The proposed work used Neural Networks (NNs) as a classifier that enables the classification of imagined movements into either fists or feet. Wavelet families such as Daubechies, Symlets, and Coiflets wavelets were used to analyze the extracted events and then different feature extraction measures were calculated for three detail levels of the wavelet coefficients. Intensive NN training and testing experiments were carried out and different network configurations were compared. The optimum classification performance of 89.11% was achieved with a NN classifier of 20 hidden layers while using the Mean Absolute Value (MAV) of the Coiflets wavelet coefficients as inputs to NN. The proposed system showed a good performance that enables controlling computer applications via imagined fists and feet movements.	artificial neural network;coefficient;computer;electroencephalography;experiment;feature extraction;humans;real-time transcription;stationary wavelet transform;statistical classification	Mohammad H.

4710fb423e47ad8f36c947dec00e7904e419d3a6	estimation of biomarkers for autism and its co-morbidities using resting state eeg		Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) is a collection of heterogeneous disorders with prevalent cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. ASD is generally considered a life-long disability occurring as a stand-alone disorder but it occurs with possible co-morbid conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Anxiety etc., Electroencephalography (EEG) studies have been identified as one of the most widely used tool for assessing the cognitive functions. Literature suggests strong evidences of stable pattern of EEG associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. But the understanding of the subtle variations between various co-morbidities and the pathophysiology behind it needs appropriate signal processing routines. Hence, this work focuses on the identification of electrophysiological biomarkers from the acquired EEG signals of low-functioning autistic children to distinguish between the various co-morbidities of autism. Results show that the sub band power and coherence parameters estimated from segmented resting state EEG waveforms are capable of differentiating the various subgroups under consideration. The identified biomarkers can thus act as supportive tools for the physician in clinically assessing the Autistic children of different groups and to define the various training approaches for children who differ widely.	auditory processing disorder;calculus of variations;cognition;coherence (physics);electroencephalography;foremost;multimodal interaction;resting state fmri;signal processing	K.

The decade before that, Rosalind Picard’s seminal book gave birth to affective computing. Both fields have since skyrocketed. Today, affective computing can enhance mHealth by, for example, encouraging mHealth technology adherence through emotionally intelligent device interactions, such as engagement monitoring. In the broader healthcare field, affective computing can be used to recognize pain in a patient’s voice or face, monitor clinical depression, or help individuals with autism recognize and express emotion. And the technical experiences gained from mHealth can be applied to mobile affective computing, which is slowly but surely entering consumers’ everyday lives. In “Real-Time Tele-Monitoring of Patients with Chronic HeartFailure Using a Smartphone: Lessons Learned” (IEEE Trans. Affective Computing, vol. 7, no. 3, 2016, pp. 206–219), Daniel Aranki, Gregorij Kurillo, Posu Yan, David M. Liebovitz, and Ruzena Bajcsy present a smartphone-based system for monitoring patients with chronic heart failure. The system uses real-time passive remote monitoring to measure physical outdoor activity and walking distance via minute-by-minute GPS tracking, and estimates energy expenditure via accelerometry. The authors’ pilot study of 15 participants sought to establish the system’s real-world feasibility. They developed a secure-transmission distributed approach, which allowed medical staff to intervene at any suspicion of urgency; they also passively monitored the subjects by measuring vital signs and general cardiovascular symptoms, and actively monitored through daily surveys. In their article, Aranki and his colleagues touch on the requirements, acceptability, usability, and usage fatigue implications. They rightfully state that these and the “challenges, privacy considerations, and lessons learned” apply to other chronic health conditions that could benefit from continuous mHealth technologies. Most certainly, this also holds for a broad range of affective states.	affective computing;gps tracking unit;global positioning system;interaction;mhealth;musicbrainz picard;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;robert istepanian;rosalind (education platform);secure transmission;smartphone;television;usability	Björn W.

To address this problem, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of autonomously detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the older adult population. We implement a signal processing approach equipped with a machine learning paradigm to process and analyze real-world data acquired using home-based unobtrusive sensing technologies. Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of three years, a number of measures associated with the subjects' walking speed and general activity in the home were calculated. Different time spans of these measures were used to generate feature vectors to train and test two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machines and random forests. We were able to autonomously detect MCI in older adults with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks. This study is of great significance since it can potentially assist in the early detection of cognitive impairment in older adults.	algorithm;cognition disorders;dementia;early diagnosis;feature vector;forests;impaired cognition;machine learning;mild cognitive disorder;programming paradigm;random forest;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;signal processing;support vector machine;walking speed	Ahmad Akl;Babak Taati;Alex Mihailidis	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2389149	support vector machine;simulation;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;sensor;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication;receiver operating characteristic	HCI	9.197950680678913	-86.88518695326887	93985
9e5bfcae060393fb4822504cdb04897c1de214ab	a review of channel selection algorithms for eeg signal processing	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Digital processing of electroencephalography (EEG) signals has now been popularly used in a wide variety of applications such as seizure detection/prediction, motor imagery classification, mental task classification, emotion classification, sleep state classification, and drug effects diagnosis. With the large number of EEG channels acquired, it has become apparent that efficient channel selection algorithms are needed with varying importance from one application to another. The main purpose of the channel selection process is threefold: (i) to reduce the computational complexity of any processing task performed on EEG signals by selecting the relevant channels and hence extracting the features of major importance, (ii) to reduce the amount of overfitting that may arise due to the utilization of unnecessary channels, for the purpose of improving the performance, and (iii) to reduce the setup time in some applications. Signal processing tools such as time-domain analysis, power spectral estimation, and wavelet transform have been used for feature extraction and hence for channel selection in most of channel selection algorithms. In addition, different evaluation approaches such as filtering, wrapper, embedded, hybrid, and human-based techniques have been widely used for the evaluation of the selected subset of channels. In this paper, we survey the recent developments in the field of EEG channel selection methods along with their applications and classify these methods according to the evaluation approach.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;domain analysis;electroencephalography;embedded system;feature extraction;filter (signal processing);flip-flop (electronics);overfitting;signal processing;spectral density estimation;wavelet transform;wrapper library	Turky N.

It involves insertion of a breathing tube into the trachea i.e. the windpipe connecting the larynx and the lungs. Often, this procedure is performed by the paramedics (aka providers) under challenging prehospital settings e.g. roadside, ambulances or helicopters. Successful intubations could be lifesaving, whereas, failed intubation could potentially be fatal. Under prehospital environments, ETI success rates among the paramedics are surprisingly low and this necessitates better training and performance evaluation of ETI skills. Currently, few objective metrics exist to quantify the differences in ETI techniques between providers. In this pilot study, we develop a quantitative framework for discriminating the kinematic characteristics of providers with different experience levels. The system utilizes statistical analysis on spatio-temporal multimodal features extracted from optical motion capture, accelerometers and electromyography (EMG) sensors. Our experiments involved three individuals performing intubations on a dummy, each with different levels of training. Quantitative performance analysis on multimodal features revealed distinctive differences among different skill levels. In future work, the feedback from these analysis could potentially be harnessed for enhanced ETI training.	dummy variable (statistics);electromyography;experiment;motion capture;multimodal interaction;performance evaluation;sensor	Samarjit Das;Jestin N.

A prevailing theory, largely unproven in humans, is that it involves the activation of endogenous opioid antinociceptive systems and mu-opioid receptors (MORs). This is also a neurotransmitter system that mediates the effects of placebo-induced analgesia. This overlap in potential mechanisms may explain the lack of differentiation between traditional acupuncture and either non-traditional or sham acupuncture in multiple controlled clinical trials. We compared both short- and long-term effects of traditional Chinese acupuncture (TA) versus sham acupuncture (SA) treatment on in vivo MOR binding availability in chronic pain patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM). Patients were randomized to receive either TA or SA treatment over the course of 4 weeks. Positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-carfentanil was performed once during the first treatment session and then repeated a month later following the eighth treatment. Acupuncture therapy evoked short-term increases in MOR binding potential, in multiple pain and sensory processing regions including the cingulate (dorsal and subgenual), insula, caudate, thalamus, and amygdala. Acupuncture therapy also evoked long-term increases in MOR binding potential in some of the same structures including the cingulate (dorsal and perigenual), caudate, and amygdala. These short- and long-term effects were absent in the sham group where small reductions were observed, an effect more consistent with previous placebo PET studies. Long-term increases in MOR BP following TA were also associated with greater reductions in clinical pain. These findings suggest that divergent MOR processes may mediate clinically relevant analgesic effects for acupuncture and sham acupuncture.	acupuncture analgesia;acupuncture procedure;acupuncture therapy discipline;acupuncture, ear;amygdaloid structure;analgesics;cell differentiation process;chronic pain;endogenous opiates;fm broadcasting;fibromyalgia;five element acupuncture;gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor;insula of reil;kohn–sham equations;lambda-mu calculus;mathematics of operations research;model order reduction;neurotransmitters;opioid receptor;opioids;patients;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;randomized algorithm;receptors, opioid, mu;sensory process;thalamic structure;traditional pulse diagnosis;video-in video-out;x-ray computed tomography	Richard E.

Both CCA and GLM techniques, however, typically perform calculations on a per-voxel basis and do not consider relationships neighboring voxels may have. Clustered voxel analyses have then been developed to improve fMRI signal detections by taking advantages of relationships of neighboring voxels. Mean-shift clustering (MSC) is another technique which takes into account properties of neighboring voxels and can be considered for enhancing fMRI activation detection.   METHODS This study examines the adoption of MSC to fMRI analysis. MSC was applied to a Statistical Parameter Image generated with the CCA technique on both simulated and real fMRI data. The MSC technique was then compared with CCA and CCA plus cluster analysis. A range of kernel sizes were used to examine how the technique behaves.   RESULTS Receiver Operating Characteristic curves shows an improvement over CCA and Cluster analysis. False positive rates are lower with the proposed technique. MSC allows the use of a low intensity threshold and also does not require the use of a cluster size threshold, which improves detection of weak activations and highly focused activations.   CONCLUSION The proposed technique shows improved activation detection for both simulated and real Blood Oxygen Level Dependent fMRI data. More detailed studies are required to further develop the proposed technique.	cluster analysis;congenital contractural arachnodactyly;cross-correlation;fbn2 wt allele;general linear model;generalized linear model;magnetic resonance imaging;mean shift;oxygen;receiver operating characteristic;sensor;voxel;fmri	Leo Ai;Xin Gao;Jinhu Xiong	2014		10.1186/1471-2342-14-6	pathology;magnetic resonance imaging;cluster analysis;nuclear medicine	ML	21.446001932860568	-82.51822667723656	94629

Maintaining high cognition is particularly important for the drivers behind the steering wheel. It requires an optimal estimation system to online continuously detect drivers' cognitive state related to abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based alertness estimation system with automatic feature selection mechanism. The independent component analysis (ICA) is used first to decompose the measured electroencephalogram (EEG). Then, a time-frequency analysis is performed to evaluate the time-frequency characteristic of each ICA component. We also proposed a new adaptive feature extracting mechanism for selections of frequency bands and ICA components. Different ranges of the alpha rhythm of subjects can be evaluated by the adaptive feature extracting mechanism according to the correlation coefficient between the ICA time-frequency response and the driving performance. The extracted features are then trained both by linear regression model and self-constructing neuro-fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) for the estimation of driving performance. The training and testing results of SONFIN are 96% and 91%, while the results of linear regression model are 90% and 85%, respectively. It demonstrates that the proposed adaptive feature extracting mechanism can achieve a great performance in alertness estimation with frequency band and component selection.	bayesian network;coefficient;cognition;electroencephalography;feature selection;frequency analysis;frequency band;frequency response;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;neuro-fuzzy;steering wheel;time–frequency analysis	Chin-Teng Lin;Wen-Hung Chao;Yu-Chieh Chen;Sheng-Fu Liang	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571458	speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;pattern recognition;virtual reality;feature selection	Robotics	14.895140749543755	-91.83628224501278	94965

Compared to traditional sEMG-based human machine interface (HMI), the ultrasound can provide some information about the morphological changes of muscles and has higher resolution. It is possible for the US-based HMI to recognize some more dexterous hand gesture especially for some finger motions. In the experiment, the subjects were instructed to perform 14 different finger motions. The sEMG signals and the ultrasound images were collected simultaneously. The 2-fold cross-validation with LDA classifier was used to analyze the accuracy. The mean accuracy of US-based HMI was nearly 96.37% while the sEMG was 92.41%. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that the US-based HMI had a significantly higher classification accuracy than sEMG-based HMI. What's more, the difference between individuals and finger motions of ultrasound was significantly smaller than that of sEMG. The US-based HMI performed better and more stable than sEMG, which may imply that ultrasound has a great potential to be an alternative method to sEMG regarding precise control, or it can corporate with sEMG to achieve a better HMI.	cross-validation (statistics);electromyography;human–computer interaction;performance;user interface	Youjia Huang;Honghai Liu	2016	2016 9th International Conference on Human System Interactions (HSI)	10.1109/HSI.2016.7529618	computer vision;speech recognition;engineering;communication	Robotics	13.000252004624077	-91.07969134097087	94974

In this research, we propose an unobtrusive, maintenance free fluid intake monitoring system based on passive (batteryless), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology by attaching a single RFID tag to a drinking container. In particular, we employ Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and phase patterns embedded in the RFID data stream to recognize individual instances of natural drinking episodes. We conducted experiments in a realistic setting using broadly scripted activity routines with 8 young volunteers. Promising results achieved in this preliminary investigation is a strong indication of the possibility of employing passive RFID technology for monitoring fluid intake in particular for recognizing natural drinking episodes in real time.	algorithm;automatic control;embedded system;experiment;passive optical network;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time clock;the australian;ultra high frequency;unobtrusive javascript	Asangi Jayatilaka;Damith Chinthana Ranasinghe	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on RFID (RFID)	10.1109/RFID.2016.7488009	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Robotics	6.444536524443509	-86.66344427568562	95214

Many works concern especially one type of incidents—fall detection. This paper concerns detection of different activities. The proposed approach is based on use of simple rules that make possible to distinct considered events. The rules are defined with use of measured acceleration and phone orientation and take into account moments of event occurrences.

In many experimental situations, however, neural signals have a broadband character and if oscillatory activity is present, its dynamical origin is unknown. To cope with these problems, a framework for detecting nonlinear oscillatory activity in broadband time series is presented. First, a narrow-band oscillatory mode is extracted from a broadband background. Second, it is tested whether the extracted mode is significantly different from linearly filtered noise, modelled as a linear stochastic process possibly passed through a static nonlinear transformation. If a nonlinear oscillatory mode is positively detected, further analysis using nonlinear approaches such as the phase synchronization analysis can potentially bring new information. For linear processes, however, standard approaches such as the coherence analysis are more appropriate and provide sufficient description of underlying interactions with smaller computational effort. The method is illustrated in a numerical example and applied to analyze experimentally obtained human EEG time series from a sleeping subject.	computation;dynamical system;electroencephalography;embedded system;embedding;experiment;extraction;interaction;mathematical model;mathematics;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sensor;sleep;small;stochastic process;time series	Martin Vejmelka;Milan Paluš;Kristína Susmáková	2010	International journal of neural systems	10.1142/S0129065710002309	stochastic process;time series;control theory;mathematics;oscillation	ML	20.74091900468708	-85.85917517196903	95285

During position-reposition tests the subject is asked to replicate a specific target angle (e.g. 30° of knee flexion) for a specific number of times. The aim of this study is to find an effective method to estimate JPE from the joint kinematic signal. Forty healthy subjects were tested to assess knee joint position sense. Three different methods of JPE estimation are described and compared using a hierarchical clustering approach. Overall, the 3 methods showed a high degree of similarity, ranging from 88% to 100%. We concluded that it is preferable to use the more user-independent method, in which the operator does not have to manually place “critical” markers.	cluster analysis;effective method;hierarchical clustering;jpeg;knee joint;proprioception;repositioning (procedure);self-replication;temporomandibular joint disorders;statistical cluster	Valentina Agostini;Samanta Rosati;Gabriella Balestra;Marco Trucco;Lorenzo Visconti;Marco Knaflitz	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037358	statistics;computer vision;artificial intelligence;knee joint;replicate;target angle;proprioception;computer science;simulation;kinematics;hierarchical clustering;ranging;position error	Robotics	12.218298998577573	-83.94980534609226	95555

A well-known fact is that the walking patterns are gaits, that is, cyclic patterns with several consecutive phases. These cyclic motions can be modeled using the consecutive gait phases. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for analyzing a normal human walking gait pattern. Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to collect the data, a combination of filters to preprocess these data, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait data. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different persons. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed human data analysis scheme has the potential to provide the necessary methodological (modeling, inference, and learning) framework for a cognitive behavior-based robot control system. More specifically, the proposed framework has the potential to be used for the recognition of abnormal gait patterns and the subsequent classification of specific walking pathologies, which is needed for the development of a context-aware robot mobility assistant.	cognitive robotics;control system;graph (discrete mathematics);hidden markov model;machine learning;markov chain;norm (social);preprocessor;robot control;stochastic matrix;wearable technology	Xanthi S.

This is a fundamental application of affective computing, which relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotion. As a first step to a system that recognizes emotions of individual users, this research focuses on how emotional experiences are expressed in six parameters (i.e., mean, absolute deviation, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) of physiological measurements of three electromyography signals: frontalis (EMG1), corrugator supercilii (EMG2), and zygomaticus major (EMG3). The 24 participants were asked to watch film scenes of 120 seconds, which they rated afterward. These ratings enabled us to distinguish four categories of emotions: negative, positive, mixed, and neutral. The skewness of the EMG2 and four parameters of EMG3, discriminate between the four emotion categories. This, despite the coarse time windows that were used. Moreover, rapid processing of the signals proved to be possible. This enables tailored HCI facilitated by an emotional awareness of systems.	affective computing;computer;experience;facial electromyography;human–computer interaction;microsoft windows	Egon L. van den Broek;Marleen H.

cbeb8cbe67e7ef4ad46994dcf1cd99325f76ac65	gamers' involvement detection from eeg data with cgaam - a method for feature selection for clustering		Abstract This paper reports the results of an experiment to identify EEG patterns specific to different levels of player involvement when playing a video game. To obtain unbiased results, we based our patterns on both raw EEG data and expert knowledge. We used a three-step procedure to identify patterns. First, we looked for clusters in the reduced feature space extracted from EEG data. Next, we assigned experts’ interpretations to the clusters. Finally, we analysed relations between features used to form the clusters and the class labels provided by experts. The most challenging part of the procedure was feature selection simultaneous with unsupervised classification. To accomplish this task, we developed a new approach for simultaneous feature selection and clustering based on modified GAAM (genetic algorithm with aggressive mutation). When the cGAAM algorithm was applied to EEG data, it returned the feature subsets that (a) were highly consistent across subjects and (b) provided 50% more compact clusters than clusters built over the feature subsets returned by a forward selection search strategy. The main cognitive outcome of EEG signal analysis was a set of patterns differentiating players’ involvement in a game. Conclusions included: 1. For a majority of subjects the most discriminative features were activity in the theta band in the left and right frontal areas, and activity in the delta band in the left frontal area; 2. All three features significantly differentiated between low and high, or medium and high engagement; 3. All subjects showed positive correlations between selected feature values and levels of engagement.	cluster analysis;electroencephalography;feature selection	Izabela Rejer;Michal Twardochleb	2018	Expert Syst.

The impairment of baroreflex - a principal blood pressure (BP) control mechanism - could contribute to the development of hypertension in obese patients. Previous studies have found a decreased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) measured by transfer function analysis of spontaneous BP and heart rate (HR) oscillations in obese subjects. However, this method ignores the causality and directionality of HR and BP oscillations interactions. Aim: The aim of the study was to analyse BRS in obese normotensive children and adolescents using causal baroreflex analysis method. Methods: Continuous noninvasive recordings of BP (volume-clamp method) and R-R intervals (ECG) were obtained from 40 obese subjects (age: 14. 7±0.3 yrs, BMI: 32. 7±0.6 kg m-2) and gender and age matched non-obese control subjects. Causal close loop model was used to measure classical (noncausal) BRS and causal feedback interaction from BP to HR (causal BRS). Results: The noncausal BRS did not show any significant difference between groups. On the other hand, causal BRS was lower (p = 0.030) in obese group. Conclusion: The causal BRS analysis is more sensitive in early detection of baroreflex impairment in obese children and adolescents compared to classical BRS method.	adolescent (age group);brs/search;baroreflex;brain–computer interface;causality;clamping (graphics);cognition disorders;early diagnosis;hematological disease;hypertensive disease;interaction;obesity;parasitic sensitivity tests;patients;sensitivity and specificity;spontaneous order;transfer function;yars wt allele;funding grant	Michal Javorka;Ingrid Tonhajzerova;Barbora Czippelova;Zuzana Turianikova;Lenka Chladekova;Kamil Javorka	2013	Computing in Cardiology 2013		endocrinology;medicine;anesthesia;diabetes mellitus	HCI	17.60069899418219	-84.63328172254636	96111

The successful recognition of human activities from video analysis is still a challenging problem. Within this context, applications targeting elderly care are of considerable interest both for public and industrial bodies, especially considering the aging society we are living in. Ambient intelligence (AmI) technologies, intended as the possibility of automatically detecting and reacting to the status of the environment and of the persons, is probably the major enabling factor. AmI technologies require suitable networks of sensors and actuators, as well as adequate processing and communication technologies. In this paper we propose an innovative solution based on a real time analysis of video with application in the field of elderly care. The system performs anomaly detection and proposes the automatic reconfiguration of the camera network for better monitoring of the ongoing event. The developed framework is tested on a publicly available dataset and has also been deployed and evaluated in a real environment.	as-interface;ambient intelligence;anomaly detection;code;on-board data handling;privacy;real-time clock;sensor;smart camera;verification and validation;video content analysis;virtual camera system	Krishna Reddy Konda;Andrea Rosani;Nicola Conci;Francesco G.

The ballistocardiogram (BCG), the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the transthoracic impedance cardiogram (ICG) were recorded on five healthy subjects during the 57th-European Space Agency (ESA) parabolic flight campaign. BCG is analyzed though its most characteristic wave, the IJ wave complex that can be identified along the longitudinal component of BCG and which has been demonstrated to be linked to cardiac ejection. The timings between the contraction of the heart and the ejection of blood in the aorta are analyzed via the time delay between the R-wave of the ECG and the I and J-waves of BCG (RI and RJ intervals respectively). Our results show that the IJ complex presents a larger amplitude in weightlessness and suggest that stroke volume (SV) increases in microgravity. We assume that ballistocardiography is an efficient method to assess the ventricular performance.	aorta;ballistocardiography;broadcast delay;cardiography, impedance;cerebrovascular accident;characteristic impedance;esa;electrocardiography;ijustine;injury due to weightlessness;inversive congruential generator;large;parabolic antenna;quantitative impedance;registered jack;stroke volume;systemverilog;waveform	Quentin Delière;Pierre-François Migeotte;X.

A Hidden Markov Model is used to construct the audio feature classifier. A skeleton feature classifier is trained to provided complementary information based on the Dynamic Time Warping model. The confidence scores generated by two classifiers are firstly normalized and then combined to produce a weighted sum for the final recognition. Experimental results have shown that the precision and recall scores for 20 classes of our multi-modal recognition framework can achieve 0.8829 and 0.8890 respectively, which proves that our method is able to correctly reject false detection caused by single classifier. Our approach scored 0.12756 in mean Levenshtein distance and was ranked 1st in the Multi-modal Gesture Recognition Challenge in 2013.	dynamic time warping;gesture recognition;hidden markov model;levenshtein distance;markov chain;modal logic;precision and recall;weight function	Jiaxiang Wu;Jian Cheng;Chaoyang Zhao;Hanqing Lu	2013		10.1145/2522848.2532589	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;dynamic time warping;pattern recognition;gesture recognition;hidden markov model;signature recognition	Vision	-4.04330671587725	-85.3066024975705	96318

In general such systems assume that only a single person (the resident) is present in the home. However, in real world environments, it is common to have visits and it is crucial to know when the resident is alone or not. We deal with this challenge by presenting a novel method that models regular activity patterns and detects visits. Our method is based on the Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP), but is extended to allow the incorporation of multiple feature streams. The results from the experiments on nine months of sensor data collected in two apartments show that our model significantly outperforms the standard MMPP. We validate the generalisation of the model using two new data sets collected from an other sensor network.		Ahmed Nait Aicha;Gwenn Englebienne;Ben J. A.

It makes it possible to evaluate variability of human brain functioning. There are some requirements, made for time series to be analyzed by Grassberger-Procaccia method, and EEG does not meet them perfectly. Also, realization of this algorithm uses subjective evaluation procedure and needs setting of additional parameters for calculation, such as lag and embedding dimension. Method of calculation, suggested in the article, meets specifics of EEG and allows calculating without using subjectivity. This makes it possible to process large amounts of experimental data. The value, calculated by this method, is not D(2) in strict sense, but it is useful for evaluated variability of brain functioning.

The various trends of parameters, including peripheral augmentation index, peripheral subendocardial viability ratio, and peripheral resistance, influenced by contact pressures were analyzed. By comparing the variation trend between different subject groups, it is notable that there exists a significant difference between the parameters of young healthy people and elder patients (P<;0.01). Moreover, the peripheral augmentation index, SEVR and the peripheral resistance descend with increased contact pressure, because of the variation of pulse wave contour.	extraction;patients;radial (radio);total peripheral resistance	Dianning He;Li Zheng;Jia Liu;Ning Geng;Dejun Guan;Lisheng Xu	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944905	electronic engineering;medicine;biological engineering;surgery	Robotics	14.786318987170173	-84.19754580991265	96715

However, eliciting motor responses using standard ESM paradigm is frequently difficult to young children. We have thus developed and tested a novel EMS protocol, which uses intense, high frequency and short stimulation pulses.

Unfortunately, CTG has a poor specificity. Recent studies suggest that, in addition to CTG, information on fetal distress can be obtained from analysis of fetal heart rate variability (HRV). However, uterine contractions can strongly influence fetal HRV. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate whether HRV analysis for detection of fetal distress can be improved by distinguishing contractions from rest periods. Our results from feature selection indicate that HRV features calculated separately during contractions or during rest periods are more informative on fetal distress than HRV features that are calculated over the entire fetal heart rate. Furthermore, classification performance improved from a geometric mean of 69.0% to 79.6% when including the contraction-dependent HRV features, in addition to HRV features calculated over the entire fetal heart rate.	cardiotocography;distress (novel);feature selection;fetal distress;fetal heart;heart rate variability;information;inventory;sensitivity and specificity;uterine contraction;uterus	Guy J.

ed77bbe6d1daf78214d96bc14a27e55e8ca18ec1	on the need of new methods to mine electrodermal activity in emotion-centered studies		Monitoring the electrodermal activity is increasingly accomplished in agent-based experimental settings as the skin is believed to be the only organ to react only to the sympathetic nervous system. This physiological signal has the potential to reveal paths that lead to excitement, attention, arousal and anxiety. However, electrodermal analysis has been driven by simple feature-extraction, instead of using expressive models that consider a more flexible behavior of the signal for improved emotion recognition. This paper proposes a novel approach centered on sequential patterns to classify the signal into a set of key emotional states. The approach combines SAX for pre-processing the signal and hidden Markov models. This approach was tested over a collected sample of signals using Affectiva-QSensor. An extensive human-to-human and humanto-robot experimental setting is under development for further validation and characterization of emotion-centered patterns.	agent-based model;apache axis;electronic design automation;emotion recognition;experiment;feature extraction;hidden markov model;markov chain;preprocessor;programming paradigm;simple api for xml	Rui Henriques;Ana Paiva;Cláudia Antunes	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-36288-0_18	machine learning;anxiety;artificial intelligence;hidden markov model;dynamic bayesian network;computer science;skin conductance;arousal;emotion recognition	AI	9.385740591331656	-93.67756934913773	97029
25b05b72d1c34ef2cf0a8533ceea468260f19d8f	enhancing grammatical evolution through data augmentation: application to blood glucose forecasting		Currently, Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 patients are waiting hopefully for the arrival of the Artificial Pancreas (AP) in a near future. AP systems will control the blood glucose of people that suffer the disease, improving their lives and reducing the risks they face everyday. At the core of the AP, an algorithm will forecast future glucose levels and estimate insulin bolus sizes. Grammatical Evolution (GE) has been proved as a suitable algorithm for predicting glucose levels. Nevertheless, one the main obstacles that researches have found for training the GE models is the lack of significant amounts of data. As in many other fields in medicine, the collection of data from real patients is very complex. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation algorithm that generates synthetic glucose time series from real data. The synthetic time series can be used to train a unique GE model or to produce several GE models that work together in a combining system. Our experimental results show that, in a scarce data context, Grammatical Evolution models can get more accurate and robust predictions using data augmentation.	grammatical evolution	José Manuel Velasco;Oscar Garnica;Sergio Contador;José Manuel Colmenar;Esther Maqueda;Marta Botella;Juan Lanchares;José Ignacio Hidalgo	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-55849-3_10	natural language processing;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	4.2913390234992965	-81.59829142477925	97198

However, the introduction of iEEG electrodes in the MR environment has inherent risk and data quality implications that require consideration prior to clinical use. Previous studies of subdural and depth electrodes have confirmed low risk under specific circumstances at 1.5T and 3T. However, no studies have assessed risk and image quality related to the feasibility of a full iEEG-fMRI protocol. To this end, commercially available platinum subdural grid/strip electrodes (4×5 grid or 1×8 strip) and 4 or 6-contact depth electrodes were secured to the surface of a custom-made phantom mimicking the conductivity of the human brain. Electrode displacement, temperature increase of electrodes and surrounding phantom material, and voltage fluctuations in electrode contacts were measured in a GE Discovery MR750 3T MR scanner during a variety of imaging sequences, typical of an iEEG-fMRI protocol. An electrode grid was also used to quantify the spatial extent of susceptibility artifact. The spatial extent of susceptibility artifact in the presence of an electrode was also assessed for typical imaging parameters that maximize BOLD sensitivity at 3T (TR=1500 ms; TE=30 ms; slice thickness=4mm; matrix=64×64; field-of-view=24 cm). Under standard conditions, all electrodes exhibited no measurable displacement and no clinically significant temperature increase (<1°C) during scans employed in a typical iEEG-fMRI experiment, including 60 min of continuous fMRI. However, high SAR sequences, such as fast spin-echo (FSE), produced significant heating in almost all scenarios (>2.0°C) that in some cases exceeded 10°C. Induced voltages in the frequency range that could elicit neuronal stimulation (<10 kHz) were well below the threshold of 100 mV. fMRI signal intensity was significantly reduced within 20mm of the electrodes for the imaging parameters used in this study. Thus, for the conditions tested, a full iEEG-fMRI protocol poses a low risk at 3T; however, fMRI sensitivity may be reduced immediately adjacent to the electrodes. In addition, high SAR sequences must be avoided.	cellular material:mcnt:pt:calculus:qn:estimated;data quality;displacement mapping;electrocorticogram;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;epilepsy;fast software encryption;fever;frequency band;heat shock proteins;heating;image quality;imaging phantom;kilohertz;maxima and minima;patients;phantoms, imaging;platinum;protocols documentation;psychologic displacement;resting state fmri;risk assessment;scanning systems;seizures;spin echo imaging;subdural space;fetal scalp electrode;voltage	Shannon M.

In the second layer, segments that have a common fundamental frequency are grouped into streams. A stream is represented by a synchronized population of relaxation oscillators, and different streams are represented by desynchronized oscillator populations. The model has been evaluated using a corpus of voiced speech mixed with interfering sounds, and produces an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio for every mixture.	linear programming relaxation;oscillator (cellular automaton);population;signal-to-noise ratio;text corpus	Guy J.

An ideal application for wireless sensor networks is a biomedical patient monitoring tool. Wireless patient monitoring systems improve quality of life for the subject by granting them more freedom to continue their daily routine, which would not be feasible if wired monitoring equipment were used. This paper explores an application of wireless biomedical sensor networks, which attempts to monitor patients for a specific condition in a completely non-invasive, non-intrusive manner. This non-invasive technique uses an accelerometer to determine if a person's arm movement is similar to that of a person suffering from a seizure. The effectiveness of the presented algorithm has been verified on test subjects and showed rare occurrences of false positives.	algorithm;sensor	T.

In order to avoid the need of full time care giving service, the actual trend is to encourage elderly to stay living autonomously in their homes as long as possible. Reliable fall detection methods can enhance life safety of the elderly and boost their confidence by immediately alerting fall cases to caregivers. This study presents an algorithm of fall detection, which detects fall events by using data-mining approach. The authors’ proposed method performs detection in two steps. First, it collects the wireless sensor network (WSN) data in stream format from sensor devices. Second, it uses k-nearest neighbour algorithm, that is, well-known lazy learning algorithm to detect fall occurrences. It detects falls by identifying the fall patterns in the data stream. Experiments show that the proposed method has promising results on WSN data stream in detecting falls.	autonomous robot;data mining;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;lazy evaluation;lazy learning;nearest neighbour algorithm;sensor	Senol Zafer Erdogan;Turgay Tugay Bilgin	2012	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2011.0228	computer science;machine learning;data mining;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;data stream mining;computer security	Mobile	5.172451328849646	-86.41760653363536	97256

ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT Article history: Received xxxx Received in final form xxxx Accepted xxxx Available online xxxx Keywords: Behavioral mimicry Motor mimicry Temporal modelling Social signal processing People mimic verbal and nonverbal expressions and behavior of their counterparts in various social interactions. Research in psychology and social sciences has shown that mimicry has the power to influence social judgment and various social behaviours, including negotiation and debating, courtship, em-pathy and helping behaviour. Hence, automatic recognition of mimicry behaviour would be a valuable tool in various domains, and especially in negotiation skills enhancement and medical help provision training. In this work, we present the MAHNOB Mimicry database, a set of fully synchronised, mul-ti-sensory, audiovisual recordings of naturalistic dyadic interactions, suitable for investigation of mimicry and negotiation behaviour. The database contains 11 hours of recordings, split over 54 sessions of dyadic interactions between 12 confederates and their 48 counterparts, being engaged either in a socio-political discussion or negotiating a tenancy agreement. To provide a benchmark for efforts in machine understanding of mimicry behaviour, we report a number of baseline experiments based on visual data only. Specifically, we consider face and head movements, and report on binary classification of video sequences into mimicry and non-mimicry categories based on the following widely-used methodologies: two similarity-based methods (cross correlation and time warping), and a state-of-the-art temporal classifier (Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network). The best reported results are session-dependent , and affected by the sparsity of positive examples in the data. This suggests that there is much room for improvement upon the reported baseline experiments. Research in psychology has found that people mimic postures , facial expressions, mannerisms and other verbal and nonverbal expressions …	artificial intelligence;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);binary classification;cross-correlation;database;dyadic transformation;experiment;heart rate variability;interaction;long short-term memory;performance;portable document format;random neural network;recurrent neural network;signal processing;sparse matrix;speech recognition;spontaneous order	Sanjay Bilakhia;Stavros Petridis;Anton Nijholt;Maja Pantic	2015	Pattern Recognition Letters	10.1016/j.patrec.2015.03.005	artificial intelligence	ML	-3.566402078797447	-84.44541958922784	97286

Thus, automatic recognition of the task phases the mobile workers are currently (or have been) in has many applications, e.g., efficient coordination of tasks by visualizing co-workers' task progress, automatic notifications based on context awareness, and record filing of task statuses and completions. This paper presents methods to sense and detect highly mobile workers' tasks phases in large building complexes. Large building complexes restrict the technologies available for sensing and recognizing the activities and task phases the workers currently perform as such technologies have to be easily deployable and maintainable at a large scale. The methods presented in this paper consist of features that utilize data from sensing systems which are common in large-scale indoor work environments, namely from a WiFi infrastructure providing coarse grained indoor positioning, from inertial sensors in the workers' mobile phones, and from a task management system yielding information about the scheduled tasks' start and end locations. The methods presented have low requirements on the accuracy of the indoor positioning, and thus come with low deployment and maintenance effort in real-world settings. We evaluated the proposed methods in a large hospital complex, where the highly mobile workers were recruited among the non-clinical workforce. The evaluation is based on manually labelled real-world data collected over 4 days of regular work life of the mobile workforce. The collected data yields 83 tasks in total involving 8 different orderlies from a major university hospital with a building area of 160, 000 m2. The results show that the proposed methods can distinguish accurately between the four most common task phases present in the orderlies' work routines, achieving Fi-Scores of 89.2%.	communication endpoint;context awareness;experiment;foremost;indoor positioning system;mobile phone;random forest;requirement;scheduling (computing);sensor;smartphone;software deployment;windows task scheduler	Allan Stisen;Andreas Mathisen;Søren Krogh Sørensen;Henrik Blunck;Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard;Thor S.

Neurometric analysis of EEG collected from the 19 standard locations of the International 10-20 System already provides such a tool. In this work we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach when the available inputs are reduced to a set of five frontal electrodes. This system has applications in certain critical clinical care situations, such as emergency room triage, when a full EEG might be unavailable, inconvenient, or time-consuming. Additionally, we augment the standard neurometric QEEG analysis with local discriminant basis features of the power spectrum and microstate-like features which exploit the rich temporal structure of the EEG.

A vibration of (50,mathrm {Hz}) was presented to the index finger. In three experimental conditions, the detection threshold for this vibration was determined with a masking vibration presented to the forearm of (50,mathrm {Hz}) (the same frequency), of (200,mathrm {Hz}) (a different frequency), or no masking vibration. The detection threshold for the (50,mathrm {Hz}) stimulus on the fingertip increased significantly when a masking vibration of the same frequency was used, but not with a different frequency. This frequency-specific effect has applications in the modulation of tactile textures, for example in augmented reality.		Yoshihiro Tanaka;Shota Matsuoka;Wouter M. Bergmann Tiest;Astrid M. L.

However, the current EEG-based interface device is not convenient enough for daily uses. In this study, we developed an EEG acquisition system that records brain signals without contacting scalp. The proposed system consists of a small sized ($5.5\,\times 3\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ acquisition hardware and four stainless steel electrodes integrated in a regular sport hat. To demonstrate the concept, we used an in-house developed steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) paradigm and recorded EEG signals using the proposed system. The EEG signals were compared with three different brain states – Eye Closed, Eye Open, and Visual Stimulation. The results show that the BCI system can record SSVEP from the brain without any professional setups or expensive dry-electrodes.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;brain-computer interfaces;brain–computer interface;electroencephalography phase synchronization;gene regulatory network;interface device component;programming paradigm;stainless steel;steady state;electrode;sensor (device)	Rahim Soleymanpour;Charmi Patel;Insoo Kim	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512712	brain–computer interface;computer vision;wearable computer;visualization;artificial intelligence;electroencephalography;computer science	Visualization	12.034988210061222	-93.17786788389719	97674

Using consumer-grade smartphones with in-built accelerometers, we objectively measure and quantify key movement severity symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Specifically, we record tri-axial accelerations, and extract a range of different features based on the time and frequency-domain properties of the acceleration time series. The features quantify key characteristics of the acceleration time series, and enhance the underlying differences in the gait and postural sway accelerations between PD participants and controls. Using a random forest classifier, we demonstrate an average sensitivity of 98.5% and average specificity of 97.5% in discriminating PD participants from controls.	random forest;sensitivity and specificity;smartphone;time series;triangular function	Siddharth Arora;Vinayak Venkataraman;Sean Donohue;Kevin M.

Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in ambulatory urodynamics due to the increased convenience and more realistic monitoring environment. This paper presents an ultra-low power implantable wireless platform, UP-Link, for long-term ambulatory bladder pressure monitoring. The proposed platform, which is built using off-the-shelf components and uses the MICS (Medical Implant Communication Service) radio frequency band for communication, enables more cost-effective and rapid development compared to existing ASIC-based solutions. The UP-Link platform is powered by two coin cell batteries with a total capacity of 560mAh and has an estimated battery life of several months to years. Results obtained through in vitro experiments demonstrate that the pressure data measured using UP-Link shows excellent agreement (0.995 using the intraclass correlation coefficient method) with measurements obtained using a commercial pressure gauge. An accelerated battery-life test was also performed, the results of which validate our lifetime estimates. The longevity of the UP-Link platform enables ambulatory urodynamic studies at much longer time scales than current practice.	application-specific integrated circuit;coefficient;experiment;frequency band;radio frequency;tract (literature)	Woo Suk Lee;Albert Kim;Babak Ziaie;Vijay Raghunathan;Charles R.

Methods: Complete FEFT curves from 90 subjects with and without respiratory disease were used to validate the method, and its application performance was evaluated by FEFT curves containing incomplete curves from nine obstructive patients. First, a lumped parameter model of the FEFT curve, taking FVC as one of the model parameters, is chosen. The 0- 1 s, 0-1.5 s, . . . , 0-6 s curves chosen from the accepted FEFT curves are, respectively, taken as the local system observations. Then, the NLJ optimization procedure was used to get the estimate of FVC (FVCest) by estimating the model parameters. Finally, FVCest was compared with the measured FVC (FVCmea). Results: The difference between FVCest and FVCmea decreased with the lengths of observed curves increasing. When the lengths of observed curves reached 3 s, the mean difference (±SD) between FVCest and FVCmea was -11 ± 58 mL. Estimated FVC derived from the incomplete curves were close to FVC from accepted maneuvers. Conclusion: The method can be used to estimate FVC by analyzing an incomplete FEFT curve, providing the length of the curve is more than 3 s. Significance: This method can help the subjects who cannot complete the forced expiratory maneuver to provide a reliable estimate of FVC and also can be used to analyze the unacceptable spirometry because of early termination of exhalation.	bézier curve;estimated;expiration, function;fingerprint verification competition;forced expiratory volume function;greater than;lumped element model;luus–jaakola;mathematical optimization;partial;patients;population parameter;respiratory tract diseases;spirometry	Zijun He;Zuchang Ma;Yubing Xu;Yongliang Zhang;Fusong Hu;Yining Sun;Duoqi Zhou	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2400227	mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;control theory	ML	15.027728121545595	-84.9481858540315	97940

Current development of prosthesis is already advanced, but most of the affected persons suffer from changes in the gait which are visible to the general public. The gait of transfemoral amputees was investigated in the laboratory environment and is called asymmetric due to different facts: shorter step length, smaller velocity and smaller cadence. The use of mobile inertial sensors can be supportive in the rehabilitation process of these patients. That is why a pilot study is conducted to evaluate the gait of transfemoral amputees and compare their gait parameters with those of the healthy subjects. The purpose of the investigation is to identify gait parameters showing the asymmetric properties of the amputees gait.

In this paper, an approach is proposed for recognizing music-induced emotions through the fusion of three-channel forehead biosignals (the left temporalis, frontalis, and right temporalis channels) and an electrocardiogram. The classification of four emotional states in an arousal–valence space (positive valence/low arousal, positive valence/high arousal, negative valence/high arousal, and negative valence/low arousal) was performed by employing two parallel support vector machines as arousal and valence classifiers. The inputs of the classifiers were obtained by applying a fuzzy-rough model feature evaluation criterion and sequential forward floating selection algorithm. An average classification accuracy of 88.78 % was achieved, corresponding to an average valence classification accuracy of 94.91 % and average arousal classification accuracy of 93.63 %. The proposed emotion recognition system may be useful for interactive multimedia applications or music therapy.	affective computing;concatenation;emotion recognition;function-behaviour-structure ontology;selection algorithm;support vector machine	Mohsen Naji;Mohammad Firoozabadi;Parviz Azadfallah	2013	Cognitive Computation	10.1007/s12559-013-9239-7	psychology;speech recognition;communication;social psychology	AI	12.08175646512585	-92.0070234732173	98081

In this paper we propose a method for detecting food intake cycles during the course of a meal using a commercially available wristband. We first model micro-movements that are part of the intake cycle and then use HMMs to model the sequences of micro-movements leading to mouthfuls. Evaluation is carried out on an annotated dataset of 8 subjects where the proposed method achieves 0:78 precision and 0:77 recall.

One drawback of this approach relies in its incapability to distinguish the direct and indirect relations. So, in order to identify only direct relations, we propose to replace the ordinary coherence function used in the phase slope index with the partial coherence. Furthermore, we consider and compare two estimators of the coherence functions, the first one based on Fourier transform and the second one on an autoregressive model. In order to cope with the difficult issue of bidirectional flow, which cannot be addressed by the coherence based phase slope index, we propose another index based on the directed transfer function. Experimental results support the relevance of the new indices, both based on autoregressive modeling, in multivariate time series.	autoregressive model;causal filter;interdependence;relevance;sensor;time series;transfer function	Chunfeng Yang;Régine Le Bouquin-Jeannès;Gérard Faucon;Huazhong Shu	2011	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2011.2109712	fourier transform;econometrics;calculus;time series;mathematics;transfer function;density functional theory;neurophysiology;statistics	ML	20.47532062773319	-84.9805844007738	98161

Worldwide, ATS are among the most common illicit drugs. Therefore, understanding whether and to what extent ATS exposure affects brain structure and functioning in recreational users has become a critical public health issue. We studied gray and white matter densities in 20 experienced users of ATS (more than 100 units MDMA and/or 50 g of amphetamine lifetime dose), 42 low exposure users with very limited ATS experience (less than 5 units lifetime dose) and 16 drug-naive controls. A tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis of fractional anisotropy images was applied to diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Furthermore, alignment invariant white matter tract representations acquired from the TBSS analysis were used as a reference for inter-subject brain registrations in a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of gray matter volume, reducing characteristic alignment inaccuracies associated with this voxel-wise gray matter investigation approach. Between-group white matter comparison revealed no significant results. However, compared to low exposure users, experienced users showed several regions of lower gray matter volume in medial frontal regions, in particular the orbital and medial frontal cortex. Differences are likely to reflect effects of repeated ATS exposure even in recreational users. However, differences in pre-existing or confounding factors might also account for between-group differences.	alignment;amphetamine;brain;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;ecstasy - drug;fractional anisotropy;gray matter;medial graph;methamphetamine;molecular orbital;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;spatial analysis;stimulant;tract (literature);voxel;white matter;density;frontal lobe	Jörg Daumann;Philip Koester;Benjamin Becker;Daniel Wagner;Davide Imperati;Euphrosyne Gouzoulis-Mayfrank;Marc Tittgemeyer	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.065	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;medicine;pathology;public health;magnetic resonance imaging;morphometrics;confounding;fractional anisotropy;voxel-based morphometry	ML	20.494226530157103	-80.45930220785318	98249

During VAD operation blood damage caused by hemolysis, thrombogenecity and denaturation has to be avoided. One key parameter causing the blood's denaturation is its temperature which must not exceed 42°C. As a temperature rise can be directly linked to the losses occuring in the drive system, this paper introduces an efficiency prediction chain for Brushless DC (BLDC) drives which are applied in various VAD systems. The presented chain is applied to various core materials and operation ranges, providing a general overview on the loss dependencies.	artificial ventricle;capillary blood;deoxycytidine;heart-assist devices;hematological disease;hemolysis (disorder);intrinsic drive;organ;population parameter;simulation;vad i protocol;voice activity detection;blood pump;pump (device)	Andre Pohlmann;Kay Hameyer	2012	2012 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347263	control engineering;medicine;engineering;electrical engineering;hemodynamics;control theory;physiology	Robotics	10.873503903226748	-82.1255492183777	98291

This relationship was investigated by analyzing the spectral features of the SEMG signals. SEMG signals were recorded from three subjects during isometric contraction and from another three subjects during anisometric contraction. In order to determine force-SEMG signal relationship, higher order frequency moments (HOFMs) of the signals were calculated and used as characterizing features of SEMG signals. Subsequently, artificial neural networks (ANN) with backpropagation algorithm were trained by using the HOFMs. Root mean square difference (RMSD) between the actual and predicted forces was calculated to evaluate force prediction performance of the ANN. In addition to RMSD, cross-correlation coefficients between actual and predicted force time histories were also calculated for anisometric experiment results. The RMSD values ranged from 0.34 and 0.02 in the isometric contraction experiments. In the anisometric contraction tests, RMSD results were between 0.23 and 0.09 and cross-correlation coefficients ranged from 0.91 to 0.98. In order to compare the performance of the HOFMs with a widely used EMG signal processing technique, root-mean-squared (RMS) values of the EMG signals were also calculated and used to train the ANN as another characterizing feature of the signal. Predicted forces using HOFMs technique were in general closer to the actual forces than those of obtained by using RMS values. The results indicated that the proposed signal processing method showed an encouraging performance for predicting the forces applied to the human hands, and the spectral features of the EMG signal might be used as input parameter for the myoelectric controlled prostheses.

721f1e873ce11ebd32f1684477d37952f4b96444	context-aware feature query to improve the prediction performance		The decision to select which features to use and query can be effectively addressed based on the available features or context. This paper presents a novel approach based on denoising autoencoders and sensitivity analysis in neural networks to efficiently query for unknown features given the context. In this setting, a denoising autoencoder is responsible for handling unknown features. On the other hand, the sensitivity of output predictions with respect to each unknown feature is used as a measure of feature importance. We evaluated the suggested method on human activity recognition and handwritten digit recognition tasks. According to the results, using the proposed method can reduce the number of extracted features in these datasets by approximately 70% and 60%, respectively. This reduction in the number of required features can be crucially important in mobile and battery-powered IoT systems as it reduces the amount of required data acquisition and computational load substantially.	activity recognition;artificial neural network;autoencoder;computation;data acquisition;noise reduction	Mohammad Kachuee;Anahita Hosseini;Babak Moatamed;Sajad Darabi;Majid Sarrafzadeh	2017	2017 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2017.8309078	autoencoder;artificial neural network;data acquisition;activity recognition;internet of things;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	Robotics	3.7064169265741986	-84.11586644809611	98323

This study investigated the cortical activation pattern from fNIRS data of 8 healthy subjects performing motor imagery and passive movement tasks using a Haptic Knob robot. Group averaged contrasts were defined as motor imagery versus idle and passive movement versus idle. The cortical activations for motor imagery appeared on the contralateral sensorimotor area, whereas the cortical activations for passive movement appeared on both contralateral and ipsilateral sensorimotor area. This result suggests that the performance of passive movement has a wider cortical activation compared to the performance of motor imagery.	chorea;control knob;functional gastrointestinal disorders;guided imagery;haptic device component;haptic technology;knob device component;movement disorders;neuroimaging;numerous;robot;sensorimotor cortex;x-ray emission spectroscopy	Juanhong Yu;Kai Keng Ang;Huijuan Yang;Cuntai Guan	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944030	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;communication	ML	16.890152565195134	-80.56374921363529	98330

It is important to establish the appropriate methods to measure GDTs clinically. We have established GDTs for a variety of stimuli, ages (7-90 years), equipment, degrees of hearing loss, psychophysical paradigms, neurophysiological paradigms, marker relationships (within-channel, across-channel), time points, and presentation ears (left, right, diotic). A number important findings will be discussed: 1. Best stimulus for measurement of GDTs is narrow-band noise. 2. GDTs improve from ages 7 to 9, stabilize between ages 9 and 40, and deteriorate with age thereafter. 3. GDTs may be measured reliably using a variety of equipment. 4. Hearing loss has a minor impact on GDTs. 5. A 2-interval psychophysical paradigm is best for measuring GDTs. 6. GDTs may be documented using the P1-N1-P2 auditory evoked potential. 7.

The prediction of drivers' drowsy and alert states from electroencephalography (EEG) using shallow and deep Riemannian methods is presented. For shallow Riemannian methods, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean (mdm) and Log-Euclidian metric are investigated, where it is shown that Log-Euclidian metric outperforms the mdm algorithm. In addition the SPDNet, a deep Riemannian model, that takes the EEG covariance matrix as the input is investigated. It is shown that SPDNet outperforms all tested shallow and deep classification methods. Performance of SPDNet is 6.02% and 2.86% higher than the best performance by the conventional Euclidian classifiers and shallow Riemannian models, respectively.	alert:type:point in time:^patient:nominal;discriminative model;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epoch (reference date);fatigue;feel drowsy;imagery;statistical classification;algorithm	Mehdi Hajinoroozi;Jianqiu Zhang;Yufei Huang	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037774	electroencephalography;covariance matrix;artificial intelligence;computer science;machine learning	DB	15.03484855092132	-94.86070260036892	98404

In order to take preventive actions, it is of great interest, to both physicians and patients, to determine cardiovascular risk factors early. To address this problem, a wearable in-ear measuring system (IN-MONIT) for 24/7 monitoring of vital parameters has been developed. The central component is a microoptic reflective sensor located inside the auditory canal. From the measured photoplethysmographic curves, heart activity and heart rate can be derived. In this paper, we describe the optoelectronic sensor concept and the autonomous design of the IN-MONIT measurement system. For the assessment of heart rate, different algorithms are introduced and the performance of the developed sensor system is evaluated in relation to conventional systems. In addition, the robustness to external artifacts is evaluated and artifact reduction strategies are considered.	autonomous robot;cns disorder;cardiovascular diseases;cessation of life;external auditory canal structure;morphologic artifacts;patients;sensor;system of measurement;wearable computer;algorithm	Stefan Vogel;Markus Hülsbusch;Thomas Hennig;Vladimir Blazek;Steffen Leonhardt	2009	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2009.2033268	medicine;surgery;statistics;monte carlo method	Mobile	11.919136489548361	-87.38410647531923	98525
39c8c6af653f2599b12dd874605e3474eeb13b24	using wearable physiological sensors to predict energy expenditure		Lower-limb assistive robotic devices are often evaluated by measuring a reduction in the user's energy cost. Using indirect calorimetry to estimate energy cost is poorly suited for real-time estimation and long-term collection. The goal of this study was to use data from wearable sensors to predict energy cost with better temporal resolution and less variability than breath measurements. We collected physiological data (heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature) and mechanical data (EMG, accelerometry) from three healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at various speeds on level ground, inclined, and backwards. Ground truth energy cost was established by averaging steady-state breath measurements. Raw physiological signals correlated well with ground truth energy cost, but raw mechanical signals did not. Correlation of mechanical signals was improved by calculating accelerometer magnitudes and linear envelope EMG signals, and further improved by averaging the signals over several seconds. A multiple linear regression including physiological and mechanical data accurately predicted ground truth energy cost across all subjects and activities tested, with less variability and better temporal resolution than breath measurements. The sensors used in this study were fully portable, and such algorithms could be used to estimate energy cost of users in the real world. This could greatly improve the design, control, and evaluation of lower-limb assistive robotic devices.	accelerometry;calorimetry;calorimetry, indirect;dermatologic disorders;electromyography;energy metabolism;ground truth;heart rate variability;real-time clock;regression analysis;robot;spatial variability;speed (motion);steady state;treadmill, device;wearable computer;accelerometers;algorithm;sensor (device)	Kimberly A.

It is actively used instead of mechanical tactile displays for tactile feedback because of several advantages such as its small and thin size, light weight, and high responsiveness. However, the similarities and differences between these sensations is still not clear. This study directly compares the intensity sensation of electrotactile stimulation to that of mechanical stimulation, and investigates the characteristic sensation of anodic and cathodic stimulation. In the experiment, participants underwent a 30 pps electrotactile stimulus every one second to their middle finger, and were asked to match this intensity by adjusting the intensity of a mechanical tactile stimulus to an index finger. The results showed that anodic stimulation mainly produced vibration sensation, whereas cathodic sensation produced both vibration and pressure sensations. Relatively low pressure sensation was also observed for anodic stimulation but it remains low, regardless of the increasing of electrical intensity.	electric stimulation technique;electrical current;functional electrical stimulation;hertz (hz);index finger;interface device component;middle finger structure;programming paradigm;responsiveness;sacral nerve stimulation;sensation disorders;touch perception;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Vibol Yem;Hiroyuki Kajimoto	2017	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2016.2605084	database index;electronic engineering;acoustics;computer science;engineering;electrode;vibration;skin;physics;electric potential;quantum mechanics	HCI	14.613465217290965	-80.89892741391499	98680
234e1ebdca30930a70207e1d9bbe8cf0b8baa47e	recognition of dynamic hand gestures from 3d motion data using lstm and cnn architectures		Hand gestures provide a natural, non-verbal form of communication that can augment or replace other communication modalities such as speech or writing. Along with voice commands, hand gestures are becoming the primary means of interaction in games, augmented reality, and virtual reality platforms. Recognition accuracy, flexibility, and computational cost are some of the primary factors that can impact the incorporation of hand gestures in these new technologies, as well as their subsequent retrieval from multimodal corpora. In this paper, we present fast and highly accurate gesture recognition systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are trained to process input sequences of 3D hand positions and velocities acquired from infrared sensors. When evaluated on real time recognition of six types of hand gestures, the proposed architectures obtain 97% F-measure, demonstrating a significant potential for practical applications in novel human-computer interfaces.	algorithmic efficiency;artificial neural network;augmented reality;convolutional neural network;feature engineering;gesture recognition;human–computer interaction;long short-term memory;motion controller;multi-user;multimodal interaction;sensor;software deployment;text corpus;virtual reality	Chinmaya R.

The data were recorded during full-night polysomnographies of 313 healthy subjects in nine different sleep laboratories. The raw signals are first normalized to common time bases and ranges. Thirteen different RQA and cross-RQA features derived from ECG, respiratory effort, heart rate and their combinations are additionally reconditioned with windowed standard deviation filters and ZSCORE normalization procedures leading to a total feature count of 195. The discriminative power between Wake, NREM and REM of each feature is evaluated using the Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Besides kappa performance, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and inter-correlations of the best 20 features with high discriminative power is also ardio-respiratory features analyzed. The best kappa values for each class versus the other classes are 0.24, 0.12 and 0.31 for NREM, REM and Wake, respectively. Significance is tested with ANOVA F-test (mostly p < 0.001). The results are compared to known cardio-respiratory features for sleep analysis. We conclude that many RQA features are suited to discriminate between Wake and Sleep, whereas the differentiation between REM and the other classes remains in the midrange. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Adolescence constitutes a critical neuromaturation period in which the brain is particularly sensitive to the effects of alcohol. However, little is known about how BD affects the brain activity. This study aimed to characterize the brain's functional organization in BD and non-BD young population by means of analyzing functional connectivity (FC) and relative power spectra (PS) profiles measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during eyes-closed resting state. Our sample composed 73 first-year university students (35 BDs and 38 controls). Results showed that the BD subjects displayed a decreased alpha FC in frontal-parietal regions, and conversely, an enhanced FC in the delta, theta and beta bands in fronto-temporal networks. Besides the FC differences, the BD group showed a decreased PS within alpha range and an increased PS within theta range in the brain's occipital region. These differences in FC and PS measurements provide new evidence of the neurophysiological alterations related to the alcohol neurotoxicity and could represent an initial sign of an anomalous neural activity caused by a BD pattern of alcohol consumption during youth.

A novel lung sound classification algorithm based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) features and multilayer perceptron network is proposed in this paper. Three types of HHT domain features, namely the instantaneous envelope amplitude of intrinsic mode functions (IMF), envelop of instantaneous amplitude of the first four layers IMFs, and max value of the marginal spectrum are proposed for jointly characterization of the time-frequency properties of lung sounds. These proposed features are feed into a multi-layer perceptron neural network for training and testing of lung sound signal classification.

While Electronic Medical Administration Record (eMAR) systems help reduce the number of ADEs, current eMAR implementations suffer from workarounds that defeat safety and verification mechanisms meant to limit the number of potential ADEs that occur during medication administration. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Element ChipLess (MECL) RFID tags which enable real-time event notifications through event signatures. Event signatures correspond to the physical configuration of different RFID elements in a chipless RFID tag. Augmenting physical objects, such as a pill container, with MECL-RFID can allow caregivers to detect the moment a particular pill container is opened or closed. We present the fundamentals behind real-time event detection using MECL-RFID and propose a cyber-physical intervention system that can be used to reduce ADEs through realtime event monitoring and notifications sent to clinicians administering medication. We also present a prototype MECL-RFID to demonstrate potential future improvements to eMAR systems that minimize ADEs.	antivirus software;chipless rfid;event monitoring;gene regulatory network;prototype;radio-frequency identification;real-time clock;real-time web	Xiaofu Ma;Thaddeus Czauski;Taeyoung Yang;Jeffrey H.

The temporal cross-correlation between each detected beat and a template beat is the typical alignment method used with high-resolution electrocardiogram (HRECG) records. However, this technique does not produce a precise fiducial mark in records with high noise levels, like those found in Holter HRECG systems. In this study, we propose a new alignment method based on the multiscale cross-correlation between the template and each detected beat. We report the results of tests comparing multiscale and temporal methods for 3000 beats of simulated HRECG records corrupted separately with white noise, electromyographic noise and power line interference (50 Hz) of different root mean square levels. A second study with simulated records constructed from real Holter HRECG records is also presented. The results indicate that the multiscale alignment method produces a lower trigger jitter than the temporal method in all tests. We conclude that the proposed alignment method can be used in HRECG records with high noise levels.	alignment;clinical use template;coherence (physics);cross-correlation;electrocardiography;electromyography;fiducial marker;hertz (hz);image resolution;interference (communication);mean squared error;root mean square;signal averaging;white noise	Eric Laciar;Raimon Jané;Dana H.

HRV is mainly composed of high frequency components attributed to parasympathetic activity and low frequency components attributed to sympathetic activity. Although, time domain and frequency domain features of HRV have been used to sleep studies, the complex interaction between nonlinear independent frequency components with OSA is less known. This study included 30 electrocardiogram recordings (20 OSA patient recording and 10 healthy subjects) with apnea or normal label in 1-min segment. All segments were divided into three groups: N-N group (normal segments of normal subjects), P-N group (normal segments of OSA subjects) and P-OSA group (apnea segments of OSA subjects). Frequency domain indices and interaction indices were extracted from segmented RR intervals. Frequency domain indices included nuLF, nuHF, and LF/HF ratio; interaction indices included mutual information (MI) and transfer entropy (TE (H→L) and TE (L→H)). Our results demonstrated that LF/HF ratio was significant higher in P-OSA group than N-N group and P-N group. MI was significantly larger in P-OSA group than P-N group. TE (H→L) and TE (L→H) showed a significant decrease in P-OSA group, compared to P-N group and N-N group. TE (H→L) were significantly negative correlation with LF/HF ratio in P-N group (r = −0.789, p = 0.000) and P-OSA group (r = −0.661, p = 0.002). Our results indicated that MI and TE is powerful tools to evaluate sympathovagal modulation in OSA. Moreover, sympathovagal modulation is more imbalance in OSA patients while suffering from apnea event compared to free event.	autonomic computing;delta modulation;heart rate variability;helicon focus;interaction;mutual information;negative feedback;nonlinear system;p–n junction;rapid refresh;sleep mode;test engineer;transfer entropy	Lianrong Zheng;Weifeng Pan;Yifan Li;Daiyi Luo;Qian Wang;Guanzheng Liu	2017	Entropy	10.3390/e19090489	heart rate variability;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics;obstructive sleep apnea;mutual information;apnea;transfer entropy;sleep disorder;internal medicine;cardiology	HCI	17.68244943853832	-85.63500407110546	99020

This technique seeks to extract the minimum number of components necessary for effective Blind Source Separation (BSS). Experimental results using synthesized noisy MEG data demonstrate the utility of this technique. Model order estimation is used in the extraction of baseline noise components which will serve as templates for subsequent identification and removal of noise. These templates are used to remove noise from a data set containing a somatosensory evoked response (SSR) potential; model order estimation was also used to decompose the SSR data set.	adaptive system;baseline (configuration management);blind signal separation;electroencephalography;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetoencephalography;source separation	Carl S.

The ECG typically consists of three important component waves, called the P, QRS, and T waves, which provide clinical information about the functioning of the heart. An important problem in ECG signal processing is that of delineation of the ECG component waves. The delineation of the P wave is difficult in certain cardiac diseases where the P wave overlaps the other ECG component waves. In this paper, we present an innovative algorithm, for the delineation of the P waves, which works well even in such cases. The algorithm basically consists of polezero modeling of the Discrete Cosine Transformed ECG. The resulting polezero filter is then decomposed into a set of unique Partial Fractions (PF), with each PF representing a sub-component or a Fractional Component (FC) of the ECG. A pole angle template matching procedure is used to identify the PFs of the Q R S and T waves, and then their corresponding FCs are subtracted from the ECG to leave the P wave as the residue.	algorithm;p (complexity);signal processing;template matching	B.

These signals reflect the influence of emotion on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The extracted features that are emotion-specific characteristics from those signals are applied to an artificial neural network in order to recognize emotions from new signal collections. Results show that the proposed method is able to accurately distinguish a user's emotion.		Sun Kook Yoo;Chung Ki Lee;Youn Jung Park;Nam H.

For the physiological tremor in healthy subjects, the analysis enables to determine the resonant contribution to the oscillation and allows to test for a contribution of reflexes to this tremor. Comparing the analysis of the relation between the tremor of both hands in normal subjects and subjects with a rare abnormal organization of certain neural pathways proves the involvement of central structures in enhanced physiological tremor. The relation between the left and the right side of the body in pathological tremor shows a specific difference between orthostatic and all other forms of tremor. An investigation of EEG and tremor in patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease reveals the tremor-correlated cortical activity. Finally, the general issue of interpreting the results of methods designed for the analysis of bivariate processes when applied to multivariate processes is considered. We discuss and apply partial cross-spectral analysis in the frame of graphical models as an extention of bivariate cross-spectral analysis for the multivariate case.	bivariate data;electroencephalography;graphical model;time series	Jens Timmer;M.

Valid and reliable assessment of pain is essential for both clinical trials and effective pain management. A major limitation of automatic pain assessment by the facial expression is the lack of clinically validated data. This work aims at collecting a pain expression database for pain intensity analysis in clinical settings. The database includes 140 color video sequences, 140 multi-sensor sequences obtained by the Kinect 2, patients' sequence-level self-report, Cyclooxygenases (COXs) level, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) level in the blood samples. The database also includes head poses and derived facial landmarks from the 2D video. The relationships of their self-report, Cyclooxygenases (COXs), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), head pose and facial expression are analyzed. The correlation between the clinical and non-clinical pain facial expressions have been evaluated as well.	copper(ii) oxide;database;kinect;pain	Peng Liu;Idris Yazgan;Sarah Olsen;Alecia Moser;Umur A.

Longitudinal studies of these models can yield valuable insights into the temporal course of disease progression and the effect of drug treatments on the progressive phenotypes. Atrophy of the brain, particularly the striatum, is a characteristic phenotype of human HD, is known to begin long before the onset of motor symptoms, and correlates strongly with clinical features. Elucidating the spatial and temporal patterns of atrophy in HD mouse models is important to characterize the phenotypes of these models, as well as evaluate the effects of neuroprotective treatments at specific time frames during disease progression. In this study, three dimensional in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and automated longitudinal deformation-based morphological analysis was used to elucidate the spatial and temporal patterns of brain atrophy in the R6/2 and N171-82Q mouse models of HD. Using an established MRI-based brain atlas and mixed-effects modeling of deformation-based metrics, we report the rates of progression and region-specificity of brain atrophy in the two models. Further, the longitudinal analysis approach was used to evaluate the effects of sertraline and coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) treatments on progressive atrophy in the N171-82Q model. Sertraline treatment resulted in significant slowing of atrophy, especially in the striatum and frontal cortex regions, while no significant effects of CoQ(10) treatment were observed. Progressive cortical and striatal atrophy in the N171-82Q mice showed significant positive correlations with measured functional deficits. The findings of this report can be used for future testing and comparison of potential therapeutics in mouse models of HD.	atrophic;brain atlas;cerebral atrophy;cerebral cortex;cervical atlas;coenzymes;color gradient;corpus striatum structure;dvd region code;disease progression;huntington disease;magnetic resonance imaging;mixed model;neostriatum;onset (audio);parkinson disease;phenotype;progressive disease;progressive scan;sensitivity and specificity;sertraline;therapeutic procedure;video-in video-out	Manisha Aggarwal;Wenzhen Duan;Zhipeng Hou;Neal Rakesh;Qi Peng;Christopher A.

To accomplish this objective, the sensor response patterns of odors in the atmosphere were measured using QCM (quartz crystal microbalance) odor sensors with partially overlapping specificities. Then the odors were identified from the response patterns using LVQ (learning vector quantization), a pattern classification algorithm of neural networks with supervised learning. Visual information, presented as a movie, was captured using a digital video camera; concurrently, odors using odor sensor responses were paired to the video. The recorded visual and olfactory information was evaluated by sensory tests to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system. As a result, it was found that the olfactory information recorded using the proposed method was appropriate for odor regeneration associated with the movie.	algorithm;anomalous experiences;artificial neural network;digital video;learning vector quantization;sensor;supervised learning	Takao Yamanaka;Nitikarn Nimsuk;Takamichi Nakamoto	2007	PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments	10.1162/pres.16.3.307	electronic nose;computer vision;speech recognition;learning vector quantization;computer science;quartz crystal microbalance;supervised learning	HCI	10.551932571200616	-93.49904597155644	100235

We addressed this problem using a cardiovascular system model that allows analysis of DC and AC under controllable levels of sympathetic and vagal activities. Multi-scale DCs and ACs with various timescales T and wavelet scales s were computed from the simulated RR interval series under randomly fluctuating levels of ANS activity, and the correlations of the indices to ANS functions were assessed. Results showed that under the conventional scales (T = 1, s = 2), both DC and AC were solely dependent on vagal activity. With higher scales (T = 3, s = 5), both DC and AC were positively correlated to sympathetic activity and negatively correlated to vagal activity. These data suggest that DC and AC provide information on the same aspects of ANS activity and that their physiological significance is highly influenced by the timescales and wavelet scales used in the computation.	autonomic nervous system;clarify;computation;congenital neurologic anomalies;deceleration;deoxycytidine;interval arithmetic;nervous system structure;numerous;qt interval feature (observable entity);randomness;rapid refresh;relevance;wavelet;physiological aspects	Qing Pan;Gongzhan Zhou;Ruofan Wang;Guolong Cai;Jing Yan;Luping Fang;Gangmin Ning	2016	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-016-1486-9	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;control theory	HCI	18.71736939946526	-84.24749891561733	100308

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as one of these requires frequent examinations and hospital visits for its long-term management. CHRONIOUS, an integrated platform for chronic disease patients, provides functional information about their health status continuously, from the patients' environment. The main component of the system is the intelligent core of the wearable device that aims at the real-time characterization of the patients' health level based on the fusion of multiple data that acquired by wearable sensors, through patients smart device interface or retrieved from the specific system's database. The Decision Support System (DSS) is activated whenever new data are entered, and is functioning using by two classification methodologies composed by highly effective algorithms. These parallel classification techniques are: a rule-based expert system and a supervised Radom Forest classifier. The classification conclusion after the above analysis is twofold. The supervised technique provides with high accuracy the severity of patients' health level and the rule-based part, extracts the critical parameters or their combination which had been triggered leading in the improvement or the worsening of the patient's condition.	algorithm;ct pulmonary angiogram;categorization;color gradient;decision support system;expert system;logic programming;random forest;real-time transcription;sensor;smart device;supervised learning;wearable computer;wearable technology	Christos Bellos;Athanasios N.

With increased automation the time that the cattle keeper uses for monitoring animals has decreased. This has created a need for automatic health monitoring systems. Lameness is a crucial welfare and economic issue in modern dairy husbandry. It causes problems especially in loose housing of cattle. This could be greatly reduced by early identification and treatment. A four-balance system for automatically measuring the load on each leg of a cow during milking in a milking robot has been developed. It has been previously shown that the weight distribution between limbs changes when cow get lame. In this paper we suggest CUSUM charts to automatically detect lameness based on the measurements. CUSUM charts are statistical based control charts and are well suited for checking a measuring system in operation for any departure from some target or specified values. The target values for detecting lameness were calculated from the cow’s own historical data so that each animal had an individual chart. The method enables objective monitoring of the changes in leg health, which is valuable information in veterinary research because it provides means for assessing the severity and impact of different causes of lameness and also evaluating the effect of treatment and medication. So far no objective method for calculating these measures has been available and the methodology presented in this paper seems very promising for the task. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

9809f0f25c8d53a0abeb82541b781bda59f87c6d	fuzzy controller design for assisted omni-directional treadmill therapy		One of the defining characteristic of human being is their ability to walk upright. Loss or restriction of such ability whether due to the accident, spine problem, stroke or other neurological injuries can cause tremendous stress on the patients and hence will contribute negatively to their quality of life. Modern research shows that physical exercise is very important for maintaining physical fitness and adopting a healthier life style. In modern days treadmill is widely used for physical exercises and training which enables the user to set up an exercise regime that can be adhered to irrespective of the weather conditions. Among the users of treadmills today are medical facilities such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, medical and physiotherapy clinics etc. The process of assisted training or doing rehabilitation exercise through treadmill is referred to as treadmill therapy. A modern treadmill is an automated machine having some built in functions and predefined features. Most of the treadmills used today are one dimensional and user can only walk in one direction. This paper presents the idea of using omnidirectional treadmills which will be more appealing to the patients as they can walk in any direction, hence encouraging them to do exercises more frequently. This paper proposes a fuzzy control design and possible implementation strategy to assist patients in treadmill therapy. By intelligently controlling the safety belt attached to the treadmill user, one can help them steering left, right or in any direction. The use of intelligent treadmill therapy can help patients to improve their walking ability without being continuously supervised by the specialists. The patients can walk freely within a limited space and the support system will provide continuous evaluation of their position and can adjust the control parameters of treadmill accordingly to provide best possible assistance.

The most common form of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes. Abnormal plantar pressures are considered to play a major role in the pathologies of neuropathic ulcers in the diabetic foot. The purpose of this study was to examine the plantar pressure distribution in normal, diabetic Type 2 with and without neuropathy subjects. Foot scans were obtained using the F-scan (Tekscan USA) pressure measurement system. Various discrete wavelet coefficients were evaluated from the foot images.

Methods: A population of 29 normal weight and 19 overweight subjects was recruited to perform eight common sports activities, while body movement was measured using a triaxial accelerometer placed at the wrist. User- and axis-independent acceleration signal templates were automatically extracted to represent each activity category and recognize activity types. Five different similarity measures between example signals and templates were compared: Euclidean distance, dynamic time warping (DTW), derivative DTW, correlation and an innovative index, and combining distance and correlation metrics (Rce). Template-based activity recognition was compared to statistical-learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN) trained using time- and frequency-domain signal features. Each algorithm was tested on data from a holdout group of 15 normal weight and 19 overweight subjects. Results: The Rce index outperformed other template-matching metrics by achieving recognition rate above 80% for the majority of the activities. Template matching showed robust classification accuracy when tested on unseen data and in case of limited training examples. LR and ANN achieved the highest overall recognition accuracy ~85% but showed to be more vulnerable to misclassification error than template matching on overweight subjects' data. Conclusion: Template matching can be used to classify sports activities using the wrist acceleration signal. Significance: Automatically extracted template prototypes from the acceleration signal may be used to enhance accuracy and generalization properties of statistical-learning classifiers.	activity recognition;apache axis;artificial neural network;body dysmorphic disorders;classification;clinical use template;decision tree;dynamic time warping;eighty;euclidean distance;extraction;generalization (psychology);lr parser;logistic regression;naive bayes classifier;overweight;template matching;wearable computer;youth sports;accelerometers;algorithm	Jenny Margarito;Rim Helaoui;Anna M.

On the contrary, conventional ankle-foot prostheses exhibit a passive-elastic response during stance, and consequently, cannot provide net work. Clinical studies indicate that transtibial amputees using conventional prostheses have higher gait metabolic rates than normal. Researchers believe that the main cause for these higher rates is due to the inability of conventional prostheses to provide sufficient positive power at terminal stance in the trailing leg to limit heel strike losses of the adjacent leading leg. In this investigation, we evaluate the hypothesis that a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, capable of providing human-like ankle work and power during stance, can decrease the metabolic cost of transport (COT) compared to a conventional passive-elastic prosthesis. To test the hypothesis, a powered prosthesis is built that comprises a unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. The prosthesis is shown to deliver the high mechanical power and net positive work observed in normal human walking. The rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production is measured as a determinant of metabolic rate on three unilateral transtibial amputees walking at self-selected speeds. We find that the powered prosthesis decreases the amputee's metabolic COT on average by 14% compared to the conventional passive-elastic prostheses evaluated (Flex-Foot Ceterusreg and Freedom Innovations Sierra), even though the powered system is over twofold heavier than the conventional devices. These results highlight the clinical importance of prosthetic interventions that closely mimic the mass distribution, kinetics, and kinematics of the missing limb.	elastic matching;elasticity (data store);kinetics internet protocol;propel	Samuel K.

The ability to automatically identify arrhythmias from ECG recordings is important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Artificial immune systems (AISs) is a new but effective branch of artificial intelligence. Among the systems proposed in this field so far, artificial immune recognition system (AIRS), which was proposed by A. Watkins, has showed an effective and intriguing performance on the problems it was applied. Previously, AIRS was applied a range of problems including machine-learning benchmark problems and medical classification problems like breast cancer, diabets, liver disorders classification problems. The conducted medical classification task was performed for ECG arrhythmia data taken from UCI repository of machine-learning. Firsly, ECG dataset is normalized in the range of [0,1] and is weighted with fuzzy weighted pre-processing. Then, weighted input values obtained from fuzzy weighted pre-processing is classified by using AIRS classifier system. In this study, fuzzy weighted pre-processing, which can be improved by ours, is a new method and firstly, it is applied to ECG dataset. Classifier system consists of three stages: 50–50% of traing-test dataset, 70–30% of traing-test dataset and 80–20% of traing-test dataset, subsequently, the obtained classification accuries: 78.79, 75.00 and 80.77%.	preprocessor	Kemal Polat;Seral Sahan;Salih Günes	2006	Expert Syst.

An important goal of these systems is to extract physiological information about the subject wearing the network. Such information can be used for life logging, quality of life measures, fall detection, extraction of contextual information, and many other applications. Data collected by these sensor nodes are overwhelming, and hence, an efficient data processing technique is essential. In this paper, we present a system using inexpensive, off-the-shelf inertial sensor nodes that constructs motion transcripts from biomedical signals and identifies movements by taking collaboration between the nodes into consideration. Transcripts are built of motion primitives and aim to reduce the complexity of the original data. We then label each primitive with a unique symbol and generate a sequence of symbols, known as motion template, representing a particular action. This model leads to a distributed algorithm for action recognition using edit distance with respect to motion templates. The algorithm reduces the number of active nodes during every classification decision. We present our results using data collected from five normal subjects performing transitional movements. The results clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. In particular, we obtain a classification accuracy of 84.13% with only one sensor node involved in the classification process.	classification;clinical use template;contribution;distributed algorithm;edit distance;movement;node - plant part;processing (action);sensor node;string (computer science);string searching algorithm;timer;timer, device;transcript;wearable computer;sensor (device)	Hassan Ghasemzadeh;Vitali Loseu;Roozbeh Jafari	2010	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2009.2036722	distributed algorithm;computer vision;quality of life;edit distance;data processing;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;remote patient monitoring;data mining;health care;biosensor;string searching algorithm;data collection;collaboration	Robotics	7.610351548638286	-87.23456338717742	101405
d0ad08543ce5eb84d077d917adbe1b3ad62858aa	smart phone application development for monitoring epilepsy seizure detection based on eeg signal classification		Automated epilepsy seizure detection is the solution to the limitation and time consuming of manual epilepsy monitoring and detection using EEG signals. In this paper we developed a technique for epilepsy seizure detection using EEG signals. The signal will be pre-processed and filtered using multiple filters. Then, the filtered signal will be decomposed into sub-bands. Furthermore, feature extraction is applied; we developed a combined feature consists of combining three features into one. Finally, we used well-known classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and K-Nears Neighbor (KNN) to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic signals, and we achieved an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, we developed an Android-based smartphone application for monitoring epilepsy detection based on the classification results of the EEG signal. A notification will be sent to the patient, doctors, and family members when an epilepsy seizure occurs. Once the EEG signal is classified as epileptic, the App will display a visual notification indicating that Epileptic Seizure has been detected. Moreover, it will trigger an alarm and send a message notification to all associated phone numbers, and the EEG signal will display on the App. Although we are using an EEG signal from a dataset, we have generated both normal and epileptic EEG signals using a waveform generator, and we have displayed those signals on the spectrum analyzer for future real time detection using our Android App.	android;artificial neural network;electroencephalography;feature extraction;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;mobile app;smartphone;spectrum analyzer;support vector machine;telephone number	Zakareya Lasefr;Ramasani Rakesh Reddy;Khaled Elleithy	2017	2017 IEEE 8th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8248992	human–computer interaction;support vector machine;spectrum analyzer;feature extraction;electroencephalography;epileptic seizure;epilepsy;signal generator;artificial neural network;computer science;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition	Mobile	13.632607840974856	-90.44661511859181	101454
62679e42b6fd40ca6845e1f8b74a575962bb114e	a novel accelerometer-based technique for robust detection of walking direction		Objective: Distance estimation in pedestrian dead reckoning is acquired using vector norm of accelerations, which results in positive values. However, anteroposterior acceleration is negative when a step is taken backward, which must be detected for accurate localization. This paper proposes a novel approach for the detection of walking direction, which uses a dominant trend duration. Methods: The approach evaluates anteroposterior acceleration out of a foot-worn accelerometer for temporal dominance of acceleration trends during swing phase of the walk. The approach is tested for forward and backward walks with speed variations on a straight path as well as for forward walk at normal speed on a turning path. To validate the detection accuracy, success rates per participant per walk trial are calculated and then overall success rate for all the trials are reported. Moreover, metrics precision, recall and F1 scores are calculated for detection reliability in both directions. Results:  Overall 98 ± 2% detection accuracy is achieved on linear path considering both directions and all speed variations, whereas 93 ± 7% on turning path including left and right turns. In comparison with the state-of-the-art bidirectional detection approach, the proposed approach delivers accurate detection with speed variations without requiring prior training and relies on a single sensory feature. Conclusion: Dominant trend duration is a novel and reliable feature to detect directional changes during communal walk with speed variation. Significance: The approach can be employed in different contexts, such as enabling pedestrian localization approaches to accommodate back stepping or any application that requires knowledge of changing directions while walking.	dead reckoning;stepping level;accelerometers	Muhammad Faraz Shaikh;Zoran A.

5a134e19180f86a3585c59f20f1e9ac6272ebed2	in-ear audio wearable: measurement of heart and breathing rates for health and safety monitoring		Objective: This paper examines the integration of a noninvasive vital sign monitoring feature into the workers’ hearing protection devices (HPDs) by using a microphone positioned within the earcanal under the HPD. Methods: 25 test-subjects were asked to breathe at various rhythms and intensities and these realistic sound events were recorded in the earcanal. Digital signal processing algorithms were then developed to assess heart and breathing rates. Finally, to test the robustness of theses algorithms in noisy work environments, industrial noise was added to the in-ear recorded signals and an adaptive denoising filter was used. Results:  The developed algorithms show an absolute mean error of 4.3 beats per minute (BPM) and 2.7 cycles per minute (CPM). The mean difference estimate is –0.44 BPM with a limit of agreement (LoA) interval of –14.3 to 13.4 BPM and 2.40 CPM with a LoA interval of –2.62 to 7.48 CPM. Excellent denoising is achieved with the adaptive filter, able to cope with ambient sound pressure levels of up to 110 dB SPL, resulting in a small error for heart rate detection, but a much larger error for breathing rate detection. Conclusion: Extraction of the heart and breathing rates from an acoustical measurement in the occluded earcanal under an HPD is possible and can even be conducted in the presence of a high level of ambient noise. Significance: This proof of concept enables the development of a wide range of noninvasive health and safety monitoring audio wearables for industrial workplaces and life-critical applications where HPDs are used.	adaptive filter;apnea;audio media;beam propagation method;digital signal processing;hpd gene;high-level programming language;inter-rater reliability;large;microphone device component;milliliter per minute per millimeters of mercury;noise reduction;obstruction;respiratory rate;sgpl1 gene;vital signs;wearable computer;algorithm;beats per minute	Alexis Martin;J&#x00E9;r&#x00E9;mie Voix	2018	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2017.2720463	ambient noise level;electronic engineering;robustness (computer science);microphone;breathing;noise reduction;computer science;industrial noise;adaptive filter;digital signal processing	Visualization	12.12375961921132	-88.22448751509421	101501

A system that predicts useru0027s level of susceptibility from their electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be helpful in clinical hypnotherapy sessions. In this paper, we extracted differential entropy (DE) of the recorded EEGs from two groups of subjects with high and low hypnotic susceptibility and built a support vector machine on these DE features for the classification of susceptibility trait. Moreover, we proposed a clustering-based feature refinement strategy to improve the estimation of such trait. Results showed a high classification performance in detection of subjectsu0027 level of susceptibility before and during hypnosis. Our results suggest the usefulness of this classifier in development of future Bel systems applied in the domain of therapy and healthcare.

013bbd5aa66d2d2666e35549e5107628e14ff6d8	extracting single trial visual evoked potentials using selective eigen-rate principal components	conference;meeting	Component Analysis (PCA) to extract Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) signals, the selection of principal components (PCs) is an important issue. We propose a new method here that selects only the appropriate PCs. We denote the method as selective eigen-rate (SER). In the method, the VEP is reconstructed based on the rate of the eigen-values of the PCs. When this technique is applied on emulated VEP signals added with background electroencephalogram (EEG), with a focus on extracting the evoked P3 parameter, it is found to be feasible. The improvement in signal to noise ratio (SNR) is superior to two other existing methods of PC selection: Kaiser (KSR) and Residual Power (RP). Though another PC selection method, Spectral Power Ratio (SPR) gives a comparable SNR with high noise factors (i.e. EEGs), SER give more impressive results in such cases. Next, we applied SER method to real VEP signals to analyse the P3 responses for matched and non-matched stimuli. The P3 parameters extracted through our proposed SER method showed higher P3 response for matched stimulus, which confirms to the existing neuroscience knowledge. Single trial PCA using KSR and RP methods failed to indicate any difference for the stimuli.	eigen (c++ library);electroencephalography;emulator;rp (complexity);signal-to-noise ratio;tree rearrangement	Andrews Samraj;Ramaswamy Palaniappan;Nidal Kamel	2005			management science;operations research;computer security	ML	18.320173884811705	-93.83382204019983	101529

Gait, the rhythmical body movements of human beings as they walk, is a particularly appealing biometric because of its distinguishability [2]. In this work, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation of gait-based user identification using the tri-axial accelerometer sensor of the Motorola Droid phone. It is envisioned that this means of user identification could be utilized as a component of a larger recognition system, one that might fully amalgamate all relevant sensed data to generate an idea of whether a legitimate user has possession of the phone at any given instant. 1	antivirus software;authentication;biometrics;forge;smartphone;triangular function	Matthew Boyle;Avraham Klausner;David Starobinski;Ari Trachtenberg;Hongchang Wu	2011		10.1145/1999995.2000053	computer science;operating system;gait;accelerometer;wavelet transform	Security	1.954971002734289	-83.13286639273187	102031

The obtained human body model includes seven parts such as head, upper body, lower body, left arm, right arm, left leg and right leg. To analyze the walking behaviour, we extract the angle and pace information of different body parts. Besides, we implement our proposed algorithm into an embedded system that can perform real-time pace analysis. The pace distance, walking speed, bending angle of each body parts and hand waving angle can be obtained in real-time at 30fps.	algorithm;connected-component labeling;contour line;distance transform;embedded system;gait analysis;kinesiology;mathematical morphology;pixel;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Yen Wen Chien;Ching-Te Chiu;I-Zan Wu	2015	2015 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)	10.1109/SiPS.2015.7345003	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;gait analysis;computer science;connected-component labeling	Vision	9.785323255916218	-85.74496605981533	102089

5ec3bac436baf5e60b035224424932fc7a2b89a3	an experimental characterization of reservoir computing in ambient assisted living applications		In this paper, we present an introduction and critical experimental evaluation of a reservoir computing (RC) approach for ambient assisted living (AAL) applications. Such an empirical analysis jointly addresses the issues of efficiency, by analyzing different system configurations toward the embedding into computationally constrained wireless sensor devices, and of efficacy, by analyzing the predictive performance on real-world applications. First, the approach is assessed on a validation scheme where training, validation and test data are sampled in homogeneous ambient conditions, i.e., from the same set of rooms. Then, it is introduced an external test set involving a new setting, i.e., a novel ambient, which was not available in the first phase of model training and validation. The specific test-bed considered in the paper allows us to investigate the capability of the RC approach to discriminate among user movement trajectories from received signal strength indicator sensor signals. This capability can be exploited in various AAL applications targeted at learning user indoor habits, such as in the proposed indoor movement forecasting task. Such a joint analysis of the efficiency/efficacy trade-off provides novel insight in the concrete successful exploitation of RC for AAL tasks and for their distributed implementation into wireless sensor networks.	atm adaptation layer;benchmark (computing);computation;data validation;echo state network;embedded system;li-chen wang;occam's razor;rss;reservoir computing;sparse matrix;test data;test set;testbed;time series	Davide Bacciu;Paolo Barsocchi;Stefano Chessa;Claudio Gallicchio;Alessio Micheli	2013	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-013-1364-4	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;operating system;computer network	Mobile	2.5909782226935993	-84.38103721589302	102307

However, since electrical stimulation causes synchronous (phase-locked) neural responses, such electrical stimulation might also cause inappropriate vestibuloocular eye movements, which might, in turn, cause visual blurring. We investigated the eye movements evoked in the guinea pig using electric stimulation with a constant rate of 250 pulses per second (pps), and measured 0.010° peak-to-peak eye movements on an average at 250 Hz, with an average peak velocity amplitude of 8.1°/s, which might cause visual blurring. However, after half an hour of stimulation, that component reduced to 1.6°/s (0.0020° peak-to-peak). The average time constant for this reduction was 5.0 min. After one week of constant stimulation, the 250-Hz response component was only slightly smaller, at 1.2°/s (0.0015° peak-to-peak). We conclude that although an electrical prosthesis with a resting rate of 250 pps may cause some visual blurring when first turned on, such blurring is very likely to attenuate and be imperceptible within several minutes.	acclimatization;arnold tongue;baseline (configuration management);blurred vision;brain implant;cavia;cochlear implant;dual;electric stimulation technique;electricity;eye movements;functional electrical stimulation;hertz (hz);maxima and minima;movement;optic nerve glioma, childhood;patients;prosthesis implantation;rest;semicircular canal structure;small;velocity (software development);vertigo	Michael A.

PTT is considered as a significant index for estimating vital signs such as blood pressure (BP) and arteriosclerosis. However, PTT is still not an accurate indicator of these vital parameters, because PTT changes over time and is influenced by several factors, such as BP, HR, and other cardiovascular variables. Previous research indicated a correlation between HR and PTT, but only under limited experimental conditions in which HR was adjusted through decreased respiration in a supine position, resulting in a relatively low HR. Hence, it is not clear whether correlations between PTT and vital parameters are maintained if HR increases. In this study, HR was increased before and after exercise, allowing analysis of PTT variability over a wide range of HRs. Results obtained from PTT and HR measurements indicated a high degree of correlation between these factors, with correlation coefficients ranging from -0.836 to -0.967. Moreover, the correlation trend between PTT and HR variability held even through changes in applied gravity achieved by shifting body positions.	coefficient;half rate;heart rate variability;spatial variability	Kenta Murakami;Mototaka Yoshioka	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics	10.1109/SMC.2015.279	gravity;telecommunications;correlation;time	DB	14.825632229400743	-84.9035474340644	102432

People counting is a challenging topic in the surveillance domain. The proposed system is built from INT3-Horus, a multi-agent based framework for intelligent monitoring and activity interpretation. The system uses an indoor overhead video camera that detects people moving freely in a hall or room. The people counting system is flexible in detecting individuals as well as groups. Counting is independent of the trajectories and possible occlusions of the humans present in the scene. The initial results offered by the system are very promising in terms of specificity, sensitivity and F-score.	people counter	Juan Serrano-Cuerda;José Carlos Castillo;Marina V.
