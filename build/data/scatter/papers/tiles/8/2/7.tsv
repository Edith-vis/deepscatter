A proper voice-based user authentication will help in many new mobile based applications including mobile-commerce and banking. We present our exploration and evaluation of an experimental set-up for user authentication in remote Indian villages using mobile phones and user-selected multilingual spoken passwords. We also present an effective speaker recognition method using a set of novel features called Compressed Feature Dynamics (CFD) which capture the speaker-identity effectively from the speech dynamics contained in the spoken passwords. Early trials demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling noisy cell-phone speech. Compared to conventional text-dependent speaker recognition methods, the proposed CFD method delivers competitive performance while significantly reducing storage and computational complexity - an advantage highly beneficial for cell-phone based deployment of such user authentication systems.	authentication;computational complexity theory;mobile commerce;mobile phone;password;software deployment;speaker recognition	Amitava Das;Ohil K.

A natural interface to this mobile device is through speech. To address this need, a new European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standard front-end has evolved for Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR). The goal of the ETSI DSR front-end is to standardize client-server speech recognition applications with a common feature set and quantization method. Although originally evolved as a speech recognition standard, we propose it is also a method of standardizing distributed speaker recognition authentication. To this end, we perform experiments using the DSR parameterization for a speaker recognition application. Results indicate excellent preservation of speaker identity in the DSR standard. This testing shows that DSR brings the potential for a promising new era of portable authentication for applications in personalization and security.	ansi escape code;authentication;client–server model;experiment;internet;mobile device;personalization;quantization (signal processing);server (computing);speaker recognition;speech recognition	Charles C.

1a1aceeb415a4b2163e8b8eff45b20652b62e629	special issue on big data inspired data sensing, processing and networking technologies		Big data is the current big thing in computing after cloud computing and it is in par with software defined network (SDN) in communications and networks field. The phrase “big data” refers to large, diverse, complex, typically distributed data sets generated from various sources such as sensors, emails, social network websites, online transactions, and/or all other digital sources available today and in the future. It is evident that big data is making big impact to diverse walks of our everyday life, ranging from increasing understanding of digital system or human/social behaviors/processes to promoting economic growth and eventually to improving human being’s health and quality of life. A long-term strategy to address various challenges introduced or inspired by big data shall be a systematic one that brings together the three key aspects of a big data system, namely, data sensing, data processing and data communications. This special issue of Elsevier Ad Hoc Networks creates a forum for researches, developers and practitioners from both academia and industry to publish the key results and to disseminate the state-of-the-art concepts and techniques in all aspects of big data advancement. In total, 18 papers have been submitted to this special issue. After a rigorous reviewing process, we accepted 11 of the submissions to appear in this special issue. The accepted papers cover new research and developments in big data inspired technologies on sensor and ad hoc networks, big data system, cyber-physical system, MapReduce application, Cloud computing, security and trust, and energy-efficient routing. The paper New Efficient Velocity-Aware Probabilistic Route Discovery Schemes for High Mobility Ad hoc Networks, by Bani Khalaf et al., considers the velocity vector probabilistic route discovery while broadcasting in MANETs. Specifically, this study proposes two new velocity aware probabilistic route discovery models, which can exclude unstable nodes while constructing routes between the source and its destination.
