The proposed approach is a novel attempt to apply the parallel processing capability of neural networks for cryptography purposes. By incorporating neural networks approach, the proposed cipher releases the constraint on the length of the secret key. The proposed cipher is robust in resisting different cryptanalysis attacks and provides efficient data integrity and authentication services. The design of the symmetric cipher is presented and its security is analyzed.

5547a1fdf89f67b411265c264a3a0ab59d3dece9	leia: a lightweight authentication protocol for can		Recent research into automotive security has shown that once a single vehicle component is compromised, it is often possible to take full control of the vehicle. This paper proposes LeiA, a lightweight authentication protocol for the Controller Area Network (CAN). This protocol allows critical vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to authenticate each other providing compartmentalisation and preventing a number of attacks e.g., where a compromised CD player is able to accelerate the vehicle. LeiA is designed to run under the stringent time and bandwidth constraints of automotive applications and is backwards compatible with existing vehicle infrastructure. The protocol is suitable to be implemented using lightweight cryptographic primitives yet providing appropriate security levels by limiting the usage of every key in the system. The security of LeiA is proven under the unforgeability assumption of the MAC scheme under chosen message attacks (uf-cma).	autosar;authentication protocol;backward compatibility;can bus;cryptography;internet access;requirement;software deployment	Andreea-Ina Radu;Flavio D.

One possible byproduct of correlating raw IDS data are attack tracks, which consist of ordered collections of alerts belonging to a single multistage attack. This paper presents a variable-length Markov model (VLMM) that captures the sequential properties of attack tracks, allowing for the prediction of likely future actions on ongoing attacks. The proposed approach is able to adapt to newly observed attack sequences without requiring specific network information. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of VLMM predictors and their adaptiveness to new attack scenarios.	algorithm;branch predictor;intrusion detection system;markov chain;markov model;multistage amplifier;network packet;network security;simulation	Daniel S.

6303f487cf9edb48df1c231bd266c124f97e6c5b	modeling inter-signal arrival times for accurate detection of can bus signal injection attacks: a data-driven approach to in-vehicle intrusion detection		Modern vehicles rely on hundreds of on-board electronic control units (ECUs) communicating over in-vehicle networks. As external interfaces to the car control networks (such as the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port, auxiliary media ports, etc.) become common, and vehicle-to-vehicle / vehicle-to-infrastructure technology is in the near future, the attack surface for vehicles grows, exposing control networks to potentially life-critical attacks. This paper addresses the need for securing the controller area network (CAN) bus by detecting anomalous traffic patterns via unusual refresh rates of certain commands. While previous works have identified signal frequency as an important feature for CAN bus intrusion detection, this paper provides the first such algorithm with experiments using three attacks in five (total) scenarios. Our data-driven anomaly detection algorithm requires only five seconds of training time (on normal data) and achieves true positive / false discovery rates of 0.9998/0.00298, respectively (micro-averaged across the five experimental tests).	algorithm;anomaly detection;attack surface;can bus;experiment;intrusion detection system;on-board data handling;refresh rate;sensor;vehicle-to-vehicle	Michael R.

Existing work achieves this by ensuring that each individual is linked to multiple sensitive values, but they have not adequately considered how the range formed by these sensitive values may affect privacy protection. When such a range is small, sensitive information about individuals may still be inferred quite accurately, thereby breaching privacy. In this paper, we study the problem of range disclosure (i.e. estimating sensitive information through ranges) in k-anonymisation, and propose Range Diversity for quantifying the effect of range disclosure on privacy protection. Our measure considers several possible attacks and allows anonymisers to specify the level of protection required in a flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that range diversity provides better protection for range disclosure and higher level of data utility than the existing methods.

39e071b2e91bc1954ef103aa1d1e0551cc978b83	efficient network coding signatures in the standard model		Network Coding is a routing technique where each node may actively modify the received packets before transmitting them. While this departure from passive networks improves throughput and resilience to packet loss it renders transmission susceptible to pollution attacks where nodes can misbehave and change in a malicious way the messages transmitted. Nodes cannot use standard signature schemes to authenticate the modified packets: this would require knowledge of the original sender’s signing key. Network coding signature schemes offer a cryptographic solution to this problem. Very roughly, such signatures allow signing vector spaces (or rather bases of such spaces). Furthermore, these signatures are homomorphic: given signatures on a set of vectors it is possible to create signatures for any linear combination of these vectors. Designing such schemes is a difficult task, and the few existent constructions either rely on random oracles or are rather inefficient. In this paper we introduce two new network coding signature schemes. Both of our schemes are provably secure in the standard model, rely on standard assumptions, and are in the same efficiency class with previous solutions based on random oracles.	authentication;cryptography;linear network coding;malware;network packet;oracle machine;provable security;random access;rendering (computer graphics);routing;throughput;transmitter;type signature	Dario Catalano;Dario Fiore;Bogdan Warinschi	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-30057-8_40	linear network coding;telecommunications;mathematics;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-51.27630297875849	78.39530606911441	23359

The system is featured in the use of One Time Pad (here-in-after called as OTP) made from intrinsic random number sequences derived from the natural phenomenon. The other unique feature of the proposed system is to establish cryptograph communication path between each user and an authentication server (here-in-after called as Auth Server), not between users directly. Authentication is first established between a user who initiates communication and Auth Server through internet, and then encrypted message transmission will follow. The other user who wants to receive delivered messages also establishes authentication with Auth Server in the same way and encrypted message reception will follow. The two users do not need to share any secret key for establishing a secure communication channel in the proposed system. Therefore, any key information leak from one party does not jeopardize authentication and communication capabilities of the others.#R##N##R##N#This proposed cryptosystem belongs to the stream-cipher method whose security level was considered low as compared to the block-cipher method. With the use of OTP made from intrinsic random number sequences derived from the natural phenomenon, the system becomes theoretically unbreakable, and the drawback mentioned above is completely removed. Because of the bit-by-bit encryption process, the system is very simple and shows ultimate low latency. The simplicity allows realization of the system without special LSI functions but with small scale software only.#R##N##R##N#With the merits described above, the unified authentication and secrecy process can be easily applied to e-commerce applications using mobile phones which are very sensitive to the increase of complexity and power consumption. Authors examined a possible enhancement of the existing e-commerce systems to allow mobile phones as the terminal device.	authentication;cryptosystem	Osamu Atsumi;Shogo Hayashida;Rikio Maruta	2006			computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;one-way function;computer security	Crypto	-46.334472482321715	72.02609784609666	23426

The ability of anyone to edit the content is, at the same time, their strength and their weakness. Anyone can write documents that improve the value of the wiki-system, but at the same time, anyone can also introduce errors into these documents, by accident or on purpose. A security model for wiki-style authoring systems has previously been proposed. This model is based on both static and dynamic document access controls that enforce a simple integrity based security policy. In this paper, we present a new policy for the existing wiki security model, which provides a higher degree of parameterization and adaptability. The new policy is analyzed and compared to the original policy. Our evaluation shows that this new policy provides stronger security when the number of malicious and colluding users is low, but it has a clearly defined level of tolerance in terms of the amount of work required by an attacker to achieve a given probability of violating the policy. Efforts beyond that level, can allow such users to take control of the system, but this is true for all soft security systems. We show that the system parameters can be tuned so that the amount of work required by malicious and colluding users to reach this level is well beyond most attackers' capabilities.	access control;living document;malware;virtual community;wiki	Kasper Lindberg;Christian Damsgaard Jensen	2012	2012 Tenth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust	10.1109/PST.2012.6297938	personal wiki;the internet;computer science;access control;multimedia;internet privacy;electronic publishing;world wide web;computer security;encyclopedia	Security	-54.25469193031452	62.07887604700652	23429

45dbb905cd791908d9eae8deed077b2bc998ba9d	a semantics for a logic of authentication (extended abstract)	inference rule;col	Burrows, Abadi, and Needham have proposed a logic for the analysis of authentication protocols. It is a logic of belief, with special constructs for expressing some of the central concepts used in au-thentication. The logic has revealed many subt Ieties and serious errors in published protocols. Unfortunately , it has also created some confusion. In this paper, we provide a new semantics for the logic, our attempt to clarify its meaning. In the search for a sound semantics, we have identified many sources of the past confusion. Identifying these sources has helped us improve the logic's syntax and inference rules, and extend its applicability. One of the greatest differences between our semantics and the original semantics is our treatment of belief as a form of resource-bounded, defensible knowledge. 1 Introduction Authentication is the act of determining the identity of a principal (such as a person, computer, or server) in a computer system. Authentication usually plays an important role in secure systems, since a principal controlling a resource must have some way of identifying principals requesting access to the resource. Authentication typically depends on secrets, such as passwords or encryption keys, that one principal can reveal or somehow use to prove its identity to others. Before these secrets can be used, however, they must be distributed to the principals in some way. An authentication protocol is a description of how these secrets are distributed to principals, and how these secrets are used to determine principals' identities.

(This is actually a very incomplete description of the Kerberos key distribution protocol [M NSS87, KNS90].) The three principals involved are a server S trusted to generate good encryption keys, and two principals A and B. The goal of this protocol is for A and B to acquire a key that they can use in their communication. Principal A begins by aending a request for a key to the server S. The server responds with a message …	authentication protocol;computer;encryption;kerberos;key distribution;needham–schroeder protocol;password;server (computing)	Martín Abadi;Mark R.

In this article, we focus on security issues related to mobile phone cameras. Specifically, we discover several new attacks that are based on the use of phone cameras. We implement the attacks on real phones, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the attacks. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight defense scheme that can effectively detect these attacks.	android;mobile app;mobile operating system;mobile phone;mobile security;smartphone	Longfei Wu;Xiaojiang Du;Xinwen Fu	2014	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2014.6766089	mobile broadband;embedded system;mobile search;3g;mobile web;imt advanced;gsm services;mobile technology;feature phone;mobile phone tracking;camera phone;internet privacy;mobile station;mobile computing;computer security;mobile payment	Security	-50.411307655865755	63.74011502188221	23505

a78735b809b56557e37ca042a2106baf176e2df5	defending internet of things against malicious domain names using d-fens		Malicious domain names have long been pervasive in the global DNS (Domain Name System) infrastructure and lend themselves to undesirable activities such as phishing or even DNS-based attacks like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and DNS rebinding. With the rise and explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), adversaries are exploiting these devices which typically lack security measures to launch DNS-based attacks through malicious domain names. Typical countermeasures against such malicious domain names employ blacklists and whitelists to determine which domain names should be resolved. While these domain lists offer fast lookup times, they require carefully curated and up-to-date information which tends to fall short of detecting newly-registered malicious domain names. In this work, we present a system called D-FENS (DNS Filtering & Extraction Network System) which works in tandem with blacklists and features a live DNS server and binary classifier to accurately predict unreported malicious domain names. The D-FENS classifier model operates at the character-level and leverages the use of deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) for real-time classification which forgoes the need for feature-engineering typically associated with traditional machine learning approaches. Sourcing from free and open datasets, we evaluate our system and achieve a 0.95 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification. By accurately predicting unreported malicious domain names in real-time, D-FENS prevents Internet-connected systems from unknowingly connecting to potentially malicious domain names.

This horizontal business model has led to many well documented issues associated with untrusted foundries including IC overproduction and shipping improperly or insufficiently tested chips. Entering such chips in the supply chain can be catastrophic for critical applications. We propose a new Secure Split-Test to give control over testing back to the IP owner. Each chip is locked during test. The IP owner is the only entity who can interpret the locked test results and unlock passing chips. In this way, SST can prevent shipping overproduction and defective chips from reaching the supply chain. The proposed method considerably simplifies the communication required between the foundry and IP owner compared to the original version of the secure split test. The results demonstrate that our new technique is more secure than the original and with less communication barriers.	a/b testing;fabless manufacturing;outsourcing;sim lock;sst (menter’s shear stress transport);semiconductor device fabrication;traffic flow (computer networking)	Md.

The security of the McEliece PKC is based on the decoding problem and it is known that it satisfies, with an appropriate conversion, the strongest security notion, i.e., INDistinguishability of encryption [10] against adaptively Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks (IND-CCA2), in the random oracle model under the assumption that the underlying primitive McEliece PKC satisfies a weak security notion of One-Wayness against Chosen-Plaintext Attacks (OW-CPA). OW-CPA is said to be satisfied if it is infeasible for chosen plaintext attacks to recover the whole plaintext of an arbitrarily given ciphertext. Currently, the primitive McEliece PKC satisfies OW-CPA if a parameter 2048 with optimum and is chosen since the binary work factor for ( ) = (2048 1278 70) to break it with the best CPA is around 2, which is infeasible even if world-wide computational power is used. While the binary work factor for the next smaller parameter = 1024 is in a gray level of2, it will be improved by applying Loidreau’s modification that employs Frobenius automorphism in Goppa codes. In this paper, we carefully investigate the one-wayness of the Loidreau’s modified McEliece PKC against ever known CPAs and new CPAs we propose, and then show that it certainly improves the one-wayness against ever known CPAs but it is vulnerable against our new CPAs. Thus, it is rather harmful to apply the new modification to the McEliece PKC.	binary goppa code;ciphertext indistinguishability;computation;computer;cost per action;digital light processing;discrete logarithm;emergence;encryption;grayscale;integer factorization;mceliece cryptosystem;pkc (conference);plaintext;polynomial;public-key cryptography;quantum computing;random oracle;time complexity	Kazukuni Kobara;Hideki Imai	2003	IEEE Trans.

3f73bcc2c336c60ce846933dfda1f05084a487cc	privacy-enabled probabilistic verification in broadcast authentication for vehicular networks	dissertation;computer science	Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) possess an extremely dynamic nature accompanying the high mobility feature. In VANETs, each vehicle sends out safety messages at regular intervals of 100 − 300 ms. Since the purpose of VANETs is to ensure the safety of human life on the road, therefore, it becomes extremely important to secure these messages. IEEE 1609.2 security standard for VANETs recommend the use of secure Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures for authenticating broadcast messages. ECDSA is a digital signature based on elliptic curve cryptography such that the elliptic curve is defined over a finite field of a prime number. It is considered to be very secure because solving its discrete logarithmic is hard, with primes of sizes 224, 256-bits and greater. Yet, ECDSA is computationally expensive, an ECDSA signature generation takes 4 milliseconds while the verification takes 22 milliseconds on a 400 Mhz processor. Besides, when all vehicles will be broadcasting messages at a frequency of 10 Hz, the verification queue size will increase at a rapid rate. Since the messages are valid only for a certain time period, some of them will time out waiting to be verified. Malicious vehicles can take advantage of this fact by increasing signature verification time through signature flooding of fake messages. Therefore, smart verification strategy is required. Hence, we design a probabilistic verification method using highly secure ECDSA. At the same time, we make available a privacy controlled mechanism, where Registering Authorities (RA) are the entities responsible for disclosing the original identities of the vehicles communicating with pseudonyms. In accordance, with the early deployment stages of VANETs, our solution does not require a strong backbone of the infrastructure entities RA. Another advantage of our solution is that the vehicles use the information available in the broadcasts to compute the probability. Thus, it does not increase the communication overhead of the broadcasts.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;antivirus software;authentication;certificate authority;digital signature;elliptic curve cryptography;entity;formal verification;hoc (programming language);internet backbone;overhead (computing);pseudonymity;software deployment;traffic collision avoidance system	Kanika Grover;Alvin S.

Various solutions attempt to analyze email exchange in order to prevent emails from being sent to the wrong recipients. However there are still no satisfying solutions; many email addressing mistakes are not detected and in many cases correct recipients are wrongly marked as potential addressing mistakes. In this paper we present a new approach for preventing emails addressing mistakes in organizations. The approach is based on analysis of emails exchange among members of the organization and the identification of groups based on common topics. Each member's topics are then used during the enforcement phase for detecting potential leakage. When a new email is composed and about to be sent, each email recipient is analyzed. A recipient is approved if the email's content belongs to at least one of the topics common to the sender and the recipient. We evaluated the new approach using the Enron Email dataset. Our evaluation results suggest that the new approach easily copes with email recipients that have no previous direct connection with the sender.	email;sensor;spectral leakage	Polina Zilberman;Shlomi Dolev;Gilad Katz;Yuval Elovici;Asaf Shabtai	2011	Proceedings of 2011 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics	10.1109/ISI.2011.5984047	statistical classification;communication in small groups;computer science;machine learning;email spoofing;internet privacy;opt-in email;world wide web;computer security;email authentication;satisfiability	SE	-58.89715196991576	63.69040863318649	23808

Mobility is one of the most distinct features to be considered in wireless networks. Moving users onto the key tree causes extra key management resources even though they are still in service. To take care of frequent handoff between wireless access networks, it is necessary to reduce the number of rekeying messages and the size of the messages. The multicast protocol used in wired networks does not perform well in wireless networks because multicast structures are fragile as the mobile node moves and connectivity changes. When we choose a key management scheme, the structure of the wireless network should be considered very carefully. In this paper, we design a key management tree such that neighbors on the key tree are also physical neighbors on the cellular network. By tracking the user location, we localize the delivery of rekeying messages to the users who need them. This lessens the amount of traffic in wireless and wired intervals of the network. The group key management scheme uses the pre-positioned secret sharing scheme.	access control;access network;care-of address;common access card;dvd region code;encryption;group key;interrupt;key management;secret sharing;secure multicast;transmitter	Hwa Young Um;Edward J.

Towards this end, we re-investigate in this paper the security concerns of smartbands. In particular, we first introduce our detailed methodology for security analysis, including log analysis, Hook technology, and Android reverse engineering. Then, we apply it to popular commercial smartbands of three different brands the concrete information of which is omitted, identify their common vulnerabilities, and develop accordingly a fake Android application (App) utilizing the identified loopholes, given the protection measures of shelling, obfuscation, as well as forcible pairing and resetting. By installing the fake App, we are able to conduct deception attacks against the targeted smartbands, succeeding to remotely activate/deactivate shaking function, to adjust/modify time (including value and format), and to obtain the smartband owner’s sensitive/health data. During our deception attacks, no cooperation from the smartband owner is required, neither the pairing process between the targeted smartbands and our fake App.	android;smartphone	Jun Xie;Sha Wu;Yansong Li;Jun Guo;Wen Sun;Jiajia Liu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-69471-9_22	wearable technology;security analysis;reverse engineering;android (operating system);deception;obfuscation;internet privacy;wearable computer;installation;computer security;computer science	AI	-55.1652152452964	62.10305060513206	24119
5b566daa814c76147d9136489cb735a4089e427d	a leakage-resilient cca-secure identity-based encryption scheme		Identity-based encryption (IBE) has many appealing applications. However, some traditional IBE schemes may not be secure in the real world due to the side-channel attacks. Leakage-resilient cryptography can capture these attacks by modeling information leakage that adversary can access. In this paper, we apply a hash proof technique in the existing CCA-secure variant of the Gentry’s IBE scheme to construct a new leakage-resilient IBE scheme in the bounded-leakage model. The proposed scheme is more computationally efficient than the original Alwen et al.’s leakage-resilient IBE scheme. It enjoys a shorter key (public/secret key) length, and a higher relative key leakage ratio. The new leakage-resilient scheme is proved semantically secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack in the standard model under the truncated augmented bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent (q-TABDHE) assumption.	adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack;adversary (cryptography);algorithmic efficiency;bilinear filtering;ciphertext;computational diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;information leakage;key (cryptography);key size;semantic security;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;the computer journal	Jiguo Li;Meilin Teng;Yichen Zhang;Qihong Yu	2016	Comput.

At Asiacrypt 2009, Katz and Vaikuntanathan showed a generic three-round PAKE based on any CCA-secure PKE with associated approximate smooth projective hashing (ASPH), which helps to obtain the first PAKE from lattices. In this paper, we give a framework for constructing PAKE from CCA-secure PKE with associated ASPH, which uses only two-round messages by carefully exploiting a splittable property of the underlying PKE and its associated non-adaptive ASPH. We also give a splittable PKE with associated non-adaptive ASPH based on the LWE assumption, which finally allows to instantiate our two-round PAKE framework from lattices.	approximation algorithm;asiacrypt;authenticated key exchange;authentication;learning with errors;password;password-authenticated key agreement;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;strong cryptography	Jiang Zhang;Yu Yu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-70700-6_2	password;theoretical computer science;discrete mathematics;computer science;asph;lattice (order);hash function;authenticated key exchange	Crypto	-39.42563134975075	76.34715861906975	24392

The sufficient conditions include (i) a uniformity property and collision-resistance for the underlying hash function, (ii) pseudorandomness in the private key space for the ephemeral private key generator, (iii) generic treatment of the underlying group, and (iv) a further condition on how the ephemeral public keys are mapped into the private key space. For completeness, a brief survey of necessary security conditions is also given. Some of the necessary conditions are weaker than the corresponding sufficient conditions used in the security proofs here, but others are identical. Despite the similarity between DSA and ECDSA, the main result is not appropriate for DSA, because the fourth condition above seems to fail for DSA. (The corresponding necessary condition is plausible for DSA, but is not proved here nor is the security of DSA proved assuming this weaker condition.) Brickell et al. [Vol. 1751 of Lecture Notes in computer Science, pp. 276--292], Jakobsson et al. [Vol. 1976 of Lecture Notes in computer Science, pp. 73--89] and Pointcheval et al. [Vol. 13 of Journal of Cryptology, pp. 361--396] only consider signature schemes that include the ephemeral public key in the hash input, which ECDSA does not do, and moreover, assume a condition on the hash function stronger than the first condition above. This work seems to be the first advance in the provable security of ECDSA.	collision resistance	Daniel R. L.

It is not difficult to realize this property by using a Trusted Third Party (TTP), but we focus on systems without TTP, considering a practical use. Our assumption is only the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Our work is based on the work by Shimizu et al., in which they applied the so-called ``gradual secret exchange protocol'' and implemented an e-mail exchange system using this protocol. The aim of this paper is to improve their system. We first point out that although the gradual secret exchange protocol is theoretically excellent, it is over-spec for our purpose. Hence we avoid using it and propose a simplified protocol, which has low computational cost. Using this protocol, we design a certified document delivery system based on the Half Agent Model proposed by Shimizu et al. Finally, we implement our protocol as a prototype system, and evaluate its performance. Experimental results show that our system runs efficiently with relatively small example documents, such as ones of size less than 30MB.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;email;megabyte;prototype;public key infrastructure;spec#;trusted third party	Satoshi Ishibashi;Shuichi Miyazaki;Yasuo Okabe	2011	2011 IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2011.13	digital signature;computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.854325849239636	73.45152649001182	24552

d750e07919d70e2b963acd8d398429b7bfce42d3	speeding up pairing computation using non-adjacent form and elm method		The bilinear pairings such as Weil pairing and Tate pairing on elliptic curves have recently found many applications in cryptography. The first efficient algorithm for computing pairing was originally proposed by Miller and much subsequent research has been directed at many different aspects in order to improve efficiency. In 2003, Eisenträger, Lauter and Montgomery proposed a new point-double-addition method to speed up elliptic curve arithmetic computation and obtained a 7.8% performance improvement of the Miller algorithm of a general elliptic curve. In 2006, Blake et al. proposed a new concept based on the conjugate of a line to reduce the total number of lines in the Miller algorithm. In this paper we propose an enhancement of Eisenträger et al.’s algorithm for computing pairings. Our enhancement can further speed up the pairing computation by 5.9%.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;computation;cryptography;elm;montgomery modular multiplication	Chao-Liang Liu;Gwoboa Horng;Du-Shiau Tsai	2016	I.

One key DNS function is Dynamic Update, which allows hosts on the network to make updates to DNS records dynamically, without the need for restarting the DNS service. Unfortunately, this dynamic process does expose DNS servers to security issues. To address these issues two protocols were introduced: Transaction Signature (TSIG) and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). In Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) networks using these protocols eliminated security issues. In Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) however, there is an issue with the DNS authentication process when using the Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) mechanism (new to IPv6, nonexistent in IPv4). This authentication issue occurs when a node wants to update its resource records on a DNS server, during the DNS update process, or when a client wants to authenticate a DNS resolver to ensure that the DNS response does not contain a spoofed source address or message. In this paper we propose the use of a new mechanism which makes use of asymmetric cryptography to establish a trust relationship with the DNS server. We also consider the use of the current security parameters used to generate IPv6 addresses in a secure manner, i.e. Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND), for assuring clients and DNS servers that the one they are communicating with is the real owner of this IP address. Since we are extending the RDATA field within the TSIG protocol to accommodate these new security parameters, we will call this new mechanism the CGA-TSIG algorithm.	algorithm;authentication;auto-configuration;domain name system security extensions;internet;key exchange;public-key cryptography;secure neighbor discovery;server (computing);spoofing attack;stateless protocol	Hosnieh Rafiee;Christoph Meinel	2013	2013 IEEE 12th International Symposium on Network Computing and Applications	10.1109/NCA.2013.37	dns hijacking;dns zone transfer;round-robin dns;the internet;transaction processing;ip address management;computer science;network security;dns spoofing;cryptographic protocol;dns zone;authorization;internet privacy;zone file;dns root zone;generic security service algorithm for secret key transaction;trustworthy computing;name server;computer security;nsupdate;domain name system;computer network;zero-configuration networking	Security	-47.69839607063745	70.50253254681296	24674
ab3f54bc5402780e79bc083fc25fac065c3366c3	collusion-resistant processing of sql range predicates		Prior solutions for securely handling SQL range predicates in outsourced Cloud-resident databases have primarily focused on passive attacks in the Honest-but-Curious adversarial model, where the server is only permitted to observe the encrypted query processing. We consider here a significantly more powerful adversary, wherein the server can launch an active attack by clandestinely issuing specific range queries via collusion with a few compromised clients. The security requirement in this environment is that data values from a plaintext domain of size N should not be leaked to within an interval of size $$H$$ H . Unfortunately, all prior encryption schemes for range predicate evaluation are easily breached with only $$O(\log _2\psi )$$ O(log2ψ) range queries, where $$\psi = N{/}H$$ ψ=N/H . To address this lacuna, we present SPLIT, a new encryption scheme where the adversary requires exponentially more—$${\mathbf{O}}(\psi )$$ O(ψ) —range queries to breach the interval constraint and can therefore be easily detected by standard auditing mechanisms. The novel aspect of SPLIT is that each value appearing in a range-sensitive column is first segmented into two parts. These segmented parts are then independently encrypted using a layered composition of a secure block cipher with the order-preserving encryption and prefix-preserving encryption schemes, and the resulting ciphertexts are stored in separate tables. At query processing time, range predicates are rewritten into an equivalent set of table-specific sub-range predicates, and the disjoint union of their results forms the query answer. A detailed evaluation of SPLIT on benchmark database queries indicates that its execution times are well within a factor of two of the corresponding plaintext times, testifying its efficiency in resisting active adversaries.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;benchmark (computing);block cipher;clients;data table;database;dolev–yao model;encryption;hl7publishingsubsection <query>;handling (psychology);plaintext;question (inquiry);range query (data structures);sql;server (computer);server (computing);anatomical layer	Manish Kesarwani;Akshar Kaul;Gagandeep Singh;Prasad Deshpande;Jayant R.

We study the security of quantum and classical protocols against adversaries that are assumed to exploit quantum effects to their advantage. Security in the quantum world means that quantum computation does not jeopardize the assumption, underlying the protocol construction. But moreover, we encounter additional setbacks in the security proofs, which are mostly due to the fact that some well-known classical proof techniques are forbidden by certain properties of a quantum environment. Interestingly, we can exploit some of the very same properties to the benefit of quantum cryptography. Thus, this work lies right at the heart of the conflict between highly potential effects but likewise rather demanding conditions in the quantum world.	computation;cryptographic protocol;quantum hall effect;quantum computing;quantum cryptography	Carolin Lunemann	2011	CoRR		quantum hall effect;quantum information;quantum information science;theoretical computer science;quantum network;quantum capacity;cryptographic protocol;mathematics;quantum computer;physics;quantum cryptography;algorithm;quantum mechanics	Crypto	-37.19451485825342	74.33079933675536	25005

2844f9e1492e003106a3d402d7ab8917b8456de4	statistical network behavior based threat detection		Malware, short for malicious software, contuses to morph and change. Traditional anti-virus software may have problems detecting malicious software that have not been seen before. By employing machine learning techniques, one can learn the general behavior patterns of different threat types and use these to detect variants of unknown threats. We have developed a malware detection system based on machine learning that uses features derived from a user's network flows to external hosts. A novel aspect of our technique is to separate hosts into different groups by how common they are visited by the users and then develop user features separately for each of these host groups. The network data for the training of the detector is based on malware samples that have been run in a sandbox and normal users' traffic that is collected from an LTE wireless network provider. Specifically, we use the Adaboost algorithm as the classification engine and obtain a good performance of 0.78% false alarm rate and 96.5% accuracy for detecting users infected with malwares. We also provide high and low confidence regions for our system based on subclasses of threats.	adaboost;algorithm;antivirus software;compaq lte;machine learning;malware;sandbox (computer security);sensor;threat (computer)	Jin Cao;Lawrence M.

While this may encourage more open and frank discussion, it diminishes accountability. In addition, anonymous comments are perceived as weaker than non-anonymous comments. We propose a communication protocol that allows a user to send a strong message to the group without having to assume sole individual responsibility. The system posts an anonymous comment, and then calls for supporters. When sufficient numbers of supporters have been gathered, the system reveals the names of all supporters as a round-robin signature. This prevents the originator from being identified.

5ce0a5b6847e86dbd6f8a4a2467f05902fbbb3a5	privacy of hidden profiles: utility-preserving profile removal in online forums		Users who wish to leave an online forum often do not have the freedom to erase their data completely from the service providersu0027 (SP) system. The primary reason behind this is that analytics on such user data form a core component of many online providersu0027 business models. On the other hand, if the profiles reside in the SPu0027s system in an unchanged form, major privacy violations may occur if the infrastructure is compromised, or the SP is acquired by another organization. In this work, we investigate an alternative solution to standard profile removal, where posts of different users are split and merged into synthetic mediator profiles. The goal of our framework is to preserve the SPu0027s data mining utility as far as possible, while minimizing usersu0027 privacy risks. We present several mechanisms of assigning user posts to such mediator accounts and show the effectiveness of our framework using data from StackExchange and various health forums.	algorithm;data mining;deep learning;experiment;fragmentation (computing);internet privacy;machine learning;parallels desktop for mac;stack exchange;synergy;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Sedigheh Eslami;Asia J.

The current attack works on MICKEY-128 2.0 with 320 state register-bits and requires 480 number of random single bit faults to break it. Till date, only two fault attacks against MICKEY family are available in literature, one attack on MICKEY-128 and another on MICKEY 2.0. The attack on MICKEY-128 with same 320 register bits required 640 number of faults whereas the other attack on MICKEY 2.0 with 200 state register bits required $2^{16.7} number of faults.

However, we show that the scheme is vulnerable to a specific kind of collusion attack.

Traceable signatures, introduced by Kiayias, Tsiounis and Yung (KTY), support an extended set of fairness mechanisms (mechanisms for anonymity management and revocation) when compared with the traditional group signatures. Designing short signatures based on the power of pairing has been a current activity of cryptographic research, and is especially needed for long constructions like that of traceable signatures. The size of a signature in our scheme is less than one third of the size in the KTY scheme and about 40% of the size of the pairing based traceable signature (which has been the shortest till today). The security of our scheme is based on the Strong Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear Diffie-Hellman assumption.

A typical wormhole attack can be launched by two colluding attackers, one of which sniffs packets at one point in the network and tunnels them through a wired or wireless link to another point, and the other relays them within its vicinity. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the wormhole attack on the localization and propose a novel distance-consistency-based secure localization scheme against wormhole attacks, which includes three phases of wormhole attack detection, valid locators identification and self-localization. The theoretical model is further formulated to analyze the proposed secure localization scheme. The simulation results validate the theoretical results and also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.	multilateration;relay;sensor;simulation;theory	Honglong Chen;Wei Lou;Xice Sun;Zhi Wang	2010	EURASIP J.

One finding reveals that blocker tags offer different levels of protection to tags associated with different leaf nodes in the binary tree. Besides, another finding confirms the potential of a new attack in which an attacker could exclusively read tag data while preventing the data requests from legal readers.

5288347d236df8afcca1755b2547088490013ea9	specification-based protocol obfuscation		This paper proposes a new obfuscation technique of a communication protocol that is aimed at making the reverse engineering of the protocol more complex. The obfuscation is based on the transformation of protocol message format specification. The obfuscating transformations are applied to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the messages and mainly concern the ordering or aggregation of the AST nodes. The paper also presents the design of a framework that implements the proposed obfuscation technique by automatically generating, from the specification of the message format, a library performing the corresponding transformations. Finally, our framework is applied to two real application protocols (Modbus and HTTP) to illustrate the relevance and efficiency of the proposed approach. Various metrics recorded from the experiments show the significant increase of the complexity of the obfuscated protocol binary compared to the non-obfuscated code. It is also shown that the execution time and memory overheads remain acceptable for a practical deployment of the approach in operation.	abstract syntax tree;adversary (cryptography);binary file;bittorrent protocol encryption;bitwise operation;communications protocol;cryptographic hash function;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);hypertext transfer protocol;modbus;obfuscation (software);overhead (computing);prototype;randomness;relevance;reverse engineering;run time (program lifecycle phase);software deployment	Julien Duchêne;Eric Alata;Vincent Nicomette;Mohamed Kaâniche;Colas Le Guernic	2018	2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN)	10.1109/DSN.2018.00056	software deployment;theoretical computer science;modbus;real-time computing;message format;communications protocol;abstract syntax tree;software;reverse engineering;obfuscation;computer science	SE	-34.524205136104115	81.1498158971597	25232

However there is a very powerful attack against it with a fault injection during one of its exponentiations. Many countermeasures were proposed but almost all of them are proven to be insecure. In 2005, two new countermeasures were proposed. However they still have a weakness. The final signature is stored in a memory after CRT combination and there is an error-check routine just after CRT combination. Therefore, if an attacker can do a double-fault attack that gives the first fault during one of the exponentiation and the other to skip the error-checking routine, then he can succeed in breaking RSA. In this paper, we show this can be done with the concrete result employing a glitch attack and propose a simple and almost cost-free method to defeat it.	algorithm;cathode ray tube;countermeasure (computer);differential fault analysis;double fault;experiment;fault injection;glitch	Chong Hee Kim;Jean-Jacques Quisquater	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72354-7_18	embedded system;real-time computing;chinese remainder theorem;computer security	Security	-35.60415546778299	80.7767737580357	25360

The authors show how to combine these techniques into one scheme in such a way that information on who is excluded and when they are excluded is hidden under certain adversary models, and communication overhead is independent of the system dynamics. Thus, the scheme is well suited for the general cases where the maximum number of excluded users is unpredictable.	interpolation;lagrange polynomial	Lukasz Krzywiecki;Miroslaw Kutylowski;Maciej Nikodem	2008	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs:20070122	atomic broadcast;lagrange polynomial;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;mathematics;distributed computing;system dynamics;broadcasting;algorithm;computer network	Crypto	-41.6407885259446	76.25998298367759	25395

There have been many approaches that were proposed to detect stepping-stone since 1995. One of those approaches proposed by A. Blum detects stepping-stone by checking if the difference between the number of the send packets of an incoming connection and the one of an outgoing connection is bounded. One weakness of this method is in resisting intruders' evasion, such as chaff perturbation. In this paper, we propose a method based on random walk theory to detect stepping-stone intrusion. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method is more effective than Blum's approach in terms of resisting intruders' chaff perturbation.	algorithm;blum axioms;crazy stone (software);digital-to-analog converter;erdős–stone theorem;evasion (network security);internet protocol suite;network packet;perturbation theory;sensor;stepping level	Jianhua Yang;Byong Lee;Stephen S.

Android malware detection becomes a crucial task. In this paper, we present a permission-combination-based scheme for Android malware detection. The Android malware detection scheme is based on permission combinations declared in the application manifest file. We obtain the permission combinations that are requested frequently by malwares but rarely by benign applications. We generate rule sets based on the permission combinations. Our experimental results show that the malware detection rate is up to 96%, and the benign application recognition rate is up to 88%.

Protocols that support such kind of joint computation without complete sharing of information are called secure multiparty computation (SMC) protocols. Applying SMC protocols in image processing is a challenging problem. Most of the existing SMC protocols are implemented based on cryptographic primitives like oblivious transfer that are too computational intensive for pixel-based operations. In this paper, we develop two efficient SMC protocols for distributed linear image filtering between two parties, one party with the original image and the other with the image filter. The first protocol is based on a combination of rank reduction and random permutation. The second one uses random perturbation with the help of a non-colluding third party. Experimental results show that both of them execute significantly faster than oblivious-transfer based techniques.	composite image filter;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;distributed algorithm;image processing;information privacy;oblivious transfer;pixel;random permutation;secure multi-party computation	Nan Hu;Sen-Ching S.

A large U.S. health insurance provider had a major data breach, which resulted in the theft of more than 80 million patient and employee records. The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) currently does not require Electronic Personal Health Information (ePHI) to be encrypted, increasing the vulnerability of e-health information. This paper proposes a secure e-health network system architecture which will significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and data theft, with minimal additional cost or network delay. This architecture is reliant on the application client and ensures authorized access to health records through the use of a secure client and a 2-step authentication process. The proposed network design will reduce instances of compromised networks, phishing attacks, or unwanted remote access, while improving authenticity of credentials.	authentication;authorization;credential;data breach;data theft;encryption;health insurance portability and accountability act;network planning and design;phishing;systems architecture	Gabriel De Luca;Morgan Brattstrom;Patricia Morreale	2016	2016 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon)	10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490528	multi-factor authentication;business;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.37466719749387	62.7775333486057	25489

However, if we consider the scenario without the assumption, previously known bounds on key-entropy are not tight. In this paper, tighter lower bounds of A-codes with non-uniformly random secret keys are investigated and derived in terms of the Rényi entropy.	authentication;code;entropy (information theory);information-theoretic security;rényi entropy	Junji Shikata	2017	2017 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW)	10.1109/ITW.2017.8278016	theoretical computer science;discrete mathematics;rényi entropy;key (lock);computer science;authentication	Crypto	-37.219331950269705	76.91664753507375	25525

Constrained resources in mobile stations make it critical for nodes to be able to cooperate to enhance communication and computation capabilities. However, the wireless and dynamic nature of the links presents easy attack vectors for adversaries. The ability to securely discover and identify neighboring nodes (secure ND) is a fundamental building block for such networks. Even a relatively weak adversarial relay has the capability of distorting the network view and diverting significant amount of traffic. This can cause significant performance degradation. In this paper, we utilize the physical layer authentication scheme introduced by Yu, Baras and Sadler [1] to secure neighborhood discovery against adversarial relays. The proposed method incurs little performance overhead and requires no additional hardware. We provide analytical and simulation based performance evaluation of the security of our scheme.	authentication;computation;dictionary attack;distortion;elegant degradation;file spanning;hoc (programming language);norsk data;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;relay;simulation;ubiquitous computing	Shalabh Jain;John S.

The XOR Encryption algorithm is an example of a Symmetric Encryption algorithm. This means that the same key is used for both encryption and decryption [7]. In the case of XOR Encryption, this is true because XOR is a two-way function which means that the function can easily be undone [6]. In the following paper the standard XOR Encryption algorithm will be introduced along with a modification. The modification comes in the form of creating random permutations of the key.	cryptography;encryption;symmetric-key algorithm;xor	Zachary A.

By now, it is common practice to analyze cryptographic proposals not only informally, but also in a mathematically specified adversarial framework.As has been demonstrated repeatedly, the available theoretical machinery allows to develop efficient cryptographic schemes that come along with provable security guarantees helping to defeat a significant class of cryptanalytic threats. Not only for the design and analysis of “simple” cryptographic primitives like asymmetric encryption or non-interactive signature schemes, the use of mathematical techniques has become indispensable. Also for coping with “more complex” protocol tasks like group key establishment mathematical techniques have turned out to be of outstanding significance. This special issue aims at offering a small selection of research articles deploying different kinds of mathematical techniques in a cryptographic context. Clearly, the list of covered topics is far from being complete, and many mathematical topics relevant to the area are not represented at all. Nevertheless, we hope that this selection of articles of renowned experts in the field helps to illustrate the diversity of mathematical tools that are enriching cryptographic research by now. All contributions to this special issue have been invited and fully peer-reviewed. We are indebted to all the authors for kindly following our invitation and submitting their contributions to this special issue.

Compared with Micali and Rivest’s micropayment scheme, the improved scheme achieves three additional properties to ensure it suitable for mobile network. First it reduces the computing burden without digital signature algorithm, which is essential for limited mobile terminal. Second, the user, the merchant, and the bank are all equally involved in the selection of payable checks, which ensure the proposed scheme is fair for all parties. Moreover, the privacy of scheme is also achieved for the computational infeasibility of calculating the inverse of secure one-way function. The improved micropayment scheme is secure, fair, and efficient, and privacy-preserving, especially suitable for mobile network.

In this paper, we adapt the classical challenge-response method for authentication to the task of verifying an entity's location. Our scheme utilizes a collection of transmitters, and adapts the power allocations across these transmitters to verify a user's claimed location. This strategy, which we call a power-modulated challenge response, is able to be used with existing. wireless sensor networks. First, we propose a direct method, where some transmitters are selected to send ldquochallengesrdquo that the claimant node should be able to witness based on its claimed location, and for which the claimant node must correctly respond to in order to prove its location. Second, we reverse the strategy by presenting an indirect method, where some transmitters send challenges that the claimant node should not be able to witness. Then, we present a signal-strength-based method, where the node responds with its received signal strength and thereby provides improved location verification. To evaluate our schemes, we examine different adversarial models for the claimant, and characterize the performance of our power-modulated challenge response schemes under these adversarial models. Further, we propose a new localization attack, where a set of nodes collaborates to pretend that there is a node at the claimed location. This collusion attack can do tremendous harm to localization and the performance of the aforementined methods under collusion attack are explained. Finally, we propose the use of a rotational directional power-modulated challenge response, where directional antennas are used to defend against collusion attacks.	adversary (cryptography);challenge–response authentication;direct method in the calculus of variations;formal verification;modulation;transmitter	Yu Zhang;Zang Li;Wade Trappe	2008	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2008.919121	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;information security;directional antenna;computer security;computer network	Security	-51.04605577020097	74.96254287433231	25806

We define the security of AOS, present concrete AOS schemes, and prove their security under standard assumptions. In addition, we find that despite its simple definition, AOS is equivalent to Hierarchical Identity-based Signatures (HIBS) through efficient and security-preserving reductions. Finally, we show direct applications of AOS to problems in network security. Our investigations indicate that AOS is both useful in practical applications and worthy of further study as a cryptographic primitive.	append;concatenation;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;electronic signature;network security	Eike Kiltz;Anton Mityagin;Saurabh Panjwani;Barath Raghavan	2005		10.1007/11523468_36	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;automaton;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-40.58443557596386	76.86396865870073	25818
761f587c94ac27ba78f2bc2aca111ca2d97ca8ef	efficient searchable encryption through compression		In this work we design new searchable encryption schemes whose goal is to minimize the number of cryptographic operations required to retrieve the result—a dimension mostly overlooked by previous works, yet very important in practice. Our main idea is to utilize compression so as to reduce the size of the plaintext indexes before producing the encrypted searchable indices. Our solution can use any existing Searchable Encryption (SE) scheme as a black-box and any combination of lossless compression algorithms, without compromising security. The efficiency of our schemes varies based on the leakage exposed by the underlying application. For instance, for private keyword search (more leakage), we demonstrate up to 188× savings in search time, while for database search (less leakage) our savings are up to 62×. The power of our approach is better manifested when combined with more secure, yet less practical, cryptographic tools, such as Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM). In particular while ORAM is known to be prohibitively expensive for large-scale applications, we show that our compressfirst-ORAM-next approach allows significant more efficient index search time, reducing the time for executing a query with result of size more than one million tuples from approximately 21 hours to 20 minutes.

f096b47e16fcadae8476dac3086988d81b6998ce	data merging method by protecting energy in wireless sensor networks	wireless sensor network;energy efficiency	Privacy protecting is a direct manifestation of information confidentiality, such as the perception of the terminal location information. Data collection is an important information resource of things, and it is also one of the needs for protecting sensitive information. Privacy protecting has a significant role in application of the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). As a part of the Internet Technology, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can supply the privacy protecting in data merging. This paper presents a novel data merging method (DMM) by protecting energy in wireless sensor networks, which utilities properties of the data merging tree framework to depress communication overhead. It randomly allocates the time slices to nodes with the aim of avoiding impact, and limits the impacted range to loss resilience. Compared with the PDA algorithm, the experimental results show that DMM can protect data privacy and achieve accurate data merging results while getting the same epoch delay as tiny aggregation algorithm. It has small communication overhead. DMM uses datadependent fusion characteristics of the tree structure to eliminate PDA algorithm for unnecessary communication node so that the data transmission amount is reduced to about 52% of PDA in case of the same privacy protection security.	algorithm;confidentiality;digital molecular matter (dmm);fusion tree;information privacy;information sensitivity;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;randomness;tree structure	Fushun Wang;Bin Wang;Xiaohua Sun;Zhenjiang Cai	2014	JNW	10.4304/jnw.9.8.2245-2251	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science;efficient energy use;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-52.881713323491084	76.51547655264322	25869
e46b7e3534aad60748e7fc2c19cf46b7d1e387e1	lattice-based techniques for accountable anonymity: composition of abstract stern's protocols and weak prf with efficient protocols from lwr		In an accountable anonymous system, a user is guaranteed anonymity and unlinkability unless some well-defined condition is met. A line of research focus on schemes that do not rely on any trusted third party capable of deanonymising users. Notable examples include k-times anonymous authentication (k-TAA), blacklistable anonymous credentials (BLAC) and linkable ring signatures (LRS). All instances of these schemes are based on traditional number theoretic assumptions, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks. One common feature of these schemes is the need to limit the number of times a key can be (mis-)used. Traditionally, it is usually achieved through the use of a pseudorandom function (PRF) which maps a user’s key to a pseudonym, along with a proof of correctness. However, existing lattice-based PRFs do not interact well with zero-knowledge proofs. To bridge this gap, we propose and develop the following techniques and primitives: • We formalize the notion of weak PRF with efficient protocols, which allows a prover to convince a verifier that the function F is evaluated correctly. Specifically, we provide an efficient construction based on the learning with rounding problem, which uses abstract Stern’s Protocol to prove y = Fk(x) and y , Fk(x) without revealing x, y or k. • We develop a general framework, which we call extended abstract Stern’s protocol, to construct zero-knowledge arguments system for statements formed by conjunction and disjunction of sub-statements, who (or whose variants) are provable using abstract Stern’s Protocol. Specifically, our system supports arbitrary monotonic propositions and allows a prover to argue polynomial relationships of the witnesses used in these sub-statements. ⋆ This work was mainly done when doing the internship at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ⋆⋆ Corresponding author. ⋆ ⋆ ⋆ Corresponding author. † The second to the fifth authors are sorted in the alphabetical order. As many existing lattice-based primitives also admit proofs using abstract Stern’s protocol, our techniques can easily glue different primitives together for privacyenhancing applications in a simple and clean way. Indeed, we propose three new schemes, all of which are the first of its kind, in the lattice setting. They also enjoy additional advantages over instances of the number-theoretic counterpart. Our k-TAA and BLAC schemes support concurrent enrollment while our LRS features logarithmic signature size without relying on a trusted setup. Our techniques enrich the arsenal of privacy-enhancing techniques and could be useful in the constructions of other schemes such as e-cash, unique group signatures, public key encryption with verifiable decryption, etc.	antivirus software;authentication;correctness (computer science);digital credential;encryption;formal verification;group signature;lattice model (finance);map;polynomial;primitive recursive function;privacy;provable security;pseudorandom function family;pseudorandomness;public-key cryptography;recurrence relation;rounding;theory;trusted third party;zero-knowledge proof	Rupeng Yang;Man Ho Au;Junzuo Lai;Qiuliang Xu;Zuoxia Yu	2017	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer network;anonymity;lattice (order);computer security;stern;computer science	Security	-38.59550692254855	75.86320189979932	25911

P2P networks are advantageous with respect to reliability and scalability. However, securing DHTs against adversary nodes which intentionally interrupt functionality of the network remains a major research problem. In particular, even if a trusted enrollment server is used for secure identifier assignment of participating nodes, attacks on overlay routing by malicious nodes that have successfully joined the network can still severely degrade the lookup service of the DHT. To gain insight into the ability of callers to reach callees during such attacks on DHT-routing, we present the first P2PSIP implementation that enables to emulate adversary nodes as well as the injection of a large amount of lookup requests (i.e., SIP- Invite requests) in an automated way. Further, we implemented several secure DHT routing algorithms and investigated their effect on the success rate of lookups and the maximum call-setup time in an infiltrated P2PSIP network. In general, our system provides the ability to analyze attacker behavior as well as future novel security techniques in an actual P2PSIP environment with comparably low effort.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;denial-of-service attack;distributed hash table;emulator;flip-flop (electronics);identifier;interrupt;lookup table;peer-to-peer sip;routing;scalability;server (computing)	Jan Seedorf;Frank Ruwolt;Martin Stiemerling;Saverio Niccolini	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.422	availability;routing;telecommunications;computer science;information security;operating system;voice over ip;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-57.36685408841026	69.30199606255962	26029

I.e. they are simulatable secure with an unlimited adversary, an unlimited simulator and an unlimited environment machine.

Authorizedgroup users may read and contribute new objects to the group.An important usability objective in g-SIS is to allow users to access group objects offline without havingto contact a server every time an access is requested. Thus a fundamental requirement forg-SIS is that protection needs to extend to clients. Henceforthwe assume that a Trusted Reference Monitor (TRM) is present on the client platforms that can enforcethe group policies in a trustworthy manner. In this paper,we discuss three different approaches for realizing a scalable and high-assurance g-SIS.In a Micro-Distribution (MD) architecture, objects are individually encrypted for eachgroup user. Thus the server shares a unique key with each user.In a Super-Distribution (SD) architecture, a single key is shared amongst all group users andthus group objects are uniformly encrypted. SD promotes ``protect once, access when authorized''.We discuss the pros and cons of both MD and SD architecture and proposea novel split-key RSA based hybrid architecture. As we will see, this architectureincorporates the high-assurance aspect from MDand the usability and scalability advantages from SD approach respectively.	authorization;encryption;federal enterprise architecture;group policy;molecular dynamics;online and offline;reference monitor;scalability;server (computing);unique key;usability	Ram Krishnan;Ravi S.

This paper provides a systematic study on how these two work together. We examined 20 popular CDN providers and 10,721 of their customer web sites using HTTPS. Our study reveals various problems with the current HTTPS practice adopted by CDN providers, such as widespread use of invalid certificates, private key sharing, neglected revocation of stale certificates, and insecure back-end communication. While some of those problems are operational issues only, others are rooted in the fundamental semantic conflict between the end-to-end nature of HTTPS and the man-in-the-middle nature of CDN involving multiple parties in a delegated service. To address the delegation problem when HTTPS meets CDN, we proposed and implemented a lightweight solution based on DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities), an emerging IETF protocol complementing the current Web PKI model. Our implementation demonstrates that it is feasible for HTTPS to work with CDN securely and efficiently. This paper intends to provide a context for future discussion within security and CDN community on more preferable solutions.	bernhard schölkopf;content delivery network;dns-based authentication of named entities;diffie–hellman key exchange;end-to-end principle;entity;https;hypertext transfer protocol;man-in-the-middle attack;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;software deployment;steiner tree problem;tao framework	Jinjin Liang;Jian Jiang;Hai-Xin Duan;Kang Li;Tao Wan;Jianping Wu	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy	10.1109/SP.2014.12	hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer;computer science;network security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-47.41078907180113	70.58913730676579	26165

With the proliferation and sophistication of information services, data mining, and search engines, a simple network address may be used to reveal a great deal of information about a user, including location, identity, and behavior. Existing approaches to privacy, however, make unacceptable tradeoffs between performance and anonymity. For example, Tor [5] attempts to provide strong anonymity by withholding trust from third-party relays. We believe an acceptable level of privacy can be provided to most users, with noticeably lower latency and throughput impact, by working with the network provider. In this paper, we introduce AnonyFlow, an in-network anonymization service designed to efficiently and seamlessly provide privacy to users as they communicate with other endpoints and services. We design, implement, and evaluate an OpenFlow-based prototype of AnonyFlow that achieves endpoint anonymity without compromising on throughput or latency.	communication endpoint;data mining;internet;network address;openflow;privacy;prototype;relay;throughput;tor messenger;web search engine	Marc Mendonca;Srini Seetharaman;Katia Obraczka	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364931	privacy software;the internet;information privacy;computer science;telecommunications service;internet privacy;world wide web;information system;search engine;computer network	Networks	-54.71437158345276	66.92372908930396	26194
21077675f5fc2345d89d89d148487255863d1c2b	identity based security for authentication and mobility in future id oriented networks		This paper firstly reviews the paradigm of identity locator split, which smoothly solves the problem of overloaded semantics of IP address and is regarded as the evolution direction for future networks. Based on this paradigm, the framework of ID Oriented Networking (ION) with a few essential components for security enhancements is then introduced, which serves as the overall architectural foundation of the proposed scheme. Subsequently, the basics of Identity Based Signature (IBS) are briefly described, which is followed by the detailed implementations of our proposal for achieving securer authentication during node mobility. Afterwards, a few evaluation results and analysis are presented to show the feasibility and potential advantages of our proposal, along with the cost to pay for gaining these advantages. In particular, the proposal covers main processes for enabling secure authentication in mobility under ION framework, which includes AAA-based distribution of ID relevant security parameters, ID-based key negotiation and authentication for mapping information query and update, authentication of binding update and session key negotiation, handover process between two attachment points. In addition, some generalized applications are presented as well, with the requirements of simultaneously enhanced security in authentication and native support for fast mobility in future networks.	aaa (video game industry);attachments;authentication;identifier;identity verification service;identity-based security;online locator service;programming paradigm;requirement;session key;smoothing;symmetric-key algorithm	Rongfei Wan;Bin Da;Richard Li;Chuang Wang;Hongpei Li	2018	2018 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2018.8343149	implementation;computer network;handover;public-key cryptography;semantics;identity-based security;session key;computer science;distributed computing;authentication;negotiation	Mobile	-48.55390650718767	72.2581087587076	26221

These activities are often performed through shell companies that masquerade as real companies but where actual the purpose is to launder money. Shell companies are used in all the three phases of money laundering, namely, placement, layering, and integration, often simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to identify shell companies. We propose to use only bank transactions since that is easily available. In particular, we look at all incoming and outgoing transactions from a particular bank account along with its various attributes, and use anomaly detection techniques to identify the accounts that pertain to shell companies. Our aim is to create an initial list of potential shell company candidates which can be investigated by financial experts later. Due to lack of real data, we propose a banking transactions simulator (BTS) to simulate both honest as well as shell company transactions by studying a host of actual real-world fraud cases. We apply anomaly detection algorithms to detect candidate shell companies. Results indicate that we are able to identify the shell companies with a high degree of precision and recall.1	algorithm;anomaly detection;broadcast television systems inc.;dummy variable (statistics);money;precision and recall;simulation	Devendra Kumar Luna;Girish Keshav Palshikar;Manoj Apte;Arnab Bhattacharya	2018		10.1145/3152494.3152519	data mining;money laundering;precision and recall;anomaly detection;business	Security	-58.31823529629534	62.132422594709205	26304

Privacy preservation provides one of the key role from security perspective in an electronic healthcare data security. Due to continuously emerging threats, a comprehensive security framework that should provide strong patient anonymity level (considering both patient’s identity and patient’s data), anonymized data searching and successful correlation of PHR for medical research is difficult to formulize. In this paper, some previous security frameworks were analyzed and their flaws were identified. Also it proposed an enhancement to the existing solutions based on a careful analysis of their shortcomings.	case preservation;data anonymization;data security;privacy;vii	Adeel Shah;Haider Abbas;Waseem Iqbal;Rabia Latif	2018	2018 14th International Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450306	anonymity;medical research;computer security;computer network;encryption;emerging technologies;health care;data security;information privacy;computer science	Security	-44.6652738327017	63.074337632840994	26309

Thus, we introduced a system that will ensure anonymity for all users, while maintaining the ability to break the anonymity of a sender in case of misconduct. The revocation of the anonymity will require the use of secret sharing schemes, since we assume that, the lifting of the anonymity of the dishonest user should not depend on a single entity, but on a consensus within the network. In addition to the revocation of the anonymity, we propose in this paper further improvements such as mixing Tor traffic with those of the major internet groups, using the camouflage, or introducing a honeypot in the network.	honeypot (computing);lambda lifting;relay;secret sharing;tor messenger	Amadou Moctar Kane	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		the internet;anonymity;computer security;honeypot;revocation;business;misconduct;communication source;secret sharing	Security	-42.92595437010871	72.26844161598352	26477
549a431d1287148e420427cca76e55fd7dcfdc3f	new extensions of pairing-based signatures into universal (multi) designated verifier signatures	security analysis;pairing based cryptography;designated verifier signature	The concept of universal designated verifier signatures was introduced by Steinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures can be used as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional functionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature to any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message was indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We propose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our first scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be analyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery assuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the knowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle model, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained computation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are pairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user setting proposed by Desmedt in 2003.	asiacrypt;bilinear filtering;computation;designated verifier signature;diffie–hellman problem;digital signature;electronic signature;formal verification;multi-user;pairing-based cryptography;random oracle	Damien Vergnaud	2009	Int.

e4f0fddb44f874cb86b224225ea9bca630b7f529	a pairing-based cryptographic approach for data security in the cloud	cloud storage;attribute-based encryption;short signatures;pairings	This paper presents AES4SeC, a security scheme fully constructed over cryptographic pairings. The main building blocks of AES4SeC are attribute-based encryption (ABE) and short signatures (SSign), with generalized constructions for the Type 3 pairing. AES4SeC was developed as an end-to-end storage service for hybrid cloud models and integrated to a file-sharing application for scenarios where data owners upload content to the cloud and selectively decide who is able to access that content. An experimental evaluation of AES4SeC was conducted by testing different security levels, recommended key sizes, and cryptographic engine constructions. This led to a wide experimental evaluation in terms of the running times of the primitive operations (encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify) and the space complexity of the ciphertexts, private and public keys, and the signatures. The implementation results revealed the feasibility and flexibility of AES4SeC in real scenarios, whereas a fine-tuning evaluation revealed that the best results in terms of performance and memory requirements are obtained using Type 3 pairings over type F elliptic curves. This is a relevant result because most of the ABE and SSign schemes in the literature are provided for the Type 1 pairing (symmetric) over type A curves, which exhibited poorer results.	antivirus software;attribute-based encryption;chomsky hierarchy;cloud computing;cryptography;dspace;data security;end-to-end principle;file sharing;key size;requirement;type signature;upload	Miguel Morales-Sandoval;José Luis González;Arturo Diaz-Perez;Víctor Jesús Sosa Sosa	2017	International Journal of Information Security	10.1007/s10207-017-0375-z	computer security;cloud storage;theoretical computer science;cryptography;public-key cryptography;cloud computing;data security;computer science;encryption;attribute-based encryption;pairing	Security	-40.79150843398057	69.09028610958177	26579

However, static route selection offers a significant advantage for adversaries to eavesdrop, or launch DoS attacks on certain network flows. Previous works on multipath routing in wireless networks propose using random forwarding to avoid jamming and blackhole attacks [18]. However, this work is far from being practical for wired network because of many topological and QoS constraints. Moreover, the potential of finding a significant number of disjoint paths in wired networks is extremely low, which consequently decreases the value of RRM. In this paper we present a proactive Random Route Mutation (RRM) technique that enables changing randomly the route of the multiple flows in a network simultaneously to defend against reconnaissance, eavesdrop and DoS attacks, while preserving end-to-end QoS properties. Our contributions in this paper are three-fold: (1) modeling RRM as a constraint satisfaction problem using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to identify efficient practical route mutations, (2) proposing a new overlay placement technique that can maximize the effectiveness of RRM in visualized networks, and (3) developing analytical and experimental models to measure the effectiveness of RRM under different adversary models and network parameters. We develop a prototype RRM implementation in Software Defined Networks (SDNs). Our analysis, simulation and preliminary implementation show that RRM can protect at least 90% of the packet flow from being attacked against realistic attackers, as compared with static routes. Our evaluation study also shows that RRM can be efficiently deployed on both conventional networks and SDNs without causing any significant disruption for active flows.	adversary (cryptography);communications protocol;computer performance;constraint satisfaction problem;dos;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end encryption;game theory;immutable object;multipath routing;network packet;prototype;quality of service;radio jamming;radio resource management;randomness;real-time transcription;satisfiability modulo theories;simulation;software-defined networking;traffic flow (computer networking)	Qi Duan;Ehab Al-Shaer;Jafar Haadi Jafarian	2013	2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2013.6682715	routing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;network security;software-defined radio;network simulation;distributed computing;computability;computer security;computer network	Networks	-56.7105514218812	70.92023750170411	26660

However, despite all the efforts undertaken, there seems to have been no previous systematic look at the growing problem of key exchange over combined wired and wireless networks which consist of both stationary computers with sufficient computational capabilities and mobile devices with relatively restricted computing resources. In this paper, we present the first group key exchange protocol that is specifically designed to be well suited for this rapidly expanding network environment.

8aa8dcc815d4b8d9dd8fa87c4d155386385a64ef	on providing automatic parental consent over information collection from children.		Children’s privacy has become critical with the increasing use of the Internet for commercial purposes and corresponding increase in requests for information. 65% of children between the ages of 10 and 13 use the Internet for casual web surfing, chatting, games, schoolwork, e-mail, interactive learning, and other applications. Often, websites hosting these activities ask for personal information such as name, e-mail, street address, and phone number. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 was enacted in reaction to the widespread collection of information from children and subsequent abuses identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). COPPA is aimed at protecting a child’s privacy by requiring parental consent before collecting information from children under 13. In this paper, we describe an automated tool for protecting child privacy called Parental Online Consent for Kids Electronic Transaction (or POCKET). The POCKET framework is a novel, technically feasible and legally sound solution to automatically enforce COPPA. Parents answer a simple questionnaire regarding their privacy requirements and the POCKET user agent automatically converts it into a privacy preferences file. These preferences are enforced when a child uses the Internet. Only websites that adhere to the preferences can receive the child’s information, while websites whose policies do not match are blocked. A merchant-specific privacy information package and a signed digital agreement are uploaded to the qualified merchant from the client (child’s machine). POCKET framework incorporates a secure handshake protocol to protect the data exchange between the client and the merchant. A local log file created by POCKET and the digital agreement are used to enforce merchant accountability.	email;formal verification;internet;mock object;p3p;personally identifiable information;privacy;prototype;requirement;server (computing);telephone number;upload;user agent;world wide web	Karthik Channakeshava;Kaigui Bian;Michael S.

Although a significant effort has been made by the research community to develop defense techniques against security attacks, less focus has been given to manage security configuration efficiently. Network security devices, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, honeypot as well as vulnerability scanner, operate as a stand-alone system for solving a particular security problem. Yet these devices are not necessarily independent. The focus of this work is encompassing a security infrastructure where multiple security devices form a global security layer. Each component is defined with respect to the others and interacts dynamically and automatically with the different security devices in order to choose the best solution to be launched to prevent the final malicious objective. Our solution aims at solving, at the same time, the need for active defence, speed, reliability, accuracy and usability of the network.	authentication;countermeasure (computer);firewall (computing);honeypot (computing);internet;intrusion detection system;network address translation;network security;network traffic control;pervasive informatics;real-time computing;secure communication;traffic analysis;usability;vulnerability scanner	Sourour Meharouech;Adel Bouhoula;Tarek Abbes	2009	International Journal of Information Security	10.1007/s10207-009-0077-2	software security assurance;computer security model;intrusion detection system;cloud computing security;countermeasure;security through obscurity;heterogeneous network;security information and event management;security association;security engineering;security convergence;covert channel;asset;computer science;technology management;logical security;network security;human-computer interaction in information security;internet security;security service;internet privacy;security testing;network access control;network security policy;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.36986289999835	70.11143191557088	26815

4fe4ed143de5beea14a7166f1748c7f253566bd6	tlssem: a tls security-enhanced mechanism against mitm attacks in public wifis		The widely used TLS protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks in public WiFis. Such attacks arise since most users are often unable to verify server certificates properly and even worse, the implement of client authentication is typically decoupled from TLS session establishment. These two authentication procedures could be bound cryptographically in the establishment of TLS sessions, and a TLS security-enhanced mechanism (TLSsem) is proposed to detect and defense MITM attacks in public WiFis. TLSsem deals with the TLS mutual authentication through a way that combines pre-binding with certificate validation. Servers take advantage of pre-binding to generate identity credentials for users as pre-shared keys. Afterwards, the mutual authentication between clients and servers is realized in certificate validation by using the identity credentials, and also the forged server certificate is detected on the server side by checking this certificate. In addition, to ensure the reliability of wireless communications in this malicious public WiFis, an TLS shared service based on random port hopping is implemented to reallocate the reliable ports for data transmission against the interception by MITM attackers. We implement a prototype and verify its effectiveness by a thorough set of experiments in the real network environment. Evaluation results show that our mechanism can significantly increase the security of TLS communication in public WiFis without introducing noticeable overhead.	credential;experiment;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication;overhead (computing);prelink;protection mechanism;prototype;public key certificate;server (computing);server-side;transport layer security	Wei Yang;Xiaohong Li;Zhiyong Feng;Jianye Hao	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS)	10.1109/ICECCS.2017.24	certificate;server-side;real-time computing;port (computer networking);data transmission;mutual authentication;man-in-the-middle attack;computer network;computer science;server;authentication	Security	-55.12239305557462	69.27787232733537	26965
01428c98750ff0eee0eee2dd8dae6ee0567be383	cnfd: a novel scheme to detect colluded non-technical loss fraud in smart grid		We newly discovered a potential fraud in Smart Grid, called colluded non-technical loss fraud. Different from the traditional non-technical loss frauds where there is only one independent adversary, a colluded non-technical loss fraud happens when a smart meter is tampered by one or more co-existing or collaborating adversaries. The behavior of one adversary may be covered by others and cannot be detected easily by the traditional detection methods. We propose Colluded Non-Technical Loss Fraud Detection (CNFD), a scheme to detect colluded non-technical loss frauds in Smart Gird. CNFD adopts recursive least squares to identify a tampered meter and then to differentiate adversaries based on their mathematical features. Experimental results show that CNFD can detect colluded non-technical loss frauds and can differentiate different adversaries on the same meter.

Our construction is based on a new framework for realizing an IBE trapdoor from pairing-based groups, which is motivated from the `two equation' revocation technique suggested by Lewko et al. (IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2010). The new framework enables our IBE system to achieve a tight security reduction to the Decisional Bilinear Diffie---Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. Due to its the tightness, our system can take as input the shorter size of security parameters than the previous practical BF, SK, and $$\hbox {BB}_{1}$$BB1 systems, which provides better efficiency to our system in terms of computational cost.	provable security;random oracle	Jong Hwan Park;Dong Hoon Lee	2016	Des.

It contains a new scheme of generation of invertible key dependent binary Global Encoding Matrix (GEM) with a complexity, a memory consumption and a decoding delay lower than the traditional $RLNC$.

Furthermore, theoretical and numerical results reveal that the proposed methods give an effectiveness of coding and a higher level of security compared to many recent works in this field.	authentication;computation;confidentiality;cryptography;integer (computer science);linear network coding;mobile device;mobile phone;network packet;numerical analysis;point of view (computer hardware company);requirement;secure coding;sensor;throughput	Hassan Noura;Steven Martin;Khaldoun Al Agha	2013	2013 22nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2013.6614088	linear network coding;telecommunications;variable-length code;computer science;theoretical computer science;authorization;computer security;finite field;computer network	Mobile	-49.714998276666506	75.44514401143134	27015
24193bd89089c5160acf89d3653dc69b2db3f45e	detection of smartphone malware		Due to technological progress, mobile phones evolved into technically and functionally sophisticated devices called smartphones. Providing comprehensive capabilities, smartphones are getting increasingly popular not only for the targeted users but all. Since 2004, several malwares appeared targeting these devices. General countermeasures to smartphone malwares are currently limited to signature-based anti-virus scanners which efficiently detect known malwares, but they have serious shortcomings with new and unknown malwares creating a window of opportunity for attackers. As smartphones become a host for sensitive data and applications, extended malware detection mechanisms not basing on signatures are necessary complying with the resource constraints of current mobile devices. In this work, we tackle the field of smartphone malware. We give a clear definition on what a smartphone actually is since an industry standard does not exist. For understanding the threat of malwares targeting smartphones, we present an updated list including all published malwares that were recognized by anti-virus companies until the end of 2010. We introduce the fields of dynamic and static analysis. In the field of dynamic analysis, a monitoring system is introduced gathering behaviorand system-based information that are processed by a remote system using machine learning for anomaly detection. Furthermore, a monitoring and detection architecture for Linux-based smartphones is presented which is used to trace execution of binaries for extracting invoked system calls. In the field of static analysis, we discuss its applicability to the domain of different smartphone platforms, namely Symbian OS and Android.

So far, many multicast key management schemes have been proposed. In 1999, Balenson, McGrew, and Sherman proposed an efficient multicast key management scheme, the BMS scheme, based on one-way function trees. The number of broadcasts for a key updating operation is roughly proportional to the logarithm of group size. Recently, Horng showed that the BMS scheme is vulnerable to the collusion attack under a certain situation. In this paper, we further analyze the necessary conditions for mounting a collusion attack on the BMS scheme. Additionally, we describe an improved version of the BMS scheme. The improved scheme ensures none of the evictee and the new member can collude to get the group key that they should not know without incurring much additional computational overhead to the system.

7c5568199fa08c1e68895824fa41b633d2fa6d9d	a network topology discovery tool for android smart phones		Abstract   Android has invaded the majority of the smartphone market. Many developers in this domain are building up applications and addressing many problems. In this paper, we present Topology Discovery Algorithm (TDA) to discover nodes and the topology of the network for the Android Platform. The algorithm is based on Net Inventory System which is used to quickly discover the network topology without generating unnecessary traffic. To speed up the topology discovery process, we used multi-threading; thus, multiple threads run in parallel and handle all the network discovery queries.	android;network topology;smartphone	Bilal Saeed;Tarek R.

With huge amount of data shared with the cloud computing platform, i.e. Amazon S3, GFS, Apache Hadoop etc, the risk of damage is increasing at the same time. Equivocation is a powerful tool that malicious nodes can use to poison the states of honest nodes and escape punishment. Accountability which makes the system actions verifiable has become the first-class citizen in distributed system design. Tamper-evidence logging is a useful utility to construct accountable system, and is used in different self-certify systems. In this paper, we present Index Tree which is a utility for tamper-evidence logging construction. Index Tree supports efficient proof generation and verification and its proof size is much smaller which is convenient to exchange among distributed nodes. Experiments show Index Tree has advantages in proof size, proof generation and verification compared with AASL.	amazon simple storage service;apache hadoop;append;cloud computing;data integrity;distributed computing;first-class citizen;formal verification;google file system;node (computer science);systems design;x-tree	Yanwen Bao;Yongjian Wang;Zhongzhi Luan;Xiang Pei;Depei Qian	2010	2010 IEEE 12th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC)	10.1109/HPCC.2010.41	parallel computing;the internet;merkle tree;data structure;cloud computing;formal verification;computer science;operating system;equivocation;data integrity;database;distributed computing;tree;programming language;computer security;server;computer network	DB	-42.365941014108806	69.35882729812954	27318

Sharing provenance brings numerous benefits, but may also disclose sensitive information, such as secret processes of synthesizing chemical substances, confidential business practices and private details about social media participants' lives. In this paper, we study privacy-preserving provenance workflow publication using differential privacy. We adapt techniques designed for sanitization of multi-dimensional spatial data to the problem of provenance workflows. Experimental results show that such an approach is feasible to protect provenance workflows, while at the same time retaining a significant amount of utility for queries. In addition, we identify influential factors and trade-offs that emerge when sanitizing provenance workflows.	computation;confidentiality;differential privacy;grams;information sensitivity;multi-level governance;n-gram;sanitization (classified information);social media	Mihai Maruseac;Gabriel Ghinita;Razvan Rughinis	2014		10.1145/2557547.2557586	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-41.562759100562054	62.89051225223321	27403

It is data plausibility, which is not addressed in any standard that comprises the WAVE framework. In particular, an attacker may forge false position values in safety beacons in order to cause unsafe response from startled receiving vehicles. The data plausibility is a longstanding issue for which various approaches based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis and communication constraints have been proposed. However, none of these completely solve the problem.	false position method;forge;plausibility structure;sensor web;type safety	Yongtae Park;Seungho Kuk	2017		10.1145/3081333.3089300	wireless;computer science;forge;computer security;government;sensor fusion	Mobile	-52.87012673077625	72.19866798592261	27411

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.	algorithm;brute-force attack;byte;data logger;dictionary attack;heart rate variability;internet backbone;intrusion detection system;login;network traffic control;spatial variability;traffic analysis	Mattijs Jonker;Rick Hofstede;Anna Sperotto;Aiko Pras	2015	2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM)	10.1109/INM.2015.7140301	intrusion detection system;payload;host-based intrusion detection system;network traffic control;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;law;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Metrics	-60.40747174394062	66.6837499696364	27434

In this paper, we take another look at the YAK protocol and the HMQV protocols and present some extended analysis. Motivated by our analysis, we reflect on the security properties that are desired by two-party key establishment protocols, and their formalizations. In particular, we take into account the interface between a key establishment protocol and the applications which may invoke it, and emphasize the concept of session and the usage of session identifier. Moreover, we show how to design a two-party key establishment protocol to achieve both key authentication and entity authentication properties in our security model.	adversary (cryptography);archive;code (cryptography);cryptography;cyclic redundancy check;diffie–hellman key exchange;diffie–hellman problem;digital signature;encryption;ephemeral key;family computer disk system;financial cryptography;handbook;ieee p1363;identifier;key authentication;key exchange;key management;key-agreement protocol;lecture notes in computer science;needham–schroeder protocol;password;privilege (computing);public-key cryptography;session id;spectral leakage;springer (tank);yak (cryptography)	Qiang Tang	2010	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer science	Security	-42.73687495486916	76.22522334475444	27462
0a941183fd8ed2ccfbc2ac644cce0eeb3237d4eb	analysis of key management protocols for social networks		Key management protocols play a major role in achieving data privacy in social networks because of the frequent addition and removal of users. Considering this, a remote storage service-key management protocol (RSS-KMP) is proposed in this paper and analysed the performance with respect to client addition and removal. RSS-KMP uses two keys, group key and content encryption/decryption key. Content decryption key will be encrypted using the group key and kept in social network service provider’s storage. Group key will be distributed to the clients or stored in the social network service provider storage securely. Each client gets or receives the group key to get the data decryption key further to decrypt data. To achieve re-key distribution efficiency, clients are grouped according to their nature of relationship and relationship trust levels. This paper also categorizes the social network items into sensitive and non-sensitive to give an idea to clients about items privacy requirement. Finally, paper analysed existing key management protocols and the proposed RSS-KMP with respect to storage, message and encryption to show the proposed protocol efficiency.	cryptography;encryption;group key;information privacy;internet security association and key management protocol;key distribution;network service provider;rss;social network;trust metric	S.

If this approach was suitable when people had only a few games (like Snake or Tetris) installed on their mobile phones, the current situation is different. A survey from Google in 2013 showed that, on average, US users have installed 33 applications on their Android smartphones. As a result, these users must manage hundreds of permissions to protect their privacy. Scalability of IBAC is a well-known issue and many more advanced access control models have introduced abstractions to cope with this problem. However, such models are more complex to handle by non-technical users. Thus, we present a permission management system for Android devices that 1) learns users' privacy preferences, 2) proposes them abstract authorization rules, and 3) provides advanced features to manage these high-level rules. We prove this approach is more efficient than current permission management system by comparing it to Privacy Guard Manager.	access control;android;authorization;high- and low-level;interaction;mobile device;mobile phone;recommender system;smartphone	Arnaud Oglaza;Romain Laborde;Abdelmalek Benzekri;François Barrère	2016	2016 11th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES)	10.1109/ARES.2016.54	engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-44.97003555292562	60.710619826286305	27668

The last-matching rules are those rules that are located at the bottom of the ruleset of a firewall’s security policy, and would require the most processing time by the firewall. If these rules are discovered, an attacker can potentially launch an effective low-rate DoS attack to trigger worst-case or near worst-case processing, thereby overwhelming the firewall and bringing it to its knees. In this paper, we present a probing technique to remotely discover the last-matching rules of a firewall. We study experimentally the effectiveness of this probing technique taking into account important factors such as the firewall’s motherboard architecture and load conditions at network links and hosts. In addition we examine the impact of launching a low-rate DoS attack on a firewall’s performance. The performance is studied in terms of the firewall’s CPU utilization and throughput, packet loss, and latency.

74e2e7a506a96bc5001a44d54aaa86026c0e195a	epidemic model of algorithm-enhanced dedicated virus through networks		Wi-Fi networks almost cover all active areas around us and, especially in some densely populated regions, Wi-Fi signals are strongly overlapped. The broad and overlapped coverage brings much convenience at the cost of great security risks. Conventionally, a worm virus can infect a router and then attack other routers within its signal coverage. Nowadays, artificial intelligence enables us to solve problems efficiently from available data via computer algorithm. In this paper, we endow the virus with some abilities and present a dedicated worm virus which can pick susceptible routers with kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithm as the attacking tasks automatically. This virus can also attack lower-encryption-level routers first and acquire fast-growing numbers of infected routers on the initial stage. We simulate an epidemic behavior in the collected spatial coordinate of routers in a typical area in Beijing City, where % routers are infected in hours. This dramatical defeat benefits from the correct infection seed selection and a low-encryption-level priority. This work provides a framework for a computer-algorithm-enhanced virus exploration and gives some insights on offence and defence to both hackers and computer users.	algorithm	Yi-Hong Du;Shi-Hua Liu	2018	Security and Communication Networks	10.1155/2018/4691203	computer science;computer network;hacker;virus;kernel density estimation;algorithm;router;epidemic model	Crypto	-56.291075636334696	75.52015512319925	27723

In this paper, we apply differential fault analysis on SHACAL-1 in a synthetic approach. We introduce the random word fault model, present some theoretical arguments, and give an efficient fault attack based on the characteristic of the cipher. Both theoretical predications and experimental results demonstrate that, 72 random faults are needed to obtain 512 bits key with successful probability more than 60%, while 120 random faults are enough to obtain 512 bits key with successful probability more than 99%.	cipher;confusion and diffusion;differential fault analysis;exclusive or;existential quantification;fault (technology);fault model;feistel cipher;hash function;nessie;paging;requirement;sha-1;synthetic intelligence;unbalanced circuit	Ruilin Li;Chunsheng Li;Chunye Gong	2009	2009 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC)	10.1109/FDTC.2009.41	computer science;stuck-at fault;theoretical computer science;fault model;distributed computing;computer security	Crypto	-37.96324556904208	81.54517055681325	27906

Generally speaking, physical attacks in sensor networks can be classified into two types: blind physical attacks and search-based physical attacks. In blind attacks, sensors are destroyed using brute-force approaches (like bombs/grenades etc.). The advantage here is the rapidness in destroying sensors. The downside however, is the fact that the deployment field also suffers significant casualties. If the attacker wishes to preserve the deployment field, the attacker will conduct search-based attacks by searching for sensors in the field and destroying only the sensors. While this preserves the deployment field, the attack process is slow. In this paper, we present policy-driven physical attacks, where the bias between the twin objectives of the attacker (rapidly destroying sensors, and preserving the deployment field) is modeled as a policy for the attacker. In policy-driven physical attacks, the attacker walks through the sensor network deployment field using signal detecting equipment to locate active sensors. Depending on the attacker's policy, the attacker takes different actions during the attack process.

For secure communication among sensors, secret keys must be established between them. Random key predistribution and pairwise key establishment schemes have been proposed for key management in large-scale sensor networks. In these schemes, after being deployed, sensors set up pairwise keys via preinstalled keys. The key establishment schemes are vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, i.e., packet dropping or altering. To counter these attacks, we propose a Byzantine resilient multi-path key establishment scheme that uses the Reed-Solomon error-correct coding scheme to improve resilience to Byzantine attacks. Our proposed scheme can tolerate at most t faulty key paths, where t - (n - k)/2 when (n,k) Reed-Solomon error-correct coding scheme is used. In addition, by using the Reed-Solomon coding scheme, sensors can identify the faulty paths with minimal communication overhead.	c11 (c standard revision);code (cryptography);code word;folded reed–solomon code;forney algorithm;forward error correction;grammatical framework;international parallel and distributed processing symposium;key (cryptography);key exchange;key management;network packet;overhead (computing);parity bit;polynomial;reed–solomon error correction;replay attack;secure communication;sensor	Dijiang Huang;Deep Medhi	2005	19th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	10.1109/IPDPS.2005.1	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;quantum byzantine agreement;key distribution;computer security;reed–solomon error correction;psychological resilience;computer network	Mobile	-50.545101033271344	77.4329003450125	27973

The task of keeping the communication system operable is highly critical due to the configuration complexity and the need for manual administration. Autonomous configuration mechanisms offer a compelling solution for the communication problem. We present an architecture for the autonomous configuration of secure, layer independent, end-to-end connections in this paper. The Extensible Security Adaptation Framework (Esaf) separates the particularities of communication setups strictly from the communication usage by the applications. Applications are unaware of the utilized security mechanisms and the complex configuration thereof. Protocols and security primitives can be easily introduced into the system whereas others might be disabled due to vulnerabilities without the need to modify existing programs. Moreover the setup can adapt to changing environments dynamically during runtime.	autonomic computing	Andreas Klenk;Heiko Niedermayer;Marcus Masekowsky;Georg Carle	2006	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/BF03219881	ground;embedded system;simulation;vulnerability;computer science;engineering;autonomous system;middleware;computer security;systems architecture	Crypto	-34.302318495265645	60.72143569221619	28005

There are some different works that have been devoted to the problems of cryptography/cryptology. Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving secret messages. With the widespread use of information technologies and the rise of digital computer networks in many areas of the world, securing the exchange of information has become a crucial task. Currently, very active research is being done with electronic or communication applications. In the present paper an innovative technique for data encryption is proposed based on the random sequence generation using the recurrence matrices and a quadruple vector. The new algorithm provides data encryption at two levels and hence security against crypto analysis is achieved at relatively low computational overhead.	algorithm;coding theory;computer;encryption;overhead (computing);quadruple-precision floating-point format;random number generation;recurrence relation	Akkapeddi Chandra Sekhar;K.

For example, such schemes should provide user-friendly features that allow group members to be conveniently added or removed, privileges of group members to be assigned or revoked by authorized parties (e.g. group leaders), organizing of members into one or more sub-groups, forming of (multiple) hierarchical layers, etc. Specifically, privileges should be self-defined by group leaders, and access control can be carried out by group leaders as a proxy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight tree-based model designed to achieve selfdefined, proxy-enabled and group-oriented access control (hereafter referred to as SeGoAC) for file storage access control in mobile cloud computing. SoGoAC is a flexible access control model that supports group access control, self-authorization and self-management iteratively, flexible self-defined accessing policies, user friendly features to grant and revoke privileges. We then demonstrate the utility of SeGoAC via extensive analysis.

abf21088ff665302c7e202c260aa6f879fc9d82f	a biometric security scheme for wireless body area networks		Abstract Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are receiving significant interest as the next generation of wireless networks and emerging technology in the field of health monitoring. One of the most important factors for the acceptance of WBANs is the provision of appropriate security and access control mechanisms. Due to its nature in transferring the patientsu0027 sensitive data, WBAN has both classical and specific security requirements. In this paper, we survey such requirements and propose a new security scheme for satisfying them in WBANs. The proposed scheme deals with the overall network architecture, including intra- and inter-WBAN tiers, and proposes two mutual authentication and key exchange protocols for diverse WBAN environments. In our scheme, we use biometrics as one part of the solution for authentication and key exchange, and the simple password three-party key exchange protocol as the other part of the WBAN security. Our scheme meets security requirements along with energy-constraint considerations. We verify our scheme through BAN Logic. Unlike the majority of the existing security protocols, our scheme proposes a solution for entire WBANs communications, from biosensors to the medical server as a trusted third party.	access control;biometrics;burrows–abadi–needham logic;control system;key exchange;mutual authentication;network architecture;next-generation network;password;requirement;server (computing)	Peyman Dodangeh;Amir Hossein Jahangir	2018	J.

On the other side firewalls have optimized several times and different types have been introduced. Today by integrating NIDS and Firewall a new product comes to the market, which is called IPS. IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet  inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs. We try to conclude this by optimizing snort as a famous open source NIDS with a sample firewall program in Linux which is implemented by means of IPTABLES commands. The data is transferred in standard XML format. We also test the model by standard DARPA99 data sets and the results are satisfied.	authorization;computer security;deep packet inspection;denial-of-service attack;execution pattern;firewall (computing);information privacy;information system;intrusion detection system;linux;network packet;network planning and design;network security;open-source software;processor technology;sensor;server (computing);snort;xml;iptables	Hamed Salehi;Hossein Shirazi;Reza Askari Moghadam	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence	10.1109/JCAI.2009.12	computer science;network security;operating system;computer security;information system;computer network	Security	-57.47306782500141	66.30370401800477	28291
7e55953240ca9377f2c7373e9739a8b5e11432e8	weak verifiable random functions	public key;random function	Verifiable random functions (VRFs), introduced by Micali, Rabin and Vadhan, are pseudorandom functions in which the owner of the seed produces a public-key that constitutes a commitment to all values of the function and can then produce, for any input x, a proof that the function has been evaluated correctly on x, preserving pseudorandomness for all other inputs. No public-key (even a falsely generated one) should allow for proving more than one value per input. VRFs are both a natural and a useful primitive, and previous works have suggested a variety of constructions and applications. Still, there are many open questions in the study of VRFs, especially their relation to more widely studied cryptographic primitives and constructing them from a wide variety of cryptographic assumptions. In this work we define a natural relaxation of VRFs that we call weak verifiable random functions, where pseudorandomness is required to hold only for randomly selected inputs. We conduct a study of weak VRFs, focusing on applications, constructions, and their relationship to other cryptographic primitives. We show: – Constructions. We present constructions of weak VRFs based on a variety of assumptions, including general assumptions such as (enhanced) trapdoor permutations, as well as constructions based on specific number-theoretic assumptions such as the Diffie-Hellman assumption in bilinear groups. – Separations. Verifiable random functions (both weak and standard) cannot be constructed from one-way permutations in a blackbox manner. This constitutes the first result separating (standard) VRFs from any cryptographic primitive. – Applications. Weak VRFs capture the essence of constructing noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs for all NP languages. ?

3870591cf830af3ccfa29e9f05c12cee532065ff	fighting spam by encapsulating policy in email addresses	web pages;security policy	Everyday network interactions require users to give out their email address, yet no guarantees can be made about how this address will be used. Sometimes the address is given to a human (e.g., on a business card), but many times it is entered in a web form as part of a web transaction. Unfortunately, that email address frequently finds itself in spammers’ lists, never to be removed again. We propose the concept of the Single-Purpose Address (SPA); SPAs are generated by a program, and then cut-andpasted into the web page (or other application) requesting an email address. In its more general form an SPA encodes a security policy that describes the acceptable use of the address; since senders cannot be trusted to abide by it, this policy is enforced by the receiver, who generated the policy in the first place. SPAs are cryptographically protected to shield them from tampering. Since SPAs are not meant to be typed by humans, but rather processed by computer only, they do not have to be short, memorable, or even pronounceable. We present ways to construct such addresses, and we show the implementation of an opti-	cryptography;email;form (html);humans;interaction;spamming;web page	John Ioannidis	2003			computer science;world wide web;computer security;internet privacy;web page;email address harvesting;spamming;security policy	Security	-54.23326608739305	63.43405508034776	28311

Due to the self-configuring nature of these networks, the topology is highly dynamic. This makes the Ad Hoc Routing Protocols in MANETS highly vulnerable to serious security issues. In this paper, we survey the common security threats and attacks and summarize the solutions suggested in the survey to mitigate these security vulnerabilities.	categorization;hoc (programming language);introduction to algorithms;qualitative comparative analysis;routing;vulnerability (computing)	Harshavardhan Kayarkar	2012	CoRR		internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-53.910111577576075	74.70873134865221	28323
3312590d55173213e52b3cd87ad32a52349c79ab	privacy preserving computation in cloud using noise-free fully homomorphic encryption (fhe) schemes		With the wide adoption of cloud computing paradigm, it is important to develop appropriate techniques to protect client data privacy in the cloud. Encryption is one of the major techniques that could be used to achieve this goal. However, data encryption at the rest alone is insufficient for secure cloud computation environments. Further efficient techniques for carrying out computation over encrypted data are also required. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and garbled circuits are naturally used to process encrypted data without leaking any information about the data. However, existing FHE schemes are inefficient for processing large amount of data in cloud and garbled circuits are one time programs and cannot be reused. Based on quaternion/octonion algebra and Jordan algebra over finite rings Zq , this paper designs efficient fully homomorphic symmetric key encryption (FHE) schemes without bootstrapping (that is, noise-free FHE schemes) that are secure in the weak ciphertext-only security model assuming the hardness of solving multivariate quadratic equation systems and solving univariate high degree polynomial equation systems in Zq . The FHE scheme designed in this paper is sufficient for privacy preserving computation in cloud.	algebraic equation;ciphertext;ciphertext-only attack;cloud computing;computation;dictionary attack;homomorphic encryption;information privacy;padding (cryptography);polynomial;programming paradigm;quadratic equation;symmetric-key algorithm	Yongge Wang;Qutaibah M.

Cryptography ensures the confidentiality and authenticity of information but often relies on unproven assumptions. SAT solvers are a powerful tool to test the hardness of certain problems and have successfully been used to test hardness assumptions. This paper extends a SAT solver to efficiently work on cryptographic problems. The paper further illustrates how SAT solvers process cryptographic functions using automatically generated visualizations, introduces techniques for simplifying the solving process by modifying cipher representations, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach by solving three stream ciphers. To optimize a SAT solver for cryptographic problems, we extended the solver’s input language to support the XOR operation that is common in cryptography. To better understand the inner workings of the adapted solver and to identify bottlenecks, we visualize its execution. Finally, to improve the solving time significantly, we remove these bottlenecks by altering the function representation and by pre-parsing the resulting system of equations. The main contribution of this paper is a new approach to solving cryptographic problems by adapting both the problem description and the solver synchronously instead of tweaking just one of them. Using these techniques, we were able to solve a well-researched stream cipher 2 times faster than was previously possible.	bottleneck (software);confidentiality;cryptography;exclusive or;function representation;information;parsing;solver;stream cipher;tweaking	Mate Soos;Karsten Nohl;Claude Castelluccia	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02777-2_24	system of linear equations;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;function representation;stream cipher;boolean satisfiability problem;programming language;algorithm	Crypto	-36.35125257017573	78.00154514593824	28555

Typically, phishers are fond of using fuzzy techniques during the creation of a website. They confuse the victim by imitating the appearance and content of a legitimate website. In addition, many websites are vulnerable to phishing attacks, including financial institutions, social networks, e-commerce, and airline websites. This paper is an extension of our previous work that leverages the favicon with Google image search to reveal the identity of a website. Our identity retrieval technique involves an effective mathematical model that can be used to assist in retrieving the right identity from the many entries of the search results. In this paper, we introduced an enhanced version of the favicon-based phishing attack detection with the introduction of the Domain Name Amplification feature and incorporation of addition features. Additional features are very useful when the website being examined does not have a favicon. We have collected a total of 5,000 phishing websites from PhishTank and 5,000 legitimate websites from Alexa to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. From the experimental results, we achieved a 96.93% true positive rate with only a 4.13% false positive rate.	application programming interface;cybercrime;e-commerce;experiment;favicon;image retrieval;mathematical model;phishing;sensitivity and specificity;social network	Kang-Leng Chiew;Jeffrey Choo Soon Fatt;San-Nah Sze;Kelvin S.

Many of the proposed systems were designed with the assumption that all of the nodes are altruistic. However, this assumption may be violated by compromised nodes acting maliciously to degrade the accuracy of the coordinate system. As numerous peer-to-peer applications come to rely on virtual coordinate systems to achieve good performance, it is critical to address the security of such systems.  In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of decentralized virtual coordinate systems to insider (or Byzantine) attacks. We propose techniques to make the coordinate assignment robust to malicious attackers without increasing the communication cost. We use both spatial and temporal correlations to perform context-sensitive outlier analysis to reject malicious updates and prevent unnecessary and erroneous adaptations. We demonstrate the attacks and mitigation techniques in the context of a well-known virtual coordinate system using simulations based on three representative, real-life Internet topologies of hosts and corresponding Round Trip Times (RTT). We show the effects of the attacks and the utility of the mitigation techniques on the virtual coordinate system as seen by higher-level applications, elucidating the utility of deploying robust virtual coordinate systems as network services.	context-sensitive grammar;internet;malware;peer-to-peer;real life;simulation	David Zage;Cristina Nita-Rotaru	2010	ACM Trans.

There are numerous applications for wireless sensor networks, and security is vital for many of them. However, sensor nodes suffer from many constraints, including low computation capability, small memory, limited energy resources, susceptibility to physical capture, and the lack of infrastructure, all of which impose formidable security challenges and call for innovative approaches. In this thesis, we present our research results on three important aspects of securing sensor networks: lightweight entity authentication, distributed node clone detection, and secure data aggregation. As the technical core of our lightweight authentication proposals, a special type of circulant matrix named circulant-P2 matrix is introduced. We prove the linear independence of matrix vectors, present efficient algorithms on matrix operations, and explore other important properties. By combining circulant-P2 matrix with the learning parity with noise problem, we develop two one-way authentication protocols: the innovative LCMQ protocol, which is provably secure against all probabilistic polynomial-time attacks and provides remarkable performance on almost all metrics except one mild requirement for the verifier’s computational capacity, and the HBC protocol, which utilizes the conventional HB-like authentication structure to preserve the bit-operation only computation requirement for both participants and consumes less key storage than previous HB-like protocols without sacrificing other performance. Moreover, two enhancement mechanisms are provided to protect the HB-like protocols from known attacks and to improve performance. For both protocols, practical parameters for different security levels are recommended. In addition, we build a framework to extend enhanced HB-like protocols to mutual authentication in a communication-efficient fashion. Node clone attack, that is, the attempt by adversaries to add one or more nodes to the network by cloning captured nodes, imposes a severe threat to wireless sensor networks. To cope with it, we propose two distributed detection protocols with difference tradeoffs on network conditions and performance. The first one is based on distributed hash table, by which a fully decentralized, key-based caching and checking system is constructed to deterministically catch cloned nodes in general sensor networks. The protocol performance of efficient storage consumption and high security level is theoretically deducted through a probability model, and the resulting equations, with necessary adjustments for real application, are supported by the simulations. The other is the randomly directed exploration protocol, which presents notable communication performance and minimal storage consumption by an elegant probabilistic directed forwarding technique along with random initial direction and border determination. The extensive experimental results uphold the protocol design and show its efficiency on communication overhead and satisfactory detection probability.	algorithm;authentication protocol;bitwise operation;circulant matrix;communications protocol;data aggregation;distributed hash table;duplicate code;human-based computation;mutual authentication;one-way function;overhead (computing);pp (complexity);parity learning;polynomial;provable security;randomness;simulation;time complexity	Zhijun Li	2010			computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.54565473066662	76.41559894103625	28879
b7e199b4ede9b493a231212b144098ab9e97e83c	a measure version of gaussian heuristic		Most applicable lattice reduction algorithms used in practice are BKZ (Block-Korkine-Zolotarev) type algorithms as the blockwise generalizations of the LLL algorithm (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz). Its original version was proposed by Schnorr and Euchner in 1991. The quality of reduced lattice bases is measured by the Hermitian factor ||b1|| vol(L)1/d and the d-th root of this factor which is called root Hermitian factor. In Asiacrypt 2011 paper Y. Chen and Phong Q. Nguyen used BKZ with extreme pruning enumeration subroutine to handle the large block size lattice reduction with the purpose that the better root Hermitian factors can be expected. This BKZ 2.0 algorithm has been served as a base stone for the security evaluation of recent lattice-based cryptosystems such as fully homomorphic encryption and cryptographic multilinear mappings. In this paper we propose a measure version of Gaussian heuristic. This is a strict mathematical proven theorem. It can be used to give a strict mathematical proof for conjectured or simulated root Hermitian factors in BKZ 2.0 type algorithms and BKZ or slide reduction with large block-sizes. The theoretical analysis of these heuristic assumptions in the simulator of BKZ 2.0 type algorithms are also given.	arjen lenstra;asiacrypt;block size (cryptography);cryptography;cryptosystem;entity–relationship model;heuristic;homomorphic encryption;lattice reduction;lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;multilinear subspace learning;subroutine	Hao Chen	2016	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		mathematical optimization;heuristic;gaussian;mathematics	Crypto	-38.40102998985087	79.86794239898613	28909

5a72c97d01ac35ab65648988f339d5cd3e306388	protecting mobile crowd sensing against sybil attacks using cloud based trust management system		Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) arises as a new sensing paradigm, which leverages citizens for large-scale sensing by various mobile devices to efficiently collect and share local information. Unlike other MCS application challenges that consider user privacy and data trustworthiness, this study focuses on the network trustworthiness problem, namely, Sybil attacks in MCS network. The Sybil attack in computer security is a type of security attack, which illegally forges multiple identities in peer-to-peer networks, namely, Sybil identities. These Sybil identities will falsify multiple identities that negatively influence the effectiveness of sensing data in this MCS network or degrading entire network performance. To cope with this problem, a cloud based trust management scheme (CbTMS) was proposed to detect Sybil attacks in the MCS network. The CbTMS was proffered for performing active and passive checking scheme, in addition to the mobile PCS trustworthiness management, and includes a decision tree algorithm, to verify the covered nodes in the MCS network. Simulation studies show that our CbTMS can efficiently detect the malicious Sybil nodes in the network and cause 6.87&#x2009;Wh power reduction compared with other malicious Sybil node attack mode.	management system;sybil attack;trust management (managerial science)	Shih-Hao Chang;Zhi-Rong Chen	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/6506341	internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.04360375717229	77.00925504087995	29083

Recently, two identity-based threshold signcryption schemes [12], [27] have been proposed by combining the concepts of identity-based threshold signature and signcryption together. However, the formal models and security proofs for both schemes are not considered. In this paper, we formalize the concept of identity-based threshold signcryption and give a new scheme based on the bilinear pairings. We prove its confidentiality under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption and its unforgeability under the Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. Our scheme turns out to be more efficient than the two previously proposed schemes.	bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;computation;computational diffie–hellman assumption;confidentiality;cryptographic primitive;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;digital signature;encryption;provable security;public-key cryptography;random oracle;scheme;signcryption	Fagen Li;Yong Yu	2008	2008 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems		digital signature;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;signcryption;mathematics;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security	Crypto	-41.01912369914306	75.79513040307555	29112

The nodes are arranged hierarchically in the form of a 6-nary tree. Key predistribution follows a deterministic approach. Each node in our scheme requires storing significantly less number of secret keys. Our scheme provides better resiliency compared to other existing schemes and reasonable connectivity as well. It can be found that any two nodes are connected either directly or via a key-path. Moreover, any number of nodes can be introduced in the network by assigning a few keys to the newly joined nodes only, without disturbing the existing set-up of the network.	fano plane	Sarbari Mitra;Ratna Dutta;Sourav Mukhopadhyay	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-31909-9_21	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;distributed computing	Theory	-50.91150436307235	77.73754053965341	29120

Among them mafia fraud attack is the most serious since this attack can be mounted without the notice of both the reader and the tag. An adversary performs a kind of man-in-the-middle attack between the reader and the tag. It is very difficult to prevent this attack since the adversary does not change any data between the reader and the tag. Recently distance bounding protocols measuring the round-trip time between the reader and the tag have been researched to prevent this attack. All the existing distance bounding protocols based on binary challenges, without final signature, provide an adversary success probability equal to (3/4) where n is the number of rounds in the protocol. In this paper, we introduce a new protocol based on binary mixed challenges that converges toward the expected and optimal (1/2) bound. We prove its security in case of both noisy and non-noisy channels.	2.5d;adversary (cryptography);communications protocol;computation;contactless smart card;location-based service;man-in-the-middle attack;performance;relay attack;security parameter	Chong Hee Kim;Gildas Avoine	2009	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-10433-6_9	radio-frequency identification;man-in-the-middle attack;reflection attack;pre-play attack;computer science;authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;round-trip delay time;computer security	Security	-45.423969491809956	75.04090878055317	29236
0226d69aea35413c0f2cb6c03788dfb409613b1c	survey of rank attack detection algorithms in internet of things		This paper addresses one of the RPL routing attacks - Rank attack, which is a fundamental security attack on the routing of in IoT networks. Today, most devices, which are used for health care, connected vehicles and smart buildings have the capability to be connected to the internet through wireless. The IoT devices use routing protocols such as RPL and 6LoWPAN. The major challenge within IoT is that the devices are resource constrained, the communication links are low power and lossy, which makes it more vulnerable to attacks. This paper presents a detailed investigation on the various algorithms developed to detect the rank attack in IoT. An Intrusion detection system (IDS) is designed for IoT, which is capable of detecting Rank attack and attacker node. This system is used to identify the Rank attack, attacker nodes based on the location information of node rank, neighboring node rank and its respective rank value, usual signal strength. The plan of this system is helping in securing the IoT network and prevent from some attacks [2]. However, applying usual IDS techniques to IoT is difficult due to its particular characteristics such as constrained-resource devices, specific protocol stacks. In this paper, present a survey of IDS research efforts for IoT. Main objective is to identify rank attack and future research possibilities to detect rank attack by using IDS Technique.

Phishing has become the most popular practice among the criminals of the Web. Phishing attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The impact of phishing is drastic and significant since it can involve the risk of identity theft and financial losses. Phishing scams have become a problem for online banking and e-commerce users. In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect phishing attacks. We implemented a prototype web browser which can be used as an agent and processes each arriving email for phishing attacks. Using email data collected over a period time we demonstrate data that our approach is able to detect more phishing attacks than existing schemes.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is an imperative part of the smart grid. It has replaced legacy metering, as it reports the energy consumption to the utility automatically through communication channels. AMI is also featuring to communicate control functions from utility to the smart meters. So, both the consumption data and control data needs to be securely transmitted to their ends. Any leak and tempering may produce the dire effects to both utility and consumers. Hence security of AMI is a very important concern to take real advantage of this technology. In this paper, first we analyze the security threats faced by AMI components and then propose the countermeasures to tackle them. The aim is to visualize the possible threats in the context of confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA Triad) context and propose countermeasure.	authentication;categorization;confidentiality;control function (econometrics);countermeasure (computer);encryption;imperative programming;information security;intrusion detection system;key distribution;project merrimac;routing;smart meter;software metering;strong cryptography	Sheeraz Niaz Lighari;Birgitte Bak-Jensen;Dil Muhammad Akbar Hussain;Asad Ali Shaikh	2014	2014 6th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2014.7002094	embedded system;computer science;authentication;smart grid;internet privacy;computer security;internet of things	SE	-45.462957682945664	66.3379179421617	29277

We first design a security definition for routing path vector protocols by studying, generalizing, and formalizing numerous known threats. Our model incorporates three major security goals. It is quite strong, yet simple to use. We prove by reduction that S-BGP satisfies two out of the security model's three goals, assuming the underlying signature scheme is secure. Under the same assumption, we next show how the protocol can be modified to meet all three security goals simultaneously. Finally, we study security of partial PKI deployment of path vector protocols when not all nodes have public keys. We investigate the possibilities of relaxing the PKI requirement and relying on the non-cryptographic physical security of the protocol in order to achieve possibly weaker, but still well-defined, notions of security. We also present the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve full security in the partial PKI deployment scenario. We believe our conclusions will prove useful for protocol developers, standards bodies and government agencies.	border gateway protocol;cryptography;digital signature;physical security;provable security;public key infrastructure;routing;software deployment	Alexandra Boldyreva;Robert Lychev	2012		10.1145/2382196.2382254	computer security model;security through obscurity;security association;computer science;concrete security;provable security;distributed computing;internet privacy;security testing;computer security	Security	-48.70967026341994	74.84862557874777	29285
ad106136bf0201105f197d501bd8625d7e9c2562	botcensor: detecting dga-based botnet using two-stage anomaly detection		Nowadays, most botnets utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to build resilient and agile command and control (C&C) channels. Specifically, botmasters employ DGAs to dynamically produce a large number of random domains and only register a small subset for their actual C&C servers with the purpose to defend them from takeovers and blacklisting attempts. While many approaches and models have been developed to detect DGA-based botnets, they suffer from several limitations, such as difficulties of DNS traffic collection, low feasibility and scalability, and so forth. In this paper, we present BotCensor, a new system that can determine if a host is infected with certain DGA malware with two-stage anomaly detection. In the first stage, we preliminarily attempt to identify malicious domains using a Markov model, and in the second stage, we re-examine the hosts that requested aforementioned malicious domains using novelty detection algorithms. Our experimental results show that our approach performs very well on identifying previously unknown DGA-generated domains and detects DGA bots with high efficiency and efficacy. Our approach not only can be regarded as security forensics tools, but also can be used to prevent malware infections and spread.	agile software development;anomaly detection;botnet;computation;context of computational complexity;discriminant;domain generation algorithm;experiment;feedback;malware;markov chain;markov model;novelty detection;reverse engineering;scalability	Biao Qi;Jianguo Jiang;Zhixin Shi;Rui Mao;Qiwen Wang	2018	2018 17th IEEE International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications/ 12th IEEE International Conference On Big Data Science And Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE)	10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00109	computer network;anomaly detection;malware;botnet;scalability;novelty detection;markov model;computer science;distributed computing;server	SE	-61.17219893363354	63.929334262203625	29289

At the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), we have been developing an alternate type of network intrusion detection system called IDA (Intrusion Detection Agent system), which detects intrusions with mobile agents that act by gathering information related to intrusions from target systems on a network. The mobile agents autonomously trace the origin of the break-in without the intrusion-detection servers control and also gather information from target systems. Consequently, network traffic between the target systems and the server is reduced. This paper describes how the mobile agents migrate from machine to machine within a network and details how they trace intrusions and gather and exchange information efficiently. © 1999 Scripta Technica, Syst Comp Jpn, 30(2): 3137, 1999	digi-comp i;intrusion detection system;machine to machine;mobile agent;network traffic control;server (computing);tcl	Midori Asaka	1999	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/(SICI)1520-684X(199902)30:2%3C31::AID-SCJ4%3E3.0.CO;2-F	intrusion detection system;host-based intrusion detection system;computer science;network security;mobile agent;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;intrusion prevention system	Security	-60.91297987747203	68.96511941584247	29307

Insiders must be prevented to operate on the system: they may benefit of their position in the control room to fool colleagues, and gain access to machines or accounts. This paper proposes an authentication system for deterring and detecting malicious access to the workstations of control rooms. Specifically tailored for the operators in the control room of the crisis management system Secure!, the solution aims to guarantee authentication and non-repudiation of operators, reducing the risk that unauthorized personnel (including intruders) misuses a workstation. A continuous multi-biometric authentication mechanism is developed and applied in which biometric data is acquired transparently from the operator and verified continuously through time. This paper presents the authentication system design and prototype, its execution and experimental results.

a99f40136e368b72fdf15d3c8f2a77493c9f09d4	ecb4ci: an enhanced cancelable biometric system for securing critical infrastructures		Physical access control is an indispensable component of a critical infrastructure. Traditional password-based methods for access control used in the critical infrastructure security systems have limitations. With the advance of new biometric recognition technologies, security control for critical infrastructures can be improved by the use of biometrics. In this paper, we propose an enhanced cancelable biometric system, which contains two layers, a core layer and an expendable layer, to provide reliable access control for critical infrastructures. The core layer applies random projection-based non-invertible transformation to the fingerprint feature set, so as to provide template protection and revocability. The expendable layer is used to protect the transformation key, which is the main weakness contributing to attacks via record multiplicity. This improvement enhances the overall system security, and undoubtedly, this extra security is an advantage over the existing cancelable biometric systems.	access control;biometrics;control system;critical infrastructure protection;encryption;engine control unit;fingerprint;interdependence;password;physical access;random projection	Wencheng Yang;Song Wang;Guanglou Zheng;Junaid Ahsenali Chaudhry;Craig Valli	2018	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-018-2266-0	computer science;password;distributed computing;access control;physical access;critical infrastructure;security controls;biometrics;random projection	Security	-48.64155199304053	60.878812861890246	29361

They claimed that their scheme is secured from attacks and suitable for high security applications; however, we point out that their scheme is vulnerable and can easily be cryptanalyzed. We demonstrate that their scheme performs only unilateral authentication (only client authentication) and there is no mutual authentication between user and remote system, thus their scheme is susceptible to the server spoofing attack. To fill this security gap, we present an improvement which overcomes the weakness of Lin-Lai's scheme. As a result, our improved security patch establishes trust between client and remote system in the form of mutual authentication. Moreover, some standards for biometric-based authentication are also discussed, which should be followed during the development of biometric systems.	authentication;biometrics	Muhammad Khurram Khan;Jiashu Zhang	2007	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2006.01.002	fingerprint verification competition;data authentication algorithm;ntlmssp;smart card;cryptanalysis;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;computer science;information security;access control;authentication protocol;internet authentication service;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;email authentication;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Security	-45.17470696953592	74.07927861055087	29376

Indeed, due to their simplicity and ease, they are one of the first methods used to analyze gathered data. Typically, the construction of contingency tables from source data is considered straightforward since all data is supposed to be aggregated at a single party. However, in many cases, the collected data may actually be federated among different parties. Privacy and security concerns may restrict the data owners from free sharing of the raw data. However, construction of the global contingency tables would still be of immense interest. In this paper, we propose techniques for enabling secure construction of contingency tables from both horizontally and vertically partitioned data. Our methods are efficient and secure. We also examine cases where the constructed contingency table may itself leak too much information and discuss potential solutions.	contingency table;federation (information technology);privacy;source data	Haibing Lu;Xiaoyun He;Jaideep Vaidya;Nabil R.

However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can easily introduce errors to state estimates without being detected by the current security systems. In this paper, we analyze and formulate an effective false-data injection attack to control real-time electricity price at any tagged bus. It is observed that an adversary capable of false-data injection attack can induce false real-time electricity price by fabricating biased transmission congestion pattern. From the strategic level, we propose a simple algorithm that finds the effective congestion pattern with minor distortion to the normal system operation. For practical implementation, load redistribution attack, a special false-data injection attack which produces biased load estimates, is used to achieve the derived congestion pattern. We also propose a cost-aware neighborhood load redistribution attack, which only compromises limited measurements around the tagged bus. From theory to practice, our results here reveal the potential cyber vulnerabilities of current electricity market and would help to build more secure smart power grid in the future.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;code injection;distortion;lr parser;network congestion;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Suzhi Bi;Ying Jun Angela Zhang	2013	2013 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831166	telecommunications;computer science;information security;electricity;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.534890171413245	66.32374420082027	29461

We show impossibility of constructing such a protocol that achieves a transmission rate of less than Θ(n) for constant-size messages and arbitrary reliability parameter. In addition, we show how to improve two existing protocols for RMT to allow for either larger messages or reduced field sizes.	adversary (cryptography);virtual economy	René Bødker Christensen	2017	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		impossibility;discrete mathematics;mathematics;cryptographic protocol;adversary;computer network;transmission (mechanics);communication channel	Crypto	-41.843528733574644	76.24536350151809	29463

In this paper, we consider ad hoc networks real deployment, in which advanced services are provided to users (mainly multimedia services, ex, music and video transfer and sharing, audio-visual guidance during festivals), considering that the services are provided by dedicated ad hoc nodes playing the role of application servers (application providers). We proposed a novel solution allowing, the mutual authentication of each user with respect to the network operator/service provider, the authentication of each ad hoc node with respect to its neighbors during the ad hoc user access to the network, and the authorization of each user to access the required services. Our proposed solution employs a Kerberos authentication model, extending it to the ad hoc network environment. We provided a security analysis of this solution showing its resistance against a number of attacks and we implemented it analyzed its performance in an ad hoc network test-bed, mainly in term of authentication delay compared to traditional authentication approaches.	application server;authorization;hoc (programming language);kerberos;mutual authentication;software deployment;testbed	Hassnaa Moustafa;Jacky Forestier;Mohamed Chaari	2009		10.1145/1710035.1710050	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dynamic circuit network;computer science;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;delay-tolerant networking;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.10676074271228	72.58523812049529	29474

A limitation of the model is that the same level of privacy protection is afforded for all individuals. However, it is common that the data subjects have quite different expectations regarding the acceptable level of privacy for their data. Consequently, differential privacy may lead to insufficient privacy protection for some users, while over-protecting others. We argue that by accepting that not all users require the same level of privacy, a higher level of utility can often be attained by not providing excess privacy to those who do not want it. We propose a new privacy definition called personalized differential privacy (PDP), a generalization of differential privacy in which users specify a personal privacy requirement for their data. We then introduce several novel mechanisms for achieving PDP. Our primary mechanism is a general one that automatically converts any existing differentially private algorithm into one that satisfies PDP. We also present a more direct approach for achieving PDP, inspired by the well-known exponential mechanism. We demonstrate our framework through extensive experiments on real and synthetic data.	aggregate data;algorithm;algorithmic inference;differential privacy;experiment;exponential mechanism (differential privacy);heuristic (computer science);nonuniform sampling;offset binary;personalization;sampling (signal processing);scalability;social network;synthetic data;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Zach Jorgensen;Ting Yu;Graham Cormode	2015	2015 IEEE 31st International Conference on Data Engineering	10.1109/ICDE.2015.7113353	privacy software;lead;privacy by design;computer science;data mining;database;data protection act 1998;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-39.5098272873085	62.89620068211283	29477

Many solutions have been proposed to secure communications for WSNs and most of them rely on a centralized component which behaves as a certificate authority. We propose in this paper a distributed solution able to ensure authentication of nodes at any time without having any on-line access to a certificate authority. Each node will be equipped with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) which is able to store keys with security. Each node will have its own public key and private key pair in the TPM and a certificate of the public key. The certificate is issued off-line when setting-up the node. When a node communicates with another, it has to sign the message with its own private key (done securely by the TPM) and sends the message, the signature and the certificate of the public key. The evaluation of the solution has been done using simulation and the overhead added by integrating authentication does not exceed 15% of energy consumption.

One main challenge is how to manage public keys' certificates among ad hoc nodes. This paper introduces a fast and secure clustering scheme by select candidate's nodes using voting method, This method is to select certificates management node which manages certificates on behave of other nodes in ad hoc network.	cluster analysis;computer simulation;hoc (programming language);malware;public key certificate;semantic network;stationary process	Iichiro Nishimura;Tomoyuki Nagase;Youjiro Takehana;Yoshio Yoshioka	2011	2011 14th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems	10.1109/NBiS.2011.115	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.8264124665004	77.10268201995962	29537

Detection of masquerade attacks is of great importance and is a non-trivial task of system security. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her computer usage. Traditional detection mechanisms are based on command line system events collected using log files. In a GUI based system, most of the user activities are performed using either mouse movements and clicks or a combination of mouse movements and keystrokes. The command line data cannot capture the complete GUI event behavior of the users hence it is insufficient to detect attacks in GUI based systems. Presently, there is no frame work available to capture the GUI based user behavior in Linux systems. We are proposing a novel approach to capture the GUI based user behavior for Linux systems using our event logging tool. Our experimentation results shows that, the GUI based user behavior can be efficiently used for masquerade attack detection to achieve high detection rates with less false positives. We have applied One-class SVM on the collected data, which requires only training the user's own legitimate sessions to build up the user's profile. Our results on GUI data using One-class SVM gives higher detection rates with less false positives compared to a Two-class SVM approach.	graphical user interface;linux	Wilson Naik Bhukya;Suneel Kumar Kommuru;Atul Negi	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-76929-3_21	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-57.64141858390993	61.21951198113427	29557

Shannon defined perfect secrecyfor a pair of secure computers communicating over an insecure link. The present paper extends Shannon’s notion of perfect secrecy to ad hoc wireless networks of computers. All of the wireless transmissions are insecure. This paper assumes a secure base-station communicating wirelessly using symmetric encryption with physically insecure autonomous computers. These wireless communications use a common symmetric encryption algorithm. Each of the computers has a unique fixed key. The base station has a copy of each key. This scenario gives way to a generalization of Shannon’s perfect secrecy. This generalizes to t-perfect secrecywhich is directly based on t-wise independence. This gives another natural application of t-wise independence to cryptography. Finally, transmission noise, message collisions, and other issues are briefly discussed with respect to this generalization of Shannon’s perfect secrecy.	autonomous robot;computer;cryptography;encryption;hoc (programming language);information-theoretic security;key (cryptography);shannon (unit);symmetric-key algorithm	Phillip G.

One mechanism to safeguard information stored in database systems is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The purpose of intrusion detection in database systems is to detect malicious transactions that corrupt data. Recently researchers are working on using data mining techniques for detecting such malicious transactions in database systems. Their approach concentrates on mining data dependencies among data items. However, the transactions not compliant with these data dependencies are identified as malicious transactions. Algorithms that these approaches use for designing their data dependency miner have limitations. For instance, they need to experimentally determine appropriate settings for minimum support and related constraints, which does not necessarily lead to strong data dependencies. In this paper we propose a new data mining algorithm, called the Optimal Data Access Dependency Rule Mining (ODADRM), for designing a data dependency miner for our database IDS. ODADRM is an extension of k-optimal rule discovery algorithm, which has been improved to be suitable in database intrusion detection domain. ODADRM avoids many limitations of previous data dependency miner algorithms. As a result, our approach is able to track normal transactions and detect malicious ones more effectively than existing approaches.	algorithm;association rule learning;computer;data access;data dependency;data item;data mining;database;database transaction;experiment;intrusion detection system;malware;sensor;synthetic intelligence	Mina Sohrabi;Mohammad M.

We can replace the invocation of the hash function that is used to check the receiver is well-behaved with the XOR of bit strings. This is possible by applying a cut-and-choose technique on the length of the bit strings that the receiver sends in the reversed OT. We also improve on the number of seeds required for the extension, both asymptotically and practically. Moreover, the protocol used to test receiver’s behaviour enjoys unconditional security.	cryptography;exclusive or;hash function;oblivious transfer;overhead (computing)	Enrique Larraia	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-16295-9_20		Crypto	-37.85578880106439	76.52361987367163	29646

In this paper, we introduce a simple chameleon-hash-based transformation and show that it can tighten a security reduction of a signature scheme that suffers from a loose security reduction. Taking the Waters' signature from Eurocrypt 2005 as an example, we demonstrate an improvement of the security reduction that the probability of success in the security reduction can be made as a constant and independent of the signature queries from an adversary. Our reduction methodology has never been considered in the literature and is applicable to many signature schemes such as identity-based signature schemes, online/offline signatures, and signatures with strong unforeability.	provable security	Fuchun Guo;Yi Mu;Willy Susilo	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04642-1_9	ring signature;standard model;digital signature;merkle signature scheme;data mining;mathematics;signature;internet privacy;kcdsa;blind signature;schnorr signature;elgamal signature scheme;computer security	Crypto	-39.300834615486195	77.01404508588838	29654

For email alone, there is a multitude of proposals to mitigate known vulnerabilities, ranging from the introduction of completely new protocols to modifications of the communication paths used by big providers. Deciding which measures to deploy requires a deep understanding of the induced benefits, the cost and the resulting effects. This paper proposes the first automated methodology for making formal deployment assessments. Our planning algorithm analyses the impact and cost-efficiency of different known mitigation strategies against an attacker in a formal threat model. This novel formalisation of an infrastructure attacker includes routing, name resolution and application level weaknesses. We apply the methodology to a large-scale scan of the Internet, and assess how protocols like IPsec, DNSSEC, DANE, SMTP STS, SMTP over TLS and other mitigation techniques like server relocation can be combined to improve the confidentiality of email users in 45 combinations of attacker and defender countries and nine cost scenarios. This is the first deployment analysis for mitigation techniques at this scale.

d183a1cd59721e8031a983629b14dbcf28b0ff9b	isogenies and cryptography		This thesis explores the notion of isogenies and its applications to cryptography. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is an efficient public cryptosystem with a short key size. For this reason it is suitable for implementing on memory-constraint devices such as smart cards, mobile devices, etc. However, these devices leak information about their private key through side channels (power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, timing etc) during cryptographic processing. In this thesis we have examined countermeasures against a specific side channel attack (power consumption) using isogeny, (a rational homomorphism between elliptic curves) and elliptic curve isomorphism. We found that these methods are an efficient way of securing cryptographic devices using ECC against power analysis attacks. We have also investigated the security and efficiency of implementation of a public key cryptosystem based on isogenies. We found that in order to implement the proposed cryptosystem one has to compute a root of the Hilbert polynomial H D ( X ) over F p . Since there is no known efficient way of achieving this calculation, the proposed cryptosystem cannot be used in practice.	cryptography	Raza Ali Kazmi	2010	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		discrete mathematics;power analysis;theoretical computer science;threshold cryptosystem;side channel attack;cryptosystem;mathematics;elliptic curve cryptography;hybrid cryptosystem;computer security	Crypto	-39.503794165707276	81.1622934238834	29706

7a08144db2df0ff7e3fa06235dac78da49196501	algorithmically determining store-and-forward mta relays using domainkeys		Store-and-forward MTA relaying servers have frequently presented problems to various antispam techniques, such as IPbased reputation or email authentication. Algorithms that find email relaying servers can use knowledge about a domain’s outbound IP addresses combined with cryptographic domain authentication frameworks such as DomainKeys. This paper presents one such algorithm. 1.Why find relaying servers? In this paper, the term relaying will be used to describe the situation where messages intended for an email user are systematically and automatically delivered to a non-local address. Many industry terms are used for this action: forwarding, redirection, lifetime email addresses, etc. The feature is prevalent in university’s alumni email accounts and Internet access providers. Unmoderated mailing lists also have many of the characteristics of forwarding servers. In this paper, the term is specifically for MTA relays and not used to describe the use of a Forward button or Bounce/redirect option in a MUA. Email that has traversed a store-and-forward MTA relay is generally indistinguishable from a forgery to a receiving system. Without email authentication technology, the connecting IP address is the only data piece of an email that is not forgeable. In a relaying scenario, the IP address connecting to the final recipient’s mail server is not one associated with the message’s originator. Instead, the connecting IP address will be present in a Received header, perhaps several below the one describing the final network hop. Generally, this data about the originator is not trustable by the receiving system, as a spammer can pretend to forward an email by adding a faux Received header at the top of their transmission. However, if a receiver had a list of servers that it trusted to properly relay, rules could be developed to parse Received headers to find the originator and then apply IP-based reputation filters, or authenticate the email using path-based models such as SPF or Sender ID that are ineffective in relaying situations. Relay servers are also likely false positive candidates for sender reputation. With spam email between 65-85% of normal traffic, relaying servers will likely redirect similar percentages of spam. This rate of spam would mark the relaying server’s reputation as negative, because the spam rate would be orders of magnitude worse than a best practices sender’s spam complaint rate per message. As a result, relays are more likely to be treated as second class (or worse) mail, experiencing deliverability problems such as tagged false positives and degraded performance from greylisting [4] and teergrubing [5], or even message rejection. If a receiver can algorithmically determine a forwarding server, different rules could be applied to avoid this treatment. This need to reliably determine relay servers creates a transient trust dilemma for the receiving system. If the receiving system blindly trusts Received headers to determine relays, it may enable the spammer to forge email and slip by filters, an unacceptable risk. If it could algorithmically determine the auto-forwarding servers, these risks would be significantly mitigated.	algorithm;anti-spam techniques;best practice;british undergraduate degree classification;cryptography;domainkeys;email authentication;forge;greylisting;integrated windows authentication;internet access;parsing;rejection sampling;relay;sender id;sender policy framework;server (computing);spamming;store and forward;tarpit (networking);url redirection	Miles Libbey;Peter Ludemann	2006			hop (networking);computer network;internet privacy;domainkeys;header;communication source;spamming;store and forward;server;computer science;email authentication	Security	-56.72038849536262	64.50287202803808	29767

A UCH-VE scheme allows an encryptor to designate t out of a group of n users and prepare a publicly verifiable ciphertext in such a way that any k of these t designated users can recover the message. The values of k and t are set arbitrarily by the encryptor. The anonymity of these t designated users will also be preserved. The UCHVE scheme captures the notions of various types of verifiable encryption schemes that include conventional one-decryptor type, conventional threshold type, designated-1-out-of-n custodian-hiding type and designated group custodian-hiding type. On efficiency, the new scheme avoids using inefficient cut-and-choose proofs and compares favourably with the state-of-the-art verifiable encryption schemes for discrete logarithms.	ciphertext;discrete logarithm;encryption;formal verification	Joseph K.

Unfortunately such cross-site authentications carry privacy and tracking risks. For example, federated identity providers can learn what applications users are accessing; meanwhile, the applications can know the users' identities in reality.  This paper presents Crypto-Book, an anonymizing layer enabling federated identity authentications while preventing these risks. Crypto-Book uses a set of independently managed servers that employ a (t,n)-threshold cryptosystem to collectively assign credentials to each federated identity (in the form of either a public/private keypair or blinded signed messages). With the credentials in hand, clients can then leverage anonymous authentication techniques such as linkable ring signatures or partially blind signatures to log into third-party applications in an anonymous yet accountable way.  We have implemented a prototype of Crypto-Book and demonstrated its use with three applications: a Wiki system, an anonymous group communication system, and a whistleblower submission system. Crypto-Book is practical and has low overhead: in a deployment within our research group, Crypto-Book group authentication took 1.607s end-to-end, an overhead of 1.2s compared to traditional non-privacy-preserving federated authentication.	antivirus software;authentication;blind signature;credential;cross-site cooking;cryptosystem;end-to-end principle;federated identity;group communication system;identity provider;overhead (computing);privacy;prototype;public-key cryptography;software deployment;wiki	John Maheswaran;Daniel Jackowitz;Ennan Zhai;David Wolinsky;Bryan Ford	2016		10.1145/2857705.2857725	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-46.89412176919233	65.18698944804903	29772

Attribute/Key management is a keystone issue in CP-APE because of low efficiency of existing attribute revocation techniques. Indeed, existing solutions induce great side effect after each attribute revocation. The side effect induces rekeying and/or re-assignment of attributes to all users. In this paper, we propose a solution which does not require extra entities like proxies to re-encrypt data after every access policy change. Moreover, our solution does not imply latencies following access grants and revocations. We compare our solution with the batch-based CP-ABE attribute management technique and we show that our solution outperforms existing rekeying/revocation techniques in terms of overhead.	access control;attribute-based encryption;ciphertext;cryptography;entity;key (cryptography);key management;keystone effect;overhead (computing);proxy server	Lyes Touati;Yacine Challal	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology; Ubiquitous Computing and Communications; Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing; Pervasive Intelligence and Computing	10.1109/CIT/IUCC/DASC/PICOM.2015.49	logic gate;computer science;access control;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;internet of things;encryption;attribute-based encryption;computer network	DB	-41.94959804884758	68.36815474841443	29809

Unfortunately, anonymous location samples do not fully solve the privacy problem. An adversary could link multiple samples (i.e., follow the footsteps) to accumulate path information and eventually identify a user. This paper reports on our ongoing work to analyze privacy risks in such applications. We observe that linking anonymous location samples is related to the data association problem in tracking systems. We then propose to use such tracking algorithms to characterize the level of privacy and to derive disclosure control algorithms.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;correspondence problem;global positioning system;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;population;privacy;tracking system	Marco Gruteser;Baik Hoh	2005		10.1007/978-3-540-32004-3_19	simulation;confidentiality;internationalization and localization;anonymity;global positioning system;tracking system;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;tracking;computer security;ubiquitous computing;cumulant	Security	-46.11057832244694	78.86945667655338	29854

Previous work has employed supervised classifiers in order to link the sessions of individual users. However, classifiers need labeled training sessions, which are difficult to obtain for observers. In this paper we show how this limitation can be overcome with an unsupervised learning technique. We present a modified k-means algorithm and evaluate it on a realistic dataset that contains the Domain Name System (DNS) queries of 3,862 users. For this purpose, we simulate an observer that tries to track all users, and an Internet Service Provider that assigns a different IP address to every user on every day. The highest tracking accuracy is achieved within the subgroup of highly active users. Almost all sessions of 73% of the users in this subgroup can be linked over a period of 56 days. 19% of the highly active users can be traced completely, i.e., all their sessions are assigned to a single cluster. This fraction increases to 40% for shorter periods of seven days. As service providers may engage in behavior-based tracking to complement their existing profiling efforts, it constitutes a severe privacy threat for users of online services. Users can defend against behavior-based tracking by changing their IP address frequently, but this is cumbersome at the moment.	algorithm;e-services;k-means clustering;simulation;supervised learning;unsupervised learning	Matthias Kirchler;Dominik Herrmann;Jens Lindemann;Marius Kloft	2016		10.1145/2996758.2996770	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.584262024397	64.76791634557517	29881
56240e6135d86afc0bedbc58c4323ea2487cd837	an unbreakable cryptosystem for common people	random numbers	It has been found that an algorithm can generate true random numbers on classical computer. The algorithm can be used to generate unbreakable message PIN (personal identification number) and password. Cryptography has long history [1]. Interestingly, it has been found that taking key material from open source it is possible to design unbreakable crypto-system. Following the technique [2] an algorithm [3] has also been designed for the generation of arbitrary numbers of random numbers. Using the algorithm [3] distant parties can generate common key if they give the same inputs which are three sequences of random numbers. It means distant parties have to secretly share the initial inputs. Common people can use the algorithms because only for one time common people can easily generate some random numbers by tossing coin. No need of taking any help from third party to procure secret key. Suppose the output of the algorithm , that is a n-bit key, is used to encrypt a n-bit message. Eavesdropper’s probability of guessing the n-bit key/message is 1/2. The system is information theoretically completely secure. However, eavesdropper can steal some messages and decode the message encrypting keys to know their secret keys S , (S ) and , and thereby unused message encrypting keys. This attack is known as plaintext-attack. To know this information eavesdropper has to generate outputs giving his own input sequences S , S ( ) and S .

9ef739d2946eca817c53655a2e1a6bf99abb3cf0	unlynx: a decentralized system for privacy-conscious data sharing		Current solutions for privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple parties either depend on a centralized authority that must be trusted and provides only weakest-link security (e.g., the entity that manages private/secret cryptographic keys), or leverage on decentralized but impractical approaches (e.g., secure multi-party computation). When the data to be shared are of a sensitive nature and the number of data providers is high, these solutions are not appropriate. Therefore, we present UnLynx, a new decentralized system for efficient privacypreserving data sharing. We consider m servers that constitute a collective authority whose goal is to verifiably compute on data sent from n data providers. UnLynx guarantees the confidentiality, unlinkability between data providers and their data, privacy of the end result and the correctness of computations by the servers. Furthermore, to support differentially private queries, UnLynx can collectively add noise under encryption. All of this is achieved through a combination of a set of new distributed and secure protocols that are based on homomorphic cryptography, verifiable shuffling and zero-knowledge proofs. UnLynx is highly parallelizable and modular by design as it enables multiple security/privacy vs. runtime tradeoffs. Our evaluation shows that UnLynx can execute a secure survey on 400,000 personal data records containing 5 encrypted attributes, distributed over 20 independent databases, for a total of 2,000,000 ciphertexts, in 24 minutes.	centralized computing;confidentiality;correctness (computer science);cryptography;database;decentralised system;encryption;formal verification;information privacy;key (cryptography);merge sort;personally identifiable information;secure multi-party computation;trusted operating system;zero-knowledge proof	David Froelicher;Patricia Egger;João Sá Sousa;Jean Louis Raisaro;Zhicong Huang;Christian Mouchet;Bryan Ford;Jean-Pierre Hubaux	2017	PoPETs	10.1515/popets-2017-0047	internet privacy;computer security;differential privacy;encryption;verifiable secret sharing;cryptography;computer science;key (cryptography);data sharing;server;secure multi-party computation;distributed computing	Security	-39.34467221341233	66.35286720719424	29977

Detecting these attacks is quite tough for network operators using misuse-based IDSs because they need to see through attackers and upgrade their IDSs by adding new accurate attack signatures. In this paper, we proposed a novel signal and image processing-based method for detecting network probe and DoS attacks in which prior knowledge of attacks is not required. The method uses a time-frequency representation technique called S-transform, which is an extension of Wavelet Transform, to reveal abnormal frequency components caused by attacks in a traffic signal (e.g., a time-series of the number of packets). Firstly, S-Transform converts the traffic signal to a two-dimensional image which describes time-frequency behavior of the traffic signal. The frequencies that behave abnormally are discovered as abnormal regions in the image. Secondly, Otsu's method is used to detect the abnormal regions and identify time that attacks occur. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method with several network probe and DoS attacks such as port scans, packet flooding attacks, and a low-intensity DoS attack. The results clearly indicated that the method is effective for detecting the probe and DoS attack streams which were generated to real-world Internet.	denial-of-service attack;frequency analysis;image processing;intrusion detection system;network packet;network traffic control;otsu's method;s transform;sensor;signature;thresholding (image processing);time series;time–frequency analysis;time–frequency representation;two-port network;wavelet transform	Sirikarn Pukkawanna;Hiroaki Hazeyama;Youki Kadobayashi;Suguru Yamaguchi	2014	The International Conference on Information Networking 2014 (ICOIN2014)	10.1109/ICOIN.2014.6799482	robust random early detection;the internet;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;network security;computer security;computer network;wavelet transform	Security	-61.392560382838525	66.42753852334504	30034

With the great interest for the connection via mobile platforms, and the growing number of vulnerabilities and attacks, it is essential to provide suitable security solutions regarding the limitations of resource restricted platforms. Although some solutions such as PGP and S/MIME are currently available for the secure e-mail over the Internet, they are based on traditional public key cryptography that involves huge computational costs. In this paper, a new secure application-layer protocol, called SMEmail, is introduced that provides several security attributes such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and forward secrecy of message confidentiality for the electronic mails. SMEmail offers an elliptic curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secure key establishment of a symmetric encryption, and is so suitable for the resource restricted platforms such as mobile phones.	authentication;cipher;confidentiality;digital signature;email encryption;forward secrecy;key exchange;mobile device;mobile phone;non-repudiation;pretty good privacy;public-key cryptography;s/mime;session key;signcryption;symmetric-key algorithm;vulnerability (computing)	Mohsen Toorani	2008	2008 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference	10.1109/ATNAC.2008.4783292	security association;computer science;information security;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.91588061079852	73.46405428850525	30042

However, the integration of different services allows an attacker to cross service boundaries. For example, an attack carried out through the wireless network interface may eventually provide access to the phone functionality. This type of attacks can cause considerable damage because some of the services (e.g., the GSM-based services) charge the user based on the traffic or time of use. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks by developing a proof-of-concept exploit that crosses service boundaries. To address these security issues, we developed a solution based on resource labeling. We modified the kernel of an integrated wireless device so that processes and files are marked in a way that allows one to regulate the access to different system resources. Labels are set when certain network services are accessed. The labeling is then transferred between processes and system resources as a result of either access or execution. We also defined a language for creating labeling rules, and demonstrated how the system can be used to prevent attacks that attempt to cross service boundaries. Experimental evaluation shows that the implementation introduces little overhead. Our security solution is orthogonal to other protection schemes and provides a critical defense for the growing problem of cell phone viruses and worms.	mobile app;mobile phone;network interface;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;smartphone	Collin Mulliner;Giovanni Vigna;David Dagon;Wenke Lee	2006		10.1007/11790754_6	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Security	-47.528559558569384	69.31668924146891	30057

Network forensics is a research area that gathers evidence by collecting and analysing network traffic data logs. This analysis can be a difficult process, especially because of the high variability of these attacks and large amount of data. Therefore, software tools that can help with these digital investigations are in great demand. In this paper, a novel approach to analysing and visualising network traffic data based on growing hierarchical self-organising maps (GHSOM) is presented. The self-organising map (SOM) has been shown to be successful for the analysis of highly-dimensional input data in data mining applications as well as for data visualisation in a more intuitive and understandable manner. However, the SOM has some problems related to its static topology and its inability to represent hierarchical relationships in the input data. The GHSOM tries to overcome these limitations by generating a hierarchical architecture that is automatically determined according to the input data and reflects the inherent hierarchical relationships among them. Moreover, the proposed GHSOM has been modified to correctly treat the qualitative features that are present in the traffic data in addition to the quantitative features. Experimental results show that this approach can be very useful for a better understanding of network traffic data, making it easier to search for evidence of attacks or anomalous behaviour in a network environment.

Various approaches mostly based on virtual machines or emulators have been proposed for the analysis of such envisions. However, the practicality of these approaches is still an open debate. This paper presents a malware analysis system, capable of encountering known evasion methods of malware. A novel technique for detection of malware evasive behavior is presented, which is based on measuring the deviation from normal behavior of a program or malware. Evaluations and analysis show that this approach is effective against detecting the variations in malware behavior. Moreover, countermeasures implemented by the Analysis Evasion Malware Sandbox (AEMS) are effective for large percentage of malware detection.	evasion (network security);malware	Muzzamil Noor;Haider Abbas;Waleed Bin Shahid	2018	J.

Roughly, our framework requires indistinguishability of the real world in which a mechanism is computed over the real dataset, and an ideal world in which a simulator outputs some function of a """"scrubbed"""" version of the dataset (e.g., one in which an individual user's data is removed). In each world, the underlying dataset is drawn from the same distribution in some class (specified as part of the definition), which models the adversary's uncertainty about the dataset. We argue that our framework provides meaningful guarantees in a broader range of settings as compared to previous efforts to model privacy in the presence of adversarial uncertainty. We also show that several natural, """"noiseless"""" mechanisms satisfy our definitional framework under realistic assumptions on the distribution of the underlying data."""	adversary (cryptography);database;definition;privacy;simulation	Raef Bassily;Adam Groce;Jonathan Katz;Adam D.

e85a1ec882ddf83f773889988cc70eb4fa9031de	glasspass: tapping gestures to unlock smart glasses		Wearable technologies such as smart-glasses can sense, store and display sensitive personal contents. In order to protect this data, users need to securely authenticate to their devices. However, current authentication techniques, such as passwords or PINs, are a poor fit for the limited input and output spaces available on wearables. This paper focuses on eyewear and addresses this problem with a novel authentication system that uses an alphabet of simple tapping patterns optimized for rapid and accurate input on the temples (or arms) of glasses. Furthermore, it explores how an eyewear display can support password memorization by privately presenting a visualization of entered symbols. A pair of empirical studies confirm that performance during input of both individual password symbols and full passwords is rapid and accurate. A follow-up session one week after the main study suggests using a private display to show entered password symbols effectively supports memorization.	atm turbo;authentication;coat of arms;input/output;next-generation network;norm (social);password;personal identification number;sim lock;smart card;smartglasses;usability;wearable computer	Md.

Previously, in this setting solutions for retrieval of data in the eecient manner were given, where a user achieves this by interacting with all the databases. We consider the case of both writing and reading. While the case of reading was well studied before, the case of writing was previously completely open. In this paper, we show how to implement both read and write operations, with the following strong security guarantees: all the information about the read/write operation is information-theoretically hidden from all the databases (i.e. both the value of the bit and the address of the bit). As in the previous papers, we measure, as a function of k and n the amount of communication required between a user and all the databases for a single read/write operation, and achieve eecient read/write schemes. Moreover, we show a general reduction from reading database scheme to reading and writing database scheme, with the following guarantees: for any k, given a retrieval only k-database scheme with communication complexity R(k; n) we show a (k + 1) reading and writing database scheme with total communication complexity O R(k; n) (log n) O(1). Our general reduction in combination with the paper of Chor,Goldreich,Kushilevtiz,Sudan] yields: a 3-database scheme with read/write communication complexity of O n 1=3 (log n) 3 ; for all constants k 2, a (k + 1)-database scheme with read/write communication complexity of O n 1=k (log n) 3 ; O(log n)-database scheme with read/write communication complexity of O ?

Our result also implies that eecient instance-hiding schemes where the state can be altered are possible."""	communication complexity;computation;distributed database;information theory;information-theoretic security;interaction;oblivious ram;one-way function;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;random-access memory;read-only memory;read-write memory;simulation	Rafail Ostrovsky;Victor Shoup	1996	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer science;knowledge management;management science;knowledge;business intelligence	Theory	-39.35191488785414	68.52610399397322	30322

The protocol has been found vulnera ble to a replay/mutation attack based on homomorphism by one of the back-ends. In order to fix it, we int grated into the protocol a common solution, including a new addition to the original protocol and the solution proposed by Liu, Ma and Yang, who earlier found a man-in-the-middle attack by me ans of a different model checker instantiated with different session compositions. When we te sted this solution in AVISPA, under both conditions, we discovered that AVISPA considers it safe, wh ile it can be demonstrated that it suffers from the same mutation attack as in the original protocol.	authentication protocol;man-in-the-middle attack;model checking;whole earth 'lectronic link;yang	Alberto Gugel;Benjamin Aziz;G.

In the vast majority of cases, this role is fulfilled by the password, but evidence suggests that this approach is easily compromised. Whilst many alternatives exist, particularly in the form of biometric methods, questions remain over the likely user acceptance. This paper presents the results of a survey that examines user attitudes towards a range of authentication and supervision techniques. It is concluded that whilst there is still an element of reluctance amongst users to depart from the familiar password based mechanisms, many are convinced of the need for improved authentication controls. The acceptability to users of various new techniques is variable, but many seem willing to consider a range of alternative methods.	authentication;biometrics;password;real-time clock;while	Steven Furnell;Paul Dowland;H.

KMM introduces extra communication overhead to UMTS. The previous study, key-tree scheme (KTS), resolves this issue for the IP multicast network. However, this scheme may not be so efficient while applied in UMTS MBMS due to lots of storage space and heavy multicast traffic introduced, which may decrease the QoS of UMTS MBMS. In this paper, we propose a more efficient scheme, Hash function scheme (HFS), to release both storage and communication overhead for KMM in UMTS MBMS. In this paper, we first modify the KTS to be applied in UMTS MBMS. Then we detail HFS. We prove the correctness of HFS. Our study shows that the proposed HFS can reduce both communication and storage overhead without damaging QoS of UMTS MBMS.	correctness (computer science);hash function;internet protocol suite;key management;multimedia broadcast multicast service;overhead (computing);quality of service	Shin-Ming Cheng;Wei-Ru Lai;Phone Lin	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.976	hash function;ip multicast;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;key management;distributed computing;broadcasting;computer network	DB	-47.32002475205245	81.18360415797379	30512

Information flow control is a well-known method for enforcing the confidentiality and integrity of information. This paper demonstrates that these two techniques can be integrated to simultaneously enforce all three major security properties: confidentiality, integrity and availability. It presents a security-typed language with explicit language constructs for supporting secure quorum replication. The dependency analysis performed by the type system of the language provides a way to formally verify the end-to-end security assurance of complex replication schemes. We also contribute a new multilevel timestamp mechanism for synchronizing code and data replicas while controlling previously ignored side channels introduced by such synchronization.	computation;confidentiality;dependence analysis;distributed computing;end-to-end principle;information flow (information theory);non-interference (security);type system	Lantian Zheng;Andrew C.

In this paper, we propose a self-defense mechanism where the DNS resolvers collect a small amount of additional information for the DNS responses they receive and maintain a history of previous responses to guard their clients against misleading information from compromised DNS servers in the Internet. Any organization can choose to enhance its resolvers with our mechanism unilaterally, unlike DNSSEC, which can ensure correctness of information only if the remote DNS server deploys it.	correctness (computer science);domain name system security extensions;internet;malware;phishing;provisioning;server (computing)	Andrew J.

Shibboleth is introduced to our university, providing capabilities of web single sign-on and attribute exchange framework for organizational services. The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) is adopted into Shibboleth as an external authentication, to realize passwordless authentication. Furthermore, we held a feasibility test of an integrated authentication system without password, and considered problems of the passwordless authentication method using FIDO.	authorization;dataflow;experiment;information system;integrated windows authentication;login;packet analyzer;password;phishing;session hijacking;shibboleth;single sign-on;spectral leakage	Michitomo Morii;Hiroki Tanioka;Kenji Ohira;Masahiko Sano;Yosuke Seki;Kenji Matsuura;Tetsushi Ueta	2017	2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.198	s/key;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;computer science;password policy;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;computer security;authentication protocol;data authentication algorithm	Security	-47.67120326340751	63.00232463552485	30736

With the emergence of various multicast-based services, multiple multicast groups are possible to exist within a single network, and mobile subscribers could subscribe to multiple groups concurrently. However, the existing group key management (GKM) protocols intend to secure group communication for just a single group service. The GKM approaches involve inefficient use of keys and huge rekeying overheads, hence unsuitable for multiple multicast group environments. In this paper, we propose a novel GKM protocol for multiple multicast groups, called slot based multiple group key management (SMGKM) scheme. SMGKM supports the movement of single and multiple members across a homogeneous or heterogeneous wireless network while participating in multiple group services with minimized rekeying transmission overheads. Unlike conventional GKM protocols, SMGKM protocol mitigates 1-affect-n phenomenon, single point of failure and investment pressure of signaling load at the core network. The results of the proposed protocol show resource economy in terms of communication bandwidth and storage overheads.	algorithm;authentication;bottleneck (software);emergence;group key;key management;multicast;overhead (computing);reliability engineering;scalability;single point of failure;tek search engine;unicast	Trust Tshepo Mapoka;Simon J.

The existing bit-decomposition algorithms either do not offer sufficient security or are computationally inefficient. In order to provide better security as well as to improve efficiency, we propose a novel probabilistic-based secure bit-decomposition protocol for values encrypted using public key additive homomorphic encryption schemes. The proposed protocol guarantees security as per the semi-honest security definition of secure multi-party computation (MPC) and is also very efficient compared to the existing method. Our protocol always returns the correct result, however, it is probabilistic in the sense that the correct result can be generated in the first run itself with very high probability. The computation time of the proposed protocol grows linearly with the input domain size in bits. We theoretically analyze the complexity of the proposed protocol with the existing method in detail.	algorithm;cluster analysis;homomorphic encryption;public-key cryptography;secure multi-party computation;semiconductor industry;statistical classification;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Bharath K.

Mixminion is an open source, deployed system under active development. It resists known forms of traffic analysis, allowing parties to communicate without revealing their identities.	code;confidentiality;financial cryptography;open-source software;traffic analysis	Nick Mathewson;Roger Dingledine	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27809-2_23	anonymity;computer science;cryptography;operating system;distributed computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;payment	Security	-49.258708329166566	68.24574742236044	30820
a902aa8d4f2fd0df2ed1dfd59a30283a3c6afe9a	hiding in the crowd: a massively distributed algorithm for private averaging with malicious adversaries		The amount of personal data collected in our everyday interactions with connected devices offers great opportunities for innovative services fueled by machine learning, as well as raises serious concerns for the privacy of individuals. In this paper, we propose a massively distributed protocol for a large set of users to privately compute averages over their joint data, which can then be used to learn predictive models. Our protocol can find a solution of arbitrary accuracy, does not rely on a third party and preserves the privacy of users throughout the execution in both the honest-but-curious and malicious adversary models. Specifically, we prove that the information observed by the adversary (the set of maliciours users) does not significantly reduce the uncertainty in its prediction of private values compared to its prior belief. The level of privacy protection depends on a quantity related to the Laplacian matrix of the network graph and generally improves with the size of the graph. Furthermore, we design a verification procedure which offers protection against malicious users joining the service with the goal of manipulating the outcome of the algorithm.	adversary (cryptography);distributed algorithm;interaction;laplacian matrix;machine learning;malware;personally identifiable information;predictive modelling;privacy	Pierre Dellenbach;Aurélien Bellet;Jan Ramon	2018	CoRR		machine learning;distributed algorithm;theoretical computer science;laplacian matrix;verification procedure;adversary;adversary model;artificial intelligence;mathematics;graph	Security	-37.93814375781059	65.0954244839709	30892

Despite that many protective measures have been proposed to solve those issues, such as building firewall, applying for secure routing technology and installing antivirus programs, those measures are unable to ensure the absolute security of the network and tracing the source of the issues. In order to realize the in-depth analysis on warning security risks in the network, this paper introduces several common methods of intrusion detection and the retrospective analysis technology, analyzes the advantage of retrospective analysis system compared to other common methods of intrusion detection, sets forth the design principle of the retrospective analysis system, and concludes that retrospective analysis system is superior to other intrusion detection systems based on an experiment.	antivirus software;firewall (computing);information security;intrusion detection system;routing;spectral leakage	Wei Wu;Nan Cheng;Yubin Wang	2014	2014 Tenth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2014.133	intrusion detection system;cloud computing security;host-based intrusion detection system;the internet;security association;asset;computer science;information security;internet security;security service;internet privacy;security analysis;world wide web;computer security;intrusion prevention system;server	Security	-58.66217984303902	65.5714675018539	30975

In this paper, a statistical approach for the modeling of network intrusions as Markov processes is introduced. The theoretical findings presented here confirm the earlier experimental results of Androulidakis and Papavassiliou. A common notion about network intrusion detection systems is that every packet arriving into a network must be inspected in order to prevent intrusions. This investigation, together with the earlier experimental results, disproves that notion. Additional experimental testing of a corporate local area network is reported.	high-level programming language;interval exchange transformation;intrusion detection system;network packet;network security;overhead (computing);sampling (signal processing)	Ezzat G.

e71dfb37402252ef66072518720fc217891e1bd4	an intelligent approach of sniffer detection		ARP cache poisoning and putting host Network Interface Card (NIC) in promiscuous mode are ways of sniffer attacks. ARP cache poisoning attack is effective in an environment which is not broadcast in nature (like switch LAN environment) and other attack is effective in an environment which is broadcast in nature (like hub, bus, access point LAN environments). Sniffing is malicious activity performed by network user and because of this network security is at risk so detection of sniffer is essential task to maintain network security. Sniffer detection techniques can be divided into two main categories. First category’s techniques are used to detect a sniffer host that runs it’s NIC into promiscuous mode and second category’s techniques are used to detect a sniffer host that uses ARP cache poisoning for sniffing. The network configuration is hidden form users. Network users do not have any information about nature of network. Therefore, users of network may invoke such sniffer detection technique that is not effective in that environment. This may result in sharing of his private and confidential information with malicious users. In this paper, we designed an intelligent invocation module that checks the nature of environment automatically and invokes appropriate, sniffer detection technique for that environment. With the help of this invocation module it is possible to detect passive as well as active sniffer hosts in both environments.	arp spoofing;confidentiality;dns spoofing;network interface controller;network security;packet analyzer;promiscuous mode;usb hub;wireless access point	Abdul Nasir Khan;Kalim Qureshi;Sumair Khan	2012	Int.

Our system is the first to recover Byzantine-faulty replicas proactively and it performs well because it uses symmetric rather than public-key cryptography for authentication. The recovery mechanism allows us to tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become faulty within a window of vulnerability that is small under normal conditions. The window may increase under a denial-of-service attack but we can detect and respond to such attacks. The paper presents results of experiments showing that overall performance is good and that even a small window of vulnerability has little impact on service latency.	asynchronous system;authentication;be file system;breadth-first search;byzantine fault tolerance;denial-of-service attack;electronic signature;elegant degradation;experiment;high availability;internet;intrusion detection system;library (computing);malware;proactive parallel suite;public-key cryptography;robustness (computer science);state machine replication;symmetric-key algorithm;vulnerability (computing)	Miguel Castro;Barbara Liskov	2000			real-time computing;computer science;quantum byzantine agreement;distributed computing;public-key cryptography;finite-state machine;computer security;denial-of-service attack	OS	-35.16476781570921	65.42927056086342	31097

Anonymity mechanism in ad hoc networks is a critical securing measure method employed to mitigate these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel secure and anonymous source routing protocol, called SADSR, based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) for wireless ad hoc networks. In the proposed scheme, we use the pseudonym, pseudonym based cryptography and the bloom filter to establish secure and anonymous routing in wireless ad hoc networks. Compared to other anonymous routing protocol, SADSR is not only anonymous but also the secure in the routing discover process and data transmission process.	ansi escape code;bloom filter;hoc (programming language)	Li Xu;Sisheng Chen;Xinyi Huang;Yi Mu	2010	IJSN	10.1504/IJSN.2010.030721	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;exor;optimized link state routing protocol;routing;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic source routing;information security;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;ad hoc wireless distribution service;link-state routing protocol;computer security;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Mobile	-46.86049383366031	79.16948703071363	31138

Because of its decentralized operation, these nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Video transmission over MANETs is more challenging than over conventional wireless networks due to rapid topology changes and lack of central administration. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume that all nodes are working within a cooperative and friendly network context. However, misbehaving nodes that exhibit abnormal behaviors can disrupt the network operation and affect the network availability by refusing to cooperate to route packets due to their selfish or malicious behavior. In this paper, we examine the effect of packet dropping attacks on video transmission over MANETs. We also study the effects of mitigation using intrusion detection systems to MANET in presence of video traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study multimedia over such environments. We propose a novel intrusion detection system, which is an adaptive acknowledgment scheme (AACK) with the ability to detect misbehaved nodes and avoid them in other transmissions. The aim of AACK scheme is to overcome watchdog weaknesses due to collisions and limited transmission power and also to improve TWOACK scheme. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme, simulation experiments are performed. The results of our experiments show that MPEG4 is more suitable for our simulation environment than H264 video traffic. The simulation results show that AACK scheme provides better network performance with less overhead than other schemes; it also shows that AACK outperforms both TWOACK and watchdog in video transmission applications in the presence of misbehaving nodes.	ansi escape code;acknowledgment index;end-to-end principle;experiment;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;malware;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);routing;simulation;store and forward;tokenization (data security);watchdog timer	Tarek R.

3ec26c92b91e4105bc41e28147c6f4b0a006b896	identity-based cryptosystems		I Background Identity-based public key cryptography is a paradigm introduced by Shamir in  []. His motivation was to simplify key management and remove the need for public key certificates as much as possible by letting the user’s public key be the binary sequence corresponding to an information identifying him in a nonambiguous way (e-mail address, IP address combined to a user name, telephone number, etc). The removal of certificates allows avoiding the trust problems encountered in current public key infrastructures (PKIs): it is no longer necessary to bind a public key to its owner’s name since those are one single thing, and it also simplifies key management since public keys are human-memorizable. These systems involve trusted authorities called private key generators (PKGs) that have to deliver private keys to users after having derived them from their identity information (users do not generate their key pairs themselves) using a master secret key. End users do not have to enquire for a certificate for their public key. The only things that still must be certified are the public keys of trusted authorities. This does not completely eliminate the need for certificates but, sincemanyusers depend on the same authority, this need is drastically reduced. Several practical solutions for identitybased signatures (IBS) have been devised since  [, , ], but finding a practical identity-based encryption scheme (IBE) remained an open challenge until  when elegant solutions were provided by Boneh and Franklin [] and Cocks []. Other identity-based signatures were proposed after  (e.g., [, ]). Basically, an identity-based cryptosystem consists of four algorithms. First, a Setup algorithm, which is run by a PKG, takes as input a security parameter to output a public/private master key pair (mpk,msk) for the PKG. A key generation algorithm Keygen is also run by the PKG: it takes as input the PKG’s master secret key msk and a user’s identity ID to return the user’s private key dID . In the case of identity-based encryption, the third algorithm is an encryption algorithm Encrypt that can be publicly run by anyone and takes as input a plaintext M, the recipient’s identity, and the PKG’s master public key mpk to output a ciphertext C. The last algorithm is then the decryption algorithm Decrypt that takes as input the ciphertext C and the private decryption key dID to return a plaintext M. In the case of identity-based signatures, the last two algorithms are the signature generation algorithm Sign that, given a message M, the PKG’s public key and a private key dID generates a signature on M that can be verified by anyone thanks to the signature verification algorithm Verify. The latter takes as input the PKG’s key	algorithm;antivirus software;bitstream;certificate authority;ciphertext;cryptosystem;digital identity;enquire;email;franklin electronic publishers;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;key (cryptography);key generation;key management;keygen;plaintext;programming paradigm;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;security parameter;signature;telephone number;user (computing)	Benoît Libert;Jean-Jacques Quisquater	2011		10.1007/978-1-4419-5906-5_127	computer graphics (images);solenoid;cryptosystem;drum;scanner;tray;copying;computer science	Crypto	-36.94461075929611	78.84959557175219	31167

Our approach, which we call randomize-and-link, uses large checksum cords to """"link"""" message fragments in a way that is highly scalable, for the checksums serve both as associative addresses and data integrity verifiers. The main advantage of these checksum cords is that they spread the addresses of possible router messages across a spectrum that is too large for the attacker to easily create messages that collide with legitimate messages. Our methods therefore scale to attack trees containing hundreds of routers and do not require that a victim know the topology of the attack tree a priori. In addition, by utilizing authenticated dictionaries in a novel way, our methods do not require routers sign any setup messages individually."""	attack tree;authentication;checksum;data integrity;dictionary;ip traceback;item unique identification;network packet;programming paradigm;router (computing);scalability	Michael T.

Due to the concerns of personal privacy, the Jaccard Coefficient cannot be computed directly between two independently owned datasets. The problem, secure computation of the Jaccard Coefficient for multisets (SJCM), considers the situation where two parties want to securely compute the random shares of the Jaccard Coefficient between their multisets. During the process, the content of each party's multiset is not disclosed to the other party and also the value of Jaccard Coefficient should be hidden from both parties. Secure computation of multiset intersection cardinality is an important sub-problem of SJCM. Existing methods when applied to solve such a problem can lead to either insecure or inefficient solutions. Our work addresses this gap. We first present a basic SJCM protocol constructed using the existing secure dot product method as a sub-routine. Then, as a major contribution, we propose an approximated version of our basic protocol to improve efficiency without compromising accuracy much. We provide various experimental results to show that the proposed protocols are significantly more efficient than the existing techniques when the domain size is small using both simulated and real datasets.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;coefficient;image segmentation;jaccard index;privacy;secure multi-party computation;similarity measure	Bharath K.

For many Internet applications, the ability to protect the identity of participants and the characteristics of their communication in distributed applications is critical. For such applications, a number of traffic camouflaging systems have been developed over the past several years. The effectiveness of these systems relies greatly on (1) the protocol by which messages are (re-)routed among the participants and (2) the scheme by which links are padded. In this talk, we discuss our recent discoveries on the effectiveness of these camouflaging methods. Our results contradict some of the methods that have been commonly used. For example, we find that using more agents in re-routing may not necessarily increase the probability that a sender can be identified. Furthermore, padding links with a constant-bit rate pattern may result in the worst probability; that an adversary can identify the underlying payload status.

8efa3107aa906df58876998c3987e3ce11112c32	authenticating compromisable storage systems		A service may be implemented over several servers, and those servers may become compromised by an attacker, e.g. through software vulnerabilities. When this happens, the service manager will remove the vulnerabilities and re-instate the server. Typically, this will involve regenerating the public key by which clients authenticate the service, and revoking the old one. This paper presents a scheme which allows a storage service composed of several servers to create a group public key in a decentralised manner, and maintain its security even when such compromises take place. By maintaining keys for a long term, we reduce the reliance on public-key certification. The storage servers periodically update the decryption secrets corresponding to a public key, in such a way that secrets gained by an attacker are rendered useless after an update takes place. An attacker would have to compromise all the servers within a short period lying between two updates in order to fully compromise the system.	authentication;cloud storage;clustered file system;computer data storage;epoch (reference date);operating system service management;provable security;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;server (computing);vulnerability (computing)	Jiangshan Yu;Mark Ryan;Liqun Chen	2017	2017 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS	10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.216	computer security;computer network;information security;public-key cryptography;computer science;service management;malware;certification;server;compromise;authentication	Security	-43.228544713588484	68.68464524544713	31603
35de6d62e876715b0526bcf31a5c11fd3d19bffb	practical dos attacks on embedded networks in commercial vehicles		The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol has become the primary choice for in-vehicle communications for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. However, it is possible for malicious adversaries to cause major damage by exploiting flaws in the CAN protocol design or implementation. Researchers have shown that an attacker can remotely inject malicious messages into the CAN network in order to disrupt or alter normal vehicle behavior. Some of these attacks can lead to catastrophic consequences for both the vehicle and the driver. Although there are several defense techniques against CAN based attacks, attack surfaces like physically and remotely controllable Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can be used to launch attacks on protocols running on top of the CAN network, such as the SAE J1939 protocol. Commercial vehicles adhere to the SAE J1939 standards that make use of the CAN protocol for physical communication and that are modeled in a manner similar to that of the ISO/OSI 7 layer protocol stack. We posit that the J1939 standards can be subjected to attacks similar to those that have been launched successfully on the OSI layer protocols. Towards this end, we demonstrate how such attacks can be performed on a test-bed having 3 J1939 speaking ECUs connected via a single high-speed CAN bus. Our main goal is to show that the regular operations performed by the J1939 speaking ECUs can be disrupted by manipulating the packet exchange protocols and specifications made by J1939 data-link layer standards.

The goal is to provide a more realistic balance between forward privacy and security, resistance against denial of service attacks, and computational efficiency (in tags and readers) than existing protocols. We achieve this goal by solely relying on a stream cipher—which can be arbitrarily chosen, for instance a stream cipher design aimed at extremely lightweight hardware implementations—and we provide security proofs for our new protocol in the standard model, under the assumption that the underlying stream cipher is secure.	authentication protocol;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;privacy;stream cipher;tag (metadata)	Olivier Billet;Jonathan Etrog;Henri Gilbert	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13858-4_4	block cipher mode of operation;computer science;stream cipher attack;internet privacy;computer security;cbc-mac;computer network	Security	-39.81519653194851	76.78523080494628	31617
258d9631d4131a106c66400e034f293cb6ca504f	tight security bounds for key-alternating ciphers		A t-round key-alternating cipher (also called iterated Even-Mansour cipher) can be viewed as an abstraction of AES. It defines a cipher E from t fixed public permutations P1, . . . , Pt : {0, 1} → {0, 1} and a key k = k0‖ · · · ‖kt ∈ {0, 1} by setting Ek(x) = kt⊕Pt(kt−1⊕Pt−1(· · · k1⊕P1(k0⊕ x) · · · )). The indistinguishability of Ek from a truly random permutation by an adversary who also has oracle access to the (public) random permutations P1, . . . , Pt was investigated in 1997 by Even and Mansour for t = 1 and for higher values of t in a series of recent papers. For t = 1, Even and Mansour proved indistinguishability security up to 2 queries, which is tight. Much later Bogdanov et al. (2011) conjectured that security should be 2 t t+1 n queries for general t, which matches an easy distinguishing attack (so security cannot be more) . A number of partial results have been obtained supporting this conjecture, besides Even and Mansour’s original result for t = 1: Bogdanov et al. proved security of 2 2 3 n for t ≥ 2, Steinberger (2012) proved security of 2 3 4 n for t ≥ 3, and Lampe, Patarin and Seurin (2012) proved security of 2 t t+2 n for all even values of t, thus “barely” falling short of the desired 2 t t+1 . Our contribution in this work is to prove the long-sought-for security bound of 2 t t+1 , up to a constant multiplicative factor depending on t. Our method is essentially an application of Patarin’s H-coefficient technique. Introduction Given t permutations P1, . . ., Pt : {0, 1} n → {0, 1}n the t-round key-alternating cipher based on P1, . . . , Pt is a blockcipher E : {0, 1} (t+1)n × {0, 1}n → {0, 1}n of keyspace {0, 1}(t+1)n and message space {0, 1}n, where for a key k = k0‖k1‖ · · · ‖kt ∈ {0, 1} (t+1)n and a message x ∈ {0, 1}n we set E(k, x) = kt ⊕ Pt(kt−1 ⊕ Pt−1(· · ·P1(k0 ⊕ x) · · · )). (1) (See Figure 1.) Plainly, E(k, ·) is a permutation of {0, 1}n for each fixed k ∈ {0, 1}(t+1)n ; we let E−1(k, ·) denote the inverse permutation. The Pi’s are called the round permutations of E and t is the number of rounds of E. Thus t and the permutations P1, . . . , Pt are parameters determining E. k0 P1 k1 P2 k2 P3 b b b Pt kt Figure 1: A t-round key alternating cipher.	adversary (cryptography);box counting;cipher;distinguishing attack;emoticon;iteration;key (cryptography);key schedule;matthews correlation coefficient;random permutation;xor-encrypt-xor	Shan Chen;John P.

In this paper we use the concept of information leakage to evaluate the strength of Sboxes and SP networks. We define a n equivalence class on n x n S-boxes that is invariant in information leakage. Simulation results for a 16x 16 SP network suggest that after a sufficient number of rounds the distribution of the output XOR in the SP network looks random. We further present simulation results to show that the information leakage for a n SP network diminishes more rapidly with the number of rounds when the S-boxes are cryptographically strong.	exclusive or;information leakage;point of view (computer hardware company);s-box;simulation;spectral leakage;strong cryptography;theory;turing completeness	M.

After analyzing several attacks including latticereduction attacks, they claimed that its security was high, although the cryptosystem had some resemblances with the former knapsack cryptosystems, since decryption could be viewed as a multiplicative knapsack problem. In this paper, we show how to recover the private key from a fraction of the public key in less than 10 minutes for the suggested choice of parameters. The attack is based on a systematic use of the notion of the orthogonal lattice which we introduced as a cryptographic tool at Crypto ’97. This notion allows us to attack the linearity hidden in the scheme.	congruence of squares;cryptanalysis;cryptosystem;knapsack cryptosystems;knapsack problem;merkle–damgård construction;public-key cryptography;sac;syntactic monoid	Phong Q.

While the mechanics of certifying and revoking public keys and escrowing and recovering private keys have been widely explored, less attention has been paid to access control frameworks for regulating access to stored keys by different parties. In this article we propose such a framework for a key management service that supports public key registration, lookup, and revocation, and private key escrow, protected use (e.g., to decrypt selected messages), and recovery. We propose an access control model using a policy based on principal, ownership, and authority relationships on keys. The model allows owners to grant to others (and revoke) privileges to execute various actions on their keys. The simple authorization language is very expressive, enabling the specification of authorizations for composite subjects that can be fully specified (ground) or partially specified, thus making the authorizations applicable to all subjects satisfying some conditions. We illustrate how the access control policy and the authorizations can easily be expressed through a simple and restricted, hence efficiently computable, form of logic language.	access control;authorization;computable function;credential;cryptographic hash function;e-commerce;encryption;expressive power (computer science);key escrow;key management;lookup table;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;secure communication	Pierangela Samarati;Michael K.

Simulations using real network traces and the Snort rule set show that a pre-filter can reduce up to 90% of network traffic that would have otherwise been processed by Snort software.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) deals with huge amount of network traffic and uses large feature set to discriminate normal pattern and intrusive pattern. However, most of existing systems lack the ability to process data for real-time anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a 3-Tier Iterative Feature Selection Engine (IFSEng) for feature subspace selection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is used for the pre-processing of data. Mahalanobis Distance Map (MDM) is used to discover hidden correlations between the features and between the packets. We also propose a novel Real-time Payload-based Intrusion Detection System (RePIDS) that integrates a 3-Tier IFSEng and the MDM approach. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) dissimilarity criterion is used to classify each packet as either a normal or an attack packet. The effectiveness of the proposed RePIDS is evaluated using DARPA 99 dataset and Georgia Institute of Technology attack dataset. The traffic for Web-based application is considered for validating our model. F-value, a criterion, is used to evaluate the detection performance of RePIDS. Experimental results show that RePIDS achieves better performance (high F-values, 0.9958 for DARPA 99 dataset and 0.976 for Georgia Institute of Technology attack dataset respectively, with only 0.85% false alarm rate) and lower computational complexity when compared against two state-of-the-art payload-based intrusion detection systems. Additionally, it has 1.3 time higher throughput in comparison with real scenario of medium sized enterprise network. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While early works in the field mainly threatened the security of smart cards and simple processors, several recent publications have shown the vulnerability of hardware implementations as well. In particular, field programmable gate arrays are attractive options for hardware implementation of encryption algorithms,but their security against power analysis is a serious concern, as we discuss in this paper. For this purpose, we present recent results of attacks attempted against standard encryption algorithms, provide a theoretical estimation of these attacks based on simple statistical parameters and evaluate the cost and security of different possible countermeasures.

However, since compression has been much in use well before users saw the need for security, most are more familiar with compression software than they are with security ones. Therefore, encryption-enabled compression software such as WinRAR and WinZip tend to be more widely used for security than a dedicated security software. In this paper, we present several attacks on the encryption feature provided by the WinRAR compression software. These attacks are possible due to the subtlety in developing security software based on the integration of multiple cryptographic primitives. In other words, no matter how securely designed each primitive is, using them especially in association with other primitives does not always guarantee secure systems. Instead, time and again such a practice has shown to result in flawed systems. Our results, compared to recent attacks on WinZip by Kohno, show that WinRAR appears to offer slightly better security features.		Gary S.-W. Yeo;Raphael C.-W.

However, one can also use domain preserving keyed Pseudo Random Functions(PRF) to instantiate MAC modes. The very first security proof of CBC-MAC [BKR00], essentially modeled the PRP as a PRF. Until now very little work has been done to investigate the difference between PRP vs PRF instantiations. Only known result is the rather loose folklore PRP-PRF transition of any PRP based security proof, which looses a factor of O( 2 2n ) (domain of PRF/PRP is {0, 1} and adversary makes σ many PRP/PRF calls in total). This loss is significant, considering the fact tight Θ( q 2 2n ) security bounds have been known for PRP based EMAC and ECBC constructions (where q is the total number of adversary queries). In this work, we show for many variations of encrypted CBC MACs (i.e. EMAC, ECBC, FCBC, XCBC and TCBC), random function based instantiation has a security bound O( qσ 2n ). This is a significant improvement over the folklore PRP/PRF transition. We also show this bound is optimal by providing an attack against the underlying PRF based CBC construction. This shows for EMAC, ECBC and FCBC, PRP instantiations are substantially more secure than PRF instantiations. Where as, for XCBC and TMAC, PRP instantiations are at least as secure as PRF instantiations.		Ashwin Jha;Avradip Mandal;Mridul Nandi	2017	IACR Trans.

5f5f5fe8533b106a8d1e29dcbdf8ae7000882f3b	pisces: anonymous communication using social networks.		The architectures of deployed anonymity systems such as Tor suffer from two key problems that limit user’s trust in these systems. First, paths for anonymous communication are built without considering trust relationships between users and relays in the system. Second, the network architecture reli es on a set of centralized servers. In this paper, we proposePisces, a decentralized protocol for anonymous communications tha t leverages users’ social links to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that such an approach greatly improves the system’s resilience to attackers. A fundamental challenge in this setting is the design of a secure process to discover peers for use in a user’s circuit. All existing solutions for secure peer discovery leverage stru ctured topologies and cannot be applied to unstructured social net work topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using random wal ks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected nodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To secure the random walks, we leverage thereciprocal neighbor policy: if malicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to improv e the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a titfortat approach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes f rom their routing tables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy, and use it to build the Pisces anon ymity system. Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network topologies, we show that (a) the reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active attacks that an adversary can perform, (b) our decentralized protocol to enforce this policy is secure and has low overhead, and (c) the overall anonymity provided by our system significantly outperforms existing approaches.	adversary (cryptography);centralized computing;collaboration graph;emoticon;experiment;lotus improv;malware;network architecture;network topology;overhead (computing);peering;relay;routing table;social network;tor messenger;write-ahead logging	Prateek Mittal;Matthew K.

b2814b3076897082250a4406f48c806f40a45780	improved zero-correlation and impossible differential cryptanalysis of reduced-round simeck block cipher		SIMECK is a family of three lightweight block ciphers designed by Yang et al., following the framework used by Beaulieu et al. from the United States National Security Agency to design SIMON and SPECK. In this study, the authors employ an improved miss-in-the-middle approach to find zero correlation linear distinguishers and impossible differentials on SIMECK48 and SIMECK64. Based on this novel technique, they will be able to present zero-correlation linear approximations for 15-round SIMECK48 and 17-round SIMECK64 and these zero-correlation linear approximations improve the previous best result by two rounds for SIMECK48 and SIMECK64. Moreover, they attack 27-round SIMECK48 and 31-round SIMECK64 based on these zero-correlation linear distinguishers. In addition, due to the duality of zero-correlation and impossible differential, they search for the impossible differential characteristics for SIMECK48 and SIMECK64 so that they will be able to present 15-round SIMECK48 and 17-round SIMECK64 while the best previously known results were 13-round impossible differentials for SIMECK48 and 15-round impossible differentials for SIMECK64. Moreover, they propose impossible differential attacks on 22-round SIMECK48 and 24-round SIMECK64 based on these impossible differential characteristics. The results significantly improve the previous zero correlation attack and impossible differential characteristic results for these variants of SIMECK to the best of the authors’ knowledge.	block cipher;impossible differential cryptanalysis	Sadegh Sadeghi;Nasour Bagheri	2018	IET Information Security	10.1049/iet-ifs.2016.0590	differential (mechanical device);impossible differential cryptanalysis;theoretical computer science;duality (optimization);arithmetic;differential cryptanalysis;correlation attack;correlation;computer science;block cipher	Crypto	-37.29136981444149	81.90165099968766	32585
725d9ccb294c4119fd4bf1b32ed2dd4639f9aa1f	precautions taken against various potential attacks		This paper describes a digital signature scheme giving message recovery>> in order to submit it to the public scrutiny of IACR (the International Association for Cryptologic Research). This scheme is currently prepared by Subcommittee SC27, Security Techniques, inside Joint Technical Committee JTCl, Information Technology, established by both IS0 (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission). The digital signature scheme specified in DIS 9796 does not involve any hash-function. It allows a minimum resource requirement for verification. And it avoids various attacks against the generic algorithms in use. Definition : An operation (addition, multiplication, power.. .) modulo n is matural>> when, being less than the modulus, the result does not involve the modulo reduction. Attacks by natural products The exponential function is the basis of the signature schemes based upon RSA (odd verification exponents), and more generally, based upon exponentials in a ring (including even verification exponents). Under the exponential function, the image of a product of several constants is the product of the images of these constants. A subtle and efficient attack has teen recently formulated by Don Coppersmith against annex D of CCI’IT X509, alias ISO/IEC 9594-8. The attacks by natural products have been definitely excluded in DIS 9796. Attacks by natural powers If a natural v-th power is a legitimate argument of the secret function <<raising to the power s mod nn, then anyone can easily produce the natural v-th root of this argument as a legitimate signature. And even more dangerous, if the verification exponent is even, then signing a natural v-th power may reveal the modulus factorization (cf. Rabin syndrom). In DIS 9796, the natural powers cannot be legitimate arguments to the secret function ((raising to the powers mod n>>. DIS 9796 is under a 6-month DIS ballot (closed in September 1990) by IS0 and IEC Members. This is a major step towards the adoption of an International Standard. ’ CCEn I EPT, 4, Rue du Clos Courtel, BP 59, F-3551 2, Cesson S&ignB, France 2 Philips Research Laboratories, 2.

1f0138aad99aa6b8f72c9b67be2ea7907505150c	the internet of names: a dns big dataset		The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core infrastructure of the Internet. Tracking changes in the DNS over time provides valuable information about the evolution of the Internetu0027s infrastructure. Until now, only one large-scale approach to perform these kinds of measurements existed, passive DNS (pDNS). While pDNS is useful for applications like tracing security incidents, it does not provide sufficient information to reliably track DNS changes over time. We use a complementary approach based on active measurements, which provides a unique, comprehensive dataset on the evolution of DNS over time. Our high-performance infrastructure performs Internet-scale active measurements, currently querying over 50% of the DNS name space on a daily basis. Our infrastructure is designed from the ground up to enable big data analysis approaches on, e.g., a Hadoop cluster. With this novel approach we aim for a quantum leap in DNS-based measurement and analysis of the Internet.

9e0d5cc43e6df77aff512c6730b7a97d982cb812	efficient integrity auditing for shared data in the cloud with secure user revocation		With the cloud storage services, users can easily form a group and share data with each other. Given the fact that the cloud is not trustable, users need to compute signatures for blocks of the shared data to allow public integrity auditing. Once a user is revoked from the group, the blocks that were previously signed by this revoked user must be re-signed by an existing user, which may result in heavy communication and computation cost for the user. Proxy re-signatures can be used here to allow the cloud to do the re-signing work on behalf of the group. However, a malicious cloud is able to use the re-signing keys to arbitrarily convert signatures from one user to another deliberately. Moreover, collusions between revoked users and a malicious cloud will disclose the secret values of the existing users. In this paper, we propose a novel public auditing scheme for the integrity of shared data with efficient and collusion-resistant user revocation utilizing the concept of Shamir secret sharing. Besides, our scheme also supports secure and efficient public auditing due to our improved polynomial-based authentication tags. The numerical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is provably secure and highly efficient.	antivirus software;authentication;cloud computing;cloud storage;computation;malware;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);polynomial;provable security;proxy re-encryption;replay attack;shamir's secret sharing;type signature	Yuchuan Luo;Ming Xu;Shaojing Fu;Dongsheng Wang;Junquan Deng	2015	2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA	10.1109/Trustcom.2015.404	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-41.89107833317928	68.29670396093057	32782
2bd830b9926d625b8710eeab7faf64778cf3d6ce	multipurpose identity-based signcryption : a swiss army knife for identity-based cryptography		Identity-Based (IB) cryptography is a rapidly emerging approach to public-key cryptography that does not require principals to pre-compute key pairs and obtain certificates for their public keys— instead, public keys can be arbitrary identifiers such as email addresses, while private keys are derived at any time by a trusted private key generator upon request by the designated principals. Despite the flurry of recent results on IB encryption and signature, some questions regarding the security and efficiency of practicing IB encryption (IBE) and signature (IBS) as a joint IB signature/encryption (IBSE) scheme with a common set of parameters and keys, remain unanswered. We first propose a stringent security model for IBSE schemes. We require the usual strong security properties of: (for confidentiality) indistinguishability against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks, and (for nonrepudiation) existential unforgeability against chosen-message insider attacks. In addition, to ensure as strong as possible ciphertext armoring, we also ask (for anonymity) that authorship not be transmitted in the clear, and (for unlinkability) that it remain unverifiable by anyone except (for authentication) by the legitimate recipient alone. We then present an efficient IBSE construction, based on bilinear pairings, that satisfies all these security requirements, and yet is as compact as pairing-based IBE and IBS in isolation. Our scheme is secure, compact, fast and practical, offers detachable signatures, and supports multirecipient encryption with signature sharing for maximum scalability.	adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack;antivirus software;authentication;bilinear filtering;ciphertext;confidentiality;cryptosystem;email;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;identifier;key generator;non-repudiation;plaintext;public-key cryptography;requirement;scalability;signcryption	Xavier Boyen	2003	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_23	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-39.58902552458108	75.14359612990759	32818

We argue that these restrictions preclude interesting applications, make usage of the schemes error-prone and are generally undesirable in practice. Via a new analysis and proof, we show how the restrictions can be lifted, yielding the first truly unrestricted aggregate signature scheme. Via another new analysis and proof, we show that the distinct signer restriction on the sequential aggregate signature schemes of [18] can also be dropped, yielding an unrestricted sequential aggregate signature scheme. Finally, we present variants of these schemes with tight security reductions. 1 Supported by NSF grants CNS-0524765 and CNS-0627779, and a gift from Intel Corporation. 2 Supported by the Thailand Research Fund. 3 Postdoctoral Fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders, supported in part by the Concerted Research Action Ambiorics 2005/11 of the Flemish Government and the European Commission through the IST Programme under Contract IST-2002-507932 ECRYPT.	aggregate data;aggregate function;cognitive dimensions of notations;digital signature;ecrypt;ibm notes;public-key cryptography	Mihir Bellare;Chanathip Namprempre;Gregory Neven	2006	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-540-73420-8_37	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;public-key cryptography;algorithm	Crypto	-35.53268883626543	76.89697592319901	32866

ee3ef825d93b36e4e7a9f1a802e60503c2870e24	pareto optimal security resource allocation for internet of things		In many Internet of Thing (IoT) application domains security is a critical requirement, because malicious parties can undermine the effectiveness of IoT-based systems by compromising single components and/or communication channels. Thus, a security infrastructure is needed to ensure the proper functioning of such systems even under attack. However, it is also critical that security be at a reasonable resource and energy cost. In this article, we focus on the problem of efficiently and effectively securing IoT networks by carefully allocating security resources in the network area. In particular, given a set of security resources R and a set of attacks to be faced A, our method chooses the subset of R that best addresses the attacks in A, and the set of locations where to place them, that ensure the security coverage of all IoT devices at minimum cost and energy consumption. We model our problem according to game theory and provide a Pareto-optimal solution in which the cost of the security infrastructure, its energy consumption, and the probability of a successful attack are minimized. Our experimental evaluation shows that our technique improves the system robustness in terms of packet delivery rate for different network topologies. Furthermore, we also provide a method for handling the computation of the resource allocation plan for large-scale networks scenarios, where the optimization problem may require an unreasonable amount of time to be solved. We show how our proposed method drastically reduces the computing time, while providing a reasonable approximation of the optimal solution.	approximation;computation;game theory;internet of things;malware;mathematical optimization;network packet;network topology;optimization problem;pareto efficiency	Antonino Rullo;Daniele Midi;Edoardo Serra;Elisa Bertino	2017	ACM Trans.

Reputation based trust management has been identified in the literature as a viable solution to the problem. However, the mechanism faces the challenges of subjectively, experiential weighting referrals when aggregating recommendation information. Furthermore, not considering some malicious attacks when building trust relationship between peers in the existing schemes make trust model very vulnerable. This paper presents P2PTrust-a new trust framework based on reputation for unstructured P2P networks. In P2PTrust, except reputation value, reputation revision value is also taken into account in order to deal with the dynamic or spoiling behavior of peers, which makes P2PTrust differ from other trust models based on the reputation only. Considering the credibility of peers' referrals, a credibility quantification and update scheme is proposed in the paper as reliable means of seeking honest feedbacks. Subsequent experimental results show that, compared to the existing trust models, our scheme is robust in systems where the vast majority of users are malicious and more advanced in successful transaction rate.	e-commerce;malware;peer-to-peer;trust management (information system)	Chunqi Tian;Shihong Zou;LingWei Chu;Shiduan Cheng	2008	2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference	10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745120	e-commerce;communications protocol;trust anchor;computer science;peer-to-peer;reliability;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computational trust;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-59.81557926558296	72.88260783970223	32965

These d permutations will be called the “internal” permutations, and d is the number of rounds of the Misty scheme. Misty schemes are important from a practical point of view since for example, the Kasumi algorithm based on Misty schemes has been adopted as the standard block cipher in the third generation mobile systems. In this paper we describe the best known “generic” attacks on Misty schemes, i.e. attacks when the internal permutations do not have special properties, or are randomly chosen. We describe known plaintext attacks (KPA), non-adaptive chosen plaintext attacks (CPA-1) and adaptive chosen plaintext and ciphertext attacks (CPCA-2) against these schemes. Some of these attacks were previously known, some are new. When d = 5 rounds, it is shown in [6] that a CPA-1 exists with complexity 2. We will present completely different attacks with d = 5 and the same complexity. We will also present new attacks for d ≤ 4 and d ≥ 6. For d ≥ 6 the complexity will be greater than 2, so these attacks will be useful only when n is small.	algorithm;block cipher;ciphertext;complexity;cryptography;discrete logarithm;kasumi ninja;known-plaintext attack;plaintext;pseudorandomness;randomness;upwind scheme	Valérie Nachef;Jacques Patarin;Joana Treger	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14712-8_14	discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computer security	Crypto	-38.029623938541675	78.86281451192544	32986

However, cloud computing also raises security and privacy concerns since the users have no physical control over the outsourced data. This paper focuses on fairly retrieving encrypted private medical records outsourced to remote untrusted cloud servers in the case of medical accidents and disputes. Our goal is to enable an independent committee to fairly recover the original private medical records so that medical investigation can be carried out in a convincing way. We achieve this goal with a fair remote retrieval (FRR) model in which either t investigation committee members cooperatively retrieve the original medical data or none of them can get any information on the medical records. We realize the first FRR scheme by exploiting fair multi-member key exchange and homomorphic privately verifiable tags. Based on the standard computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model (ROM). A detailed performance analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is efficient in terms of communication and computation.	artificial intelligence;cloud computing;computation (action);computational diffie–hellman assumption;epilepsy, female-restricted, with mental retardation (disorder);encryption;formal verification;information retrieval systems;key exchange;numerous;profiling (computer programming);provable security;random oracle	Huaqun Wang;Qianhong Wu;Bo Qin;Josep Domingo-Ferrer	2014	Journal of biomedical informatics	10.1016/j.jbi.2014.02.008	cloud computing;computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;medical record	Security	-43.191657216717836	65.21615503864562	33000

Indeed, Bitcoin's security claims rely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently large portion of the network's overall computational power. Unfortunately, rather than participating independently, most Bitcoin miners join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largely directs the pool's activity, leading to a consolidation of power. Recently, the largest mining pool has accounted for more than half of network's total mining capacity. Relatedly, """"hosted mining"""" service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale, tempting them away from independent participation. We argue that the prevalence of mining coalitions is due to a limitation of the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle -- specifically, that it affords an effective mechanism for enforcing cooperation in a coalition. We present several definitions and constructions for """"nonoutsourceable"""" puzzles that thwart such enforcement mechanisms, thereby deterring coalitions.

In two previous studies, genetic algorithms (GAs) were employed to investigate the randomness of TEA output, based on which distinguishers for TEA could be designed. In this study, we used quantum-inspired genetic algorithms (QGAs) in the cryptanalysis of TEA. Quantum chromosomes in QGAs have the advantage of containing more information than the binary counterpart of the same length in GAs, and therefore generate a more diverse solution pool. We showed that QGAs could discover distinguishers for reduced cycle TEA that are more efficient than those found by classical GAs in two earlier studies. Furthermore, we applied QGAs to break four-cycle and five-cycle TEAs, a considerably harder problem, which the prior GA approach failed to solve.	block cipher;chi;cryptanalysis;feistel cipher;fitness function;genetic algorithm;information;mask (computing);memory footprint;quantum;qubit;randomness;software release life cycle;tea	Wei Hu	2010	JSEA	10.4236/jsea.2010.31006	block cipher;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;algorithm	Crypto	-36.62747159967328	81.7426499179992	33086

a024e20b42c8bb5d1e78327e74a50837fa895a88	tight tradeoffs in searchable symmetric encryption		A searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) scheme enables a client to store data on an untrusted server while supporting keyword searches in a secure manner. Recent experiments have indicated that the practical relevance of such schemes heavily relies on the tradeo between their space overhead, locality (the number of non-contiguous memory locations that the server accesses with each query), and read e ciency (the ratio between the number of bits the server reads with each query and the actual size of the answer). These experiments motivated Cash and Tessaro (EUROCRYPT '14) and Asharov et al. (STOC '16) to construct SSE schemes o ering various such tradeo s, and to prove lower bounds for natural SSE frameworks. Unfortunately, the best-possible tradeo has not been identi ed, and there are substantial gaps between the existing schemes and lower bounds, indicating that a better understanding of SSE is needed. We establish tight bounds on the tradeo between the space overhead, locality and read e ciency of SSE schemes within two general frameworks that capture the memory access pattern underlying all existing schemes. First, we introduce the pad-and-split framework, re ning that of Cash and Tessaro while still capturing the same existing schemes. Within our framework we signi cantly strengthen their lower bound, proving that any scheme with locality L must use space Ω(N logN/ logL) for databases of size N . This is a tight lower bound, matching the tradeo provided by the scheme of Demertzis and Papamanthou (SIGMOD '17) which is captured by our pad-and-split framework. Then, within the statistical-independence framework of Asharov et al. we show that their lower bound is essentially tight: We construct a scheme whose tradeo matches their lower bound within an additive O(log log logN) factor in its read e ciency, once again improving upon the existing schemes. Our scheme o ers optimal space and locality, and nearly-optimal read e ciency that depends on the frequency of the queried keywords: For a keyword that is associated with n = N1− (n) document identi ers, the read e ciency is ω(1) · (n)−1 + O(log log logN) when retrieving its identi ers (where the ω(1) term may be arbitrarily small, and ω(1) · (n)−1 is the lower bound proved by Asharov et al.). In particular, for any keyword that is associated with at most N1−1/o(log log logN) document identi ers (i.e., for any keyword that is not exceptionally common), we provide read e ciency O(log log logN) when retrieving its identi ers. ∗Cornell Tech.

The standard definition of differential privacy is information theoretic in nature, but it is natural to consider computational relaxations and to explore what can be achieved with respect to such notions. Mironov et al. (Crypto 2009) and McGregor et al. (FOCS 2010) recently introduced and studied several variants of computational differential privacy, and show that in the two-party setting (where data is split between two parties) these relaxations can offer significant advantages. Left open by prior work was the extent, if any, to which computational differential privacy can help in the usual client/server setting where the entire database resides at the server, and the client poses queries on this data. We show, for queries with output in R (for constant n) and with respect to a large class of utilities, that any computationally private mechanism can be converted to a statistically private mechanism that is equally efficient and achieves roughly the same utility.	computation;differential privacy;information theory;server (computing);standard-definition television;symposium on foundations of computer science	Adam Groce;Jonathan Katz;Arkady Yerukhimovich	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19571-6_25	standard-definition television;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;client–server model	Crypto	-38.20636963155981	66.88750033339849	33177

In this research, we focused on a unique function of the bots the remote control channel (C&C session). We clarified that the C&C session has unique characteristics that come from the behavior of bot programs. Accordingly, we propose an alternative technique to identify computers compromised by the bot program for the classification of the C&C session from the traffic data using a machine learning algorithm support vector machine (SVM). Our evaluation resulted in 95% accuracy in the identification of the C&C session by using SVM. We evaluated that the packet histogram vector of the session is better than the other vector definitions for the classification of the bot C&C session.	algorithm;botnet;computer;feature vector;internet relay chat;machine learning;network packet;pattern matching;remote control;scalability;sensor;support vector machine	Satoshi Kondo;Naoshi Sato	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-75651-4_7	computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security	Security	-60.844420601127254	66.41889743109837	33179

A network covert channel is created that operates by modulating the time between web resource accesses, with an “average web user” read-time used as a reference. While the covert channel may be classified as timing based, it does not operate by changing deterministic protocol attributes such as inter-packet delay, as do most timing based network covert channels. Instead, our channel communicates by modulating transaction level read-time, which in the web browsing case has significant non-deterministic components. The channel is thus immune to methods typically used to detect timing based network covert	covert channel;extensibility;message authentication code;modulation;network packet;pseudorandom number generator;web page;web resource	Joshua Davis	2014	CoRR		covert channel;modulation;web resource;computer security;computer science;communication channel;database transaction	Security	-54.138899749488715	69.67817064031719	33213

The health data are typically located at different general practices and hospitals. The data analysis consists of local processing at these locations, and the locations become nodes in a computing graph. To support the legal, security and privacy concerns, the proposed toolset for statistical analysis of health data uses a combination of secure multi-party computation (SMC) algorithms, symmetric and public key encryption, and public key infrastructure (PKI) with certificates and a certificate authority (CA). The proposed toolset should cover a wide range of data analysis with different data distributions. To achieve this, large set of possible SMC algorithms and computing graphs have to be supported.	algorithm;certificate authority;distributed computing;encryption;nonlinear system;privacy;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;secure multi-party computation;statistical model;verification and validation	Anders Andersen;Kassaye Yitbarek Yigzaw;Randi Karlsen	2014	2014 IEEE 16th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom)	10.1109/HealthCom.2014.7001845	privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.99394911229197	63.09154665830154	33314

On one hand, service providers want to authenticate legitimate users and make sure they are accessing their authorized services in a legal way. On the other hand, users want to maintain the necessary privacy without being tracked down for wherever they are and whatever they are doing. In this paper, a novel privacy preserving authentication and access control scheme to secure the interactions between mobile users and services in PCEs is proposed. The proposed scheme seamlessly integrates two underlying cryptographic primitives, namely blind signature and hash chain, into a highly flexible and lightweight authentication and key establishment protocol. The scheme provides explicit mutual authentication between a user and a service while allowing the user to anonymously interact with the service. Differentiated service access control is also enabled in the proposed scheme by classifying mobile users into different service groups.

While there are a number of secure double-block-length compression functions, there is little research on generalized constructions. This paper introduces the Counter-bDM family of multi-block-length compression functions, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first provably secure block-cipher-based compression function with freely scalable output size. We present generic collisionand preimage-security proofs for it, and compare our results with those of existing double-block-length constructions. Our security bounds show that our construction is competitive with the best collisionand equal to the best preimage-security bound of existing double-block-length constructions.	background debug mode interface;block cipher;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;one-way compression function;one-way function;provable security;scalability;turned a	Farzaneh Abed;Christian Forler;Eik List;Stefan Lucks;Jakob Wenzel	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-06734-6_26	swifft	Crypto	-37.94309221881219	77.77445309123263	33663

3af5cec943af3ecf223fb2efce89ca55e094f1e0	adaptive and concurrent secure computation from new notions of non-malleability		We present a unified framework for obtaining general secure computation that achieves adaptiveUniversally Composable (UC)-security. Our framework captures essentially all previous results on adaptive concurrent secure computation, both in relaxed models (e.g., quasi-polynomial time simulation), as well as trusted setup models (e.g., the CRS model, the imperfect CRS model). This provides conceptual simplicity and insight into what is required for adaptive and concurrent security, as well as yielding improvements to set-up assumptions and/or computational assumptions. Moreover, using our framework we provide first constructions of concurrent secure computation protocols that are adaptively secure in the timing model, and in the non-uniform simulation model. Conceptually, our framework can be viewed as an adaptive analogue to the recent work of Lin, Pass and Venkitasubramaniam [STOC ‘09], who considered only non-adaptive adversaries. Their main insight was that stand-alone non-malleability was sufficient for UC-security. A main conceptual contribution of this work is, quite surprisingly, that it is indeed the case even when considering adaptive security. A key element in our construction is a commitment scheme that satisfies a new notion of nonmalleability. The notion of concurrent equivocal non-malleable commitments, intuitively, guarantees that even when a man-in-the-middle adversary observes concurrent equivocal commitments and decommitments, the binding property of the commitments continues to hold for commitments made by the adversary. This notion is stronger than standard notions of concurrent non-malleable commitments which either consider only specific commits (e.g., statistically-binding) or specific scenarios (e.g., the commitment phase and the decommitment phase are executed in a non-overlapping manner). Previously, commitments that satisfy our definition, have been constructed in setup models, but either require existence of stronger encryption schemes such as CCA-secure encryption or require independent “trapdoors” provided by the setup for every pair of parties to ensure non-malleability. We here provide a construction that eliminates these requirements and require only a single trapdoor.	adversary (cryptography);commitment scheme;computational hardness assumption;encryption;man-in-the-middle attack;non-repudiation;polynomial;quasi-polynomial;requirement;secure multi-party computation;simulation;symposium on theory of computing;time complexity;uc browser;unified framework	Dana Dachman-Soled;Tal Malkin;Mariana Raykova;Muthuramakrishnan Venkitasubramaniam	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		encryption;commitment scheme;theoretical computer science;secure multi-party computation;secure two-party computation;malleability;adversary;distributed computing;computer science	Crypto	-38.13358958660152	75.1642891214942	33739

Over the past year, we have systematically scanned large portions of the internet to monitor the presence of trivially vulnerable embedded devices. At the time of writing, we have identified over 540,000 publicly accessible embedded devices configured with factory default root passwords. This constitutes over 13% of all discovered embedded devices. These devices range from enterprise equipment such as firewalls and routers to consumer appliances such as VoIP adapters, cable and IPTV boxes to office equipment such as network printers and video conferencing units. Vulnerable devices were detected in 144 countries, across 17,427 unique private enterprise, ISP, government, educational, satellite provider as well as residential network environments. Preliminary results from our longitudinal study tracking over 102,000 vulnerable devices revealed that over 96% of such accessible devices remain vulnerable after a 4-month period. We believe the data presented in this paper provides a conservative lower bound on the actual population of vulnerable devices in the wild. By combining the observed vulnerability distributions and its potential root causes, we propose a set of mitigation strategies and hypothesize about its quantitative impact on reducing the global vulnerable embedded device population. Employing our strategy, we have partnered with Team Cymru to engage key organizations capable of significantly reducing the number of trivially vulnerable embedded devices currently on the internet. As an ongoing longitudinal study, we plan to gather data continuously over the next year in order to quantify the effectiveness of community's cumulative effort to mitigate this pervasive threat.	credential;embedded system;firewall (computing);iptv;login;password;pervasive informatics;population;router (computing)	Ang Cui;Salvatore J.

But the current practice is not able to clarify the IP addresses with no reverse resolution response and the source verification process is not optimized in terms of network bandwidth and response latency. This paper proposes an explicit scheme to bind A/AAAA resource records (RRs) with their matching PTR RRs by introducing APTR/AAAAPTR RR types. The DNS cache server can automatically switch from forward resolution to reverse resolution when handling the APTR/AAAAPTR RR types. This scheme enables the negative verification if no reverse records are returned for APTR/AAAAPTR records. Furthermore, the analytical and numerical results show that the number of queries and response delay are significantly cut by the proposed scheme.	anti-spam techniques;email;numerical analysis;rapid refresh;recursion;round-robin scheduling;server (computing);spamming;web cache	Zheng Wang;Rui Wang	2013	2013 Proceedings of ITU Kaleidoscope: Building Sustainable Communities		dns hijacking;computer science;database;world wide web;domain name system;computer network	Metrics	-56.52552749918999	67.85998211346477	33883

Our first method broadens the fault width of previous Camellia attacks, injects multiple byte faults into the r round left register to recover multiple bytes of the r round equivalent key, and obtains Camellia-128,192/256 key with at least 8 and 12 faulty ciphertexts respectively; our second method extends fault depth of previous Camellia attacks, injects one byte fault into the r-2 round left register to recover full 8 bytes of the r round equivalent key, 5-6 bytes of the r-1 round equivalent key, 1 byte of the r-2 round equivalent key, and obtains Camellia-128,192/256 key with 4 and 6 faulty ciphertexts respectively. Simulation experiments demonstrate: due to its reversible permutation function, Camellia is vulnerable to multiple bytes fault attack, the attack efficiency is increased with fault width, this feature greatly improves fault attack’s practicalities; and due to its Feistel structure, Camellia is also vulnerable to deep single byte fault attack, 4 and 6 faulty ciphertexts are enough to reduce Camellia-128 and Camellia-192/256 key hypotheses to 2 and 2 respectively.	algorithm;aria;attack model;block cipher;byte;clefia;cryptography;differential fault analysis;encryption;experiment;fault injection;feistel cipher;s-box;sbcs;simulation	Xin-jie Zhao;Tao Wang	2010	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		fault;real-time computing;engineering;distributed computing;computer security	Security	-35.50255660578101	81.29709135557866	33884

Two-factor authentication, despite being more secure and strongly promoted, has not been widely applied to web authentication. Leveraging the unprecedented popularity of both personal mobile devices (e.g., Smartphones) and barcode scans through camera, we explore a new horizon in the design space of two-factor authentication. In this paper, we present CamAuth, a web authentication scheme that exploits pervasive mobile devices and digital cameras to counter various password attacks including man-in-the-middle and phishing attacks. In CamAuth, a mobile device is used as the second authentication factor to vouch for the identity of a use who is performing a web login from a PC. The device communicates directly with the PC through the secure visible light communication channels, which incurs no cellular cost and is immune to radio frequency attacks. CamAuth employs public-key cryptography to ensure the security of authentication process. We implemented a prototype system of CamAuth that consists of an Android application, a Chrome browser extension, and a Java-based web server. Our evaluation results indicate that CamAuth is a viable scheme for enhancing the security of web authentication.	barcode;browser extension;digital camera;java;login;man-in-the-middle attack;mobile device;multi-factor authentication;password;phishing;prototype;public-key cryptography;radio frequency;server (computing);smartphone;web server	Mengjun Xie;Yanyan Li;Kenji Yoshigoe;Remzi Seker;Jiang Bian	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering	10.1109/HASE.2015.41	password policy;chip authentication program;s/key;digest access authentication;challenge–response authentication;computer science;engineering;authentication protocol;operating system;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;authentication;internet privacy;one-time password;world wide web;password;computer security;email authentication;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;server	Security	-51.941277441667225	63.256028918333726	33914

Users either have trusted identities which they cannot control, or they control identities which are entirely untrusted. To resolve this dichotomy, the Independently Verifiable Identity Scheme (IVIS) is proposed, which draws trust for verification of user-provided personal data via evidence held by reputable organizations, acting as verifiers. The IVIS concept empowers users to structure their own identity with verifiable claimed attributes, and choose the parties who are best qualified to confirm their veracity. A case study of ‘Verifiable CV’ demonstrates verifying distributed work records by previous employers.	antivirus software;digital signature;formal verification;personally identifiable information;strong authentication;trusted operating system;veracity;verifiable random function	Rebecca Copeland;Michael Copeland	2017	2017 20th Conference on Innovations in Clouds, Internet and Networks (ICIN)	10.1109/ICIN.2017.7899410	mathematics;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-40.95284250201327	72.7525877923903	34002

With the advancement of chaos-based cryptography, it has become an interesting topic to investigate if it can be used as an alternative tool for building mobile roaming authentication schemes that achieve higher efficiency and security. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by proposing a chaotic maps-based authentication scheme for roaming. The scheme supports authentication, security and strong anonymity using the applied pi calculus-based formal verification tool ProVerif. Besides, it applies the efficient Chebyshev polynomial computation for better performance.	authentication;list of chaotic maps	Qi Xie;Bin Hu;Xiao Tan;Duncan S.

The well-known privacy preserving method is the spatial cloaking technique where exact user locations are blurred into a cloaked region to meet the privacy requirement, e.g. k-anonymity. Most of current solutions are designed with a centralized architecture in mind and rely on a third trustworthy party, i.e. a location anonymizing server (LAS). Unfortunately, these solutions cannot be directly applied to the mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) networks where no centralized servers are possible. In this paper, we present a dual-active spatial cloaking algorithm for mobile P2P networks. The key difference between the suggested algorithm and two existing algorithms, on-demand and proactive, is that: our algorithm allows peers not only actively collect but also actively disseminate location information to others. The three approaches are assessed through extensive simulation experiments for a range of P2P network scenarios. The experimental result shows that the dual-active approach uses the least anonymizing time and has the best anonymization success rate at the price of acceptable communicating cost.	algorithm;centralized computing;experiment;location-based service;network partition;partition problem;peer-to-peer;privacy;server (computing);simulation;software propagation;trust (emotion);while;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yanzhe Che;Qiang Yang;Xiaoyan Hong	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214137	mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;location-based service;internet privacy;mobile computing;privacy;world wide web;server;computer network	Mobile	-39.45673094838162	60.969939180922296	34034

However, the real effectiveness of those tools is usually unknown, which may lead administrators to put an unjustifiable level of trust in the tools they use. In this paper we present an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of five SQL Injection detection tools that operate at different system levels: Application, Database and Network. To test the tools in a realistic scenario, Vulnerability and Attack Injection is applied in a setup based on three web applications of different sizes and complexities. Results show that the assessed tools have a very low effectiveness and only perform well under specific circumstances, which highlight the limitations of current intrusion detection tools in detecting SQL Injection attacks. Based on experimental observations we underline the strengths and weaknesses of the tools assessed.	benchmark (computing);database;database-centric architecture;experiment;intrusion detection system;malware;sql injection;sensor;system administrator;web application	Ivano Alessandro Elia;José Fonseca;Marco Vieira	2010	2010 IEEE 21st International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering	10.1109/ISSRE.2010.32	sql injection;computer science;engineering;information security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-60.573533250336325	61.703411088354564	34058
e352dc8abe162b3e7568f3df650544b6491d1e92	secure data access control with ciphertext update and computation outsourcing in fog computing for internet of things		Fog computing is a paradigm that extends cloud computing to the edge of the network. It can provide computation and storage services to end devices in Internet of Things (IoT). Attribute-based cryptography is a well-known technology to guarantee data confidentiality and fine-grained data access control. However, its computational cost in encryption and decryption phase is linear with the complexity of policy. In this paper, we propose a secure and fine-grained data access control scheme with ciphertext update and computation outsourcing in fog computing for IoT. The sensitive data of data owner are first encrypted using attribute-based encryption with multiple policies and then outsourced to cloud storage. Hence, the user whose attributes satisfy the access policy can decrypt the ciphertext. Based on the attribute-based signature technique, authorized user whose attributes integrated in the signature satisfy the update policy can renew the ciphertext. Specifically, most of the encryption, decryption, and signing computations are outsourced from end devices to fog nodes, and thus, the computations for data owners to encrypt, end users to decrypt, re-encrypt, and sign are irrelevant to the number of attributes in the policies. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme is secure against known attacks, and the experimental results show that the fog nodes perform most of the computation operations of encryption, decryption, and signing, and hence, the time of encryption for data owner, decryption, re-encryption, and signing for users is small and constant.	access control;ampersand;attribute-based encryption;authorization;ciphertext;cloud computing;cloud storage;computation;computational complexity theory;confidentiality;cryptography;data access;fog computing;internet of things;outsourcing;programming paradigm;relevance	Qinlong Huang;Yixian Yang;Licheng Wang	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2727054	encryption;40-bit encryption;distributed computing;56-bit encryption;computer network;client-side encryption;filesystem-level encryption;ciphertext;attribute-based encryption;computer science;plaintext-aware encryption	Security	-41.51006740992084	67.5403155947458	34065

It intends to solve the trusted platform attestation and the platform privacy protection. In DAA, the certificate can be used repeatedly and this will provide the opportunities for rogue TPMs to initiate the replay attacks. For identifying the rogue platform, DAA cannot but use a relatively fixed pseudonym rather than a random pseudonym, which would badly weaken the anonymity of the platform. To tackle this problem, a time-and-times-limited strong DAA (TTLS-DAA) scheme, which extends DAA by adding valid period of time and restriction of times into the certificate, is put forward. Since the pseudonym of the user platform is different for each attestation, TTLS-DAA provides stronger anonymity. Being able to control the use of the certificate, it can be widely used in practice especially in commercial fields.	adversary (cryptography);direct anonymous attestation;extensible authentication protocol;privacy;public key certificate;relay;replay attack;rogue;time to live;trusted computing;trusted platform module	Yue Chen;Hong-hu Zhen;Jing Cao;Jing Shao	2009	2009 International Conference on Business Intelligence and Financial Engineering	10.1109/BIFE.2009.112	direct anonymous attestation;engineering;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.675847953949955	73.66921933789766	34088

673cb30aea7de57a61be933fdd3077daee2aa2ab	proofs of work from worst-case assumptions		We give Proofs of Work (PoWs) whose hardness is based on well-studied worst-case assumptions from fine-grained complexity theory. This extends the work of (Ball et al., STOC ’17), that presents PoWs that are based on the Orthogonal Vectors, 3SUM, and All-Pairs Shortest Path problems. These, however, were presented as a ‘proof of concept’ of provably secure PoWs and did not fully meet the requirements of a conventional PoW: namely, it was not shown that multiple proofs could not be generated faster than generating each individually. We use the considerable algebraic structure of these PoWs to prove that this nonamortizability of multiple proofs does in fact hold and further show that the PoWs’ structure can be exploited in ways previous heuristic PoWs could not. This creates full PoWs that are provably hard from worst-case assumptions (previously, PoWs were either only based on heuristic assumptions or on much stronger cryptographic assumptions (Bitansky et al., ITCS ’16)) while still retaining significant structure to enable extra properties of our PoWs. Namely, we show that the PoWs of (Ball et al, STOC ’17) can be modified to have much faster verification time, can be proved in zero knowledge, and more. Finally, as our PoWs are based on evaluating low-degree polynomials originating from average-case fine-grained complexity, we prove an averagecase direct sum theorem for the problem of evaluating these polynomials, which may be of independent interest. For our context, this implies the required non-amortizability of our PoWs.	3sum;best, worst and average case;computational complexity theory;cryptography;heuristic;linear algebra;polynomial;provable security;requirement;shortest path problem;symposium on theory of computing	Marshall Ball;Alon Rosen;Manuel Sabin;Prashant Nalini Vasudevan	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-96884-1_26	3sum;proof of concept;discrete mathematics;algebraic structure;mathematical proof;heuristic;computer science;shortest path problem;orthogonality	Crypto	-37.40789404678572	77.83275410183721	34102

Experimental performance evaluation, using three different signature databases, is carried out to provide some new insights into the relationship between different practical factors, in particular clarifying the impact on recognition performance of the data collection protocols used and the use of the feature pools underpinning the signature processing. This analysis provides an alternative perspective from which to explore and manage physical ageing effects in signature biometrics. The paper demonstrates that the proposed strategy maximises system accuracy while minimising the performance differential across a population which is heterogeneous with respect to age, and across different databases. The results presented suggest that adoption of the strategy proposed can render a template update procedure less critical than hitherto expected.	biometrics	Meryem Erbilek;Michael C.

3fc66f44c0ec19697b7edbdc85922559dee22c03	multilayer approach to defend phishing attacks		Spam messes up users inbox, consumes resources and spread attacks like DDoS, MiM, phishing etc. Phishing is a byproduct of email and causes financial loss to users and loss of reputation to financial institutions. In this paper we examine the characteristics of phishing and technology used by Phishers. In order to counter anti-phishing technology, phishers change their mode of operation; therefore a continuous evaluation of phishing only helps us combat phisher effectiveness. In our study, we collected seven hundred thousand spam from a corporate server for a period of 13 months from February 2008 to February 2009. From the collected data, we identified different kinds of phishing scams and mode of operation. Our observation shows that phishers are dynamic and depend more on social engineering techniques rather than software vulnerabilities. We believe that this study will develop more efficient anti-phishing methodologies. Based on our analysis, we developed an anti-phishing methodology and implemented in our network. The results show that this approach is highly effective to prevent phishing attacks. The proposed approach reduced more than 80% of the false negatives and more than 95% of phishing attacks in our network.	block cipher mode of operation;brute-force attack;brute-force search;computer virus;denial-of-service attack;email;entity;inbox by gmail;malware;phishing;server (computing);social engineering (security);spamming;subscriber identity module;trojan horse (computing);vulnerability (computing)	Beatrice Cynthia Dhinakaran;Dhinaharan Nagamalai;Jae-Kwang Lee	2011	CoRR		spam;phishing;virus;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;social engineering	Security	-57.47562261486545	62.910253755255866	34164

Mix networks have been subject to various traffic analysis attacks that aim at compromising the identities of these communication nodes. Our focus in this paper is to propose mix network schemes that are more robust against these attacks. To this end, we propose using traffic re-distribution techniques. Traffic re-distribution involves changing the number and size of messages in the network by splitting and merging the messages at network nodes and using variable size messages to confuse the attacker. The security and anonymity of the proposed techniques are evaluated against traffic analysis attacks. Performance analysis is provided to determine the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.	alpha compositing;computation;dummy variable (statistics);end-to-end principle;merge sort;mix network;padding (cryptography);tor messenger;traffic analysis;watermarking attack	Dijiang Huang;Vinayak Kandiah	2010	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-010-9170-0	network traffic control;anonymity;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network;low latency	Security	-56.23367351757227	69.78153128131756	34186
3661a57ca6abc342605eadc01975c24bb896b5d8	authenticated media uploading framework for mobile cloud computing		With the growing popularity of social networking services and the rapid development of smart devices, an increasing number of people are now uploading media such as images and videos to social networks for sharing with acquaintances, and making that content available for public use. Given the flexibility of uploading and sharing media, a common question arises: can we trust all these images and videos? To address this issue, we propose a mobile cloudbased media uploading framework that checks images for authenticity (i.e., by detecting known forgery techniques). For images that are found to be genuine, the framework will allow public sharing. The authenticity check will be carried out on the private or local cloud to which the image is uploaded. For the check itself, we propose a curvelet transform and Weber local descriptor-based system to extract features from the image. Statistical features obtained from the system are then fed into a support vector machine-based classifier. Offline experiments show that the proposed system can achieve very high detection accuracy for image forgery. Online experiments show that the proposed framework also works in real time. To validate the suitability of this media uploading framework,workloadsweremeasured in theAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud environment. B M.

Over the past several years we have also seen the increase in advanced targeted attacks against corporations which steal intellectual property and sensitive customer information. This problem is amplified as security is bypassed for work productivity and usability, while mobile devices increasingly access sensitive information. Though many organizations are beginning to invest significantly into securing their internal corporate network, users are typically given access to the Internet for web browsing purposes, leaving the enterprise vulnerable to drive-by downloads and data exfiltration attacks. In this work we propose a new method to safely browse the Internet by redirecting web requests to a cloud-based Transparent Virtual Browser. Web browsing requests are automatically redirected to the Transparent Virtual Browser via a transparent network proxy, protecting against user configuration errors or malware running on the device. The virtual browsing session is streamed back to the user securely, while maintaining a seamless user experience. Experiments show that our architecture can isolate web-attacks from a user's machine, protecting enterprises from most of the attacks to which they are vulnerable today. Using a small user trial we tested our solution with several popular web browsers on various operating systems and report on their feedback. Our testing also shows that our prototype only incurs a small initial delay when browsing to a webpage while maintaining a seamless browsing experience for the rest of the browsing session.	browsing;cloud computing;computer security;data theft;drive-by download;html5;information sensitivity;internet access;malware;mobile device;next-generation network;operating system;prototype;seamless3d;streaming media;usability;user experience;virtual machine;web page	Jeffrey Bickford;Paul Giura	2015	2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing	10.1109/CSCloud.2015.58	communications protocol;the internet;computer science;operating system;malware;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-54.34722838877525	61.231843530301404	34294
cf8ff3f742d93606ffbbfcc83dadc7f3da6b1bf7	automated behavioral analysis of malware: a case study of wannacry ransomware		Ransomware, a class of self-propagating malware that uses encryption to hold the victims’ data ransom, has emerged in recent years as one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with widespread damage; e.g., zero-day ransomware WannaCry has caused world-wide catastrophe, from knocking U.K. National Health Service hospitals offline to shutting down a Honda Motor Company in Japan [1]. Our close collaboration with security operations of large enterprises reveals that defense against ransomware relies on tedious analysis from high-volume systems logs of the first few infections. Sandbox analysis of freshly captured malware is also commonplace in operation. We introduce a method to identify and rank the most discriminating ransomware features from a set of ambient (non-attack) system logs and at least one log stream containing both ambient and ransomware behavior. These ranked features reveal a set of malware actions that are produced automatically from system logs, and can help automate tedious manual analysis. We test our approach using WannaCry and two polymorphic samples by producing logs with Cuckoo Sandbox during both ambient, and ambient plus ransomware executions. Our goal is to extract the features of the malware from the logs with only knowledge that malware was present. We compare outputs with a detailed analysis of WannaCry allowing validation of the algorithm’s feature extraction and provide analysis of the method’s robustness to variations of input data—changing quality/quantity of ambient data and testing polymorphic ransomware. Most notably, our patterns are accurate and unwavering when generated from polymorphic WannaCry copies, on which 63 (of 63 tested) antivirus (AV) products fail.	algorithm;antivirus software;catastrophe theory;encryption;feature extraction;malware;online and offline;port knocking	Qian Chen;Robert A.

However, a long path has to be pursued before electronic voting, particularly if based on Internet, is accepted as a reliable system alternative to conventional methods. In this paper, we propose a new and simple platform, based on open software, which can be used primarily in small to medium sized communities, as a means to build confidence and experience for future larger elections. We try to provide adequate answers to multiple requirements, such as accuracy, democracy, privacy, verifiability and mobility. This can be done by establishing a distributed system which supports the different roles of a voting system and by using cryptography techniques in the interactions between these components.	cryptography;distributed computing;e-government;formal verification;interaction;internet;open-source software;requirement	Ricardo André Costa;Mário Jorge Leitão;Isidro Vila Verde	2005		10.1007/11545156_30	confidentiality;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;confidence;mobile computing;law;computer security	Security	-45.69042079185413	78.83960434294039	34338

Although a P2P file sharing network shares many files, it does not usually have a management and control mechanism for the files exchanged. Consequently, copyright infringement and malware propagation in P2P file sharing networks have become prevalent. In order to prevent these file distribution, content poisoning has attracted much attention recently. Although content poisoning aims to obfuscate users by diffusing a lot of poisoned chunks in P2P networks, its effect to the networks have not been well studied yet. In this paper, we apply content poisoning to “Share”, one of the most popular P2P file sharing applications in Japan, to control its file distribution. Our evaluation includes how effective our proposed content poisoning method to a live Share network composed of over 100,000 active peers. The evaluation result shows that our content poisoning method decreases the number of peers that complete file download to less than 5% compared to the case without our control. Our content poisoning method also reduces additional traffic required for poisoning to 4%.	download;experiment;malware;peer-to-peer file sharing;planetlab;software propagation;gift	Masahiro Yoshida;Satoshi Ohzahata;Akihiro Nakao;Konosuke Kawashima	2010	2010 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2010.68	agriculture;pollution;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;file sharing;web server;computer network	Metrics	-58.901403926281745	67.34615010519501	34790

We depart from previous approaches by considering super-efficient answer verification, where answers to queries are validated in time asymptotically less that the time spent to produce them and using lightweight cryptographic operations. We achieve this property by adopting the decoupling of query answering and answer verification in a way designed for queries related to range search. Our techniques allow for efficient updates of the database and protect against replay attacks performed by the responder. One such technique uses an off-line audit mechanism: the data source and the user keep digests of the sequence of operations, yet are able to jointly audit the responder to determine if a replay attack has occurred since the last audit.	algorithm;authentication;coupling (computer programming);cryptography;database;online and offline;range searching;replay attack	Michael T.

Some have been mainly designed for Web resources or computing resources, like Grid Computing environments, or even for network access for roaming users. A common aspect in most of those approaches is the management of identities, that is, the representation of the information related to specific individuals or other entities and its use for authentication and authorization purposes. However, since the different solutions are focused on different application scenarios (Web, Grid, and network) it has been really difficult to create a unified point of view (cross-layer) for identity management and, therefore, mechanisms like Single Sign On (SSO) across different layers are considered to be a main gap in current efforts. In this article, we present an architecture based on an existing solution for roaming in educational environments (eduroam). The architecture is able to provide what has been called a unified SSO mechanism, that is, once the users have been authenticated during the network access, they are enabled to obtain protected resources at higher layers (like Web resources) without further re-authentication. Additionally, we include a performance analysis to illustrate the feasibility of this architecture, which has been tested in a real production environment like eduroam. & 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

9f6888a664334e943abb5e3bb606de1209e045f0	secure two-party computation over unreliable channels		We consider information-theoretic secure two-party computation in the plain model where no reliable channels are assumed, and all communication is performed over the binary symmetric channel (BSC) that flips each bit with fixed probability. In this reality-driven setting we investigate feasibility of communication-optimal noise-resilient semi-honest two-party computation i.e., efficient computation which is both private and correct despite channel noise. We devise an information-theoretic technique that converts any correct, but not necessarily private, two-party protocol that assumes reliable channels, into a protocol which is both correct and private against semi-honest adversaries, assuming BSC channels alone. Our results also apply to other types of noisy-channels such as the elastic-channel. Our construction combines tools from the cryptographic literature with tools from the literature on interactive coding, and achieves, to our knowledge, the best known communication overhead. Specifically, if f is given as a circuit of size s, our scheme communicates O(s+ κ) bits for κ a security parameter. This improves the state of the art (Ishai et al., CRYPTO’ 11) where the communication is O(s) + poly(κ · depth(s)).	binary symmetric channel;cryptography;information theory;noise (electronics);overhead (computing);secure two-party computation;security parameter;semiconductor industry	Ran Gelles;Anat Paskin-Cherniavsky;Vassilis Zikas	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-98113-0_24	computer network;computation;binary symmetric channel;computer science;secure two-party computation;distributed computing;communication channel	Crypto	-37.104899601581266	75.08013080175016	34907

Th is scheme is i n discussion inside a working group o f I S 0 on signature schemes (TC97/SC20/WG2). A work ing d ra f t has been writ ten and accepted recently (with formal modifications t o b e added). B y th is presentation we hope t o receive useful remarks for improving this scheme. T h i s scheme is the fastest known scheme for the verification o f signature (only one square plus some very easy operations). W e introduce t h e not ion o f signatures wi th shadow tha t is, when the signature is mathematically attached together the message to sign and with imprint t h a t is, where the message and the signature are two separate entities. Th i s scheme is RSA-based and, i n some aspects, is a variant o f Rabin-Will iams schemes. However, if the scheme is correctly implemented, it is immune against the at tacks by chosen messages. T h e technique is well-known: You introduce a redundancy in the message before you sign w i th your secret function.

If you use the RSA or one o f i ts variants, you are in a context where each known optimisation i s possible. The function o f redundancy is defined in such a way tha t the system resists t o any known attack; moreover the redundancy is used, if necessary, t o identify the correct message f rom the possible ones when you veri fy the signature. Indeed, in the scheme o f Will iams, the operation of signature needs a square root: T h e message thus needs to be a quadratic residue. A useful result is t ha t f r o m t h e set { a , -a, a / 2 , -a /2 } , there is one and only one quadratic residue . So, in fact, you can detect t he unique quadratic residue f rom this set then you extract the square roo t o f th is one. T h e redundancy is also used t o indicate the length of the signed message (if the message is short) or o f the hashed value o f the message.

Confidential data such as military secrets or intellectual property must never be disclosed outside the organization. Therefore, one of the most severe threats in the case of cyber-insider attacks is the loss of confidential data due to exfiltration. A malicious insider who has the proper credentials to access the organization databases may, over time, send data outside the organization network through a variety of channels, such as email, crafted HTTP requests that encapsulate data, etc. Existing security tools for detection of cyber-attacks focus on protecting the boundary between the organization and the outside world. Numerous network-level intrusion detection systems (IDS) exist, which monitor the traffic pattern and attempt to infer anomalous behavior. While such tools may be effective in protecting against external attacks, they are less suitable when the data exfiltration is performed by an insider who has the proper credentials and authorization to access resources within the organization. In this paper, we argue that DBMS-layer detection and prevention systems are the best alternative to defend against data exfiltration because: (1) DBMS access is performed through a standard, unique language (SQL) with well-understood semantics; (2) monitoring the potential disclosure of confidential data is more effective if done as close as possible to the data source; and (3) the DBMS layer already has in place a thorough mechanism for enforcing access control based on subject credentials. By analyzing the pattern of interaction between subjects and the DBMS, it is possible to detect anomalous activity that is indicative of early signs of exfiltration. In the paper, we outline a taxonomy of cyber-insider dimensions of activities that are indicative of data exfiltration, and we discuss a high-level architecture and mechanisms for early detection of exfiltration by insiders. We also outline a virtualization-based mechanism that prevents insiders from exfiltrating data, even in the case when they manage to gain control over the network. The protection mechanism relies on explicit authorization of data transfers that cross the organizational boundary.	access control;authorization;baseline (configuration management);confidentiality;credential;data theft;database;email;high-level architecture;insider threat;intrusion detection system;malware;network governance;overhead (computing);pattern matching;protection mechanism;sql;security controls	Elisa Bertino;Gabriel Ghinita	2011		10.1145/1966913.1966916	intrusion detection system;automatic gain control;computer science;access control;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;intellectual property	Security	-60.173880213262585	63.88046346763405	35149

In the cloud computing environments, achieving both data privacy and integrity is the challenging issue for data outsourcing service. Proof of Storage with Deduplication (POSD) is a promising solution that addresses the issue for the cloud storage systems with deduplication enabled. However, the validity of the current POSD scheme stands on the strong assumption that all clients are honest in terms of generating their keys. We present insecurity of this approach under new attack model that malicious clients exploit dishonestly manipulated keys. We also propose an improved POSD scheme to mitigate our attack.	attack model;cloud computing;cloud storage;computational diffie–hellman assumption;data deduplication;diffie–hellman problem;discrete logarithm;fits;information privacy;key (cryptography);outsourcing;programmed data processor;random oracle;server (computing)	Young-joo Shin;Dongyoung Koo;Junbeom Hur;Joobeom Yun	2015	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-015-2956-z	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	OS	-42.033082759881765	68.09933810580756	35234

To the best of our knowledge, BodySec is the first approach that can remove the timing synchronization assumption of the biometric inter-pulse signals among different biomedical sensors. The basic design is to represent the biometrics as an unordered set of short-term slots, then transform the problem of key agreement using biometrics into a problem of set reconciliation, finally ensure the different sensors can possess the same keys with low energy consumption. The experimental results on the PhysioBank electrocardiogram database demonstrate that BodySec opens up a new feasible way for energy-efficient key distribution in the future human-centered wireless system characterized by timing asynchronism and limited power.	biometrics;key distribution;secure communication;sensor;unordered associative containers (c++)	Jinyang Shi;Kwok-Yan Lam;Ming Gu;Husheng Li	2010	Mobile Computing and Communications Review	10.1145/1837188.1837197	secure communication;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;efficient energy use;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-49.43154501209896	78.59984911665879	35312

(ICICS'2011), can trace out the real signer of a signature/message pair. The weakness is due to that the signature scheme is based on bilinear groups of composite order, instead of the usual groups of prime order. We remark that the usual bilinear groups of prime order are sufficient for the construction. We will present a modification of the scheme and show its security. We also remark that the structure of bilinear groups of a large composite order could make group operation inefficient and lose the advantages of elliptic curve cryptography which gained mainly from smaller parameter size. From the practical point of view, such an algebraic structure is unlikely applicable to cryptographic schemes.	bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;cryptographic protocol;digital signature;elliptic curve cryptography;linear algebra;ring signature	Zhengjun Cao;Xiangjia Wu;Hanyue Cao	2013	2013 International Conference on Cloud and Service Computing	10.1109/CSC.2013.27	ring signature;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;eddsa;elliptic curve digital signature algorithm;mathematics;blind signature;schnorr signature;algebra	Crypto	-39.879017252907346	77.89334194026215	35363

Most work in privacy-aware data sharing has considered disclosing summaries where the aggregate information about the data is preserved, but sensitive user information is protected. Nonetheless, there are applications, including online advertising, cloud computing and crowdsourcing markets, where detailed and fine-grained user data must be disclosed. We consider a new data sharing paradigm and introduce the problem of privacy-aware data partitioning, where a sensitive dataset must be partitioned among k untrusted parties (adversaries). The goal is to maximize the utility derived by partitioning and distributing the dataset, while minimizing the total amount of sensitive information disclosed. The data should be distributed so that an adversary, without colluding with other adversaries, cannot draw additional inferences about the private information, by linking together multiple pieces of information released to her. The assumption of no collusion is both reasonable and necessary in the above application domains that require release of private user information. SPARSI enables us to formally define privacy-aware data partitioning using the notion of sensitive properties for modeling private information and a hypergraph representation for describing the interdependencies between data entries and private information. We show that solving privacy-aware partitioning is, in general, NP-hard, but for specific information disclosure functions, good approximate solutions can be found using relaxation techniques. Finally, we present a local search algorithm applicable to generic information disclosure functions. We conduct a rigorous performance evaluation with real-world and synthetic datasets that illustrates the effectiveness of SPARSI at partitioning sensitive data while minimizing disclosure.	adversary (cryptography);aggregate data;application domain;approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;cloud computing;crowdsourcing;e-services;information gain in decision trees;information sensitivity;interdependence;linear programming relaxation;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;online advertising;performance evaluation;personally identifiable information;privacy;programming paradigm;search algorithm;streaming media;synthetic intelligence;world wide web	Theodoros I.

Many web applications such as mobile banking, emails, online shopping require users to provide their credentials to authenticate themselves before they can use the services. Four factors, including password, token, biometrics, social networks, have been proposed for authentication. However, the proposed authentication schemes of the four factors all suffer from different shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a multi-level social authentication framework. Our analysis shows that the framework is much more robust than the existing approaches. More importantly, we minimize the potential privacy disclosure of users during the authentication procedure.

61fb56e38a2a1aa8c6cfb62b4ac9d9bfc67a835e	leakage-abuse attacks against order-revealing encryption		Order-preserving encryption and its generalization order-revealing encryption (OPE/ORE) allow sorting, performing range queries, and filtering data — all while only having access to ciphertexts. But OPE and ORE ciphertexts necessarily leak information about plaintexts, and what level of security they provide in practice has been unclear. In this work, we introduce new leakage-abuse attacks that recover plaintexts from OPE/ORE-encrypted databases. Underlying our new attacks is a framework in which we cast the adversary's challenge as a non-crossing bipartite matching problem. This allows easy tailoring of attacks to a specific scheme's leakage profile. In a case study of customer records, we show attacks that recover 99% of first names, 97% of last names, and 90% of birthdates held in a database, despite all values being encrypted with the OPE scheme most widely used in practice. We also show the first attack against the recent frequency-hiding Kerschbaum scheme, to which no prior attacks have been demonstrated. Our attack recovers frequently occurring plaintexts most of the time.	adversary (cryptography);database;encryption;matching (graph theory);range query (data structures);sorting;spectral leakage	Paul Grubbs;Kevin Sekniqi;Vincent Bindschaedler;Muhammad Naveed;Thomas Ristenpart	2016	2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	10.1109/SP.2017.44	internet privacy;computer security;computer science;encryption;filter (signal processing);adversary;leakage (electronics);range query (data structures);bipartite graph;sorting	Security	-39.41123265314827	66.8024981499254	35584

Recent studies consider cases where the adversary may possess different kinds of knowledge about the data. In this article, we show that knowledge of the mechanism or algorithm of anonymization for data publication can also lead to extra information that assists the adversary and jeopardizes individual privacy. In particular, all known mechanisms try to minimize information loss and such an attempt provides a loophole for attacks. We call such an attack a minimality attack. In this article, we introduce a model called m-confidentiality which deals with minimality attacks, and propose a feasible solution. Our experiments show that minimality attacks are practical concerns on real datasets and that our algorithm can prevent such attacks with very little overhead and information loss.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;confidentiality;data anonymization;experiment;overhead (computing);privacy;run time (program lifecycle phase);selectivity (electronic)	Raymond Chi-Wing Wong;Ada Wai-Chee Fu;Ke Wang;Jian Pei	2009	ACM Trans.

1c23c291dd1de9e0919f163053a227ac3b7989c1	cryptographic rule-based trading - (short paper).		We present an interesting new protocol where participants in a securities exchange may submit cryptographically encrypted rules directly to an exchange rather than orders to buy and sell. We define this in two parts: a secure, partially trusted computer that runs the exchange and proves its actions correct, and a set of participants who define the rules and submit them to the exchange. At each “tick” of the exchange, market prices are taken from the national market system, all submitted rules are evaluated, with any resulting trades executed at market prices. Cryptography reduces information leakage, masks participants’ intent, and provides for verification. A cryptographic audit trail proves that all transactions executed by the exchange are according to a set of published exchange rules and the encrypted trading rules.	computer;continuation;correctness (computer science);cryptography;encryption;explicit congestion notification;information leakage;profiling (computer programming);prototype;risk management;simulation;spectral leakage	Christopher Thorpe;Steven R.

Later, Wu et al. showed that Yen-Joye revision is also insecure and therefore an improved protocol was proposed. However, Wu et al.'s protocol violates the original requirement in which no one-way hash function is needed. On the other hand, in order to overcome Yen-Joye and Wu et al.'s attacks, Harn and Lin proposed a modified version by modifying the signature signing equation. But the modified version increases one exponentiation in the verification equation. Afterward Zhou et al. showed that the second Harh-Lin protocol is insecure against impersonation attack, i. e., a cheater can impersonate a valid user to execute the protocol successfully and obtains parts of the valid session keys. Then they proposed an improved version to enhance the second Harh-Lin protocol. In this paper, we first show that Zhou et al.'s protocol still suffers the impersonation attack, then we propose an improved scheme that is secure against forgery and doesn't involve any one-way hash function. Compared with all above modified versions, our scheme is secure and efficient.	authentication;communications protocol;cryptographic hash function;key-agreement protocol;local interconnect network;one-way function;session (computer science);session key	Bi-Hui Chen	2004	Operating Systems Review	10.1145/1035834.1035839	telecommunications;computer science;authentication;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.789971652169186	75.29134188639942	35721

Many approaches have been proposed to detect botnet, which rely on end-host installations or operate on network traffic with deep packet inspection. They have limitations for detecting botnets which use evasion techniques such as packet encryption, fast flux, dynamic DNS and DGA. Sporadic botnet behavior caused by disconnecting the power of system or botnet's own nature also brings unignorable false detection. Furthermore, normal user's traffic causes a lot of false alarms. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called PsyBoG to detect botnets by capturing periodic activities. PsyBoG leverages signal processing techniques, PSD (Power Spectral Density) analysis, to discover the major frequencies from the periodic DNS queries of botnets. The PSD analysis allows us to detect sophisticated botnets irrespective of their evasion techniques, sporadic behavior and even the noise traffic generated by normal users. To evaluate PsyBoG, we utilize the real-world DNS traces collected from a /16 campus network including more than 48,046K queries, 34K distinct IP addresses and 146K domains. Finally, PsyBoG caught 19 unknown and 6 known botnet groups with 0.1% false positives.	botnet;classless inter-domain routing;cluster analysis;deep packet inspection;denial-of-service attack;domain generation algorithm;encryption;evasion (network security);fast flux;network packet;network traffic control;proactive parallel suite;sensor;server (computing);signal processing;spamming;spectral density;tracing (software);user (computing);warez	Jonghoon Kwon;Jeongsik Kim;Jehyun Lee;Heejo Lee;Adrian Perrig	2014	2014 9th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software: The Americas (MALWARE)	10.1109/MALWARE.2014.6999414	srizbi botnet;engineering;internet privacy;botnet;computer security;computer network	Networks	-60.275130126792924	65.67366652819577	35727

We demonstrate that such responses can differ significantly enough to distinguish between a number of popular chipsets and drivers. We expect to significantly expand the number of recognized device types through community contributions of signature data for the proposed open fingerprinting framework. Our method complements known fingerprinting approaches, and can be used to interrogate and spot devices that may be spoofing their MAC addresses in order to conceal their true architecture from other stations, such as a fake AP seeking to engage clients in complex protocol frame exchange (e.g., in order to exploit a driver vulnerability). In particular, it can be used to distinguish rogue APs from legitimate APs before association.	chipset;data control language;device driver;fingerprint (computing);firmware;rogue access point;wireless access point	Sergey Bratus;Cory Cornelius;David Kotz;Daniel Peebles	2008		10.1145/1352533.1352543	embedded system;fingerprint;link layer;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-53.19164726042537	69.43577438399488	35748

However, they rely on computations which are too hard to be performed by humans and are instead done on computers. Trusting a digital signature implies trusting the computer which produced/checked it. Often, this trust cannot be taken for granted. This paper presents a method for visual authentication of large messages which relies on embedding a human-recognizable watermark and needs practically no computational power on the receiver side. Also, using a simple challenge-response mechanism is proposed to prevent attackers from obtaining signatures without author’s knowledge.	antivirus software;challenge–response authentication;computation;computer;digital signature;digital watermarking;information security;message authentication code;trust (emotion)	Igor Fischer;Thorsten Herfet	2006		10.1007/11766155_36	message authentication code;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;algorithm	Security	-44.37102256626349	77.68572425249457	35811

Large-scale spammers target commerce queries that they can monetize and attempt to spam as many top search results of those queries as possible. We model the large-scale search spam problem as that of defending against correlated attacks on search rankings across multiple keywords, and propose an autonomic anti-spam approach based on self-monitoring and self- protection. In this new approach, search engines monitor and correlate their own search results of spammer-targeted keywords to detect large-scale spam attacks that have successfully bypassed their current anti-spam solutions. They then initiate self-protection through targeted patrol of spam-heavy domains, targeted hunting at the sources of successful spam, and strengthening of specific weakness in the ranking algorithms. We describe the strider search ranger system which implements this new approach, and focus on its use to defend against an important class of search spam - the redirection spam - as a demonstration of the general concept. We evaluate the system by testing it against actual search results and show that it can detect useful spam patterns and eliminate a significant amount of spam for all three major search engines.	algorithm;anti-spam techniques;autonomic computing;coat of arms;invariant (computer science);mathematical optimization;monetization;relevance;reverse engineering;search engine optimization;software business;spamdexing;spamming;strider;tracing (software);url redirection;web search engine;ranger	Yi-Min Wang;Ming Ma	2007	Fourth International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC'07)	10.1109/ICAC.2007.38	content analysis;computer science;spamdexing;spambot;database;internet privacy;search analytics;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	Web+IR	-57.57300194135727	62.920815891484175	35898

However, no IPTV exhibits both of these characteristics in the present era. Usually IPTV uses Conditional Access System (CAS) and Digital Rights Management (DRM) as a means to protect the contents. However, these two approaches use different broadcasting systems and are limited for on-demand purposes. Such approaches illustrate the limited use of IPTV to date. In this paper, a more effective method to improve the security system will be proposed for smart mobile platforms. In this method, both the content server and IPTV use an OPT in order to apply a security code to the contents. In addition, the model performs CAS to manage user rights and keys. Such a method for smart mobile platforms will decrease the load between the server and the client network and secure the transfer of user certification, content security, and stream data.	conditional access;content security policy;digital rights management;effective method;iptv;mobile device;mobile operating system;one-time password;requirement;server (computing)	Manhyun Chung;Younghoon Lee;Taeshik Shon;Jongsub Moon	2013	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-011-9652-8	downloadable conditional access system;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.28415630471769	69.49615166074562	35904

This feature makes it very useful in the environments with low bandwidth communication, low storage, and low computability. Recently, Chen et al. proposed a new certificateless aggregate signature scheme. They claim that their scheme is provably secure under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem. Unfortunately, this paper shows that Chen et al.’s scheme is insecure, it cannot resist Type I and Type II adversaries, and the corresponding attacks are given. Furthermore, we also show their scheme exists a more powerful attack, namely, anyone can forge a certificateless signature on an arbitrary message in this attack. Finally, we discuss the reason to produce such attacks and give the corresponding suggestions to resist such attacks.

Among which, Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) pose significant problems, as they are disruptive to the useful traffics and are hard to prevent. One solution consists in instituting accountability, which hold the attackers accountable for the attack. The key issue is to identify the “real” sources of the attacks as attackers use spoofed IP address to hide their actual network location. However, the Internet architecture does not provide intrinsic support for identifying the real sources of IP packets. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to “traceback” the real sources. Most of such works have been addressing the IP version 4. In this paper, we address the issues of IP traceback in the context of IPv6 and Mobile IPv6. This paper provides a detailed analysis of these issues and problems. The main problem lies with the transformations that are introduced by IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 protocols, namely tunneling and addresses manipulation. We then propose a solution, including new ICMPv6 messages for traceback co-ordination, to facilitate the traceback mechanism.	denial-of-service attack;health insurance portability and accountability act;ip address spoofing;ip traceback;internet;mobile ip;pervasive informatics;spoofing attack;tunneling protocol	Henry C.

This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract IP fragmentation can be used to disguise TCP packets from IP filters used in routers and hosts. This document describes two methods of attack as well as remedies to prevent them. 1. Background System administrators rely on manufacturers of networking equipment to provide them with packet filters; these filters are used for keeping attackers from accessing private systems and information, while permitting friendly agents to transfer data between private nets and the Internet. For this reason, it is important for network equipment vendors to anticipate possible attacks against their equipment and to implement robust mechanisms to deflect such attacks. The growth of the global Internet has brought with it an increase in """"undesirable elements"""" manifested in antisocial behavior. Recent months have seen the use of novel attacks on Internet hosts, which have in some cases led to the compromise of sensitive data.

Our model and architecture have the following properties:Resilience. The generator's output looks random to an observer with no knowledge of the internal state. This holds even if that observer has complete control over data that is used to refresh the internal state.Forward security. Past output of the generator looks random to an observer, even if the observer learns the internal state at a later time.Backward security/Break-in recovery. Future output of the generator looks random, even to an observer with knowledge of the current state, provided that the generator is refreshed with data of sufficient entropy.Architectures such as above were suggested before. This work differs from previous attempts in that we present a formal model for robust pseudo-random generation, and provide a formal proof within this model for the security of our architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at a rigorous model for this problem.Our formal modeling advocates the separation of the entropy extraction phase from the output generation phase. We argue that the former is information-theoretic in nature, and could therefore rely on combinatorial and statistical tools rather than on cryptography. On the other hand, we show that the latter can be implemented using any standard (non-robust) cryptographic PRG.We also discuss the applicability of our architecture for applications such as /dev/(u)random in Linux and pseudorandom generation on smartcards.	cryptography;formal language;formal proof;information theory;linux;memory refresh;procedural generation;pseudorandomness;smart card	Boaz Barak;Shai Halevi	2005		10.1145/1102120.1102148	smart card;computer science;theoretical computer science;randomness extractor;computer security;algorithm	Security	-36.846344809242105	75.57382497747753	36186

784a8d0d48a5bec970b9c2b490c3ce6d0379681d	outsourcing power system simulations		The advancement of cloud-computing technologies opens new possibilities to outsource to the third-party cloud the computation-intensive and time-consuming dynamic simulations needed in power grid system research and operations. Outsourcing makes it possible to conduct dynamic simulations much faster and with lower cost than to keep all computations local. On the other hand, outsourcing, however, also gives rise to the risk of information leak, as the outsourced simulation contains sensitive information, such as critical operational parameters and projected states of the power grid. In this paper, a novel secure outsourcing scheme, combining disguising technique and code obfuscation, was proposed to enable efficient outsourcing while preserving the confidentiality of the information. It was shown that our scheme can limit the adversary's capability to obtain the sensitive information in the context of outsourcing of power system dynamic simulations.	adversary (cryptography);cloud computing;computation;computer simulation;confidentiality;information sensitivity;nonlinear system;obfuscation (software);outsourcing;system dynamics	Yue Tong;Jinyuan Sun;Kai Sun;Pan Li	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417734	simulation;computer science;cryptography;trajectory;theoretical computer science;operating system;mathematical model;computer security;statistics;outsourcing;computer network	EDA	-41.94178098626138	67.91041757783555	36213

These were transcribed from hand-written notes. Mike Burmester (M. B.): We are having a talk here, on the topic of authentication on constrained environments. The panelists could take it into any direction they find interesting. I chose this topic because it is almost impossible to achieve authentication in ad-hoc settings. (After this opening, M. B. introduces the speakers to the audience filling the room.) Virgil Gligor (V. G.): So, I will try to be respectful to the topic. I will mention several topics that are related to the main topic. First primitive: Authenticated encryption. Involves 1-pass through data, requiring block cipher computation plus redundancy check. No extra work is required, only the block cipher. This is the most efficient approach. If authentication fails, then encryption fails with high probability. Note that 1-pass authenticated encryption is what you want. Alternative: Kerberos authentication (using hashes) and a second pass with block cipher. Another alternative: use block cipher and authentication (using block cipher to implement both primitives). Again, two passes over the data. The 1-pass authenticated encryption is clearly most efficient. M. Burmester and A. Yasinsac (Eds.): MADNES 2005, LNCS 4074, pp. 186–191, 2006. c © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006 Panel: Authentication in Constrained Environments 187 Second primitive: Another form of authentication that is needed is to authenticate based on threshold voting: Suppose there are m neighbors in a location. One should be able to figure out if t-out-of-m vote to take some action (sensing event). Any t messages out of m authenticate in a neighborhood. How to do this? Various primitives are available: I have described a technique using random polynomials, where the degree should be approximately equal to the threshold. May have to use Merkle trees. In summary, it is possible to implement t-out-of-m authentication efficiently using one of Merkle trees, hash trees, or random polynomials. Other form of authentication: Base station based as opposed to fully distributed. Not so interesting, and [I am] not convinced it is needed [for] more sophisticated forms of authentication. Doug Tygar (D. T.): About base-station to node not being interesting: It hurts, I wrote a book on the topic! I do not think authentication will be a problem, at least machine-to-machine or message authentication. I believe our model is wrong. I will give an example with dual-core devices: a lowpower one that runs all the time, and a high-power crypto device that works infrequently. What about tamper-resistance? I believe that trends coming in the next few years (Playstation DRM technology, trusted computing base (TCB)) will make tamper-resistance available. Important question: Will we have any anonymity in this type of environment? Yuliang Zheng (Y. Z.): My interest is efficient cryptographic solutions to problems. I take a different approach. How keys get distributed, updated? How to design efficient/better algorithms? How to design authenticated encryption? For that, a solution is available. So, first issue: Key distribution. second issue: If we look to far ahead, we may loose perspective. Why not look at novel techniques for authentication if you want to anticipate MADNES 2010? Before then quantum devices may be available, so why not look at novel approaches? M. B.: Take another angle. MANETS are short-term networks, but also useful as support for fixed networks. Attackers of fixed-line networks exploit particular weaknesses of the network. I wish to set-up wireless overlay networks to set-up new networks quickly and compensate on attacks on wire-based networks. – Issue: Key revocation. How to revoke keys? How to decide with mobile devices are not behaving as required, how to revoke them? There is scope for ad-hoc networks that are not only sensors, not short-lived, but needed for long-term survivability (using threshold-based encryption). Evangelos Kranakis (E. K.): These guys have left nothing for me. Let me see, authentication in constrained devices. One word at a time. – Authentication: Verify that something is genuine. How much authentication is satisfactory to us? How much do we want? How may we afford it? Each application has its own risks, constraints, so focus on what is important. 188 M. Burmester et al. – Constrained devices: Which part is constrained? Do we mean bandwidth limitations, resource limitations? Authentication is best for short periods of time. Authentication is short-lived. – Environment: Assuming an ad-hoc environment, not previously thoughtout. Out-of-blue authentication needed. What is involved: Servers, a wifi network? Environment is not well defined. Within this context, think differently, new approaches. • Use directional antenna in some clever way. • Use location in some clever way. • Use radio-frequency fingerprint, at least study for what aspects they may work. • What is possible? Measure it. History of wired networks: As V. G. mentioned, we have experience transferring solutions from other contexts to see what can be better: Take wireless out, put wire-line back in, go back 30 years (old devices were constrained). Think differently, not just transfer solutions. M. B.: It occurs to me, we started this workshop with V. G. with talk about how to do things in a different way. Then E. K. talked about new technologies, using non-cryptographic authentication for identification. It is an emerging technology to deal with new types of properties referring to wireless technologies. Y. Z.: We talked about constrained devices. My watch is powered by light. Perhaps the battery issue will go away. E. K.: I do not think battery issues will go away, it will not because of Moore’s law. Member of Audience: New technologies (TOSHIBA) increase battery capacity 3 times, then double the capacity again. Batteries improve, but many interests require power. Are we making mistakes to use crypto that is secure by going back in time 30 years? D. T.: I do not think that we go back in time, some issues are revisited, but new issues appear. Batteries have Moore’s law, everything has Moore’s laws except human intelligence. Batteries could use temperature differentials, liquid fuel, could burn fuel for decades. I think these issues will be addressed. Think about the motivation: More than a third of the weight that American soldiers carry is batteries. V. G.: Batteries are nice targets of attacks. Authentication protocols are not designed to protect against battery depletion attacks, especially public-key authentication. The problem is not really public-key if you use only once. But where to stop authentication? For example, vehicular protocols, authenticating distances. What do you mean? Feet, yards? I am talking about revealing positions. Can A reveal his position to B, then B to A? What primitives, batteries need to be used? E. K.: There are examples of environments that are not constrained. E.g.: Internet. We try to run BGP, notoriously insecure. Cannot do anything very well. How can we be secure when we cannot do anything right? Panel: Authentication in Constrained Environments 189 D. T.: We cannot defend BGP. May be people will do something right next time. V. G.: More than BGP, look at DNS. We know DNSSEC for 10 years, but it is nowhere to be seen. How to reconcile competing economic interests that are difficult to change? We know how to do Internet authentication, but other issues come in the picture. I hope in MANETs we should not box ourselves in. Back to D. T., we are interested in privacy. What is the impact of authentication on privacy? When are we for authentication? When for privacy? D. T.: Example: My house is burglarized. I can cancel my credit cards w/o authentication. There are clear DoS issues in this picture. I want to digress. Legacy of Internet: Remember TCP/IP were experimental protocols. Do it over again, and we could make better choices. I fell negative about IPv6, its a patch instead of an evolution. In MANETs there is an opportunity not to build upon previous mistakes. What stops us from making new mistakes? Make new protocols modular so that we can address these. Member of Audience: Regarding anonymity. Any possibility of achieving privacy-preserving authentication? Any hope? D. T.: I do not know. V. G.: Skeptical. E. K.: Product of anonymity and authentication equals 1. Y. Z.: I think devices that, for devices that are not associated with human beings, like sensors in a forest, this is not an issue. But for cell phones, this is an important issue. Member of Audience: Some networks have hundreds of nodes. If a small number of nodes is compromised, how much damage takes place? E. K.: A containment issue. I do not know the answer. M. B.: Hard issue in fixed-line networks. Different, much harder in MANETs. Nearly impossible in general, but maybe local containment is achievable. Depends on the application. If it is a military application, you can use sophisticated techniques. Varies with context. V. G.: If devices can be captured, all authentication protocols will fail. Authentication is designed to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. If one end is compromised, what will happen to them? If adversary captures node. We will develop and deploy these technologies, introducing new vulnerabilities on old security protocols. What worries me is mismatch: That spells trouble. D. T.: To be controversial, if [adversary] captures nodes, and re-uses them, ok. What if cloning? Need to develop cloning-proof technology. V. G.: We have examples of protocols that can solve such problems, but they are few and far between. D. T.: Give me 18 months. One solution: tamper-resistance. Substantial work has been achieved on this from PODC. We can learn from them. We have different applications in mind.

In this work we examine the pseudorandomness of the block cipher KASUMI and the provable security of f8. First we show that the three round KASUMI is not a pseudorandom permutation ensemble but the four round KASUMI is a pseudorandom permutation ensemble under the adaptive distinguisher model by investigating the properties of the round functions in a clear way. Second we provide the upper bound on the security of f8 mode under the reasonable assumption from the first result by means of the left-or-right security notion.	block cipher mode of operation;computer security;encryption;provable security;pseudorandom permutation;pseudorandomness;route distinguisher;unbalanced circuit	Ju-Sung Kang;Sang-Uk Shin;Dowon Hong;Okyeon Yi	2001		10.1007/3-540-45682-1_16	block cipher;computer science;theoretical computer science;provable security;pseudorandom permutation;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;computer security;encryption;standardization;algorithm;enterprise information security architecture;systems architecture	Crypto	-41.570722264891614	78.90486500031312	36257

15b8bb365d9bc019f55d0f539b2a9b9a91037218	trusted system-calls analysis methodology aimed at detection of compromised virtual machines using sequential mining		Abstract Most organizations today employ cloud-computing environments and virtualization technology; Due to their prevalence and importance in providing services to the entire organization, virtual-servers are constantly targeted by cyber-attacks, and specifically by malware. Existing solutions, consisting of the widely-used antivirus (AV) software, fail to detect newly created and unknown-malware; moreover, by the time the AV is updated, the organization has already been attacked. In this paper, we present a during run-time analysis methodology for a trusted detection of unknown malware on virtual machines (VMs). We conducted trusted analysis of volatile memory dumps taken from a VM and focused on analyzing their system-calls using a sequential-mining-method. We leveraged the most informative system-calls by machine-learning algorithms for the efficient detection of malware in widely used VMs within organizations (i.e. IIS and Email server). We evaluated our methodology in a comprehensive set of experiments over a collections of real-world, advanced, and notorious malware (both ransomware and RAT), and legitimate programs. The results show that our suggested methodology is able to detect the presence of unknown malware, in an average of 97.9% TPR and 0% FPR. Such results and capabilities can form the ground for the development of practical detection-tools for both corporates and companies.	trusted system;virtual machine	Nir Nissim;Yuval Lapidot;Aviad Cohen;Yuval Elovici	2018	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2018.04.033	virtualization;trusted system;data mining;malware;computer science;software;ransomware;virtual machine;volatile memory	Metrics	-60.27150656670356	61.0428364789886	36359

These challenges are the prime hindrance for ECG based biometric being commercialized as a pervasive authentication mechanism. At least,ECGbased biometric can provide a secured mechanism for cardiac patients being monitored over telephony network. In this paper, we present a polynomial distance measurement (PDM) method for ECG based biometric authentication for the very first time, according to the literature and to the best of our knowledge. The proposed PDM method is up to 12 times faster than existing algorithms, requires up to 6.5 times less template storage, needs only 2.49 (average) acquisition time with the highest accuracy rate (up to 100 per cent) when experimented on a population size of 15. Moreover, this proposed ECG based biometric system was deployed on a mobile phone based telemonitoring scenario with multilayer authentication mechanism upholding its applicability.	authentication;biometrics;polynomial	Fahim Sufi;Ibrahim Khalil;Ibrahim Habib	2010	Security and Communication Networks	10.1002/sec.76	data compression;identification;verification;computer science;theoretical computer science;internet privacy;computer security;biometrics	Security	-48.4293127851852	68.81516712013003	36394

This may attract hackers to eavesdrop and then break them. Hence, the security is an important issue needed to be addressed. Advanced Standard Encryption (AES) is currently a frequently used encryption approach. However, AES will be insecure in the near future since it has been partially solved. Therefore, in this paper, we present a security system, named Random Cladding with Feedback Mechanism encryption method (RCFM for short), which uses the password key or the channel key entered by a underlying user as the initial encryption key, and adopts a dynamically accumulated shifting substitution technique together with a Two-Dimensional Operation encryption method to produce a sub-keys group. It also retrieves the current time parameters and random number keys as dynamic parameters to perform a cladded feedback encryption. Through theoretic analysis and computer simulations, the RCFM demonstrates practical security in network communications.	cladding (fiber optics);computer simulation;encryption;feedback;key (cryptography);password;random number generation;theory	Yi-Li Huang;Fang-Yie Leu;Ilsun You;Hsing-Chung Chen;Chishyan Liaw;Jung-Chun Liu	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)	10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562221	multiple encryption;watermarking attack;encryption software;h.235;disk encryption theory;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;disk encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;key wrap;link encryption;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption;computer network	Crypto	-46.19686935704265	73.00310222543655	36401

Forward security allows one to mitigate the damage caused by exposure of secret keys. Forward-secure public encryptions are used to the threshold setting, this model guarantees that even if an adversary have broken into more than t distinct servers(for some i), messages encrypted during all time periods prior to i remain secret. In this paper, we present the first probably secure (non-interactive) forward-secure threshold public-key encryption scheme against chosen-cipher text attacks in the random oracle model. The encryption and update operations are very efficient when compared with the scheme presented by Libert et al. A formal definition, as well as a detailed analysis of the security performance of this scheme, is presented. The security of this scheme is based on the Computational Bilinear Diffie Hellman assumption, which leads to a unique approach to prove security in the random oracle model. Furthermore, in our model, the servers update their keys individually and asynchronously, without any communication between them.	adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack;adversary (cryptography);authorization;bilinear transform;cipher;ciphertext;computational diffie–hellman assumption;encryption;interactivity;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;random oracle	Xiujie Zhang;Chunxiang Xu;Wenzheng Zhang	2013	2013 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies	10.1109/EIDWT.2013.76	40-bit encryption;computer science;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;attribute-based encryption;computer network	Crypto	-41.327771187575216	74.1489522043369	36503

In many cases, however, exploitation of existing vulnerabilities may not be practical and, moreover, not all applications may suffer because of the identified vulnerabilities. Therefore, we may need to analyze a protocol for weaker notions of security. In this paper, we present a security model that supports such weaker notions. In this model, the overall goals of an authentication protocol are broken into a finer granularity; for each fine level authentication goal, we determine the """"least strongest-attacker"""" for which the authentication goal can be satisfied. We demonstrate that this model can be used to reason about the security of supposedly insecure protocols. Such adaptability is particularly useful in those applications where one may need to trade-off security relaxations against resource requirements."""	authentication	Naveed Ahmed;Christian Damsgaard Jensen	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19125-1_18	computer security model;otway–rees protocol;security through obscurity;computer science;authentication protocol;spnego;wide mouth frog protocol;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-39.109891549415785	72.64062463086337	36622

Contract signature is similar to a real-life contract. No less than two signers take part in a contract signature. After introducing the concept and definition of contract signature, a scheme based on Discrete Logarithm (DL) and Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptosystems is presented. This scheme allows signers, whose ordinary signature schemes use many different cryptographic systems, to generate a single signature. The scheme requires neither a trusted arbitrator nor a high degree of interaction between signers. We then prove that this scheme is secure under the discrete logarithm assumption.	cryptosystem;digital signature;discrete logarithm;elliptic curve cryptography;real life	Wang Lianhai;Manu Malek	2006			ring signature;digital signature;merkle signature scheme;eddsa;elliptic curve digital signature algorithm;computer science;digital signature algorithm;blind signature;schnorr signature;elgamal signature scheme	Security	-41.59012866766371	75.77651989464913	36666
be292ab8e346770d2c86d0c3827f4321b07bc50f	improvements to nfc mobile transaction and authentication protocol.		A protocol for NFC mobile authentication and transaction is recently proposed by W. Chen et al. This protocol is used for micropayments, where the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) pays for its customers. The main advantage of this protocol is its compatibility with the existing GSM network. This paper suggests some improvements in this protocol from security point of view. As this protocol is used for monetary transactions, it should be as secure as possible. This paper presents an improved version of the existing protocol with a detailed analysis at the end. The user interaction with the system is improved making it more user friendly. An additional layer of security has been added by introducing PIN authentication by the user. Mutual authentication is improved by adding freshness by the mobile device in order to resist replay attack. We also add digital signatures with the transaction messages for data integrity and non-repudiation.	antivirus software;authentication protocol;channel (communications);communications protocol;data integrity;digital signature;entity–relationship model;micropayment;mobile device;mutual authentication;near field communication;non-repudiation;personal identification number;randomness;replay attack;usability	Muhammad Qasim Saeed	2013	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		authentication protocol;internet privacy;computer security;challenge-handshake authentication protocol;computer network	Security	-46.27189561401496	71.94382438804402	36693

(CCS 2013), for two reasons: (1) The construction is deterministic, and thus there are high-entropy input distributions on which the construction fails to extract random bits, and (2) The construction is not forward secure, and presented solutions aiming at restoring forward security have not been rigorously analyzed. We propose a seeded variant of Bertoni et al.’s PRNG with input which we prove secure in the sense of robustness, delivering in particular concrete security bounds. On the way, we make what we believe to be an important conceptual contribution, developing a variant of the security framework of Dodis et al. tailored at the ideal permutation model that captures PRNG security in settings where the weakly random inputs are provided from a large class of possible adversarial samplers which are also allowed to query the random permutation. As a further application of our techniques, we also present a simple and very efficient key-derivation function based on sponges (which can hence be instantiated from SHA-3 in a black-box fashion), which we also prove secure when fed with samples from permutation-dependent distributions.	black box;concrete security;forward secrecy;key derivation function;programming paradigm;provable security;random permutation;sha-3	Peter Gazi;Stefano Tessaro	2016		10.1007/978-3-662-49890-3_4	sha-3;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;key derivation function;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-37.83036963955162	76.62147342067793	36757

We demonstrate our techniques using publicly available records from the state of Texas, and reduce the entropy of a mother's maiden name from an average of close to 13 bits down to below 6.9 bits for more than a quarter of the people targeted, and down to a zero entropy (i.e., certainty of their mothers maiden name) for a large number of targeted individuals. This poses a signi cant risk not only to individuals whose mothers maiden name can easily be guessed, but highlights the vulnerability of the system as such, given the traditional reliance of authentication by mother maiden names for nancial services. While our techniques and approach are novel, it is important to note that these techniques { once understood { do not require any insider information or particular skills to implement. This emphasizes the need to move away from mothers maiden names as an authenticator. Using the techniques described, during testing we were able to deduce the mother's maiden name for approximately 4,105,111 Texans.	algorithm;authentication;cryptography;data mining;entropy (information theory);henry spencer;mystery meat navigation;threat (computer)	Virgil Griffith;Markus Jakobsson	2005		10.1007/11496137_7	telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;authentication;computer security;algorithm	Security	-44.38191422234748	78.20054590837552	36771

We propose an aggregate signature scheme which is an extension in two standpoints of structured signatures and ID-based signatures, i.e., we construct an identity-based structured aggregate signature scheme. The proposed scheme is expected to be used with consumer-generated media services. We prove the security of the proposed scheme with tight reduction under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the random oracle model. Tight reduction means that the cost of a reduction algorithm is independent of an adversary's capability, i.e., security is not downgraded by the adversary's capability. To the best of our knowledge, no structured signature scheme with tight reduction has been proposed to date because it contains complicated structures that make the reduction inefficient. Note that the security of our scheme captures the switching attack (CCS 2007, Boldyreva et al.) and the re-ordering attack (ISPEC 2007, Shao), which break several famous schemes.	adversary (cryptography);aggregate data;aggregate function;algorithm;computation;computational diffie–hellman assumption;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;digital signature;random oracle;user-generated content	Tomoya Iwasaki;Naoto Yanai;Masaki Inamura;Keiichi Iwamura	2016	2016 IEEE 30th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2016.99	random oracle;ring signature;digital signature;computer science;provable security;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;user-generated content;schnorr signature;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-41.9945930395145	72.99151052479507	36918

So this paper proposes a versatile trust model based on multidimensional trust evaluation, MDTrust. The concept of multi-dimensional trust is introduced and the approach of evaluation which uses the joint of subjective and objective evaluation is presented. We use the discrete degree of the set of evaluation similarity between peers' evaluation to measure the feedback credibility, in order to resolve the problem of collusion and bad-mouthing. Consequently, simulation and analysis shows that MDTrust can calculate the trust value effectively and reasonably and discard the malicious peers from P2P system.

Three RSA type schemes are proposed, first two are not semantically secure where as the other two schemes are semantically secure. The decryption speed of the proposed schemes is about two times as fast as RSA for a 2 log n-bit message. It is shown that the proposed schemes are more secure than the RSA scheme when purely common plaintexts are encrypted in the broadcast application and are as secure as the RSA scheme against ciphertext attack. In addition the proposed schemes are also secure against partially known plaintext attack. First two are not semantically secure but the third one is semantically secure.	ciphertext;cryptosystem;encryption;known-plaintext attack;plaintext;public-key cryptography;rsa (cryptosystem);semantic security	Sahadeo Padhye	2006	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	-39.65396769977873	78.09672849083728	36994

In this paper, a new fuzzy cryptographic technique without use of chaff data, Randomized Dissolvent Template (RDT), is proposed for biometric set modalities. The proposed technique is designed to dissolve the enrolled biometric set into a random secret resource, so as to construct robust secured templates by exploiting at least two resources of randomness. In this way, when one fingerprint is used for multiple applications, each time the additional information leakage by secured templates will not exceed the new introduced random information, so RDT is reusable. We thus provide two novel RDT-based constructions in practice: Fuzzy Reconciler using set difference threshold and Fuzzy Dissolver using set intersection threshold. Security analysis proves the new constructions have enough computational complexity for the required security properties, and implementations on FVC2002DB fingerprint database show that the proposed schemes can bring about better accuracy performance over current Fuzzy Vault and Fuzzy Extractor, thus are more promising for biometric-based security applications.	biometrics;computational complexity theory;cryptography;fingerprint;fuzzy extractor;information leakage;key (cryptography);key management;non-repudiation;randomized algorithm;randomness extractor;remote digital terminal;spectral leakage;vault	Jinyang Shi;Kwok-Yan Lam;Ming Gu;Husheng Li	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425487	computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;key management;data mining;security analysis;computer security;statistics	Security	-37.883751453038556	70.3125537119957	37069

In the present work, we clarify that claim in respect to a linear cryptanalysis (in the very spirit of Matsui’s classic one) applied to modified DES algorithm with S-boxes having parity check bits. The results of our investigations show that embedding parity checks in the outputs of these S-boxes does not generally guarantee more suitable for that kind of cryptanalysis best multi-round linear characteristics. Their structure, the corresponding bias and the number of effective bits depend crucially on the parity position chosen, and may lead not only to reduction but as well to growth in complexity of successful linear cryptanalysis compared to that towards the original DES.	embedded system;linear cryptanalysis;s-box	Yuri L.

4e114a4cb13d693d31c259196ed8352ac2c39320	cobalt: separating content distribution from authorization in distributed file systems	content distribution;distributed file system	How should a distributed file system manage access to protected content? On one hand, distributed storage should make data access pervasive: authorized users should be able to access their data from any location. On the other hand, content protection is designed to restrict access — this is often accomplished by limiting the set of computers from which content can be accessed. In this paper, we propose a new method for storing content in distributed storage called Cobalt. Rather than grant access to data based on the computer that reads the data, Cobalt grants access based on the physical proximity of authorized users. Protected content is stored encrypted in the distributed Blue File System; files can only be decrypted through the cooperation of a personal, mobile device such as cell phone. The Cobalt device is verified by content providers: it acts as a proxy that protects their interests by only decrypting data when policies specified during content acquisition are satisfied. Wireless communication with the device is used to determine the physical proximity of its user; when the Cobalt device moves out of range, protected content is made inaccessible. Our results show that Cobalt adds only modest overhead to content acquisition and playback, yet it enables new forms of interaction such as the ability to access protected content on ad hoc media players and create playlists that adapt to the tastes of nearby users.	authorization;clustered file system;cobalt;computer;copy protection;cryptography;dce distributed file system;data access;digital distribution;encryption;hoc (programming language);mobile device;mobile phone;overhead (computing);pervasive informatics	Kaushik Veeraraghavan;Andrew Myrick;Jason Flinn	2007			content management;computer science;operating system;database;internet privacy;distributed file system;world wide web	OS	-48.707796136227195	65.16188544079554	37249

Because the key production in these algorithms is performed functionally and deterministically, there is a relation between the keys and their length that makes the differential analysis of the keys possible. Moreover, the fixed length and values of the keys make these algorithms unsafe against exhaustive key searches. In this study, a block cipher algorithm called indefinite block ciphering based on variable and great length key which belongs to probabilistic (nondeterministic) family is presented. In this algorithm, the key depends on the plain text and is produced indecisively by a random number and the connectivity of the different parameters. On the other hand, the plain text is divided into blocks with size of random number. The proposed algorithm was evaluated, and the results were compared with those of the deterministic and other nondeterministic algorithms. This comparison was indicative of the high performance and security of the new algorithm with respect to the other approaches.

68ddfd8dc2082907e35d90778b2981c6deae9e8c	online social networks : is it the end of privacy ? (etude des menaces contre la vie privée sur les réseaux sociaux : quantification et possibles solutions)		Sharing information between users constitutes the cornerstone of the Web 2.0. Online Social Networks (OSN), with their billions of users, are a core component of this new generation of the web. In fact, OSNs offer innovative services allowing users to share their self-generated content (e.g., status, photos etc.) for free. However, this free access is usually synonymous with a subtle counterpart: the collection and usage of users’ personal information in targeted advertisement. To achieve this goal, OSN providers are collecting a tremendous amount of personal, and usually sensitive, information about their users. This raises concerns as this data can be exploited by several entities to breach user privacy. The primary research goals of this thesis are directed toward understanding the privacy impact of OSNs. Our first contribution consists in demonstrating the privacy threats behind releasing personal information publicly. Two attacks are constructed to show that a malicious attacker (i.e., any external attacker with access to the public profile) can breach user privacy and even threaten his online security. Our first attack shows how seemingly harmless interests (e.g., music interests) can leak privacy-sensitive information about users. In particular, we infer their undisclosed (private) attributes using the public attributes of other users sharing similar interests. Leveraging semantic knowledge from Wikipedia and a statistical learning method, we demonstrated through experiments —based on more than 104K Facebook profiles— that our inference technique efficiently predicts attributes that are very often hidden by users. Our second attack is at the intersection of computer security and privacy. In fact, we show the disastrous consequence of privacy breach on security by exploiting user personal information —gathered from his public profile— to improve the password cracking process. First, we propose a Markov chain password cracker and show through extensive experiments that it outperforms all probabilistic password crackers we compared against. In a second step, we systematically analyze the idea that additional personal information about a user helps in speeding up password guessing. We propose a methodology that exploits this information in the cracking process and demonstrate that the gain can go up to 30%. These studies clearly indicate that publicly disclosing personal information harms privacy, which calls for a method to estimate this loss. Our second contribution tries to answer this question by providing a quantitative measure of privacy. We propose a practical, yet formally proved, method to estimate the uniqueness of each profile by studying the amount of information carried by public profile attributes. To achieve our goal, we leverage Ads Audience Estimation platform and an unbiased sample of more than 400K Facebook	bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;computer security;entity;experiment;information sensitivity;linear algebra;machine learning;malware;markov chain;password cracking;personally identifiable information;privacy law;web 2.0;wikipedia;world wide web	Abdelberi Chaabane	2014				Security	-55.818252183728895	62.81527818141346	37323
a88aef66a44165978ac33ca8fc4f04b409b28daa	toward exposing timing-based probing attacks in web applications †	web security;side channel;probing attack;privacy	Web applications have become the foundation of many types of systems, ranging from cloud services to Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Due to the large amount of sensitive data processed by web applications, user privacy emerges as a major concern in web security. Existing protection mechanisms in modern browsers, e.g., the same origin policy, prevent the users' browsing information on one website from being directly accessed by another website. However, web applications executed in the same browser share the same runtime environment. Such shared states provide side channels for malicious websites to indirectly figure out the information of other origins. Timing is a classic side channel and the root cause of many recent attacks, which rely on the variations in the time taken by the systems to process different inputs. In this paper, we propose an approach to expose the timing-based probing attacks in web applications. It monitors the browser behaviors and identifies anomalous timing behaviors to detect browser probing attacks. We have prototyped our system in the Google Chrome browser and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by using known probing techniques. We have applied our approach on a large number of top Alexa sites and reported the suspicious behavior patterns with corresponding analysis results. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that the effectiveness of the timing-based probing attacks is dramatically limited by our approach.	browser extension;cloud computing;embedded system;embedding;execution;extravasation;google chrome;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;inference;internet of things;internet privacy;internet security;national origin;protection mechanism;rem sleep behavior disorder;runtime system;same-origin policy;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;timing channel;web site;web application;web page;webplatform	Jian Mao;Yue Chen;Futian Shi;Yaoqi Jia;Zhenkai Liang	2017		10.3390/s17030464	web application security;computer science;engineering;side channel attack;web navigation;internet security;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-55.7105638544137	61.08109786060605	37347
86974483bcda5f0cb8409e99842a2e0610f7d64d	a polynomial-time key-recovery attack on mqq cryptosystems		We investigate the security of the family of MQQ public key cryptosystems using multivariate quadratic quasigroups (MQQ). These cryptosystems show especially good performance properties. In particular, the MQQ-SIG signature scheme is the fastest scheme in the ECRYPT benchmarking of cryptographic systems (eBACS). We show that both the signature scheme MQQ-SIG and the encryption scheme MQQ-ENC, although using different types of MQQs, share a common algebraic structure that introduces a weakness in both schemes. We use this weakness to mount a successful polynomial time key-recovery attack. Our key-recovery attack finds an equivalent key using the idea of so-called good keys that reveals the structure gradually. In the process we need to solve a MinRank problem that, because of the structure, can be solved in polynomial-time assuming some mild algebraic assumptions. We highlight that our theoretical results work in characteristic 2 which is known to be the most difficult case to address in theory for MinRank attacks. Also, we emphasize that our attack works without any restriction on the number of polynomials removed from the public-key, that is, using the minus modifier. This was not the case for previous MinRank like-attacks againstMQ schemes. From a practical point of view, we are able to break an MQQ-SIG instance of 80 bits security in less than 2 days, and one of the more conservative MQQ-ENC instances of 128 bits security in little bit over 9 days. Altogether, our attack shows that it is very hard to design a secure public key scheme based on an easily invertible MQQ structure.	cryptosystem;dictionary attack;digital signature;ecrypt;encryption;fastest;key-recovery attack;modifier key;polynomial;public-key cryptography;time complexity	Jean-Charles Faugère;Danilo Gligoroski;Ludovic Perret;Simona Samardjiska;Enrico Thomae	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-662-46447-2_7	discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-38.35444294875608	78.98184177311941	37365

We evaluate CBDG using a combination of experiments with PlanetLab and real cloud storage services, demonstrating that we can bind fetched data to the location originally hosting it with high precision.

But experts advise that the idea be well thought out before applying it to the market. The analysis of business competitors is one of the ways that helps the entrepreneur devise strategies to seize the market. However, the manual process of this review is time-consuming and tiring. Considering the great interaction of companies and their clients in social networks and Internet applications, this work presents LISE as a solution. This solution is a system developed to automate the process of analyzing competitors, using the application of Google Maps to collect data of the competitors of the locality that the entrepreneur wants to develop his company. As an expected contribution, this paper intends that this tool helps entrepreneurs to analyze their competitors quickly and easily.	internet;locality of reference;social network	Nayara da Silva Ferreira;Valéria Oliveira Costa	2018		10.1145/3243082.3267443	competitor analysis;data mining;marketing;locality;the internet;sentiment analysis;social network;computer science	ML	-55.72136316259119	62.91309999685073	37479

With the need for responsiveness in view, we claim that (instead of preventing the cheat) cheating detection schemes could represent profitable solutions, which enable the identification of cheaters without impeding a realtime evolution of the game. Based on a general framework able to fairly model game time advancements which was recently proposed [4], we provide evidence of its effectiveness on a specific case of time cheat termed fast rate cheat. According to this malicious scheme, players alter the event generation rate of game events. We show that detection of fast rate cheat can be easily accomplished based on the proposed framework.	event generator;interactivity;responsiveness	Stefano Ferretti;Marco Roccetti	2006		10.1145/1230040.1230045	non-cooperative game;synchronization;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;peer-to-peer;internet privacy;computer security;profitability index	Security	-59.90055756375376	69.63659669874234	37481

We have identified various trust factors and developed a trust model for each trust factor to ensure security. We have proposed and analysed our trust factors evaluation-based secure routing (TFSR) protocol using network simulator NS2. The result shows that trust factors and trust models enhances secure communication in WSN for various possible attacks.

To date, however, there appears to be no study which has identified a systematic method that could be used by an attacker to undermine an anomaly-based intrusion detection system. This paper shows how an adversary can craft an offensive mechanism that renders an anomaly-based intrusion detector blind to the presence of on-going, common attacks. It presents a method that identifies the weaknesses of an anomaly-based intrusion detector, and shows how an attacker can manipulate common attacks to exploit those weaknesses. The paper explores the implications of this threat, and suggests possible improvements for existing and future anomaly-based intrusion detection systems.	adversary (cryptography);anomaly detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;apache forrest;archive;data model;internet;linux;os-tan;passwd;ptrace;rendering (computer graphics);securityfocus;setuid;static program analysis;stephanie forrest;system call;traceroute	Kymie M.

Previous research has shown that the information extracted from webbrowsers can uniquely identify an end-user. To collect webbrowser specific information, intentional JavaScript codes are embedded in web pages. In this paper, we show that fingerprinting characteristics of a webbrowser can also be collected by solely checking the network traffic data generated when browsing a website. We collect network traffic data generated by browsing the homepage of the most popular websites. Based on this data, we show that the browser fingerprinting characteristics can be inferred with high accuracy. Among these characteristics, type of webbrowser can be identified with over 70\% accuracy rate. Usage status of popular plug-ins like JavaScript and flash can also be accurately identified.	code;device fingerprint;embedded system;fingerprint (computing);javascript;network traffic control;tcp/ip stack fingerprinting;web page	Jiangmin Yu;Eric Chan-Tin	2014		10.1145/2665943.2665968	anonymity;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Metrics	-55.99140948105688	61.383805742578424	37696

In these attacks, adversaries induce honest nodes to exhibit undesirable behaviors by misrepresenting their intent or network conditions. Our method is based on a novel combination of static analysis with symbolic execution and dynamic analysis with concrete execution. The former finds code paths that are likely vulnerable, and the latter emulates adversarial actions that lead to effective attacks. Our method is precise (i.e., no false positives) and we show that it scales to complex protocol implementations. We apply it to four diverse protocols, including TCP, the 802.11 MAC, ECN, and SCTP, and show that it is able to find all manipulation attacks that have been previously reported for these protocols. We also find a previously unreported attack for SCTP. This attack is a variant of a TCP attack but must be mounted differently in SCTP because of subtle semantic differences between the two protocols.	adversary (cryptography);emulator;explicit congestion notification;static program analysis;symbolic execution	Nupur Kothari;Ratul Mahajan;Todd D.

One of the most interesting of its features is that it can be used to reason about security in face of attempted attacks on low-level algebraic properties of the functions used in a protocol. Indeed, it has been used successfully to either reproduce or discover a number of such attacks. In this paper we give for the first time a precise formal specification of the main features of the NPA inference system: its grammar-based techniques for invariant generation and its backwards reachability analysis method. This formal specification is given within the well-known rewriting framework so that the inference system is specified as a set of rewrite rules modulo an equational theory describing the behavior of the cryptographic algorithms involved. We then use this formalization to prove some important meta-logical properties about the NPA inference system, including the soundness and completeness of the search algorithm and soundness of the grammar generation algorithm. The formalization and soundness and completeness theorems not only provide also a better understanding of the NPA as it currently operates, but provide a modular basis which can be used as a starting point for increasing the types of equational theories it can handle. ∗ Corresponding author.

fbf8a94e2d55c2c3d8b91c4723ef9e36cb91148b	advancing attacker models of satellite-based localization systems: the case of multi-device attackers		In this paper, we report on recent advancements in attacking satellite-based positioning systems and on shortcomings of proposed countermeasures. Applications based on satellite positioning and navigation systems make use of a deployed infrastructure that is challenging to protect and secure against attacks. Many of the proposed protection mechanisms and solutions in the wild are based on and analyzed with respect to single-antenna attacker models that should in the meantime be considered outdated as they are no longer appropriate. Due to a significant drop in complexity and cost to perform multi-device attacks on these systems, the attacker models need to be adjusted to comprise more powerful adversaries that have recently become a reality. By demonstrating the implementation of a simple yet effective multi-antenna setup, we outline possible attacks against systems that are otherwise considered secure.	countermeasure (computer);protection mechanism	Kai Jansen;Christina Pöpper	2017		10.1145/3098243.3098270	computer network;computer security;satellite;computer science;countermeasure	Security	-51.931090358172746	70.25745360536077	37898

Moreover, exposure of unprotected authentication data is a high risk threat for organizations with online presence. The challenge is: how to ensure security of multifactor authentication data without deteriorating the performance of an identity verification system? To solve this problem, we present a novel framework that applies random projections to biometric data (inherence factor), using secure keys derived from passwords (knowledge factor), to generate inherently secure, efficient and revocable/renewable biometric templates for users’ verification. We evaluate the security strength of the framework against possible attacks by adversaries. We also undertake a case study of deploying the proposed framework in a two-factor authentication setup that uses users’ passwords and dynamic handwritten signatures. Our system preserves the important biometric information even when the user specific password is compromised – a highly desirable feature but not existent in the state-of-the-art transformation techniques. We have evaluated the performance of the framework on three publicly available signatures datasets. The results prove that the proposed framework does not undermine the discriminating features of genuine and forged signatures and the verification performance is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art benchmark results.	antivirus software;benchmark (computing);biometrics;identity verification service;multi-factor authentication;password;random projection;signature	Salman H.

The prime example is Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) that are subject to a growing body of research. These networks support applications used by the military and first responders, especially in emergency situations. Securing a DTN is not a trivial undertaking due to node mobility and the ADHOC method in which nodes communicate. Here, we propose a distributed trust management scheme to secure this class of networks with many of the underlying principles applicable to the larger class of Mobile ADHOC Networks (MANET). The scheme employs erasure coding not only to increase delivery rate in a DTN but also to infer the trustworthiness of the nodes along all paths that deliver a message segments to the destination. The proposed approach enables us to decide when the destination node should stop waiting for additional segments and instead request message retransmission. Moreover, even after the message is recreated successfully, additional segments received enable the destination to collect precious trust information about the nodes involved in delivery of these segments. We show how distributing this trust information identifies compromised nodes.	delay-tolerant networking;erasure code;message authentication code;retransmission (data networks);trust (emotion);trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science)	Thomas A.

In order to detect that an application is malicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant period of time is often required. Mobile devices have limited computation and power resources and thus are limited in their monitoring capabilities. In this paper we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses the collective resources of many mobile devices, “vaccinating” them against potentially unsafe applications. We suggest a new local information flooding algorithm called TTL Probabilistic Propagation (TPP). The algorithm is implemented in any mobile device, periodically monitors one or more application and reports its conclusions to a small number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information onwards, whereas each message has a predefined TTL. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform existing state of the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as well as network overhead. The maximal load of the algorithm (the fastest arrival rate of new suspicious applications, that can still guarantee complete monitoring), is analytically calculated and shown to be significantly superior compared to any non-collaborative approach. Finally, we show both analytically and experimentally using real world network data received among others from the Reality Mining Project, that implementing the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. In addition, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to several types of Byzantine attacks where some adversarial agents may generate false information, or abuse the algorithm in other way.	byzantine fault tolerance;computation;download;experiment;fastest;flooding algorithm;malware;maximal set;mobile device;overhead (computing);programmer;queueing theory;software propagation;tpp;transistor–transistor logic	Yaniv Altshuler;Shlomi Dolev;Yuval Elovici	2010	CoRR		cellular network;real-time computing;computer cluster;computer science;artificial intelligence;mobile device;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security	Mobile	-58.91536692808026	75.55948613702994	38035

Traditional public key cryptography uses certificates to bind the users with their public keys and are considered the best alternative for key distribution, but requires to have a very involved key management process. Identity based cryptography makes the key management easier but suffers from the key escrow problem and requires secure channel to issue the private keys to the users. Key issuing protocols deal with secret key issuing (SKI) process to overcome the two problems. We present an efficient and secure key issuing protocol which enables the identity based cryptosystems to be more acceptable and applicable in the real world. In the protocol, neither key generating center nor key privacy authority can impersonate the users to obtain the private keys. Performance and security analysis are being carried out for the protocol and is shown that it is efficient and secure against replay, man-in-the-middle and insider attacks.	communications protocol;cryptosystem;key (cryptography);key distribution;key escrow;key management;malware;man-in-the-middle attack;public key certificate;public-key cryptography;regular expression;secure channel	Ashutosh Saxena	2007	Third International Symposium on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/IAS.2007.22	weak key;shared secret;key;key authentication;security association;key exchange;key-agreement protocol;diffie–hellman key exchange;derived unique key per transaction;key management;key generation;ephemeral key;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;pre-shared key;key space;key distribution;computer security;key distribution center;computer network	Security	-44.9543190750549	73.99669360616271	38117

In this paper, we propose the PKI security system using the agent server in consideration of the characteristic of the mobile terminal instead of the mobile authenticator. In the radio communication PKI system, by using CRL, and OCSP, this solves the problem that the realtime verification is impossible. At the same time with that, by minimizing the traffic of the mobile terminal the load of the terminal was minimized and the effectiveness at the mobile authentication stage was enhanced.	e-commerce;electronic authentication;mobile phone;mutual authentication;online certificate status protocol;public key infrastructure;serial experiments lain;server (computing)	Sang-Wook Choi;Cheol-Joo Chae;Jae-Kwang Lee	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking	10.1109/FGCN.2008.116	business;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Robotics	-48.186402453210576	66.78259200732339	38268
7a11c569fb463c7fc912496329da69484fde0e3c	a server-aided verification signature scheme without random oracles		random oracles Bin Wang and Qing Zhao Information Engineering College of Yangzhou University No.196 West HuaYang Road, Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, P.R.China E-mail: jxbin76@yahoo.cn Abstract: Server-aided verification(SAV) signature is useful for power-constrained devices since a powerful server can assist in performing costly operations such as pairing operations. Wu et al. [13] defined three security notions for SAV protocol to prevent a server from convincing a verifier that an invalid signature is valid. Security against strong collusion attack provides the strongest security guarantee among these notions. They [13] constructed SAV protocols that meet the requirement of these notions respectively. But they did not provide concrete running time to show that the running time of a verifier in their SAV protocol is strictly less than that of a verifier in the original verification protocol. In addition, a problem left open by their work is to design SAV signature which is unforgeable without random oracles as well as sound against strong collusion attack. To address the above issues, we first choose to design a SAV protocol called SAV-Hofheinz for a short signature proposed by Hofheinz unforgeable in the standard model. Then we implement SAV-Hofheinz by the PBC library and shows that the running time of a verifier in SAV-Hofheinz is strictly less than that of a verifier in the verification protocol of Hofheinz short signature.	challenge–response spam filtering;computation;digital signature;information engineering;online and offline;oracle machine;periodic boundary conditions;precomputation;server (computing);time complexity	Bin Wang;Qing Zhao	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		merkle signature scheme;bin;collusion;pairing;information engineering;computer science;distributed computing	Crypto	-40.669655032910434	75.49165885248247	38307

Hiding the unique IDs of the tags is critical to prevent unauthorized tag tracking. In this paper, we analyze two mutual authentication protocols called MAP and EMAP, recently proposed by Peris-Lopez et. al. We show that a passive adversary eavesdropping on the open wireless medium, can extract the unique ID of the RFID tag by collecting an expected O(log2 L) challengeresponse exchange messages between the tag and the reader, where L is the length of the tag’s unique ID. To date, previously known attacks on MAP and EMAP require the active probing of each tag. Furthermore, attacks on MAP require O(L) active queries to be sent to the tag by a rogue reader, as opposed to O(log2 L).	adversary (cryptography);authentication protocol;authorization;confidentiality;map;mutual authentication;radio-frequency identification;rogue	Basel Alomair;Loukas Lazos;Radha Poovendran	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-76788-6_9	radio-frequency identification;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-45.382588195871946	74.24464287271641	38324

One such pitfall is that cryptography may create unique identifiers potentially usable to repeatedly and precisely re-identify and hence track users. This work investigates TLS Client Certificate Authentication (CCA), which currently transmits certificates in plain text. We demonstrate CCA's impact on client traceability using Apple's Apple Push Notification service (APNs) as an example. APNs is used by all Apple products, employs plain-text CCA, and aims to be constantly connected to its backend. Its novel combination of large device count, constant connections, device proximity to users and unique client certificates provides for precise client traceability. We show that passive eavesdropping allows to precisely re-identify and track users and that only ten interception points are required to track more than 80 percent of APNs users due to global routing characteristics. We conduct our work under strong ethical guidelines, responsibly disclose our findings, and can confirm a working patch by Apple for the highlighted issue. We aim for this work to provide the necessary factual and quantified evidence about negative implications of plain-text CCA to boost deployment of encrypted CCA as in TLS 1.3.	access network;authentication;authentication protocol;clickable;client certificate;cryptography;encryption;foremost;hyperlink;information privacy;information sensitivity;notification service;observable;plaintext;public key certificate;routing;software deployment;spectral leakage;telecommunications link;timeline of apple inc. products;traceability;transport layer security;unique identifier	Matthias Wachs;Quirin Scheitle;Georg Carle	2017	2017 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)	10.23919/TMA.2017.8002897	computer network;software deployment;encryption;unique identifier;push technology;cryptography;computer science;computer security;client certificate;server;authentication	Security	-54.558262818457635	61.798663302046016	38357

Malicious sinkhole nodes try to attract most of the surrounding network traffic by providing fake routes, invalidating alternative legitimate routes and disrupting the normal network operation. Our detection proposal leverages on the existence of “contamination borders”, formed by legitimate nodes under the influence of the sinkhole attack and, at the same time, neighbors of other non-contaminated legitimate nodes. We show that analyzing the routing information of their vicinity, these border nodes are more likely to properly detect sinkholes. We evaluate our approach in a simulation framework and the results show the promising nature of the proposal in terms of detection capabilities and performance in comparison with other solutions in the literature.	network traffic control;routing;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Leovigildo Sánchez-Casado;Gabriel Maciá-Fernández;Pedro García-Teodoro;Nils Aschenbruck	2015	J.

A social botnet refers to a group of social bots under the control of a single botmaster, which collaborate to conduct malicious behavior while mimicking the interactions among normal OSN users to reduce their individual risk of being detected. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of exploiting a social botnet for spam distribution and digital-influence manipulation through real experiments on Twitter and also trace-driven simulations. We also propose the corresponding countermeasures and evaluate their effectiveness.

The protocol allows the user and the foreign server to establish a session key and carry out mutual authentication with the help of the home server. In the mutual authentication, user authentication is generally done in two steps. First, the user claims that a particular server is his home server. Second, that particular server is called in by the foreign server for providing a 'credential' which testifies the user's claim. We present a new attacking technique which allows a malicious server to modify the user's claim in the first step without being detected and provide a fake credential to the foreign server in the second step in such a way that the foreign server believes that the malicious server is the user's home server. We give some examples to explain why it is undesirable in practice if a roaming protocol is vulnerable to this attack. We also show that there are three roaming protocols proposed previously which are vulnerable to this attack.	credential;home server;malware;mutual authentication;server (computing);session key	Guomin Yang;Duncan S.

One of the features offered by P2P networks is the possibility of having several replicas of the same content distributed among multiple nodes. Despite its advantages (e.g. robustness and fault tolerance), it is crucial to guarantee content authenticity, as well as to enforce appropriate access control policies. However, the extremely decentralized nature of these environments makes impossible to apply classic solutions that rely on some kind of fixed infrastructure, typically in the form of on-line trusted third parties. In a previous work, we presented a protocol for content authentication based on public key certificates that does not rely on the existence of a public key infrastructure. In this paper, we show how these certificates can be extended to provide authorization capabilities. In our scheme, each peer classifies her contents according to several security labels. Peers allowed to access a given content must have a security clearance of at least the same level that the content's. These security clearances, which take the form of attributes in public key certificates, can be discretionally issued by the content provider	access control;authentication;authorization;byzantine fault tolerance;centralized computing;fault tolerance;file sharing;hoc (programming language);online and offline;peer-to-peer;public key certificate;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;self-organization;trusted third party	Esther Palomar;Juan E.

However, this special field communication brings new security challenges. In this paper, we propose a behavioral model NODE EYE for secure group communication in wireless Mesh networks. We contend that our model facilitates reasoning about protocols designed for public safety by integrating the behavioral trust and cryptographic aspects of group communication in the special field. We illustrate our concept by introducing group key agreement and distribution protocols to support special communication cases associated with the public safety.	behavioral modeling;cryptography;group key;secure communication;wireless mesh network	Qian Wei;Jingsha He;Xing Zhang	2010		10.1145/1852666.1852758	ieee 802.11s;wireless mesh network;computer science;mesh networking;distributed computing;order one network protocol;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-49.01823145330186	75.86126362015015	38442

Especially in the virtual private network (VPN) topology, with the emergence of the tunneling, private routing and cipher technology in VPN, there are two embarrassments for the protection of the entire VPN topology. One is that internal services will be uncovered in the Internet by the tunneling, which can be compromised by attacking the client-side endpoint of a VPN tunnel. The other is that firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) could not completely analyze the network packet content because of the private routing and cipher technology. Based on the analysis of the VPN topology, we put forward the multi-layered correlative control (MLCC) mechanism. MLCC is a multi-layered security protection mechanism based on VPN gateway incorporating client end-point, firewall, IDS and internal services. There are three types of correlative technology introduced in MLCC, which are endpoint extending, component correlation and service engine. By their combination, MLCC can turn the VPN protection into a correlative and full model and improve the security of the VPN topology. Finally, the performance analysis based on our prototype is presented.	cipher;client-side;communication endpoint;emergence;firewall (computing);intrusion detection system;layered security;network packet;network topology;profiling (computer programming);protection mechanism;prototype;routing;tunneling protocol;virtual private network	Kai Ouyang;Xiaowen Chu;Lijun Dong;Hengqing Wang;Ting Cai	2007	2007 International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage (NAS 2007)	10.1109/NAS.2007.39	computer security model;intrusion detection system;firewall;the internet;computer science;world wide web;computer security;network topology;computer network	Networks	-58.33629974921034	66.79884084173304	38517

Firewalls use a rule database to decide which packets will be allowed from one network onto another thereby implementing a security policy. With the introduction of new types of services and applications there is a growing demand for larger bandwidth and also for improved security. Both demands are in conflict since providing security partly relies on screening packet traffic, which implies a considerable overhead. In such a scenario as LAN and WAN speeds are becoming comparable, a single firewall can become a bottleneck and reduces the overall throughput of the network. A firewall with heavy load and limited processing power, which is supposed to be a first line of defence against attacks, becomes susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Many research groups have proposed different methods to improve efficiency and throughput to optimize firewalls. This paper presents and analyse various parallel implementations of packet filtering running on cost effective GPGPU. We describe an approach to efficiently exploit the massively parallel capabilities of the GPGPU.	denial-of-service attack;firewall (computing);general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;network packet;overhead (computing);throughput	Manoj Singh Gaur;Vijay Laxmi;Vasudevan Lakshminarayanan;Kamal Cahndra;Mark Zwolinski	2011		10.1145/2070425.2070465	real-time computing;computer science;network security;distributed computing;computer security;denial-of-service attack	Networks	-57.345224356469636	66.79144668019539	38567

By applying this technique, we achieve O(n) communication complexity per multiplication for a wide class of robust practical Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols. In particular our technique applies to robust threshold computationally secure protocols in the case of t < n/2 in the pre-processing model. Previously in the pre-processing model, O(n) communication complexity per multiplication was only known in the case of computationally secure non-robust protocols in the dishonest majority setting (i.e. with t < n) and in the case of perfectly-secure robust protocols with t < n/3. A similar protocol was sketched by Damgård and Nielsen, but no details were given to enable an estimate of the communication complexity. Surprisingly our robust reconstruction protocol applies for both the synchronous and asynchronous settings.	communication complexity;computation;preprocessor	Ashish Choudhury;Emmanuela Orsini;Arpita Patra;Nigel P.

The cloud server can provide powerful computing and storage capability as services. Since the decryption algorithm for attribute-based encryption needs a lot of computations, so with the help of cloud servers many attribute-based encryption schemes are designed for practical applications in cloud computing. To the best of our knowledge there does not exist any flexible key policy attribute-based proxy re-encryption (KP-AB-PRE) scheme with matrix access structure. In this paper, we present a KP-AB-PRE scheme, in which the cloud server can function as a proxy and deal with the attribute-based encryption (ABE) ciphertexts directly. In the proposed scheme, the key policy is matrix access structure. We will prove our scheme in the replayable adaptively chosen ciphertext attack (RCCA) security model. Our construction enjoys the desirable properties of unidirectional, non-interactive, and multi-use, and the secret key security is guaranteed.	access structure;algorithm;attribute-based encryption;chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext;cloud computing;computation;entity–relationship model;interactivity;key (cryptography);key size;pixel;provable security;proxy re-encryption;server (computing);virtual private server	Keying Li;Jianfeng Wang;Yinghui Zhang;Hua Ma	2014	J.

To effectively cope with arbitrary malicious disruption of data transmissions, we propose and evaluate the secure message transmission (SMT) protocol and its alternative, the secure single-path (SSP) protocol. Among the salient features of SMT and SSP is their ability to operate solely in an end-to-end manner and without restrictive assumptions on the network trust and security associations. As a result, the protocols are applicable to a wide range of network architectures. We demonstrate that highly reliable communication can be sustained with small delay and small delay variability, even when a substantial portion of the network nodes systematically or intermittently disrupt communication. SMT and SSP robustly detect transmission failures and continuously configure their operation to avoid and tolerate data loss, and to ensure the availability of communication. This is achieved at the expense of moderate transmission and routing overhead, which can be traded off for delay. Overall, the ability of the protocols to mitigate both malicious and benign faults allows fast and reliable data transport even in highly adverse network environments.	denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;fault tolerance;heart rate variability;hoc (programming language);network architecture;overhead (computing);routing	Panagiotis Papadimitratos;Zygmunt J.

3482d0596a4dc3a34c3c39c5588185f07e824ed1	unwanted behaviour detection and classification in network traffic		An Intrusion Detection System classifies activities at an unwanted intention and can log or prevent activities that are marked as intrusions. Intrusions occur when malicious activity and unwanted behaviour gain access to or affect the usability of a computer resource. During the last years, anomaly discovery has attracted the attention of many researchers to overcome the disadvantage of signature-based IDSs in discovering novel attacks, and KDDCUP’99 is the mostly widely used data set for the evaluation of these systems. Difficulty is discovering unwanted behaviour in network traffic after they have been subject to machine learning methods and processes. The goal of this research is using the SVM machine learning model with different kernels and different kernel parameters for classification unwanted behaviour on the network with scalable performance. The SVM model enables flexible, flow-based method for detecting unwanted behaviour and illustrates its use in the context of an incident, and can forward the design and deployment of improved techniques for security scanning. Although scalability and performance are major considerations and results also are targeted at minimizing false positives and negatives. The classification matured in this paper is used for improving SVM computational efficiency to detect intrusions in each category, and enhanced model is presented experimental results based on an implementation of the model tested against real intrusions.	anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;machine learning;malware;network traffic control;scalability;sensor;software deployment;support vector machine;usability	Ismail Melih Önem	2010			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining	ML	-61.442844880686096	64.11115816018444	38662
17ccac4c338330e6db889fedfc11af15bb109704	packed ciphertexts in lwe-based homomorphic encryption		In this short note we observe that the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method of packing many plaintext elements in a single Regev-type ciphertext, can be used for performing SIMD homomorphic operations on packed ciphertext. This provides an alternative to the Smart-Vercauteren (SV) ciphertextpacking technique that relies on polynomial-CRT. While the SV technique is only applicable to schemes that rely on ring-LWE (or other hardness assumptions in ideal lattices), the PVW method can be used also for cryptosystems whose security is based on standard LWE (or more broadly on the hardness of “General-LWE”). Although using the PVW method with LWE-based schemes leads to worse asymptotic efficiency than using the SV technique with ring-LWE schemes, the simplicity of this method may still offer some practical advantages. Also, the two techniques can be used in tandem with “general-LWE” schemes, suggesting yet another tradeoff that can be optimized for different settings.

Tailoring the architecture of the computation platform to the characteristics of the underlying cryptographic protocol enables for short authentication times, minimal hardware usage, while providing a higher level of security compared to today's standard cryptosystems. Due to the low hardware footprint it is ideally suited for integration into embedded systems with limited resources such as electronic control units in automobiles. All cryptographic functionality is strictly bound to an internal processing module thus hiding the complexity of the HECC operations. Automotive access control systems is am example of an application area that can be matched perfectly by the proposed architecture. Experiments show that a massive speed up can be achieved which can be exploited to save power or introduce additional security measures on algorithmic level.	algorithm;authentication protocol;computation;control system;cryptographic protocol;cryptosystem;embedded system;hyperelliptic curve cryptography;real-time computing;speedup	Alexander Klimm;Sebastian Vogel;Jürgen Becker	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing Workshops and Phd Forum	10.1109/IPDPS.2011.142	data authentication algorithm;cryptographic primitive;embedded system;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;cryptographic nonce;hash-based message authentication code;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing;computer security	Arch	-37.45665543865376	68.52107395815256	38777

b180a3baf9b4248097e354419bd56b1920c94fdc	information extraction and manipulation threats in crowd-powered systems	manipulation;security;crowdsourcing;extraction;privacy	Crowd-powered systems have become a popular way to augment the capabilities of automated systems in real-world settings. Many of these systems rely on human workers to process potentially sensitive data or make important decisions. This puts these systems at risk of unintentionally releasing sensitive data or having their outcomes maliciously manipulated. While almost all crowd-powered approaches account for errors made by individual workers, few factor in active attacks on the system. In this paper, we analyze different forms of threats from individuals and groups of workers extracting information from crowd-powered systems or manipulating these systems' outcomes. Via a set of studies performed on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and involving 1,140 unique workers, we demonstrate the viability of these threats. We show that the current system is vulnerable to coordinated attacks on a task based on the requests of another task and that a significant portion of Mechanical Turk workers are willing to contribute to an attack. We propose several possible approaches to mitigating these threats, including leveraging workers who are willing to go above and beyond to help, automatically flagging sensitive content, and using workflows that conceal information from each individual, while still allowing the group to complete a task. Our findings enable the crowd to continue to play an important part in automated systems, even as the data they use and the decisions they support become increasingly important.	amazon mechanical turk;information extraction;space: above and beyond;the turk	Walter S.

It is based on synchronization of Tree Parity Machines (TPM) by mutual learning. Two neural networks trained on their mutual output bits synchronize to a state with identical time dependent weights. This has been used for creation of a secure cryptographic secret key using a public channel. In this paper a genetic approach has been used in the field of neural cryptography for synchronizing tree parity machines by mutual learning process.

Many traditional access control systems based on certificates or predefined access control policies are insufficient to deal with abnormal access requests or hidden intrusions. A flexible and efficient mechanism is needed to support open authentication and secure interoperations. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an Adaptive Secure Interoperation system using Trust-Level (ASITL), which involves a statistical learning algorithm to judge an access request event, an adaptive calculating algorithm to dynamically adjust a user's trust-level and a self-protecting mechanism to prevent the system from potential risks. In particular, we also presented examples to demonstrate the secure working flow of ASITL.	interoperation	Li Jin;Zhengding Lu	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71549-8_10	computer access control;information exchange;computer science;access control;data mining;database;distributed computing;computer security	NLP	-44.28975587587001	67.9191077541135	38898
05ccf6e4f357d3954ad98a746b22e74cc3655cca	a cross-layer key establishment model for wireless devices in cyber-physical systems	wireless devices;cyber physical systems;cross layer;security;key establishment	Wireless communications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are vulnerable to many adversarial attacks such as eavesdropping. To secure the communications, secret session keys need to be established between wireless devices. In existing symmetric key establishment protocols, it is assumed that devices are pre-loaded with secrets. In the CPS, however, wireless devices are produced by different companies. It is not practical to assume that the devices are pre-loaded with certain secrets when they leave companies. As a consequence, existing symmetric key establishment protocols cannot be directly implemented in the CPS. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents a cross-layer key establishment model for heterogeneous wireless devices in the CPS. Specifically, by implementing our model, wireless devices extract master keys (shared with the system authority) at the physical layer using ambient wireless signals. Then, the system authority distributes secrets for devices (according to an existing symmetric key establishment protocol) by making use of the extracted master keys. Completing these operations, wireless devices can establish secret session keys at higher layers by calling the employed key establishment protocol. Additionally, we prove the security of the proposed model. We analyse the performance of the new model by implementing it and converting existing symmetric key establishment protocols into cross-layer key establishment protocols.	cyber-physical system;key exchange;session key;symmetric-key algorithm	Yuexin Zhang;Yang Xiang;Xinyi Huang	2017		10.1145/3055186.3055187	telecommunications;engineering;key distribution;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-50.06139681603442	72.42112021503341	38927

A signer may disavow a genuine document, if the signature is only verifiable with the aid of the signer under the condition that the signer is not honest. Undeniable signatures solve this problem by adding a new feature called the disavowal protocol in addition to the normal components of signature and verification. Disavowal protocol is able to prevent a dishonest signer from disavowing a valid signature. In some situations, an undeniable signature should be converted into a normal digital signature in order that the signature can be universally verified. Blind signatures the digital signatures that help a user to get a signature on a message without revealing the content of the message to a signer. For the blind signatures, if the signer is able to make an agreement with the user, then the underlying signer may include some common information that is known to the user, then such signatures are partially blind signatures. Convertible undeniable partially blind signatures are of the features of undeniable signatures, blind signatures, convertible undeniable signatures, and partially blind signatures. Recently, a convertible undeniable partially blind signature scheme was presented. In this paper, we first analyze a security flaw of the convertible undeniable partially blind signature scheme. To address the security flaw, we present an improvement on the disavowal protocol. The improved scheme can prevent the signer from either proving that a given valid signature as invalid, or cheating the verifier	blind signature;digital signature;flaw hypothesis methodology;formal verification;type signature;undeniable signature;zero-knowledge proof	Song Han;Elizabeth Chang;Tharam S.

Due to the complex nature of MANETs and its resource constraint nodes, there has always been a need to develop lightweight security solutions. Since MANETs require a unique, distinct, and persistent identity per node in order for their security protocols to be viable, Sybil attacks pose a serious threat to such networks. A Sybil attacker can either create more than one identity on a single physical device in order to launch a coordinated attack on the network or can switch identities in order to weaken the detection process, thereby promoting lack of accountability in the network. In this research, we propose a lightweight scheme to detect the new identities of Sybil attackers without using centralized trusted third party or any extra hardware, such as directional antennae or a geographical positioning system. Through the help of extensive simulations and real-world testbed experiments, we are able to demonstrate that our proposed scheme detects Sybil identities with good accuracy even in the presence of mobility.	centralized computing;complex system;distributed computing;experiment;hoc (programming language);peripheral;positioning system;self-organization;simulation;sybil attack;system of systems;testbed;trusted third party;two generals' problem	Sohail Abbas;Madjid Merabti;David Llewellyn-Jones;Kashif Kifayat	2013	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2012.2221912	computer science;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-52.315020048719454	75.6333834370319	39094

The scheme is obtained from a modification of Agrawal, Boneh, and Boyen's lattice identity-based encryption scheme. In this construction, we use two distinct trapdoors for finding short bases. One trapdoor enables the real implementation to generate short bases for all lattices. The other trapdoor enables the simulator to generate short bases for all lattices. Furthermore, the generating short bases are used to sample short vectors as signatures. Our scheme is computationally efficient. The scheme's strong unforgeability is proven in the standard model and rests on the hardness of the small integer solution problem. Finally, we extend the basic construction to obtain a hierarchical identity-based signature scheme.

In addition, address book is encrypted, thus E-mail addresses can not be stolen for spamming. Each E–mail server is protected using SAML authorization policy, so E–mails are received only from authorized senders. Finally, all E–mail addresses are validated and certified by specially designed Secure E–mail Infrastructure (SEI) Authorities, organized in a federated hierarchy.

Our attack is applicable to square & multiply exponentiation and to table-based exponentiation algorithms, extending known timing attacks on unprotected implementations. Simulation experiments are conducted, which confirm the theoretical results. Interestingly, increasing the blinding length does not counteract our attack. Our attack can be adjusted to fulfil mild format restrictions. Effective countermeasures exist.

Structured P2P, in particular, has received a greater amount of research attention. Having trust in such the P2P environments can help mitigate many problems including security, because peers can choose to interact with the ones that are deemed trustworthy. However, there exists numerous hurdles that need to be overcome before a reliable trust system can be implemented for P2P. This thesis seeks to improve the existing reputation metrics and feedback mechanisms which are important components of the trust system. The new reputation metrics are more resilient to manipulations, and they take into account negative feedback. New protocols are also proposed as parts of the feedback mechanisms, and they allow an honest peer in a structured P2P system to securely detect if another peer has misbehaved. The new protocols make used of hardware-based security which is in the form of trusted devices: TPMs and the newly proposed trusted device called TTMs. The protocols are analyzed using formal methods and simulation. CSP is used to model and verify the properties of these protocols. The performance of these protocols is then evaluated using a new, distributed simulation platform called dPeerSim.

Users need PCs to access grid service. But there is no effective mechanism to manage the PCs in GSI. In order to apply GSI in Military Grid, a novel adaptive Proxy Certificates management scheme is brought forward based on the hierarchical one-way hash chains. The hierarchical one-way chain consists of two or more levels of chains, where values of a first-level chain act as roots of a set of second-level chains and each PC is protected by a hash value, so the PCs' available time can be controlled adaptively and safely. The experimental results indicate that the scheme more adapt to the Military Grid environments.	access grid;cryptographic hash function;grid security infrastructure;markov chain;one-way function;proxy server	Ying Liu;Jingbo Xia;Jing Dai	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74784-0_3	hash function;computer science;operating system;hash chain;database;distributed computing;world wide web;computer security;computer network	HPC	-44.015281725349915	68.93013406621772	39424

Security requirements in conducting eAuctions are mainly bid privacy, anonymity and public verifiability. Most of the secure protocols concentrate on privacy and anonymity, which are achieved through bidder-resolved multi-party computation, assuming two or more trusted third parties, either through numerous auctioneers or with asymmetric models in which the commercial entity of an auction issuer or registration manager is assumed in addition to the auctioneer. Multi-attribute reverse auctions promise higher market efficiency and effective information exchange. This work extends and uses the existing schemes. This scheme uses scoring function, winner determination in multi-attribute auctions to implement public verifiability. Anonymity is achieved through bidder side pseudonym generation. By results and analysis we say this is very simple and effective scheme. This scheme ensures public verifiability and anonymity in multiattribute auctions without revelation of the bids received, third parties and complex communications.	auction algorithm;computation;distributed computing;formal verification;information exchange;information security;requirement;scoring functions for docking;unique user	T.

To reduce the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense mechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In this regard, an important decision for Internet users is their amount of investment in self-defense mechanisms when insurance solutions are offered. In this paper, we investigate the problem of self-defense investments in the Internet, under full and partial cyber-insurance coverage models. By the term ‘self-defense investment’, we mean the monetary-cum-precautionary cost that each user needs to invest in employing risk mitigating self-defense mechanisms, given that it is fully or partially insured by the Internet insurance agencies. We propose a general mathematical framework by which co-operative and non-co-operative Internet users can decide whether or not to invest in self-defense for ensuring both, individual and social welfare. Our results show that (1) co-operation amongst users results in more efficient self-defense investments than those in a non-cooperative setting, under a full insurance coverage model and (2) partial insurance coverage motivates non-cooperative Internet users to invest more efficiently in self-defense mechanisms when compared to full insurance coverage.	anti-spam techniques;antivirus software;botnet;computer virus;cyber-insurance;distributed computing;download;emoticon;feedback;ibm notes;internet security;peer-to-peer;risk management;vii	Ranjan Pal;Leana Golubchik	2010	2010 IEEE 30th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2010.79	risk analysis;insurance;computer science;information security;social welfare;internet security;computer security;government;computer network	Metrics	-61.642138378178004	72.86999273512056	39647

It is therefore necessary to integrate security requirements into the design of VANETs and defend VANET systems against misbehavior, in order to ensure correct and smooth operations of the network. In this paper, we propose a security system for VANETs to achieve privacy desired by vehicles and traceability required by law enforcement authorities, in addition to satisfying fundamental security requirements including authentication, nonrepudiation, message integrity, and confidentiality. Moreover, we propose a privacy-preserving defense technique for network authorities to handle misbehavior in VANET access, considering the challenge that privacy provides avenue for misbehavior.

Privacy is a critical issue for these networks as adversaries may be able to eavesdrop or observe the presence of sensor data to infer information that was not intended to be revealed. The devices that constitute sensor networks are low-powered, compute-constrained devices. Any privacy solution should carefully consider the tradeoffs between supporting location-privacy and energy consumption. We explore two main classes of privacy issues: content privacy and originator location privacy. Content privacy can be maintained through conventional cryptographic methods that provide data confidentiality. We briefly discuss system design techniques that are needed to prevent an adversary from correlating observations from multiple messages to infer the content of encrypted sensor readings. We then examine the issue of protecting the originating sensor's location by studying several multihop routing mechanisms for ad hoc networks. We focus our discussion on three classes of routing protocols: the class of the shortest path routing protocols, the class offloading protocols, and a hybrid class of routing.	adversary (cryptography);confidentiality;cryptography;encryption;hoc (programming language);privacy;routing;sensor;shortest path problem;systems design;ubiquitous computing	Celal Ozturk;Yanyong Zhang;Wade Trappe;Maximilian Ott	2004	Second IEEE Workshop on Software Technologies for Future Embedded and Ubiquitous Systems, 2004.

For safeguarding such secret keys or decrypting or signing in a threshold manner, Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) in bilinear groups is required. In this paper, we show a method of verifiably sharing a random secret in a bilinear group. Our method is simple and practical. It can be regarded as a generalisation of threshold linear VSS in finite fields to the case when the secrets are in bilinear groups. We present a general scheme for verifiably sharing secrets in bilinear groups. A modified version of our general scheme with improved efficiency is also introduced.	bilinear filtering;cryptography;cryptosystem;discrete logarithm;distributed key generation;login;randomness;verifiable secret sharing	Jie Zhang;Futai Zhang	2013	IJGUC	10.1504/IJGUC.2013.056258	theoretical computer science;shamir's secret sharing;homomorphic secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;proactive secret sharing;secret sharing;computer security;finite field;verifiable secret sharing	Crypto	-39.92182554600749	74.67054975413234	39803
8f542461e68aae9daa48424914be69ad72d2238b	human readable paper verification of prêt à voter	receipt freeness	The Pret a Voter election scheme provides high assurance of accuracy and secrecy, due to the high degree of transparency and auditability. However, the assurance arguments are subtle and involve some understanding of the role of cryptography. As a result, establishing public understanding and trust in such systems there remains a challenge. It is essential that a voting system be not only trustworthy but also widely trusted. In response to this concern, we propose to add a mechanism to Pret a Voter to generate a conventional (i.e. human readable) paper audit trail that can be invoked should the outcome of the cryptographic count be called into question. It is hoped that having such a familiar mechanism as a safety net will encourage public confidence. Care has to be taken to ensure that the mechanism does not undermine the carefully crafted integrity and privacy assurances of the original scheme. We show that, besides providing a confidence building measure, this mechanism brings with it a number of interesting technical features: it allows extra audits of mechanisms that capture and process the votes to be performed. The mechanism proposed also has the benefit of providing a robust counter to the danger of voters undermining the receiptfreeness of property by trying to retain the candidate list. Furthermore, we show how the paper audit trail can be extended with cryptographic elements that ensure the integrity of the paper trail and allow for the safe use of voting machines with a touchscreen user interface. © 2008 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

When it was noted that quantum computers could break public key cryptosystems based on number theory extensive studies have been undertaken on QKD. Based on quantum mechanics, QKD offers unconditionally secure communication. Now, the progress of research in this field allows the anticipation of QKD to be available outside of laboratories within the next few years. Efforts are made to improve the performance and reliability of the implemented technologies. But several challenges remain despite this big progress. The task of how to test the apparatuses of QKD For example did not yet receive enough attention. These devises become complex and demand a big verification effort. In this paper we are interested in an approach based on the technique of probabilistic model checking for studying quantum information. Precisely, we use the PRISM tool to analyze the security of BB84 protocol and we are focused on the specific security property of eavesdropping detection. We show that this property is affected by the parameters of quantum channel and the power of eavesdropper.	bb84;cryptographic protocol;cryptosystem;data rate units;eve;experiment;key (cryptography);model checking;quanta computer;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;quantum information;quantum key distribution;quantum mechanics;requirement;secure communication;sensor;statistical model	Mohamed Elboukhari;Mostafa Azizi;Abdelmalek Azizi	2010	CoRR	10.5121/ijnsa.2010.2207	model checking;secure communication;number theory;quantum information;quantum key distribution;quantum information science;computer science;theoretical computer science;quantum network;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing;quantum channel;quantum computer;computer security;quantum cryptography;bb84	Crypto	-43.704315380359716	82.66369315240232	39876
61a9b488f9b964b6c4597432c6fb86566843ab64	efficient biometrics remote user authentication scheme.	user authentication	Recently, bio-information has been playing an important role in modern user authentication schemes. In 2004, Lin and Lai proposed a flexible biometrics remote user authentication scheme. However, their scheme is vulnerable and cannot provide mutual authentication between user and remote system. Hence, Khan and Zhang improved the security of a flexible biometrics remote user authentication scheme in 2007. This paper shows that Khan et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to both the impersonation attack and the man-in-the-middle attack. Moreover, an efficient and flexible biometrics user authentication scheme is proposed to enhance the performance and correct the security problems.	biometrics;british informatics olympiad;man-in-the-middle attack;mutual authentication	Ming-Jheng Li;Justie Su-tzu Juan	2008			data authentication algorithm;chip authentication program;challenge–response authentication;computer science;authentication protocol;generic bootstrapping architecture;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;multi-factor authentication;mathematics;internet privacy;challenge-handshake authentication protocol	Security	-45.49019908159605	74.30565560380971	39886
170749e814f563ce673cf84c16d240cf090cce85	lightweighted and energy-aware mikey-ticket for e-health applications in the context of internet of things		E-health applications have emerged as a promising approach to provide unobtrusive and customizable support to elderly and frail people based on their situation and circumstances. However, due to limited resources available in such systems and data privacy concerns, security issues constitute a major obstacle to their safe deployment. To secure e-health communications, key management protocols play a vital role in the security process. Nevertheless, current e-health systems are unable to run existing standardized key management protocols due to their limited energy power and computational capabilities. In this paper, we introduce two solutions to tailor MIKEY-Ticket protocol to constrained environments. Firstly, we propose a new header compression scheme to reduce the size of MIKEY’s header from 12 Bytes to 3 Bytes in the best compression case. Secondly, we present a new exchange mode to reduce the number of exchanged messages from six to four. We have used a formal validation method to evaluate and validate the security properties of our new tailored MIKEY-Ticket protocol. In addition, we have evaluated both communication and computational costs to demonstrate the energy gain. The results show a decrease in MIKEY-Ticket overhead and a considerable energy gain without compromising its security properties.	byte;computation;energy drift;entity;information privacy;internet of things;key management;low-power broadcasting;mickey;mikey;overhead (computing);software deployment;ticket granting ticket;unobtrusive javascript	Mohammed Riyadh Abdmeziem;Djamel Tandjaoui;Imed Romdhani	2018	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2018.10011717	key management;distributed computing;computer network;computer science;ticket;byte;header;internet of things;information and computer science	Security	-50.26030041701613	74.77914830788393	39917

The secure issues are inevitable and urgent in range query (a pivotal component). Secure range query (SRQ), removing such concerns, is urgent to resolve. Concretely, a secure k-d tree (SKD tree) is constructed by invoking comparable encryption (CE) and AES, and SKD mechanism is proposed to resolve SRQ directly over the encrypted data. Until both the CE and AES are cracked, it is infeasible to reveal the query, data base or query result. In our proposal, only a single interaction is occurred between user and cloud, which promotes the searching efficiency dramatically. Experimental studies show that SKD mechanism is efficient over really geographical datasets.	cathode ray tube;cloud computing;computation;confidentiality;database;encryption;outsourcing;range query (database);range searching;round-trip engineering	Yanguo Peng;Hui Li;Jiangtao Cui;Yixiao Zhu;Changgen Peng	2016	2016 International Conference on Networking and Network Applications (NaNA)	10.1109/NaNA.2016.31	query optimization;computer science;k-d tree;database;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	DB	-40.919307040005215	66.85504637227903	39922

Due to extraordinarily high mobility of vehicles in a vehicular network, frequent handover requests will be a norm, which initiates the demand for an effective and fast authentication scheme that can maintain the service continuity in presence of the frequent handover events. However, previously reported authentication schemes, although with minimized handover latency and packet loss rate, may disclose the location information of the mobile user to the third party, which will seriously violate the location privacy of the user. In this paper, we propose a location privacy preserving authentication scheme based on blind signature in the elliptic curve domain. The scheme cannot only provide fast authentication, but also guarantee the security and location anonymity to the public. To analyze the proposed scheme, a theoretical traceability analysis is conducted, which shows that the probability of tracing an vehicle's route is negligibly small. We will also examine the authentication speed of the scheme, and show that the scheme can satisfy seamless handover for fast moving vehicles.	authentication;authentication protocol;blind signature;computation;digital signature;experience;exponentiation by squaring;internet;mutual authentication;network packet;on-board data handling;privacy;scott continuity;seamless3d;traceability;web service	Chenxi Zhang;Rongxing Lu;Pin-Han Ho;Anyi Chen	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.447	vehicular ad hoc network;transport;digital signature;information privacy;computer science;information security;probability;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;elliptic curve;blind signature;computer security;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	-48.59628368219318	73.505239041924	40039

There are various types of DDoS attacks with different characteristics. These differences have made very difficult to detect such attacks. Furthermore, the sophisticated the evolution of DDoS attacks techniques and the enhanced scale of Botnet encourage attackers to launch DDoS attacks. The IP spoofing technique also makes difficult detect and traceback of DDoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a new detection model for spoofed DDoS attacks using dispersible traffic matrix and weighted moving average. This proposed detection model can not only visualize network traffic streams but also describe the dispersibility characteristics of DDoS attacks such as intensity, duration and rate of DDoS traffic. We carry out experiments on both DARPA 2000 dataset and real data in our network testbed environments so as to validate the feasibility of our approach. Our approach demonstrates that it effectively detects the DDoS attacks in the early stage and in very short time, even though DDoS attacks’ streams are low. Also, the proposed detection model shows a good performance in terms of detection accuracy, speed, and false alarms.	algorithm;botnet;denial-of-service attack;experiment;ip address spoofing;network packet;network traffic control;pattern recognition;sensor;testbed;traffic analysis	Tae Hwan Kim;Dong Seong Kim;Sang Min Lee;Jong Sou Park	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02617-1_30	trinoo;computer science;engineering;internet privacy;moving average;application layer ddos attack;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Security	-61.54817397010527	66.22582167625218	40048

It helps them to multiply or lessen their resources according to their operational requirements. However, the organizations are reluctant to store their sensitive information on the cloud due to various privacy and identity tracking threats. In the past few years, a lot of research and development efforts have been made to define centralized and federated security mechanisms for the protection of identity information in a cloud environment. However, to the best of our knowledge none of the systems have been designed keeping anonymity as the key component. This paper describes an authentication and authorization protocol which outlines the main features of anonymous communication in the cloud. The solution is an extension of existing standards making it easy to integrate and compatible with existing standards. c © 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, these solutions clearly expose the fact that the protection of private keys is a security bottleneck in these sensitive applications. This problem is further worsened in the cases where a single and unchanged private key must be kept secret for very long time (such is the case of certi cation authority keys, bank and e-cash keys, etc.). One crucial defense against exposure of private keys is o ered by threshold cryptography where the private key functions (like signatures or decryption) are distributed among several parties such that a predetermined number of parties must cooperate in order to correctly perform these operations. This protects keys from any single point of failure. An attacker needs to break into a multiplicity of locations before it can compromise the system. However, in the case of long-lived keys the attacker still has a considerable period of time (like a few years) to gradually break the system. Here we present proactive public key systems where the threshold solutions are further enhanced by periodic refreshment of the shared function in such a way that the private key (and its corresponding public key) is kept unchanged for as long as required, yet the breaking of the system requires the attacker to break into IBM Research, Haifa Scienti c Center, amir@haifa.vnet.ibm.com University of California, San Diego, markus@cs.ucsd.edu Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stasio@theory.lcs.mit.edu IBM T.J.

We present such solutions for a variety of discrete log based cryptosystems including DSS and Schnorr signatures, ElGamal-like signatures and encryption, undeniable signatures, and more. We build on previous work on proactive secret sharing and threshold schemes, and develop a general methodology for the combination of many of these systems into secure proactive public key solutions.	cryptosystem;discrete logarithm;e-commerce;encryption;ibm research;public-key cryptography;reliability engineering;secret sharing;secure communication;single point of failure;thomas j. watson research center;undeniable signature	Amir Herzberg;Markus Jakobsson;Stanislaw Jarecki;Hugo Krawczyk;Moti Yung	1997		10.1145/266420.266442	e-commerce;web of trust;implicit certificate;financial cryptography;key exchange;self-signed certificate;computer science;certificate signing request;public key infrastructure;threshold cryptosystem;public key fingerprint;public key certificate;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;pre-shared key;root certificate;key distribution;computer security;certificate authority;id-based cryptography;computer network	Security	-43.5943061742292	69.77424638959562	40235

We define privacy violation taxonomies, as well as review attack trees, and illustrate the practical implementation of PTATA through example scenarios. The advantages and drawbacks to our method are also discussed.

b3efd8cc656c052e918cb11dfde833ca93de775a	a lightweight secure vanet-based navigation system		Recently, large scale vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs)-based navigation systems have drawn much research attention. Although an enhanced secure and privacy VANET-based navigation (EVSPN) scheme has been proposed to prevent the replay and man-in-the- middle attacks, providing signature and verification on the public key infrastructure (PKI) based signatures of all messages relayed costs much computation resource and incurs a high authentication delay for not only the vehicles but also the roadside units (RSUs), especially when the navigation service is busy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight secure VANET-based navigation scheme (LSVN) that has a lower computation cost and a lower authentication delay. By the LSVN, a vehicle firstly initiates the navigation service with a RSU nearby to request a shared symmetric key for further communication with other RSUs in the VANET. Then, the best route will be calculated. The pseudo identity of the vehicle and the shared keying materials are sent to the RSUs on the route of the vehicle to its destination. At last, the vehicle will be led to the destination by these RSUs in series. We formally verify, by BAN Logic, that the LSVN scheme can provide the guarantee of the integrity of messages and mutual authentication. Performance analysis shows that the LSVN can minimize the use of cryptographic operations and reduce authentication delay significantly comparing with the VSPN scheme and the EVSPN scheme.	antivirus software;burrows–abadi–needham logic;computation;hoc (programming language);key (cryptography);mutual authentication;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;series and parallel circuits;symmetric-key algorithm	Gen Li;Maode Ma;Chunfeng Liu;Yantai Shu	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417462	vehicular ad hoc network;navigation;computer science;authentication;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.44530708295118	74.26891561905182	40360

IDS plays a vital role in securing cloud data centers. This paper introduces an analytical model based on embedded Markov chain to analyze the packet processing using Bro IDPS (Intrusion Detection Prevention System). In this paper, we combine the preventive and detective rules to find a trade-off between network performance and security. We focus on how to enhance the detection engine and to predict the attack signatures taking into account of average service time, packet loss and blocking probability.	profiling (computer programming)	Iman El Mir;Abdelkrim Haqiq;Dong Seong Kim	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52941-7_45	intrusion detection system;internet privacy;computer security;intrusion prevention system;computer network	Security	-60.717777374425324	64.37730816600775	40481

However, AI training relies on highly sensitive and private data which significantly limit their applications and robustness evaluation. Moreover, the data access management after sharing across organization heavily relies on legal restriction, and there is no guarantee in preventing data leaking after sharing. Here, we present Genie, a secure AI platform which allows AI models to be trained on medical data securely. The platform combines the security of Intel Software Guarded eXtensions (SGX), transparency of blockchain technology, and verifiability of open algorithms and source codes. Genie shares insights of genetic and medical data without exposing anyone’s raw data. All data is instantly encrypted upon upload and contributed to the models that the user chooses. The usage of the model and the value generated from the genetic and health data will be tracked via a blockchain, giving the data transparent and immutable ownership.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;bitcoin;code;control flow;data access;encryption;formal verification;genie;immutable object;information privacy;open-source software;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;upload	Jingwei Zhangy;Anne Kim;Dianbo Liu;Sandeep C.

For example, a variation in the delivered Quality of Services (QoS) can frustrate buyers and they leave the e-marketplace, causing revenue loss. The inherent uncertainties of open marketplaces motivate the design of reputation systems to facilitate buyers in finding honest feedback from other buyers (advisers). Defining the threshold for acceptable level of honesty of advisers is very important, since inappropriately set thresholds would filter away possibly good advice, or the opposite - allow malicious buyers to badmouth good services. However, currently, there is no systematic approach for setting the honesty threshold. We propose a self-adaptive honesty threshold management mechanism based on PID feedback controller. Experimental results show that adaptively tuning the honesty threshold to the market performance enables honest buyers to obtain higher quality of services in comparison with static threshold values defined by intuition and used in previous work.	adaptive filter;control theory;e-commerce;pid;reputation system	Zeinab Noorian;Mohsen Mohkami;Julita Vassileva	2014		10.1145/2631775.2631821	e-commerce;computer science;world wide web	Web+IR	-59.800322150175724	73.18352955377281	40615

A global iceberg is a distributed denial of service attack, where some elements globally recur many times across the distributed streams, but locally, they do not appear as a deny of service. A natural solution to defend against global iceberg attacks is to rely on multiple routers that locally scan their network traffic, and regularly provide monitoring information to a server in charge of collecting and aggregating all the monitored information. Any relevant solution to this problem must minimise the communication between the routers and the coordinator, and the space required by each node to analyse its stream. We propose a distributed algorithm that tracks global icebergs on the fly with guaranteed error bounds, limited memory and processing requirements. We present a thorough analysis of our algorithm performance. In particular we derive a tight upper bound on the number of bits communicated between the multiple routers and the coordinator in presence of an oblivious adversary. Finally, we present the main results of the experiments we have run on a cluster of single-board computers. Those experiments confirm the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm to track global icebergs hidden in very large input data streams exhibiting different shapes.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;aqua;denial-of-service attack;deterministic algorithm;distributed algorithm;experiment;network traffic control;on the fly;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);requirement;router (computing);server (computing);single-board computer;streaming algorithm	Emmanuelle Anceaume;Yann Busnel;Nicolo Rivetti;Bruno Sericola	2015	2015 IEEE 34th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS)	10.1109/SRDS.2015.19	algorithm design;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;computational model;computer security;approximation algorithm;server;computer network	Security	-58.28988087747259	71.93031110932051	40665
5ffc035d46a3ff9126282fe037d91bf16995175d	faulds: a non-parametric iterative classifier for internet-wide os fingerprinting		Recent work in OS fingerprinting has focused on overcoming random distortion in network and user features during Internet-scale SYN scans. These classification techniques work under an assumption that all parameters of the profiled network are known a-priori -- the likelihood of packet loss, the popularity of each OS, the distribution of network delay, and the probability of user modification to each default TCP/IP header value. However, it is currently unclear how to obtain realistic versions of these parameters for the public Internet and/or customize them to a particular network being analyzed. To address this issue, we derive a non-parametric Expectation-Maximization (EM) estimator, which we call Faulds, for the unknown distributions involved in single-probe OS fingerprinting and demonstrate its significantly higher robustness to noise compared to methods in prior work. We apply Faulds to a new scan of 67M webservers and discuss its findings.	distortion;expectation–maximization algorithm;fingerprint (computing);internet protocol suite;network packet;operating system;tcp/ip stack fingerprinting	Zain Shamsi;Daren B.

In MIPv6 environment, an important design consideration for publickey-based  binding update protocols is to minimize asymmetric cryptographic operations in Mobile Nodes (MNs) with constraint computational  power. In this paper we propose a novel approach that can resolve the current security problems in CAM-DH, by adopting Aura’s  Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) scheme with two hashes, which search for hash collisions in the CGA method in order  to prevent brute-force attacks. By comparing with CAM-DH, our approach shows promise to minimize the computational overhead  of MNs, as well as provide better management and stronger security than CAM-DH does.    	computation	Yong-Hwan Lee;Il-Sun You;Sang-Burm Rhee	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30134-9_10	distributed computing;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Mobile	-47.24842875692421	74.57763631254619	40810

Specifically, as in the prior notions, time is divided into predefined time periods (e.g., days); each signature includes the number of the time period in which it was generated; while the public key remains the same, the secret keys evolve with time. Also, as in key-insulated schemes, the user has two modules, signer and home base: the signer generates signatures on his own, and the base is needed only to help update the signer’s key from one period to the next. The main strength of intrusion-resilient schemes, as opposed to prior notions, is that they remain secure even after arbitrarily many compromises of both modules, as long as the compromises are not simultaneous. Moreover, even if the intruder does compromise both modules simultaneously, she will still be unable to generate any signatures for the previous time periods. We provide an efficient intrusion-resilient signature scheme, provably secure in the random oracle model based on the strong RSA assumption. We also discuss how such schemes can eliminate the need for certificate revocation in the case of on-line authentication.	antivirus software;authentication;certificate authority;digital signature;online and offline;provable security;public-key cryptography;random oracle;strong rsa assumption;type signature	Gene Itkis;Leonid Reyzin	2002	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/3-540-45708-9_32	computer science;authentication;mathematics;internet privacy;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-43.69661102995559	76.75018571674099	40894

27038af4c3b7336d8d7cd670a43ce9d2c080191a	privacy preserving group linkage	secure multi party computation;group linkage;privacy	The problem of privacy-preserving record linkage is to find the intersection of records from two parties, while not revealing any private records to each other. Recently, group linkage has been introduced to measure the similarity of groups of records [19]. When we extend the traditional privacy-preserving record linkage methods to group linkage measurement, group membership privacy becomes vulnerable – record identity could be discovered from unlinked groups. In this paper, we introduce threshold privacy-preserving group linkage (TPPGL) schemes, in which both parties only learn whether or not the groups are linked. Therefore, our approach is secure under group membership inference attacks. In experiments, we show that using the proposed TPPGL schemes, group membership privacy is well protected against inference attacks with a reasonable overhead.	approximation algorithm;computation;cryptography;experiment;information sensitivity;linkage (software);overhead (computing);privacy;regular expression	Fengjun Li;Yuxin Chen;Bo Luo;Dongwon Lee;Peng Liu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22351-8_27	computer science;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-40.25476295468536	64.32885019767716	40958
d5d73df953ebffc6916685a0e324d72a75dbd1b8	security in personal genomics: lest we forget	genomic security;authenticated data structures;digital signature chaining;integrity;authenticity	Genomic privacy has attracted much attention from the research community, mainly since its risks are unique and breaches can lead to terrifying leakage of most personal and sensitive information. The much less explored topic of genomic security needs to mitigate threats of the digitized genome being altered by its owner or an outside party, which can have dire consequences, especially, in medical or legal settings. At the same time, many anticipated genomic applications (with varying degrees of trust) require only small amounts of genomic data. Supporting such applications requires a careful balance between security and privacy. Furthermore, genome's size raises performance concerns. We argue that genomic security must be taken seriously and explored as a research topic in its own right. To this end, we discuss the problem space, identify the stakeholders, discuss assumptions about them, and outline several simple approaches based on common cryptographic techniques, including signature variants and authenticated data structures. We also present some extensions and identify opportunities for future research. The main goal of this paper is to highlight the importance of genomic security as a research topic in its own right.	authentication;cryptography;data structure;information sensitivity;privacy;problem domain;spectral leakage	Gene Tsudik	2017		10.1145/3052973.3056128	data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-41.86984056856583	63.082458345487936	40969

In such schemes, users no longer have the physical control of their data. As a result, the reliability of the cloud storage service is the major concern of users. Existing approaches evaluate the cloud storage provider CSP from users' feedback, which are subjective and often biased. In this paper, we propose a new rating algorithm to assess the credibility of CSPs. Our solution is based on technical evidence, e.g., results of the data possession checking, which is a useful approach to ensure the integrity and availability of outsourced data in the cloud. Our approach aggregates the collaborative provable data possession results from the community of clients to achieve high coverage. Meanwhile, we introduce a new reputation-based solution to detect malicious clients based on public verification, and adjust the trust value of such clients. We prototyped our approach and analysed the scheme thoroughly. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is efficient, secure, and has the distinguishing property that supports collaborative verification among composite cloud storage frameworks.

In such a scenario, digital iden- tity management (DIM) technology is fundamental in cus- tomizing user experience, protecting privacy, underpinning accountability in business transactions, and in complying with regulatory controls. Users identity consists of data, referred to as identity attributes, that encode relevant-security properties of the clients. However, identity attributes can be target of several attacks: the loss or theft of mobile devices results in a exposure of identity attributes; identity attributes that are send over WI-FI or 3G networks can be easily inter- cepted; identity attributes can also be captured via Bluetooth connections without the user's consent; and mobile viruses, worms and Trojan horses can access the identity attributes stored on mobile devices if this information is not protected by passwords or PIN numbers. Therefore, assuring privacy and security of identity attributes, as well as of any sensitive information stored on mobile devices is crucial. In this paper we address such problems by proposing an approach to manage user identity attributes by assuring their privacy- preserving usage. The approach is based on the concept of privacy preserving multi-factor authentication achieved by a new cryptographic primitive which uses aggregate signatures on commitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK) protocols. We present the implementation of such approach on Nokia NFC cellular phones and report performance evaluation results.	digital identity;identity management system	Federica Paci;Elisa Bertino;Sam Kerr;Anna Cinzia Squicciarini;Jungha Woo	2009	JSW		user experience design;computer science;mobile device;database;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;identity management;computer network	Mobile	-45.330160205416725	61.717880811854755	41332

In traditional computer forensics where investigation is carried out on a dead system (e.g. hard disk), data integrity is the first and foremost issue for digital evidence validity in court. In the context of live system forensics, volatile data are acquired from a running system. Due to the ever-changing and volatile nature, it is impossible to verify the integrity of volatile data. Let alone the integrity issue, a more critical problem - data consistency, is present at the data collected on a live system. In this paper, we address and study the consistency issue on live systems forensics. By examining the memory data on a Unix system, we outline a model to distinguish integral data from inconsistent data in a memory dump.	computer forensics;core dump;data integrity;foremost;hard disk drive;unix	Frank Y.

It was designed by Silverman, Hoffstein and Pipher. The NTRU cryptosystem was patented by NTRU Cryptosystems Inc. (which was later acquired by Security Innovations) and available as IEEE 1363.1 and X9.98 standards. NTRU is resistant to attacks based on Quantum computing, to which the standard RSA and ECC public-key cryptosystems are vulnerable to. In addition, NTRU has higher performance advantages over these cryptosystems. Considering this importance of NTRU, it is highly recommended to adopt NTRU as part of a cipher suite along with widely used cryptosystems for internet security protocols and applications. In this paper, we present our analytical study on the implementation of NTRU encryption scheme which serves as a guideline for security practitioners who are novice to lattice-based cryptography or even cryptography. In particular, we show some non-trivial issues that should be considered towards a secure and efficient NTRU implementation.	algorithm;cipher;cloud computing security;computer security;convolution;cryptosystem;digital signature;ecc memory;homomorphic encryption;internet security;key generation;lattice-based cryptography;ntru;ntruencrypt;polynomial ring;public-key cryptography;quantum computing	Praveen Gauravaram;Harika Narumanchi;Nitesh Emmadi	2014	2014 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968468	ntru;plaintext-aware encryption;theoretical computer science;post-quantum cryptography;cryptosystem;mathematics;distributed computing;deterministic encryption;ntruencrypt;computer security;56-bit encryption	Crypto	-39.42206985684541	79.31518004369212	41362

4a0c0f2fb44306730e6b106bd885b8def515daf7	multi-input functional encryption in the private-key setting: stronger security from weaker assumptions	functional encryption;private-key;multi-input functional encryption;adaptive security	We construct a general-purpose multi-input functional encryption scheme in the private-key setting. Namely, we construct a scheme where a functional key corresponding to a function f enables a user holding encryptions of $$x_1, \ldots , x_t$$ x1,…,xt to compute $$f(x_1, \ldots , x_t)$$ f(x1,…,xt) but nothing else. This is achieved starting from any general-purpose private-key single-input scheme (without any additional assumptions) and is proven to be adaptively secure for any constant number of inputs t. Moreover, it can be extended to a super-constant number of inputs assuming that the underlying single-input scheme is sub-exponentially secure. Instantiating our construction with existing single-input schemes, we obtain multi-input schemes that are based on a variety of assumptions (such as indistinguishability obfuscation, multilinear maps, learning with errors, and even one-way functions), offering various trade-offs between security assumptions and functionality. Previous and concurrent constructions of multi-input functional encryption schemes either rely on stronger assumptions and provided weaker security guarantees (Goldwasser et al. in Advances in cryptology—EUROCRYPT, 2014; Ananth and Jain in Advances in cryptology—CRYPTO, 2015), or relied on multilinear maps and could be proven secure only in an idealized generic model (Boneh et al. in Advances in cryptology—EUROCRYPT, 2015). In comparison, we present a general transformation that simultaneously relies on weaker assumptions and guarantees stronger security.	eurocrypt;functional encryption;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;instance (computer science);learning with errors;map;one-way function;public-key cryptography;symmetric-key algorithm	Zvika Brakerski;Ilan Komargodski;Gil Segev	2016	Journal of Cryptology	10.1007/s00145-017-9261-0	discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-38.33080596446636	75.92264757780292	41459

However, the limitation thus imposed on scalability is unacceptable for many types of information systems, such as e-government services, which require an infrastructure able to support heavy computation loads while remaining highly reliable. Our scalable approach opts for the next best thing to full reliability: a certification authority with a probability of arbitrary failure so low that, in practice, false positives should never occur.	divergence (computer science);machine that always halts	Xavier Bonnaire;Rudyar Cortes;Fabrice Kordon;Olivier Marin	2017	Comput.

However, common authentication schemes are not applicable in ad hoc networks because public key infrastructures with a centralized certification authority are hard to deploy there. We propose and evaluate a security concept based on a distributed certification facility. A network is divided into clusters with one special head node each. These cluster head nodes execute administrative functions and hold shares of a network key used for certification. New nodes start to participate in the network as guests; they can only become full members with a network-signed certificate after their authenticity has been warranted by some other members. The feasibility of this concept was verified by simulation. Three different models for node mobility were used in order to include realistic scenarios as well as make the results comparable to other work. The simulation results include an evaluation of the log-on times, availability, and communication overhead.	authentication;centralized computing;certificate authority;computer cluster;computer security;confidentiality;hoc (programming language);multi-storey car park;overhead (computing);precondition;private network;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;routing;secret sharing;secure communication;simulation;waypoint	Marc Bechler;Hans-Joachim Hof;Daniel Kraft;Frank Pählke;Lars C.

Although almost all Web sites have their own privacy policies and declare that they won't disclose users' privacy without their consent, users may still receive spam messages after they register or interact with some sites. Obviously, commercial interests can drive some sites to disclose users' privacy such as email addresses to third parties. In this paper, we propose a collaborative method to identify Web sites that disclose users' privacy by using a privacy disclosure finding protocol inspired from secure multiparty computation (SMC). The advantages of our method are that the method can identify privacy disclosure sites while preserving volunteers' privacy and that the method uses a collaborative approach without relying on a trusted third party which makes it practical in the reality of Web based services.	email;privacy policy;secure multi-party computation;spamming;trusted third party;web application	Feng Gao;Jingsha He;Shunan Ma	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA)	10.1109/SOCA.2010.5707176	web service;privacy software;privacy policy;web application;information privacy;privacy by design;trusted third party;computer science;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;collaboration	Security	-54.24883548622908	62.42674471706917	41486

Properly managing these alerts and correlating them to previously seen threats is critical in the ability to effectively protect a network from attacks. Manually correlating events can be a slow tedious task prone to human error. We present a two-stage alert correlation approach involving an artificial neural network (ANN) autoassociator and a single parameter decision threshold-setting unit. By clustering closely matched alerts together, this approach would be beneficial to the analyst. In this approach, alert attributes are extracted from each alert content and used to train an autoassociator. Based on the reconstruction error determined by the autoassociator, closely matched alerts are grouped together. Whenever a new alert is received, it is automatically categorised into one of the alert clusters which identify the type of attack and its severity level as previously known by the analyst. If the attack is entirely new and there is no match to the existing clusters, this would be appropriately reflected to the analyst. There are several advantages to using an ANN based approach. First, ANNs acquire knowledge straight from the data without the need for a human expert to build sets of domain rules and facts. Second, once trained, ANNs can be very fast, accurate and have high precision for near real-time applications. Finally, while learning, ANNs perform a type of dimensionality reduction allowing a user to input large amounts of information without fearing an efficiency bottleneck. Thus, rather than storing the data in TCP Quad format (which stores only seven event attributes) and performing a multi-stage query on reduced information, the user can input all the relevant information available and instead allow the neural network to organise and reduce this knowledge in an adaptive and goal-oriented fashion.	artificial neural network;event correlation	Maxwell G.

More concretely, in the first part of the paper, we give a new proof of Yao’s XOR-Lemma that additionally applies to related theorems in the cryptographic setting. Our proof seems simpler than previous ones, yet immediately generalizes to statements similar in spirit such as the extraction lemma used to obtain pseudo-random generators from one-way functions [H̊astad, Impagliazzo, Levin, Luby, SIAM J. on Comp. 1999]. In the second part of the paper, we give a new proof of hardness amplification for weakly verifiable puzzles, which is more general than previous ones in that it gives the right bound even for an arbitrary monotone function applied to the checking circuit of the underlying puzzle. Both our proofs are applicable in many settings of interactive cryptographic protocols because they satisfy a property that we call “nonrewinding”. In particular, we show that any weak cryptographic protocol whose security is given by the unpredictability of single bits can be strengthened with a natural information theoretic protocol. As an example, we show how these theorems solve the main open question from [Halevi and Rabin, TCC2008] concerning bit commitment.	commitment scheme;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;exclusive or;formal verification;hardness of approximation;michael luby;one-way function;predicate (mathematical logic);pseudorandomness;theory;yao graph;monotone	Thomas Holenstein;Grant Schoenebeck	2010	CoRR		discrete mathematics;monotonic function;computer science;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;mathematics;pseudorandom generator;computational complexity theory;one-way function;computer security;algorithm;satisfiability	Theory	-37.85230011556141	75.94819838395048	41596

900e3d20259dfecfd4bbb0cdc0fe7ff471385ed8	introducing accountability to anonymity networks		Many anonymous communication (AC) networks rely on routing traffic through proxy nodes to obfuscate the originator of the traffic. Without an accountability mechanism, exit proxy nodes risk sanctions by law enforcement if users commit illegal actions through the AC network. We present BACKREF, a generic mechanism for AC networks that provides practical repudiation for the proxy nodes by tracing back the selected outbound traffic to the predecessor node (but not in the forward direction) through a cryptographically verifiable chain. It also provides an option for full (or partial) traceability back to the entry node or even to the corresponding user when all intermediate nodes are cooperating. Moreover, to maintain a good balance between anonymity and accountability, the protocol incorporates whitelist directories at exit proxy nodes. BACKREF offers improved deployability over the related work, and introduces a novel concept of pseudonymous signatures that may be of independent interest. We exemplify the utility of BACKREF by integrating it into the onion routing (OR) protocol, and examine its deployability by considering several system-level aspects. We also present the security definitions for the BACKREF system (namely, anonymity, backward traceability, no forward traceability, and no false accusation) and conduct a formal security analysis of the OR protocol with BACKREF using ProVerif, an automated cryptographic protocol verifier, establishing the aforementioned security properties against a strong adversarial model.	adversary model;anonymous web browsing;antivirus software;bilinear filtering;credential;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;dolev–yao model;entity;exemplification;formal verification;non-repudiation;overhead (computing);proverif;provable security;pseudonymity;routing;traceability;whitelist	Michael Backes;Jeremy Clark;Peter Druschel;Aniket Kate;Milivoj Simeonovski	2013	CoRR		internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.42994316719241	72.27828664520428	41667

We firstly formalize syntaxes of tweakable on-line ciphers and tweakable on-line authenticated encryption modes, and set up their security models, respectively. Then we propose the first new parallelizable permutation-based tweakable on-line cipher PTOC, which is constructed by a public random permutation and a universal hash function family with a tweak and a key. We prove that PTOC achieves related-key strong tweakable on-line pseudorandom permutation security using H-coefficients technique. Finally, this paper introduces a provably secure permutation-based tweakable on-line authenticated encryption scheme PTOAE, which provides both decryption-misuse resistance and related-key security. Tweakable on-line schemes can be widely applied to the data storage security, database security, cloud security, big data security, and so on.	authenticated encryption;authentication;big data;block cipher;cloud computing security;coefficient;computer data storage;cryptographic nonce;data security;database security;disk sector;hash function;linux/rk;misuse case;online and offline;point of view (computer hardware company);provable security;pseudorandom permutation;pseudorandomness;random permutation;related-key attack;storage security;universal hashing	Ping Zhang;Honggang Hu	2017	2017 IEEE Second International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace (DSC)	10.1109/DSC.2017.37	computer security model;pseudorandom permutation;theoretical computer science;cipher;random permutation;symmetric-key algorithm;cloud computing security;database security;authenticated encryption;computer science	Crypto	-41.08929686368708	68.71615000884941	41772

As the recommendations rely on personal user information, there is an inherent loss of privacy resulting from the use of such systems. While several works studied privacy-enhanced neighborhood-based recommendations, little attention has been paid to privacy preserving latent factor models, like those represented by matrix factorization techniques. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving matrix factorization by utilizing differential privacy, a rigorous and provable privacy preserving method. We propose and study several approaches for applying differential privacy to matrix factorization, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy trade-offs offered by each approach. We show that input perturbation yields the best recommendation accuracy, while guaranteeing a solid level of privacy protection.	differential privacy;floor and ceiling functions;online and offline;provable security;recommender system	Arnaud Berlioz;Arik Friedman;Mohamed Ali Kâafar;Roksana Boreli;Shlomo Berkovsky	2015		10.1145/2792838.2800173	computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;internet privacy;matrix decomposition;differential privacy	Security	-38.35745024215159	64.68051390688554	41784
375f7705ed1da8b7929e5357f39300ae12eaab07	expiration and revocation of keys for attribute-based signatures		Attribute-based signatures, introduced by Maji et al., are signatures that prove that an authority has issued the signer “attributes” that satisfy some specified predicate. In existing attribute-based signature schemes, keys are valid indefinitely once issued. In this paper, we initiate the study of incorporating time into attribute-based signatures, where a time instance is embedded in every signature, and attributes are restricted to producing signatures with times that fall in designated validity intervals. We provide three implementations that vary in granularity of assigning validity intervals to attributes, including a scheme in which each attribute has its own independent validity interval, a scheme in which all attributes share a common validity interval, and a scheme in which sets of attributes share validity intervals. All of our schemes provide anonymity to a signer, hide the attributes used to create the signature, and provide collusion-resistance between users.	attribute-based encryption;attribute-value system;cryptography;digital credential;electronic signature;embedded system;eurocrypt;functional encryption;id-based encryption;interactivity;non-monotonic logic;operating system;pkc (conference);scheme;trusted platform module;monotone	Stephen R.

For defending a global attacker, dummy message injection methods are employed by every node in WSN to enhance location privacy, which leads to significant overhead. Based on random walk model, we propose a novel scheme Chess-Board Alternation (CBA) which partition WSN into two sets, and each set operates active in an alternating fashion. We also prove CBA’s outstanding performance, including delivery time, energy consumption, and privacy theoretically and experimentally. In comparison with existing approaches, CBA can not only achieve perfect privacy but also decrease energy cost by 50% and the transmission latency from the source to the sink by more than 40%.	dummy variable (statistics);experiment;information-theoretic security;overhead (computing);privacy	Qian Zhou;Xiaolin Qin;Xiaojun Xie	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869947	random walk;latency (engineering);wireless sensor network;computer network;distributed computing;energy consumption;sink (computing);computer science	Security	-52.97383849451546	75.5295691951116	41806

Intuitively, location privacy may be obtained at the cost of query performance and query accuracy. The challenge addressed is how to obtain the best possible performance, subjected to given requirements for location privacy and query accuracy. Existing privacy solutions that use spatial cloaking employ complex server query processing techniques and entail the transmission of large quantities of intermediate result. Solutions that use transformation-based matching generally fall short in offering practical query accuracy guarantees. Our proposed framework, called SpaceTwist, rectifies these shortcomings for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries. Starting with a location different from the user's actual location, nearest neighbors are retrieved incrementally until the query is answered correctly by the mobile terminal. This approach is flexible, needs no trusted middleware, and requires only well-known incremental NN query processing on the server. The framework also includes a server-side granular search technique that exploits relaxed query accuracy guarantees for obtaining better performance. The paper reports on empirical studies that elicit key properties of SpaceTwist and suggest that the framework offers very good performance and high privacy, at low communication cost.	analysis of algorithms;client-side;correctness (computer science);database;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;location-based service;middleware;mobile phone;point of interest;privacy;requirement;server (computing);server-side;snapshot (computer storage);social inequality	Man Lung Yiu;Christian S.

How to establish a session key in node communication is a challenging task for WSNs. Considering the limitations in WSNs, such as low computing capacity, small memory, power supply limitations and price, we propose an efficient identity-based key management (IBKM) scheme, which exploits the Bloom filter to authenticate the communication sensor node with storage efficiency. The security analysis shows that IBKM can prevent several attacks effectively with acceptable computation and communication overhead.	authentication;bloom filter;capsule endoscopy;certificate authority;certification;computation (action);cryptosystem;key management;memory disorders;node - plant part;overhead (computing);power supply;sensor node;session key;storage efficiency;verification of theories	Zhongyuan Qin;Xinshuai Zhang;Kerong Feng;Qunfang Zhang;Jie Huang	2014		10.3390/s141017937	wireless sensor network;computer science;information security;bloom filter;key management;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.612252975991446	75.18256096556	41833

RCPBAC allows users using some data for certain purpose with conditions. The structure of RCPBAC model is defined and investigated. An algorithm is developed to achieve the compliance computation between access purposes (related to data access) and intended purposes (related to data objects) and is illustrated with role-based access control (RBAC) to support RCPBAC. According to this model, more information from data providers can be extracted while at the same time assuring privacy that maximizes the usability of consumers’ data. It extends traditional access control models to a further coverage of privacy preserving in data mining environment as RBAC is one of the most popular approach towards access control to achieve database security and available in database management systems. The structure helps enterprises to circulate clear privacy promise, to collect and manage user preferences and consent.	algorithm;computation;data access;data mining;database security;intension;keeper (password manager);privacy policy;role-based access control;usability;user (computing)	Md.

In particular, authentication has increasingly become a requirement in mobile P2P environments. This paper presents a new mutual authentication mechanism which requires less storage space and maintains a high level of security in mobile P2P networks. The proposed mechanism improves efficiency by avoiding the use of centralized entities and is designed to be agile in terms of both reliability and low-cost implementation. The mechanism suggested in the simulation evaluates the function costs occurring in authentication between the devices under mobile P2P network environment comparing to existing method in terms of basic operation costs, traffic costs, communications costs, storage costs and scalability. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism provides high authentication with low cryptography processing overhead.	authentication;peer-to-peer	Yoon-Su Jeong;Yong-Tae Kim;Seung-Soo Shin;Sang-Ho Lee	2013	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2013.04.019	computer science;information security;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;network access control;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-49.53081102902569	75.17368785477764	41985
7d54ab1932dcfee6b9f0e48dc4a0599751673a23	centralized group key management mechanism for vanet	centralized key management;vehicular ad hoc network;group key management	ABSTRACT#R##N##R##N#The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a novel wireless network and suffers security threats as other networks. Information exchanged in the network might be stolen by malicious users, and some secure mechanisms are needed to provide the privacy. In VANET, the vehicles can be separated to different groups. When vehicles in the same group want to communicate with others, they can use the group key to protect the messages, and the privacy in the group communication is preserved. In this paper, we propose a group key management method with centralized key management scheme for VANET. In each group, there is a group leader, and the group leader will manage the members and the keys. By managing the group keys properly, the communication in the group can be secure.

Even if the visitors are protected by a firewall, their intranet information can be collected. Then, currently people should also focus on the intranet information where he or she belongs to. In this paper, we propose a network scanning tool that allows a Web browser to collect information about active hosts or the existence of a proxy over a channel to the Web server.	countermeasure (computer);firewall (computing);html5;information extraction;intranet;proxy server;server (computing);web server;world wide web	Rio Hosoi;Takamichi Saito;Takayuki Ishikawa;Daichi Miyata;Yongyan Chen	2016	2016 19th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems (NBiS)	10.1109/NBiS.2016.10	web service;web development;framing;web-based simulation;clickstream;comet;computer science;web api;web navigation;web page;internet security;database;same-origin policy;internet privacy;client-side scripting;world wide web;computer security;web server;computer network	Web+IR	-54.079652151625815	61.51953922763706	42119

We propose the use of constraints, i.e. statements limiting the use and distribution of LI, that are securely bound to the LI, as a means to reduce this threat. Constraints may themselves reveal information to any potential LI user—that is, the constraints themselves may also be a privacy threat. To address this problem we introduce the notion of a LI Preference Authority (LIPA). A LIPA is a trusted party which can examine LI constraints and make decisions about LI distribution without revealing the constraints to the entity requesting the LI. This is achieved by encrypting both the LI and the constraints with a LIPA encryption key, ensuring that the LI is only revealed at the discretion of the LIPA. key words: multimedia location-based service, mobile security, privacy	encryption;key (cryptography);location-based service;mobile security;privacy;threat (computer)	Anand S.

In this paper, we examine, for the first time, non-fiducial feature extraction for photo-plethysmography (PPG) based authentication. PPG signals have unique identity properties for human authentication, and are becoming easier to capture by emerging IoT sensors such as MaxFast. Different machine learning techniques are used to compare non-fiducial and fiducial feature extractions. Our experimental results show that 99.84% accuracy with EER of 1.31% can be achieved based on non-fiducial feature extraction.	authentication;biometrics;confidentiality;enhanced entity–relationship model;feature extraction;feature selection;fiducial marker;machine learning;medical privacy;sensor	Nima Karimian;Mark Mohammad Tehranipoor;Domenic J.

The dynamic en-route scheme can detect and drop such false reports during the forwarding phase. In this scheme, choosing a threshold value is important as this gives a trade off between security of power and energy consumption. Thus, a threshold value should be chosen such that it provides sufficient resilience, yet is small enough to conserve energy. This paper presents a fuzzybased threshold determination method for the dynamic enroute scheme to filter false reports in wireless sensor networks. The base station periodically determines the threshold value using a fuzzy rule-based system. The resilience and energy efficiency of the proposed method, against false data injection attacks, are demonstrated using simulation studies.	adversary (cryptography);direct-broadcast satellite;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;kdl;rule-based system;simulation	Sang Jin Lee;Hae Young Lee;Tae Ho Cho	2010	JNW	10.4304/jnw.5.3.292-299	fuzzy logic;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;threshold limit value;computer science;data mining;computer security;fuzzy control system	Mobile	-53.90373114660845	76.94971906362044	42196
4cd8ac4d9e417e1dc829c9af1bf70f8e749886bf	a generic role based access control model for wind power systems		The electrical power infrastructure is facing a transition from a largely centralised distribution infrastructure with a few large power plants to an increasingly distributed infrastructure that must incorporate privately owned and operated power generation units based on fuel cells or sustainable energy sources, such as wind turbines, solar energy or wave energy. This introduces important new security challenges that are not adequately addressed by existing approaches to security in the electrical power distribution infrastructure. In this paper we examine some of the security challenges that may arise in the emerging energy distribution infrastructure. In particular, we examine the security problems that arise in the area of wind power communication infrastructures based on the IEC 61400-25 and IEC 62351 standards. These standards define ways of representing elements of the wind power infrastructure in a software domain in a manufacturer independent manner as well as establishing secure communication and authenticating the other parties in electrical power infrastructures, but they do not address the problem of access control. We therefore propose a generic model for access control in wind power systems, which is based on the widely used role-based access control model. The proposed model is tested using a prototype designed in conformance with the standards that are in use in modern wind power infrastructure and the results are presented to determine the overhead in communication caused while adhering to the proposed access model.	access control list;algorithm;authentication;authorization;centralisation;conformance testing;denial-of-service attack;entity;file system permissions;hoc (programming language);ibm power systems;iec 62351;internet;overhead (computing);power supply;prototype;proxy server;role-based access control;scalability;secure communication;server (computing);software performance testing	Anand Nagarajan;Christian Damsgaard Jensen	2010	JoWUA		simulation	Security	-45.84922049652122	66.65475294648897	42214

But even though a distributed intrusion-detection system can combine data from multiple nodes to estimate the likelihood of an intrusion, the observing nodes-might not be reliable. The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is well suited for this type of problem because it reflects uncertainty. Moreover, Dempster's rule for combination gives a numerical procedure, for fusing together multiple pieces of evidence from unreliable observers. The authors review the Dempster-Shafer theory in the context of distributed intrusion detection and demonstrate the theory's usefulness.	hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;numerical analysis;rule 184	Thomas M.

47082d799f3dd9aa22c3d2f5c5ccb1a73738f2f6	cyber security methods for aerial vehicle networks: taxonomy, challenges and solution		Aerial vehicle networks (AVNs) compose a large number of heterogeneous aerial nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, aircrafts and helicopters. The main characteristics of these networks are the high mobility of aerial nodes and the dynamic network topology. AVNs represent attractive targets for attackers due to the fact that aerial nodes could be connected to an untrusted network and hence lead the attackers to launch lethal threats, e.g., aircraft crash. Therefore, the security of AVNs is mandatory. In this article, we examine the challenges of cyber detection methods to secure AVNs and review exiting security schemes proposed in the current literature. Furthermore, we propose a security framework to protect an aircraft (SFA) against malicious behaviors that target aircrafts communication systems. Numerical results show that SFA achieves a high accuracy detection and prediction rates as compared to the current intrusion detection for aircrafts communication system.	aerial photography;computer security;intrusion detection system;malware;network topology;robustness (computer science);simple file verification;simulation;taxonomy (general);television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Hichem Sedjelmaci;Sidi-Mohammed Senouci	2018	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-018-2287-8	communications system;computer science;distributed computing;dynamic network analysis;intrusion detection system;crash	Security	-55.0125560042342	71.89979872119652	42253

Preventing network attacks has become increasingly difficult and time consuming to all who deals in today's network technologies. These days' people are dependents on internet and its integration in our live and major information supplies. These dependencies increase the growth in the volume of network traffic which becomes difficulty in monitoring and analysis; therefore, attacks are more sophisticated and more complex to detect. By analyzing the multi-core processors for the network intrusion preventions involve a thorough approach on the analysis of customizing the frame work of multi-core processor architecture. Analyzing at the Active Network Interface (ANI), the lowest layer of the architecture, can provide the insight were network attacks can occur. This analysis can deliver an event-based system logs that allows opportunities to study the information of cache locality that are collected. By relating events with the packets that eventually stimulated them, this can determine when all analysis for a given packet has completed, and thus that it is safe to forward the pending packet providing none of the analysis elements previously signaled that the packet should instead be discarded. Results of the simulation analysis will verified the evaluation of the risk assessment at high-speed network and improve the performance and efficiency as well as its security.

09b5e9bb439ef5a366377c2101d517bb58480986	efficient dynamic threshold identity-based encryption with constant-size ciphertext	threshold identity based encryption;constant size;dynamic	This paper revisits the notion of dynamic threshold identity-based encryption, due to the recent practical interest. In this notion, an encryptor selects n recipients and a threshold value t for the creation of the ciphertext. The plaintext can only be recovered if at least t receivers cooperate. The key issue in this notion is its dynamicity, where after the users enroll to the system, the sender can dynamically select the set of recipients as well as dynamically set the threshold t upon the creation of the ciphertext. Another essential feature of this notion is the need for a constant-size ciphertext. Interestingly, the work by Delerablee and Pointcheval in Crypto 2008 is the only work that achieves this essential feature. In this work, we propose a new scheme achieving all of these nice properties with significant improvements in terms of the computational efficiency (both the encryption and decryption). In our scheme, there is no need to conduct any encryption and decryption using additional dummy users, which are not part of the recipient group, which is in contrast to Delerablee and Pointchevalu0027s work. This improvement has significantly reduced the amount of computations required in both encryption and decryption algorithms.	ciphertext;cryptography;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;id-based encryption;on the fly;open research	Willy Susilo;Fuchun Guo;Yi Mu	2016	Theor.

b85135e5b35f6446c51f3a4287abd3962b61c31d	lattice-based revocable certificateless signature		Certificateless signatures (CLS) are noticeable because they may resolve the key escrow problem in ID-based signatures and break away the management problem regarding certificate in conventional signatures. However, the security of the mostly previous CLS schemes relies on the difficulty of solving discrete logarithm or large integer factorization problems. These two problems would be solved by quantum computers in the future so that the signature schemes based on them will also become insecure. For post-quantum cryptography, lattice-based cryptography is significant due to its efficiency and security. However, no study on addressing the revocation problem in the existing lattice-based CLS schemes is presented. In this paper, we focus on the revocation issue and present the first revocable CLS (RCLS) scheme over lattices. Based on the short integer solution (SIS) assumption over lattices, the proposed lattice-based RCLS scheme is shown to be existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen message attacks. By performance analysis and comparisons, the proposed lattice-based RCLS scheme is better than the previously proposed lattice-based CLS scheme, in terms of private key size, signature length and the revocation mechanism.	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;common language infrastructure;computer;digital signature;discrete logarithm;integer (computer science);integer factorization;key escrow;key size;lattice-based cryptography;post-quantum cryptography;profiling (computer programming);provable security;public-key cryptography;quantum computing;quantum cryptography;random oracle;regular expression	Ying-Hao Hung;Yuh-Min Tseng;Sen-Shan Huang	2017	Symmetry	10.3390/sym9100242	cryptography;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;certificate;public-key cryptography;lattice-based cryptography;mathematics;quantum computer;post-quantum cryptography;integer factorization;discrete logarithm	Crypto	-38.691061983114004	78.34673037350238	42442

However, when all of the nodes cannot be equally trusted, and when some users are more honest than others, controlling where code may be executed and by whom resources may be consumed is a nontrivial problem. In this paper we describe a generic authorisation certificate architecture that allows dynamic control of resource consumption and code execution in an untrusted distributed network. That is, the architecture allows the users to specify which network nodes are trusted to execute code on their behalf and the servers to verify the users’ authority to consume resources, while still allowing the execution to span dynamically from node to node, creating delegations on the fly as needed. The architecture scales well, fully supports mobile code and execution migration, and allows users to remain anonymous. We are implementing a prototype of the architecture using SPKI certificates and ECDSA signatures in Java 1.2. In the prototype, agents are represented as Java JAR packages.	access control;algorithm;antivirus software;authorization;code mobility;control system;distributed computing;internet;java development kit (jdk);java version history;on the fly;prototype;public-key cryptography;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);simple public-key infrastructure	Pekka Nikander;Yki Kortesniemi;Jonna Partanen	1999		10.1007/3-540-49162-7_11	embedded system;computer science;cryptography;operating system;database;distributed computing;certification;computer security;statistics;systems architecture	OS	-35.350151389149616	60.956460995457036	42560

This is achieved by letting observers (which need not be trusted) verify the absence of covert channels by means of techniques we introduce herein.

0bcc8d2e7a10918b36884c0ffbd5225263e1045f	cascade encryption revisited	indistinguishability;random system;cascade encryption;ideal cipher model	The security of cascade blockcipher encryption is an important and well-studied problem in theoretical cryptography with practical implications. It is well-known that double encryption improves the security only marginally, leaving triple encryption as the shortest reasonable cascade. In a recent paper, Bellare and Rogaway showed that in the ideal cipher model, triple encryption is significantly more secure than single and double encryption, stating the security of longer cascades as an open question. In this paper, we propose a new lemma on the indistinguishability of systems extending Maurer’s theory of random systems. In addition to being of independent interest, it allows us to compactly rephrase Bellare and Rogaway’s proof strategy in this framework, thus making the argument more abstract and hence easy to follow. As a result, this allows us to address the security of longer cascades. Our result implies that for blockciphers with smaller key space than message space (e.g. DES), longer cascades improve the security of the encryption up to a certain limit. This partially answers the open question mentioned above.	adversary (cryptography);archive;block cipher;circular shift;coefficient;cryptography;direct-broadcast satellite;experiment;interaction;key space (cryptography);mihir bellare;multiple encryption;route distinguisher;skolem normal form;triple des;ueli maurer (cryptographer)	Peter Gazi;Ueli Maurer	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10366-7_3	multiple encryption;discrete mathematics;disk encryption theory;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;theoretical computer science;key wrap;optimal asymmetric encryption padding;mathematics;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;statistics;attribute-based encryption	Crypto	-37.48144358193262	77.40337373058006	42586

However, Internet of Things security is an essential factor. OAuth is one of the most successful authentication and authorization protocols on the Internet. This article proposes push OAuth and personal OAuth authorization server by expanding OAuth for a secure access to the information on Internet of Things devices. In personal OAuth, the smartphones that communicate with remote servers to deliver information on Internet of Things devices can be the OAuth authorization server. Hospitals (OAuth client) that intend to access the information on Internet of Things devices cannot know millions of OAuth authorization server when the smartphone becomes the OAuth authorization server. This article proposes the push OAuth that changes the OAuth protocol and issues the OAuth token when the OAuth authorization server registers to the OAuth client first. Personal OAuth authorization server is far more trustworthy than using a third-party OAuth authorization server to authenticate because users directly control access to the information generated by Internet of Things devices. The personal OAuth authorization server and push OAuth suggested here are expected to create a more secure Internet of Things environment as users can directly authenticate the OAuth client that can access the information on their Internet of Things devices.	authorization;internet of things;oauth;server (computing)	Seung Wook Jung;Souhwan Jung	2017	IJDSN	10.1177/1550147717712627	the internet;computer network;trustworthiness;internet privacy;computer science;authorization;security token;server;internet of things;authentication	Security	-48.40017576670521	64.97112220173172	42620
ed6b459de3adf56cbdeece52d9d342e6f517ef42	a 256 bit implementation of ecc-rfid based system using shamir secret sharing scheme and keccak hash function		The applications of using multi-tag RFID technology have rapidly grown to be used in different fields of life. However, security and privacy are the main issues with this technology. In RFID multi-tags applications, a number of tags need to be securely authenticated. Although, various authentication protocols have been proposed, most of these protocols still lack of providing enough security and privacy levels. In order to overcome the security and privacy issues, this paper discusses the implementation of high-performance 256 bit elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) based system with ElGamal threshold cryptosystem. The security and privacy levels are ensured by providing a 256 bit ECC with Shamir Secret sharing scheme to distribute secure information amongst multiple RFID tags.

572973afe6db5948773205db2d3963783764db56	card-based protocols using triangle cards		Suppose that three boys and three girls attend a party. Each boy and girl have a crush on exactly one of the three girls and three boys, respectively. The following dilemma arises: On one hand, each person thinks that if there is a mutual affection between a girl and boy, the couple should go on a date the next day. On the other hand, everyone wants to avoid the possible embarrassing situation in which their heart is broken “publicly.” In this paper, we solve the dilemma using novel cards called triangle cards. The number of cards required is only six, which is minimal in the case where each player commits their input at the beginning of the protocol. We also construct multiplication and addition protocols based on triangle cards. Combining these protocols, we can securely compute any function f : {0, 1, 2} → {0, 1, 2}. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation → Cryptographic protocols	smart card;theory of computation	Kazumasa Shinagawa;Takaaki Mizuki	2018		10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2018.31	dilemma;discrete mathematics;algorithm;computer science;girl;multiplication;affection	Theory	-38.281444567506036	73.10552575157114	42827

It is elegant in theory and fast and reliable in practice. Applications are in the field of communication networks.The method is initialized by choosing some suitable large prime numbers. Encrypting and decrypting of a message are done by modular arithmetic. The modulus is a large integer (e.g. 200 decimal digits). Any attempt to break the system amounts to factoring the modulus.The basic operations that are needed for an implementation are fundamental for any computer algebra package, e.g. SAC-2 offers them in an suitable way. This project therefore requires only little programming, but some insight into theory and the ability to find and put together existing components. An optional part of the project deals with the security of the method.	computer algebra system;encryption;integer factorization;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;public-key cryptography;telecommunications network	Wolfgang Küchlin	1987	ACM SIGSAM Bulletin	10.1145/29309.29320	multiple encryption;h.235;client-side encryption;key wrap;link encryption;key distribution;encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption;keyfile;email encryption	Crypto	-36.997688423019945	79.0621964726276	42851

VANETs face many interesting research challenges in multiple areas, from privacy and anonymity to the detection and eviction of misbehaving nodes and many others in between. Multiple solutions have been proposed to address those issues. This paper surveys the most relevant while discussing its benefits and drawbacks. The paper explores the newest trends in privacy, anonymity, misbehaving nodes, the dissemination of false information and secure data aggregation, giving a perspective on how we foresee the future of this research area. First, the paper discusses the use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (and certificates revocation), location privacy, anonymity and group signatures for VANETs. Then, it compares several proposals to identify and evict misbehaving and faulty nodes. Finally, the paper explores the differences between syntactic and semantic aggregation techniques, cluster and non-cluster based with fixed and dynamic based areas, while presenting secure as well as probabilistic aggregation schemes. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Credit/debit cards and online payments are in widespread use. Bringing electronic payments to the mobile world offers huge utility for mobile users. Lack of standardized protocols, interoperability and security are major roadblocks in developing a mobile payment infrastructure. A scheme called SEMOPS (Secure Mobile Payment Service) has already been proposed by A. Vilmos and S. Karnouskos. This proposed SEMOPS architecture addresses these problems. However, it will work inefficiently for micropayments due to a lot of computation and communication for every payment. Good micropayment support is extremely important for mobile payment systems to succeed. This work focusses on enabling efficient micropayment support in SEMOPS scheme. An analysis of the security and efficiency of the proposed method is given in this paper. Our new proposed method has been found to be very efficient for micropayments in SEMOPS.	aggregate data;computation;debit card;interoperability;micropayment;mobile phone;secure mobile payment service	Rahul M.

However, the fine-grained user energy consumption information may reveal the private information of the user. In this paper, we construct a linkable anonymous credential protocol based on Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature. Then, we propose a privacy preserving smart metering scheme based on the new linkable anonymous credential. In addition to providing privacy protection for the user, our protocol also has the security properties of message authentication and traceability of fault smart metering. And there are some other useful features in our protocol, such as no need of trust-third party, dynamic users' enrollment and revocation, and complex statistical analysis of the energy use information. The computation cost and communication overhead of our scheme is O(1), which is independent of the user number. The simulation results show that our scheme is efficient.	algorithm;binary prefix;computation;coupled cluster;digital credential;discrete logarithm;like button;message authentication;overhead (computing);personally identifiable information;privacy;public-key cryptography;randomness;real-time clock;simulation;smart meter;traceability;trusted third party;z2 (computer);zero-knowledge proof	Feng Diao;Fangguo Zhang;Xiangguo Cheng	2015	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2014.2358225	internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.661223150799465	73.3952998694976	43012

Based on the recent DigiNotar attack and other attacks on CAs, we formulate here a very strong attack denoted “Certificate in The Middle” (CiTM) and propose a mitigation for this attack. The solution is embedded in a handshake protocol and makes it more robust: It adds to the usual aspect of “CA vouching” a client side vouching for the server “continuity of service,” thus, allowing clients and server to detect past and future breaches of the trust infrastructure. We had simplicity, flexibility, and scalability in mind, solving the problem within the context of the protocol (with the underlying goal of embedding the solution in the TLS layer) with minor field changes, minimal cryptographic additions, no interaction with other protocol layers, and no added trusted parties.	antivirus software;certificate authority;client-side;cryptography;digital signature;embedded system;scalability;scott continuity;server (computing);transport layer security	Omer Berkman;Benny Pinkas;Moti Yung	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-35404-5_12	protocol stack;computer security;computer science;scalability;transport layer security;digital signature;cryptography;the internet;man-in-the-middle attack;server	Security	-45.884720690763274	67.87028499235795	43022

Without it, not only paying subscribers can access content of IPTV but also illegal subscribers. Consequently, the revenues for IPTV industries will drop significantly. In this paper our discussion focused on a technique that used for service protection which is Internet protocol Conditional Access System (IP CAS). A discussion of how this technique is implemented. Moreover, we proposed new authentication protocol to improve security and reduce drawback of existing IP CAS. The main motivation to write this paper is to suggest a solution a weakness in IP CAS that its security relies in one key that is not changing for long period of time.	authentication protocol;conditional access;iptv;large-screen television technology	K.

b2afb87304a9219f05660ea9bcfbe56832bb7a3b	how effective is the artificial noise? real-time analysis of a phy security scenario		Expanding usage of mobile technologies and devices causes new challenges, especially in terms of security. In the near future, the number of battery powered devices will also significantly increase. Current security approaches are not sufficient for these issues and high-complexity cryptographic techniques are not suitable for such devices. To address these problems, physical layer (PHY) security solutions have recently emerged. Some 5G candidate techniques such as full-duplex communication (FD) and artificial noise transmission (AN) are exploited in various PHY security solutions due to their performance advantages. In this study, a scenario resembling a factory environment is considered and security level is analyzed in real-time by utilizing FD and AN methods. The aim of this analysis is to investigate physically secure transmission regions and to expand these regions by intelligently using AN. Our proposed approach is evaluated in real- time with a testbed that consists of software defined radios (SDRs). Two devices with very different front-end characteristics are utilized as eavesdroppers to analyze hardware effects on the eavesdropping performance. As observed with experiments, robust secure regions can be created by the use of AN on eavesdroppers effectively.	beamforming;cryptography;duplex (telecommunications);eve;experiment;mathematical optimization;phy (chip);power optimization (eda);real-time clock;real-time transcription;secure transmission;testbed;transmitter	Selahattin Gökceli;Özge Cepheli;Semiha Tedik Basaran;Günes Karabulut-Kurt;Guido Dartmann;Gerd Ascheid	2017	2017 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2017.8269228	secure transmission;computer network;physical layer;cryptography;computer science;software-defined radio;phy;testbed;eavesdropping;artificial noise	Security	-51.25883507803162	72.1495917908357	43032

Solving a puzzle for a message m means for Bob to encrypt m with Alice's public puzzle key by repeated modular squaring. The number of squarings to perform determines the puzzle complexity. This puzzle is non-parallelizable. Thus, the solution time cannot be shortened significantly by employing many machines and it varies only slightly across modern CPUs. Alice can quickly verify the puzzle solution by decrypting the ciphertext with a regular private key operation. Our main contribution is an offline submission protocol which enables an author being currently offline to commit to his document before the deadline by continuously solving an RSA puzzle based on that document. When regaining Internet connectivity, he submits his document along with the puzzle solution which is a proof for the timely completion of the document. We have implemented a platform-independent tool performing all parts of our offline submission protocol: puzzle benchmark, issuing a time-lock RSA certificate, solving a puzzle and finally verifying the solution for a submitted document. Two other applications we propose for RSA time-lock puzzles are trial certificates from a well-known CA and a CEO disclosing the signing private key to his deputy.	alice and bob;authentication;benchmark (computing);central processing unit;ciphertext;commit (data management);cryptanalysis;encryption;fermat's principle;interactivity;internet;numerical integration;online and offline;public-key cryptography	Yves Igor Jerschow;Martin Mauve	2010	2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2010.193	computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-39.96079235414184	74.3689358251518	43067

Thus, an NFC payment transaction is executed in a simple and practical way. EMV is the security protocol for both contact and contactless payment systems. However, during an EMV payment transaction, this standard does not ensure two main security constraints between a customer payment device and a payment terminal: (1) mutual authentication, (2) confidentiality of sensitive banking data exchanged. These weaknesses represent a major risk in the case of NFC payment because the transaction is performed using NFC radio waves in an open environment. The risk is reduced in the case of contact payment because the transaction is executed in a closed environment by inserting the card into the terminal. In this paper, we propose a new security protocol for NFC payment transactions based on a Cloud infrastructure. We verify the correctness of this proposal using Scyther tool that provides formal proofs for security protocols.	authentication protocol;cloud computing;confidentiality;contactless payment;contactless smart card;correctness (computer science);cryptographic protocol;debit card;internet;mutual authentication;near field communication;non-repudiation;payment terminal;prototype;radio wave;smartphone;vulnerability (computing)	Nour El Madhoun;Fouad Amine Guenane;Guy Pujolle	2015	2015 IEEE 4th International Conference on Cloud Networking (CloudNet)	10.1109/CloudNet.2015.7335332	business;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.99070655000654	66.21532720651325	43150

But algorithms providing strong guarantees often end up with low utility. We propose a novel privacy preserving framework that thwarts an adversary from inferring an unknown data point by ensuring that the estimation error is almost invariant to the inclusion/exclusion of the data point. By focusing directly on the estimation error of the data point, our framework is able to significantly lower the perturbation required. We use this framework to propose a new privacy aware K-means clustering algorithm. Using both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that the utility of this algorithm is almost equal to that of the unperturbed K-means, and at strict privacy levels, almost twice as good as compared to the differential privacy counterpart.	k-means clustering	Thanh Dai Nguyen;Sunil Kumar Gupta;Santu Rana;Svetha Venkatesh	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-31750-2_31	computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	ML	-39.16210425337139	63.081081901483785	43198

The authenticity of public keys is corroborated by traversing of a chain of trust that follows the DNS hierarchy. This verification process over a chain of digital signatures is computationally expensive. The objectives of this thesis are to provide a detailed appraisal of DNSSEC and to analyse the requirements of a potentially more efficient model for the establishment of trust in the authenticity of public keys using identitybased cryptography. This paper discusses DNSSEC key management issues from a general perspective before presenting and evaluating various identity-based digital signature schemes. The problems commonly associated with identity-based cryptography are examined and their impact on the given application is assessed. The deliverable of this thesis is a schematic specification that a potential alternative trust model based on a hierarchical identity-based signature scheme should follow. The thesis concludes with an appraisal of the practical issues concerning the DNSSEC protocol and its hierarchical key management scheme. The identity-based approach for an alternative trust model is discussed and found unsuitable in practice for the DNSSEC application. This conclusion follows the observation that any scheme, which does not follow a chain of trust, is vulnerable to a rollback attack if DNSSEC is deployed only partially.	analysis of algorithms;antivirus software;chain of trust;digital signature;domain name system security extensions;id-based cryptography;key management;public-key cryptography;requirement;rollback (data management);schematic;secure communication;type signature	Hyung-Jin Lim;Hak-Ju Kim;Tae-Kyung Kim;Tai-Myung Chung	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24707-4_30	random oracle;secure communication;forward secrecy;computer science;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Security	-42.76388689009125	74.84701755595619	43258

Computer security is to keep security attributes (confidentiality, integrity and availability) of computer systems, which face the threats such as deny-of-service (DoS), virus and intrusion. To ensure high computer security, the intrusion tolerance technique based on fault-tolerant scheme has been widely applied. This paper presents the quantitative performance evaluation of a virtual machine (VM) based intrusion tolerant system. Concretely, two security measures are derived; MTTSF (mean time to security failure) and the effective traffic intensity. The mathematical analysis is achieved by using Laplace-Stieltjes transforms according to the analysis of M/G/1 queueing system.	algorithm;business process;circuit restoration;computer security;computer virus;confidentiality;experiment;fault tolerance;information sensitivity;integrated circuit layout design protection;intrusion tolerance;least squares;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;queueing theory;virtual machine	Junjun Zheng;Hiroyuki Okamura;Tadashi Dohi	2016	2016 Fourth International Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR)	10.1109/CANDAR.2016.0041	computer security model;embedded system;host-based intrusion detection system;real-time computing;covert channel;engineering;internet security;security service;computer security;intrusion prevention system	Security	-49.18707094823566	61.20994326319225	43288

With this framework, users can distinguish trustworthy pages from untrustworthy pages easily. This helps users avoid online fraud such as phishing. The ideas of Trusted-Link are as follows.

These protocols are typically analyzed with respect to three types of attacks, which are historically known as Distance Fraud, Mafia Fraud, and Terrorist Fraud. We define and analyze a fourth main type of attack on distance bounding protocols, called Distance Hijacking. This type of attack poses a serious threat in many practical scenarios. We show that many proposed distance bounding protocols are vulnerable to Distance Hijacking, and we propose solutions to make these protocols resilient to this type of attack. We show that verifying distance bounding protocols using existing informal and formal frameworks does not guarantee the absence of Distance Hijacking attacks. We extend a formal framework for reasoning about distance bounding protocols to include overshadowing attacks. We use the resulting framework to prove the absence of all of the found attacks for protocols to which our countermeasures have been applied.	bit array;commit (data management);communications protocol;computation;countermeasure (computer);cryptographic protocol;distance-vector routing protocol;identification scheme;key (cryptography);modulo operation;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;verification and validation	Cas J.

This paper introduces a means to adapt the concepts of Public Key Infrastructure for a VANET environment under the worst case scenario of a pseudonym shift every second. Regions are used to scale down the size of certificate revocation lists (CRLs), administrative overhead, and the search space to link a message to its originator. Regions also provide a means for expansion of the geographical area covered and provides the ability to balance geographic mobility with privacy. The framework outlined below can then be modified to the decided pseudonym shift frequency and/or extended for other purposes.	certificate authority;geographic coordinate system;hoc (programming language);key space (cryptography);overhead (computing);privacy;pseudonymity;public key infrastructure;requirement;worst-case scenario	Joseph Benin;Michael Nowatkowski;Henry L.

The added-value service provides different kind of services for users. In this paper, we propose a stored-value card to provide an added-value service of payment protocol in VANET. When the user wants to use the added-value service, the service provider verifies the request and sends it to the payment gateway. And then, the payment gateway will forward the transaction message to the Issuer and Acquirer to process it. In our scheme, we use symmetric cryptography and digital signature to solve the security problem of payment scheme in VANET. Our scheme achieves protection against double-spending, unforgeability, non-repudiation, anonymity and the recovery issue.

Anonymity provides protection for users to enjoy network services without being traced. While anonymity-related issues have been extensively studied in payment-based systems such as e-cash and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, little effort has been devoted to wireless mesh networks (WMNs). On the other hand, the network authority requires conditional anonymity such that misbehaving entities in the network remain traceable. In this paper, we propose a security architecture to ensure unconditional anonymity for honest users and traceability of misbehaving users for network authorities in WMNs. The proposed architecture strives to resolve the conflicts between the anonymity and traceability objectives, in addition to guaranteeing fundamental security requirements including authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation. Thorough analysis on security and efficiency is incorporated, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed architecture.	authentication;computer security;confidentiality;data integrity;entity;mesh networking;non-repudiation;peer-to-peer;privacy;requirement;traceability;wireless mesh network	Jinyuan Sun;Chi Zhang;Yanchao Zhang;Yuguang Fang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing	10.1109/TDSC.2009.50	wireless mesh network;traceability;confidentiality;anonymity;logic gate;computer science;data integrity;authentication;data security;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;enterprise information security architecture;computer network	Security	-48.77208258571093	74.9037417822219	43633

Traditio nal security methods are incapable to provide secure IV communication. The major issues in IV communication are trust, data accuracy and reliability of communicatio n data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV Communication. In this paper, we introduce an Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point (IV-TP) mechanism for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. The IVs communicated data provides security and reliability using our proposed IV-TP. This IV-TP mechanism introduced in the paper provides trustworthiness for vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegalaction. The introduced reward-based system is an exchange of some IV-TP among IVs, during successful communication.	bitcoin;channel (communications);cryptocurrency;peer-to-peer;trust (emotion);vulnerability (computing)	Madhusudan Singh;Shiho Kim	2017	2017 International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)	10.1109/ISOCC.2017.8368806	real-time computing;trustworthiness;network topology;cloud computing;computer science;cryptography;cryptocurrency;blockchain;distributed computing;communication channel	Robotics	-54.93497603978097	72.8493540385248	43703

One problem of the present VoIP networks is filtering spam calls referred to as SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Unlike spam in e-mail systems, VoIP spam calls have to be identified in real time. Many of the techniques devised for e-mail spam detection rely upon content analysis, and in the case of VoIP, it is too late to analyze the content (voice) as the user would have already attended the call. Therefore, the real challenge is to block a spam call before the telephone rings. In addition, we believe it is imperative that spam filters integrate human behavioral aspects to gauge the legitimacy of voice calls. We know that, when it comes to receiving or rejecting a voice call, people use the social meaning of trust, reputation, friendship of the calling party and their own mood. In this article, we describe a multi-stage, adaptive spam filter based on presence (location, mood, time), trust, and reputation to detect spam in voice calls. In particular, we describe a closed-loop feedback control between different stages to decide whether an incoming call is spam. We further propose formalism for voice-specific trust and reputation analysis. We base this formal model on a human intuitive behavior for detecting spam based on the called party's direct and indirect relationships with the calling party. No VoIP corpus is available for testing the detection mechanism. Therefore, for verifying the detection accuracy, we used a laboratory setup of several soft-phones, real IP phones and a commercial-grade proxy server that receives and processes incoming calls. We experimentally validated the proposed filtering mechanisms by simulating spam calls and measured the filter's accuracy by applying the trust and reputation formalism. We observed that, while the filter blocks a second spam call from a spammer calling from the same end IP host and domain, the filter needs only a maximum of three calls---even in the case when spammer moves to a new host and domain. Finally, we present a detailed sensitivity analysis for examining the influence of parameters such as spam volume and network size on the filter's accuracy.	circuit switching;email filtering;experiment;feedback;formal language;imperative programming;network packet;proxy server;real-time computing;semantics (computer science);sensor;server (computing);simulation;spamming;verification and validation	Prakash Kolan;Ram Dantu	2007	TAAS	10.1145/1216895.1216897	content analysis;computer science;spambot;spam and open relay blocking system;voice over ip;internet privacy;human behavior;world wide web;computer network	Security	-60.62503783407097	71.34938796128478	43718

Similar to its wired counterpart, SDWN is expected to introduce a wide range of benefits to the operation and management of wireless networks. Security is always important to any network. On one hand, SDWN enables new security mechanisms. On the other hand, some new threats are introduced due to the separation of the control and data planes and the introduction of the logically centralized controller. In this article, we discuss its security threat vectors as well as design issues in making it secure. Also, we analyze the security requirements of SDWN, and then summarize the security attacks and countermeasures in this area and suggest some future research directions.	centralized computing;programming paradigm;requirement;threat (computer)	Daojing He;Sammy Chan;Mohsen Guizani	2016	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2016.7378421	computer science;network security;wireless network;authentication;distributed computing;software-defined networking;computer security;wireless;computer network	Security	-50.69743057565389	80.68887405339325	43742
23e38cef2d4d52e55652948d9f38e67af84745fe	violating consumer anonymity: geo-locating nodes in named data networking		Named Data Networking (NDN) is an information-centric network architecture designed as a candidate replacement for the current IP-based Internet. It emphasizes efficient content distribution, achieved via in-network caching and collapsing of closely-spaced content requests. NDN also offers strong security and explicitly decouples content from entities that distribute it. NDN is widely assumed to provide better privacy than IP due to the former’s lack of source and destination addresses. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold in practice. In particular, we present several algorithms that help locate consumers within the network by leveraging NDN router-side content caching. We use simulations to evaluate these algorithms on large and realistic topologies, and we validate our results on the official NDN testbed. Our techniques can be used not only to identify consumers, but also to detect eavesdroppers.	algorithm;cache (computing);digital distribution;entity;internet;network architecture;privacy;router (computing);simulation;testbed	Alberto Compagno;Mauro Conti;Paolo Gasti;Luigi V.

The scheme is more efficient than other group key managements since fewer re-keying messages are sent when group membership changes. Besides, it provides both forward and backward secrecy. Therefore, this proposal is helpful to deploy secure multicast over some networks with high latency or limited bandwidth such as wireless network. Furthermore, it fits both small-scale and large-scale groups.	centralized computing;fits;group key;jacobian matrix and determinant;key (cryptography);key management;key server (cryptographic);relevance;secure multicast	Ke Qin;Mingtian Zhou;Naiqi Liu;Yujie Hao;Jiandong Guo	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74784-0_30	computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Security	-49.63101723656484	77.1907841336549	43918

c5aff8faa0ad6241023eb7bc3f88665e72c57100	an efficient and secure session key management scheme for cluster based wireless sensors networks		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often deployed in hostile environments, which make such networks highly vulnerable and increase the risk of attacks against this type of network. WSN comprises of large number of sensor nodes with different hardware abilities and functions. Due to the limited memory resources and energy constraints, complex security algorithms cannot be used in sensor networks. Therefore, it is necessary to well balance between the security level and the associated energy consumption overhead to mitigate the security risks. In this paper, we present an Efficient and Secure Session Key Management Scheme for Cluster-Based Wireless Sensors Networks (ESSKM). The proposed technique based on symmetric key mechanism, provides an improved session key establishment by updating periodically the session key within a cluster, hence avoids different type of attacks from malicious nodes and mitigates the node compromise attack. Finally, through the network simulator tool (NS-2), the security analysis and performance simulation demonstrate that ESSKM not only achieves efficient security, but also provides energy saving with low storage overhead.	authentication;encryption;key exchange;key management;malware;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;performance prediction;sensor;session key;simulation;symmetric-key algorithm;tree network	Abdoulaye Diop;Yue Qi;Qin Wang	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-09265-2_5	telecommunications;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.49593874744785	76.46861012305673	44103

Many methods have been proposed to protect such information in hostile environments. However, these methods can only protect neighbor relations between benign nodes. A compromised node can easily circumvent them and setup false neighbor relations with sensor nodes in many places, impacting the network at a large scale. This paper presents a theoretic model for neighbor discovery in sensor networks and describes a fundamental security limitation and a generic attack against this model. The paper then proposes an efficient and localized solution based on a security property achievable during sensor deployment. This technique provides a threshold security guarantee in dealing with compromised sensor nodes. The analytical and simulation studies show that the technique is practical and effective for sensor networks.	routing;secure neighbor discovery;sensor;simulation;software deployment;theory	Donggang Liu	2009	2009 29th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2009.10	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;information security;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.09332319792283	76.49283905417269	44126

This is inefficient and costly when the client side is a wireless mobile unit, for wireless transmission has relatively lower bandwidth, and a mobile unit is battery powered. In this paper, we present a mobile authentication protocol which only needs seven messages for inter-domain initial authentication regardless of the number of hops transited between the visited and home domains; four messages for subsequent authentication when the mobile user requests a different service provided by the visited domain; and two messages when the same service is requested again. With the enhanced version of BAN logic we propose, it is proved that our protocol can achieve more goals of authentication than those required by the original BAN logic.	authentication protocol;bandwidth (signal processing);burrows–abadi–needham logic;client-side;integrated windows authentication;inter-domain;key distribution center;message authentication code	Shiuh-Pyng Shieh;Fu-Shen Ho;Yu-Lun Huang	1999	J.

Botnets can switch their command and control server automatically, so completely suppressing botnets is a big challenge. In this paper, we present a collaborative botnets suppression system based on overlay network, which has one control center node and several suppression nodes. The suppression nodes can automatically collect network traffic and deploy suppression rules, the control center node can gather all collected data, and process these traffic data by using botnet detection algorithm. Once botnets are detected, the control center node will generate and distribute suppression rules.

Traditional key management schemes use a key graph to manage all the keys in a group, which makes one key being shared by many users resulting in the """"one-affect-many"""" problem. In a key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) system, a ciphertext is labeled with a set of attributes and users' keys are associated with access policies, so that a ciphertext can be decrypted by multiple users when the attributes associated with the ciphertext satisfy an access policy in the users' keys. However, KP-ABE can not achieve a scalable revocation mechanism when applied to multi-privileged group communications. In this paper, we propose a scalable encryption scheme for multi-privileged group communications (EMGC), which uniquely combines a collusion resistant broadcast encryption system and a KP-ABE system with a non-monotone access control. Using our scheme, a user can not only join/leave a group at will, but also change his access privilege on demand, while requiring a small number of re-keying operations. Therefore, our scheme, which can accommodate a dynamic group of users, is more applicable to multi-privileged group communications."""	encryption	Qiushuang Du;Guojun Wang;Qing Liu	2010		10.1109/EUC.2010.96	weak key;40-bit encryption;computer science;cryptography;information security;access control;key management;link encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;computer security;encryption;ciphertext;attribute-based encryption;computer network;keyfile;satisfiability	Crypto	-41.92965982822134	70.58632826155865	44475

It seeks to characterize the current state of practices in SOA network security by gathering information regarding known threats and defenses for SOA deployments. It works towards the practical implementation of SOA designs by creating training and testing scenarios for those preparing to work in this area. Finally, it frames these and other SOA security efforts with respect to a classic theoretical model of information security. The resulting synthesis includes recommendations on how best to process the XML network traffic typical of SOA applications. The proposed approach is Filtering to Inspect XML (FIX) at the network's perimeter. This framework contributes to the understanding of secure SOA designs by clarifying the responsibilities of both network managers and software engineers in orchestrating XML-based services.	information security;network security;network traffic control;perimeter;soa security;service-oriented architecture;software engineer;theory;xml	Robert Bunge;Sam Chung;Barbara Endicott-Popovsky;Don McLane	2008	Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)	10.1109/HICSS.2008.64	software security assurance;web service;software architecture;xml;network architecture;sherwood applied business security architecture;security information and event management;computer science;information security;network security;service-oriented architecture;database;security service;network access control;network security policy;world wide web;computer security;computer network;oasis soa reference model	Security	-57.97031293778739	66.36500982221648	44486

Given a sharing of secret x, it allows the parties to compute the sharings of the bits of x in constant rounds. With the help of bit-decomposition, we will be able to construct constant-rounds protocols for various MPC problems, such as equality test, comparison, public modulo reduction and private exponentiation, which are four main applications of bit-decomposition. However, when considering perfect security, bit-decomposition does not have a linear communication complexity. Thus any protocols involving bit-decomposition inherit this inefficiency, i.e. the communication complexity is non-linear. Constructing protocols for MPC problems without relying on bit-decomposition is a meaningful work because this may provide us with perfect secure protocols with linear communication complexity. It is already proved that equality test, comparison and public modulo reduction can be solved without involving bit-decomposition and the communication complexity can be reduced to linear. However, it remains an open problem whether private exponentiation could be done without relying on bit-decomposition. In this paper, maybe somewhat surprisingly, we show that it can. That is to say, we construct a constant-rounds, linear, perfect secure protocol for private exponentiation without relying on bit-decomposition though it seems essential to this problem. Compared with the previous solution for this problem (with perfect security), our protocol has a lower round complexity and a much lower communication complexity. In a recent work, Ning and Xu proposed a generalization of bit-decomposition which can, given a sharing of secret x and an integer m ≥ 2, compute the sharings (or bitwise sharings) of the base-m digits of x. They also proposed a linear protocol for public modulo reduction as a simplification of their generalization. In this paper, we show that their generalization can be further generalized. More importantly, as a simplification of our further generalization, we propose a public modulo reduction protocol which is more efficient than theirs. Specifically, the round complexity of our (modulo reduction) protocol is the same with theirs, but the communication complexity can be considerably lower.	bitwise operation;communication complexity;computation;information-theoretic security;level of detail;modulo operation;nonlinear system	Chao Ning;Qiuliang Xu	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-25385-0_31	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;linearity;exponentiation;algorithm;algebra	Crypto	-39.126289683907636	76.99358604206824	44488

In particular, key management is a problem that has been addressed by many researchers but with limited results. In this paper, we consider the case where an ad hoc network is under the responsibility of a mother certification authority (mCA). Since the nodes can frequently be collectively isolated from the mCA (e.g., for a remote mission) but still need the access to a certification authority, the mCA preassigns a special role to several nodes (called servers) that constitute a distributed certification authority (dCA) during the isolated period. We propose a solution, called DICTATE (DIstributed CerTification Authority with probabilisTic frEshness), to manage the dCA. This solution ensures that the dCA always processes a certificate update (or query) request in a finite amount of time and that an adversary cannot forge a certificate. Moreover, it guarantees that the dCA responds to a query request with the most recent version of the queried certificate in a certain probability; this probability can be made arbitrarily close to 1, but at the expense of higher overhead. Our contribution is twofold: 1) a set of certificate management protocols that allow trading protocol overhead for certificate freshness or the other way around, and 2) a combination of threshold and identity-based cryptosystems to guarantee the security, availability, and scalability of the certification function. We describe DICTATE in detail and, by security analysis and simulations, we show that it is robust against various attacks.	adversary (cryptography);certificate authority;critical internet infrastructure;cryptosystem;forge;hoc (programming language);key management;overhead (computing);replay attack;scalability;simulation	Jun Luo;Jean-Pierre Hubaux;Patrick Th.

It has been intensively studied recently. However all the existing ZKS schemes follow the basic structure by Micali et al. That is, the schemes employ the Merkle tree as a basic structure and mercurial commitments as the commitment units to nodes of the tree. The proof for any query consists of an authentication chain. We propose in this paper a new algebraic scheme that is completely different from all the existing schemes. Our new scheme is computationally secure under the standard strong RSA assumption. Neither mercurial commitments nor tree structure is used in the new construction. In fact, the prover in our construction commits the desired set without any trapdoor information, which is another key important difference from the previous approaches.	accumulator (computing);authentication;commitment scheme;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;information system;internet privacy;linear algebra;mercurial;mercury;merkle tree;operating system;role-based access control;strong rsa assumption;symposium on foundations of computer science;tree structure;trust management (information system)	Rui Xue;Ninghui Li;Jiangtao Li	2008	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-008-9119-x	random oracle;merkle tree;computer science;theoretical computer science;tree structure;computer security;algorithm;zero-knowledge proof	Crypto	-40.816182563866306	76.33935027429297	44527
eb9a9dbd565960cd71d2683d5e5921dd6dc7882f	hierarchical based group key transfer for secure group communication		In this research paper, a scalable and efficient multicast secure protocol for large and dynamic systems that relies on trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) is proposed. In this protocol, we partition the entire group into several subgroups which is controlled by Intermediate Controller (IC). Our protocol is based on Iolus protocol and the hierarchical structure of LKH protocol. The decomposition of subgroup is organized in an hierarchical manner as it is in the LKH protocol which helps us to reduce the complexity for a member to join or leave from O(n) to O(log m), where n represents the number of entire group members and m represents the number of each subgroup members. Out protocol performance is compared with that of Iolus and LKH protocol. The performance is enhanced especially when there is a member leave operation.	computation;cryptography;dynamical system;encryption;group key;key generation;multicast;overhead (computing);scalability;secure communication;symmetric-key algorithm	Kanimozhi Sakthivel;Velumadhava Rajasekaran;Selvamani Kadirvelu;Arputharaj Kannan	2016	Int.

Given information about the database, a description of sensitive data, and assumptions about users' prior knowledge, our goal is to determine if answering a past user's query could have led to a privacy breach. According to our definition, an audited property A is private, given the disclosure of property B, if no user can gain confidence in A by learning B, subject to prior knowledge constraints. Privacy is not violated if the disclosure of B causes a loss of confidence in A. The new notion of privacy is formalized using the well-known semantics for reasoning about knowledge, where logical properties correspond to sets of possible worlds (databases) that satisfy these properties. Database users are modeled as either possibilistic agents whose knowledge is a set of possible worlds, or as probabilistic agents whose knowledge is a probability distribution on possible worlds.  We analyze the new privacy notion, show its relationship with the conventional approach, and derive criteria that allow the auditor to test privacy efficiently in some important cases. In particular, we prove characterization theorems for the possibilistic case, and study in depth the probabilistic case under the assumption that all database records are considered a-priori independent by the user, as well as under more relaxed (or absent) prior-knowledge assumptions. In the probabilistic case we show that for certain families of distributions there is no efficient algorithm to test whether an audited property A is private given the disclosure of a property B, assuming P ≠ NP. Nevertheless, for many interesting families, such as the family of product distributions, we obtain algorithms that are efficient both in theory and in practice.	algorithm;database;linear programming relaxation;online and offline;p versus np problem;possible world;privacy law;proactive parallel suite;regular language description for xml;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alexandre V.

Database servers arouse user’s suspicion because no one can fully trust traditional security mechanisms against more and more frequent and malicious attacks and no one can be fully confident on an invisible DBA administering confidential data. This paper gives an in-depth analysis of existing security solutions and concludes on the intrinsic weakness of the traditional server-based approach to preserve data confidentiality. With this statement in mind, we propose a solution called C-SDA (Chip-Secured Data Access), which enforces data confidentiality and controls personal privileges thanks to a clientbased security component acting as a mediator between a client and an encrypted database. This component is embedded in a smartcard to prevent any tampering to occur. This cooperation of hardware and software security components constitutes a strong guarantee against attacks threatening personal as well as business data.	1-wire;anytime algorithm;application security;client–server model;confidentiality;coprocessor;data access;data model;data store;database;digital signal processor;electronic data interchange;embedded system;encryption;information system;interaction;malware;mathematical optimization;operating environment;query language;requirement;same-day affirmation;scalability;school of everything;server (computing);smart card;symbolic data analysis;tamper resistance;ubiquitous computing;web hosting service;world wide web	Luc Bouganim;Philippe Pucheral	2002			chip;data access;asset;computer science;database;data security;knowledge;business intelligence;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;ubiquitous computing	Security	-47.12852118809277	61.534078207350895	44688
40706574e58dc914bdacf10059d53ac85756f0fd	establishing and preserving protocol security goals	security properties;authentication;strand spaces;cryptographic protocol analysis	We take a model-theoretic viewpoint on security goals and how to establish them. The models are (possibly fragmentary) executions. Security goals such as authentication and confidentiality are geometric sequents, i.e. implications Φ −→ Ψ where Φ and Ψ are built from atomic formulas without negations, implications, or universal quantifiers. Security goals are then statements about homomorphisms, where the source is a minimal (fragmentary) model of the antecedent Φ. If every homomorphism to a non-fragmentary, complete execution factors through a model in which Ψ is satisfied, then the goal is achieved. One can validate security goals via a process of information enrichment. We call this approach enrich-by-need protocol analysis. This idea also clarifies protocol transformation. A protocol transformation preserves security goals when it preserves the form of the information enrichment process. We formalize this idea using simulation relations between labeled transition systems.	authentication;confidentiality;gene ontology term enrichment;simulation;theory;universal quantification	Joshua D.

In particular, a string (or helper data) is generated by XORing a binary reduction of the PUF observation with the encoding of a randomly generated key, or identifier. Since the binary reduction (or hash) relies on keeping the sign of few random projections of the observation, a measure concentration property bounds, with a controlled accuracy, the distance between two different hashes in function of this of the original images. The error correcting code used to encode the identifier stabilizes therefore both the observation noise and the hashing distortion. In a verification stage, reobserving the PUF with the helper data in hand allows one to authenticate the object if the identifier can be exactly recovered. We conclude this work by calibrating and challenging the system on a database of laser-written PUFs, balancing helper data size, that is, hashing dimensions, and system security.	authentication;computer security;cryptographic hash function;distortion;encode;forward error correction;fuzzy extractor;identifier;procedural generation;randomness extractor	Saloomeh Shariati;Laurent Jacques;François-Xavier Standaert;Benoit M.

Recently size and content of Tor hidden services are highly concerned because of emerging illegal content. It is necesary to have discovery and analysis approaches to collect and analyze Tor hidden services. Previous in-band approaches are mostly based on the protocol and design principles of Tor network, which mostly have a great deal of resource consumption. In this paper, we propose an out-of-band approach to discover Tor hidden services, which is simpler and owns less resource consumption: using multiple search engines with specific keywords. In our experiments we collected 173667 unique .onion addresses in all using a single Amazon EC2 instances in 1 hour and found 4857 hidden web services online. We also propose a modified PageRank algrithm: OnionRank Algorithm to evaluate the importance of hidden web services, which concentrates more on Tor users' actions. Results showed that the top-ranking hidden web services are mostly famous in Tor network.	algorithm;amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);dark web;experiment;list of tor hidden services;out-of-band agreement;pagerank;tor messenger;web search engine;web service	Kang Li;Peipeng Liu;Qingfeng Tan;Jinqiao Shi;Yue Gao;Xuebin Wang	2016		10.1145/2851613.2851798	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;search engine	Security	-56.627251619230236	63.00187434598758	44900

In order to achieve these features standardisation was achieved for Wireless LAN (WLANs) and Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMANs) with the advent of IEEE802.11 and IEEE802.16 family of standards, respectively. One serious concern in the rapidly developing wireless networking market has been the security of the deployments since the information is delivered freely in the air and therefore privacy and integrity of the transmitted information, along with the user-authentication procedures, become a very important issue. In this article, we present the security characteristics for the WiFi and the WiMAX networks. We thoroughly present the security mechanisms along with a threat analysis for both IEEE 802.11 and the 802.16 as well as their amendments. We summarise in a comparative manner the security characteristics and the possible residual threats for both standards. Finally focus on the necessary actions and configurations that are needed in order to deploy WiFi and WiMAX with increased levels of security and privacy.	asymmetric digital subscriber line;authentication;fixed access;high availability;privacy	Panos Trimintzios;George Georgiou	2010	Journal Comp.

These attacks against computer systems result in economic losses for businesses, public organizations and privacy disclosures. The IoT presents a new soft surface for attack. Vulnerability is now found in a multitude of personal and private devices that previously lacked connectivity. The ability to trace back to an attack origin is an important step in locating evidence that may be used to identify and prosecute those responsible. In this theoretical research, IP traceback methods are compared and evaluated for application, and then consolidated into a set of metrics for potential use against attackers.

With the pervasive role of the Internet as a means of sharing information across networks, its misuse for destructive purposes, such as spreading malicious code, compromising remote hosts, or damaging data through unauthorized access, has grown immensely in the recent years. The classical way of monitoring the operation of large network systems is by analyzing the system logs for detecting anomalies. In this work, we introduce hierarchical network map, an interactive visualization technique for gaining a deeper insight into network flow behavior by means of user-driven visual exploration. Our approach is meant as an enhancement to conventional analysis methods based on statistics or machine learning. We use multidimensional modeling combined with position and display awareness to view source and target data of the hosts in a hierarchical fashion with the ability to interactively change the level of aggregation or apply filtering. The interdisciplinary approach integrating data warehouse technology, information visualization and decision support brings about the benefit of efficiently collecting the input data and aggregating over very large data sets, visualizing the results and providing interactivity to facilitate analytical reasoning	addresses (publication format);aggregate data;algorithm;anomaly detection;authorization;computer security;computers;cube dosage form;decision support system;denial (psychology);denial-of-service attack;dental intrusion;event stream processing;glossary of computer graphics;graphics visualization;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hierarchical database model;imagery;immunoprecipitation;information visualization;interaction;interactive visualization;interactivity;internet;machine learning;malware;mathematical optimization;network security;network topology;network traffic control;olap cube;online analytical processing;pervasive informatics;pixel;programming paradigm;reasoning;recursion;sensor;simulation;space-filling curve;tree network;video wall	Florian Mansmann;Svetlana Mansmann	2006	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2006.98	computer vision;multidimensional systems;computer science;data science;data warehouse;data mining;world wide web;data visualization;government;statistics	Visualization	-60.30972542118046	64.34435474561059	45059

A user who wants to compute f(x) should send x to the members of an authorized subset and receive information which enables him to compute f(x). We require that such a scheme is consistent, i.e. that given an input x all authorized subsets compute the same value f(x). The solutions we present enable the operation of many servers, preventing bottlenecks or single points of failure. There are also no single entities which can compromise the security of the entire network. The solutions can be used to distribute the operation of a Key Distribution Center (KDC). They are far better than the known partitioning to domains or replication solutions to this problem, and are especially suited to handle users of multicast groups.	approximation;authorization;bottleneck (software);entity;eval;key distribution center;multicast;reliability engineering;server (computing);single point of failure	Moni Naor;Benny Pinkas;Omer Reingold	1999		10.1007/3-540-48910-X_23	discrete mathematics;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;random function;mathematics;boolean function;computer security;finite field;key distribution center;encryption;algorithm	Crypto	-44.1782675206363	78.32746392394279	45142
d06dabd7ac367c5eb14a5269b5a970ffa3bafdaf	privacy-preserving search of similar patients in genomic data		The growing availability of genomic data holds great promise for advancing medicine and research, but unlocking its full potential requires adequate methods for protecting the privacy of individuals whose genome data we use. One example of this tension is running Similar Patient Query on remote genomic data: In this setting a doctor that holds the genome of his/her patient may try to find other individuals with “close” genomic data, and use the data of these individuals to help diagnose and find effective treatment for that patient’s conditions. This is clearly a desirable mode of operation. However, the privacy exposure implications are considerable, and so we would like to carry out the above “closeness” computation in a privacy preserving manner. In this work we put forward a new approach for highly efficient secure computation for computing an approximation of the Similar Patient Query problem. We present contributions on two fronts. First, an approximation method that is designed with the goal of achieving efficient private computation. Second, further optimizations of the two-party protocol. Our tests indicate that the approximation method works well, it returns the exact closest records in 98% of the queries and very good approximation otherwise. As for speed, our protocol implementation takes just a few seconds to run on databases with thousands of records, each of length thousands of alleles, and it scales almost linearly with both the database size and the length of the sequences in it. As an example, in the datasets of the recent iDASH competition, after a one-time preprocessing of around 12 seconds, it takes around a second to find the nearest five records to a query, in a size-500 dataset of length-3500 sequences. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than using state-of-the-art secure protocols with existing edit distance algorithms.	algorithm;approximation;block cipher mode of operation;centrality;database;edit distance;preprocessor;privacy;secure multi-party computation	Gilad Asharov;Shai Halevi;Yehuda Lindell;Tal Rabin	2017	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		internet privacy;computer security;computer science	Security	-40.442126050422324	64.87425667819919	45153

However, to claim robustness of watermarking techniques is meaningful only when the false positive probability is taken into consideration as well as robustness benchmark. In this paper, the security of a robust copyright-protection scheme based on visual cryptography proposed by Lou et al. is analyzed. We show that the false alarm of their scheme is not neglectable. Precisely, it is insecure since the verification watermark can be unreasonably extracted from other unprotected images using the identical secret key by the owner. The main weak design will be proved and shown by means of giving theoretical analysis and conducting some counter experiments.	visual cryptography	Tzungher Chen;Chin-Chen Chang;Chang-Sian Wu;Der-Chyuan Lou	2009	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2007.09.001	digital watermarking;computer science;theoretical computer science;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-38.09470362011177	71.06230649015438	45220

The method is intended for verification purposes and is based on digital signature techniques. It computes the watermark from selected attributes of the model and stores it in one or more places into the model itself. Because it does not alter the original model structure, it is compatible with copyright protection watermarking techniques and can be used many times to have a multiple watermark; moreover, no pre-processing phase is required before using the model. The verification phase requires a small a priori data knowledge, and no secret at all.  A distributed watermark extension of the schema shows strong localisation capabilities. Watermark data can be stored in control nodes or in comments, and we discuss the two possibilities for their characteristics of storage requirements, localisation capability, and rendering speed. The algorithm is very fast both in casting and verifying the watermark.  This method can be easily used with public key certificates and thus is ready to be integrated in any existing Public Key Infrastructure. Our non-distributed test implementation is also described.	authentication;constructive solid geometry;public-key cryptography	Claudio Fornaro;Andrea Sanna	2000	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/S0010-4485(00)00048-8	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer aided design;solid geometry;authentication;watermark;computer security	EDA	-44.09455740776621	76.22166332596383	45267

In this paper we introduce the first public-key encryption-scheme based on this assumption which is IND-CCA secure in the standard model. Our main technical tool to achieve this is a novel all-but-one simulation technique based on the correlated products approach of Rosen and Segev (TCC 2009). Our IND-CCA1 secure scheme is asymptotically optimal with respect to ciphertext-expansion. To achieve IND-CCA2 security we use a technique of Dolev, Dwork and Naor (STOC 1991) based on one-time-signatures. For practical purposes, the efficiency of the IND-CCA2 scheme can be substantially improved by the use of additional assumptions to allow for more efficient signature schemes. Our results make Alekhnovich’s variant of the learning parity with noise problem a promising candidate to achieve post quantum cryptography.	antivirus software;asiacrypt;asymptotically optimal algorithm;chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext expansion;ciphertext indistinguishability;cynthia dwork;encryption;ibm research;key generation;nico habermann;parity learning;post-quantum cryptography;public-key cryptography;quantum cryptography;simulation;symposium on foundations of computer science;symposium on theory of computing	Nico Döttling;Jörn Müller-Quade;Anderson C.

239b44edf78627d0e1c82413aba87dcc47e4c3f5	phishing detection in ims using domain ontology and cba - an innovative rule generation approach		User ignorance towards the use of communication services like Instant Messengers, emails, websites, social networks etc. is becoming the biggest advantage for phishers. It is required to create technical awareness in users by educating them to create a phishing detection application which would generate phishing alerts for the user so that phishing messages are not ignored. The lack of basic security features to detect and prevent phishing has had a profound effect on the IM clients, as they lose their faith in e-banking and e-commerce transactions, which will have a disastrous impact on the corporate and banking sectors and businesses which rely heavily on the internet. Very little research contributions were available in for phishing detection in Instant messengers. A context based, dynamic and intelligent phishing detection methodology in IMs is proposed, to analyze and detect phishing in Instant Messages with relevance to domain ontology (OBIE) and utilizes the Classification based on Association (CBA) for generating phishing rules and alerting the victims. A PDS Monitoring system algorithm is used to identify the phishing activity during exchange of messages in IMs, with high ratio of precision and recall. The results have shown improvement by the increased percentage of precision and recall when compared to the existing methods.	algorithm;e-commerce;email;instant messaging;online banking;ontology (information science);phishing;precision and recall;relevance;social network;sound card;surround sound	Mohammad S.

f9addfbece526021f3cbc346d37d711e562e604d	secure two-party quantum evaluation of unitaries against specious adversaries	oblivious transfer;quantum computer;quantum physics;commitment scheme	We describe how any two-party quantum computation, specified by a unitary which simultaneously acts on the registers of both parties, can be privately implemented against a quantum version of classical semi-honest adversaries that we call specious. Our construction requires two ideal functionalities to garantee privacy: a private SWAP between registers held by the two parties and a classical private AND-box equivalent to oblivious transfer. If the unitary to be evaluated is in the Clifford group then only one call to SWAP is required for privacy. On the other hand, any unitary not in the Clifford requires one call to an AND-box per R-gate in the circuit. Since SWAP is itself in the Clifford group, this functionality is universal for the private evaluation of any unitary in that group. SWAP can be built from a classical bit commitment scheme or an AND-box but an AND-box cannot be constructed from SWAP. It follows that unitaries in the Clifford group are to some extent the easy ones. We also show that SWAP cannot be implemented privately in the bare model.	commitment scheme;computation;oblivious transfer;privacy;promoting adversaries;quantum computing;semiconductor industry	Frédéric Dupuis;Jesper Buus Nielsen;Louis Salvail	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14623-7_37	discrete mathematics;commitment scheme;computer science;theoretical computer science;oblivious transfer;mathematics;quantum computer;computer security;physics;quantum mechanics	Crypto	-38.83015930532048	75.21422781477182	45341

When running these applications in an unsafe environment such as the Internet, the security concerns raised are a significant barrier to electronic commerce. In addition, these application programs such as web servers, mailservers, etc., are usually too big and complex to be bug free; trying to build security directly into these applications has been proven very difficult. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that Compartmented Mode Workstation is a suitable platform to provide a secure environment that can contain most existing network applications. We describe how to wrap these applications to reduce the potential for a security breach without the need to rewrite the application completely. By minimizing the effort of transferring unsafe application services to be reasonably secure, we are able to accelerate the process of electronic commerce.	e-commerce;internet;rewrite (programming);secure environment;software bug;web server;workstation	Qun Zhong	1997		10.1109/ENABL.1997.630826	the internet;software bug;workstation;computer science;operating system;software engineering;database;distributed computing;data security;internet privacy;business communication;computer-aided software engineering;world wide web;computer security;web server	Security	-52.473316870438424	61.479895161644855	45436

Mirroring is a simple but practical approach allowing reasonable availability and accessibility, but it cannot provide security. This paper proposes an approach which integrates data encryption and distribution to allow high security while providing the same degree of availability as mirroring. It is based on LU decomposition of matrix. Analysis confirms that it allows slightly higher availability compared with mirroring scheme for both read and write operation. The proposed scheme needs almost the same storage space as mirroring.	accessibility;confidentiality;disk mirroring;encryption;lu decomposition;np-hardness;persistence (computer science)	Sung Jin Choi;Hee Yong Youn	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24768-5_68	multiple encryption;matrix analysis;disk encryption theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;deterministic encryption;probabilistic encryption	OS	-42.025235305738676	67.98511630575935	45453
99e2f8361b3038f198ab01ed40782442727f87b5	cryptanalysis of another knapsack cryptosystem	lll algorithm	At the last Eurocrypt meeting, a cryptosystem based on modular knapsacks was proposed (see [11]). We show that this system is not secure, and we describe two different ways of breaking it using the LLL algorithm. This is one more example of a cryptosystem that can be broken using this powerful algorithm (see [1, 13, 14]). For more details, the reader should refer to [4]. 1 The proposed cryptosystem We briefly describe this knapsack based system. Every computation in this system are done in Zp, where p is a fixed prime, and an absolute value must be defined in Zp : |a| is the smallest of the least positive remainders of a and −a. Given a number k, we say that a is k-small if |a| ≤ k, and that a is k-large if |a| ≥ p/2− k. Let C, D, S be n× n matrices of small numbers, ∆ be a diagonal matrix of large numbers and R be a n× n invertible matrix, and compute A = R−1(∆− SC), B = −R−1SD and E = (A,B). Encryption of a bit vector x is done by computing c = Ex and, if p is sufficently large, then decryption can be computed using the secret key R by the following formulas. First let l = Rc, the first half of x can then be obtained from the first half of l simply by translating small numbers into 0 and large numbers into 1. The remaining half of x can then be obtained by methods of linear algebra. The proofs can be found in [11]. The author of the cryptosystem then restricts himself to the case S = I, where I denotes the identity matrix and claims that in this case p > 4kn, is sufficent to ensure decryption. He also claims that k = 1 is a good choice. We present here two different methods to break the cryptosystem with S = I, k = 1 and with p being the smallest prime greater than 4n + 1. One of our method is key oriented and allows us to compute the secret key given the public one, the other is message oriented and gives the original message back without using the secret key. A sligthly different version of this second attack was found independently by an other researcher (cf [5]), and has already been exposed at Crypto 91. Thus, we won’t give any details concerning this second attack. From a theoretical point of view, the attacks don’t need any modification to perform with different values for S and k, however, we haven’t made any practical tests in these cases.	bit array;computation;cryptanalysis;encryption;eurocrypt;key (cryptography);lenstra–lenstra–lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm;linear algebra;merkle–hellman knapsack cryptosystem	Antoine Joux;Jacques Stern	1991		10.1007/3-540-57332-1_40	computer science;merkle–hellman knapsack cryptosystem;linear cryptanalysis	Crypto	-37.042339370258766	79.01595011844007	45512

We extend a simple imperative language with cryptographic operations which are modelled as special expressions respecting the Dolev-Yao assumptions. Then, we adapt to our setting the notion of patterns proposed by Abadi and Rogaway for modelling the equivalence of cryptographic expressions. Based on this notion, we naturally obtain a definition of strongly secure programs corresponding to the one proposed by Sabelfeld and Sands for programs without cryptography. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first definition of noninterference in a multi-threaded distributed setting, with insecure channels and cryptography. We prove compositionality of secure programs and we adapt the type system of Sabelfeld and Sands to our setting, proving its correctness.	computation;correctness (computer science);cryptography;distributed computing;dolev–yao model;encryption;imperative programming;information flow;non-interference (security);thread (computing);turing completeness;type system;yao graph	Riccardo Focardi;Matteo Centenaro	2008		10.1145/1375696.1375711	information flow;type system;computer science;bisimulation;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;programming language;algorithm	Crypto	-34.99294330328983	70.85722358084459	45599

Outside specialized domains (military, vehicular, etc.), city-wide community-networks are emerging, connecting regular Internet users with each other, and with the Internet, via MANETs. Growing to encompass more than a handful of “trusted participants”, the question of preserving the MANET network connectivity, even when faced with careless or malicious participants, arises, and must be addressed. A first step towards protecting a MANET is to analyze the vulnerabilities of the routing protocol, managing the connectivity. By understanding how the algorithms of the routing protocol operate, and how these can be exploited by those with ill intent, countermeasures can be developed, readying MANETs for wider deployment and use. This memorandumtakes an abstract look at the algorithms that constitute the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2), and identifies for each protocol element the possible vulnerabilities and attacks – in a certain way, provides a “cookbook” for how to best attack an operational OLSRv2 network, or for how to proceed with developing protective countermeasures against these attacks.

Outre les applications spécilisées (militaires, véhiculaires etc.), des réseaux communautaires urbains émergent pour connecter des simples utilisateurs d’Internet à d’autres utilisateurs et à Internet via MANETs. Pour supporter un nombre croissant d’utilisateurs au-delà d’une poignée de participants de confiance, la question de préserver la connectivité des réseaux MANET face à des utilisateurs imprudents ou malicieux se pose. Un premier pas vers la protection de MANET est d’analyser les vulnérabilités du protocole de routage qui gère la connectivité. En comprenant en profondeur comment les algorithmes du protocole de routage opèrent et comment ils peuvent être exploités par des utilisateurs indélicats, des contre-mesures peuvent être développées afin de rendre MANET prêt à être déployé à plus grande échelle. Ce rapport examine de manière conceptuelle les algorithmes qui constituent le protocole OLSRv2 (Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2) et pour chaque élément du protocole identifie les éventuelles vulnérabilités et attaques possibles.

It has been widely employed along with the deployment of SASL. In this paper, we implement a password recovery attack to Digest Access Authentication that can recover passwords as long as 48 characters in overall off-line computation about 2^{35} MD5 compressions and 8084 on-line queries. This confirms that the security of Digest Access Authentication is totally broken, and all applications based on that must be re-evaluated seriously. Further, we prove that the security of the hashing scheme H(C| |P), where H is a hash function, C is a challenge and P is a shared password, is totally dependent on the collision resistance of H, instead of the pre-image resistance. Such scheme can't be used in challenge and response protocols to protect the shared password. Finally, we prove that some hashing schemes like H(H(C| |P)) provide no more security than H(C| |P), in the aspect of collision resistance.	collision resistance;computation;digest access authentication;encryption;hash function;hypertext transfer protocol;md5;online and offline;password cracking;sasl;software deployment	Fanbao Liu	2011	2011 14th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	10.1109/CSE.2011.79	data authentication algorithm;message authentication code;hash function;s/key;collision attack;digest access authentication;computer access control;challenge–response authentication;collision resistance;computer science;authentication protocol;cryptographic nonce;generic bootstrapping architecture;hash chain;hash-based message authentication code;cryptographic protocol;internet privacy;one-time password;password;computer security;transport layer;computer network	Crypto	-45.12170707453038	73.95349644645495	45774

Contrary to its primary expectations, server centralization, enterprise-wide collaborative applications trends raise various network resources need to be made available to users regardless of their VLAN membership. Unfortunately these trends also increase network security threats. It is general that the primary threat to network security is not caused by external users but the come from individuals inside and organization. Although network access is opened for every user in VLAN, it must be restricted to some degree. In this paper, we propose a new asymmetric VLAN management scheme in which users belonging to multiple VLANs to access another VLAN end station while both end stations are VLAN-unaware. In our scheme, an end station can communicate another end station belonging to different VLAN only after authentication. We also propose a novel VLAN access control scheme that allows only authorized users to access the multi-netted asymmetric VLAN.	access control;virtual lan	Wonwoo Choi;Hyuncheol Kim;Seong-Jin Ahn;Jin-Wook Chung	2005		10.1007/11424758_15	local area network;vlan access control list;telecommunications;computer science;network security;authentication;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-36.063607796652974	61.220787761046516	45878

However, the wide attacking surface of the public cloud and the growing security awareness from the society are both calling for data encryption before outsourcing to cloud. Under the circumstance of encrypted videos, how to still preserve all the service benefits of cloud media center remains to be fully explored. In this paper, we present a secure system architecture design as our initial effort toward this direction, which bridges together the advancements of video coding techniques and secure deduplication. Our design enables the cloud with the crucial deduplication functionality to completely eliminate the extra storage and bandwidth cost, which would have been incurred by hosting encrypted videos from different entities. The design is also carefully tailored to the scalable video coding (SVC) techniques to support heterogeneous networks and devices for high-quality adaptive video dissemination. We show fully functional system implementations with structure-aware encryption design and structure-aware deduplication strategies that are both completely compliant with the video format in SVC. Extensive security analysis and experiments via our prototype deployed on Azure cloud platform show the practicality of the design. Our work can also be easily extended to support other media applications that employ media files with scalable structures.	cloud computing;data compression;data deduplication;encryption;entity;experiment;microsoft azure;outsourcing;programming paradigm;prototype;scalability;scalable video coding;security awareness;systems architecture;video coding format;windows media center	Yifeng Zheng;Xingliang Yuan;Xinyu Wang;Jinghua Jiang;Xinyu Wang;Xiaolin Gui	2017	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2016.2612760	media;cloud computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;encryption;computer network	Security	-43.663804380148065	66.80778723598148	45994

In this paper, we propose Agent based SEcured Routing using Trusted neighbors (ASERT) in WSN. ASERT selects trustworthy neighbors and establishes secured routes using software agents. ASERT operates in following phases. (1) Defining Safeguard Agency (SA) and Routing Agency (RA), both consisting of static and mobile agents and a knowledge base. (2) Identification of trustworthy neighbor nodes by SA with trust model that consists of probability and Message Authentication Codes (MAC) model. (3) Probability model estimates the trustworthy channel and trustworthy nodes whereas MAC model ensures them. (4) MAC’s are dynamically computed by agents by generating the keys with the help of Random Oracle Extractor (ROE). (5) RA establishes secured routes from source to the sink node using agents. (6) Agents effectively identify possible security threats on wireless channel and node. (7) An improvement in packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, route maintenance overhead, memory overhead and energy consumption is achieved in ASERT as compared to two protocols, namely, Bio-inspired Trust and Reputation model in WSN (BTRM-WSN) using ant colony based approach and Ambient Trust Sensor Routing that uses trust combined with location information for routing.

SIP can be configured in several ways so that different functional and security requirements are met. Careless configuration of the SIP protocol is known to lead to a large set of attacks. In this paper we show how different configurations of SIP can be specified in a protocol centric formal language. Both static analysis and simulations can be performed on the resulting specifications by the recently developed tool PROSA. In particular, we analyze the VoIP architecture of a medium size Norwegian company, and show that several of the well known threats can be found.	digest access authentication;formal language;formal specification;requirement;routing;signaling protocol;simulation;static program analysis;threat (computer);whole earth 'lectronic link	Anders Moen Hagalisletto;Lars Strand	2008	2008 Second International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies	10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.61	sip trunking;computer science;information security;voice over ip;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	EDA	-51.42514486535142	68.92515358188912	46079
019d38364eec9f8dfb543f899c1fd949bf43020d	differential private poi queries via johnson-lindenstrauss transform		The growing popularity of location-based services is giving untrusted servers relatively free reign to collect huge amounts of location information from mobile users. This information can reveal far more than just a user’s locations but other sensitive information, such as the user’s interests or daily routines, which raises strong privacy concerns. Differential privacy is a well-acknowledged privacy notion that has become an important standard for the preservation of privacy. Unfortunately, existing privacy preservation methods based on differential privacy protect user location privacy at the cost of utility, aspects of which have to be sacrificed to ensure that privacy is maintained. To solve this problem, we present a new privacy framework that includes a semi-trusted third party. Under our privacy framework, both the server and the third party only hold a part of the user’s location information. Neither the server nor the third party knows the exact location of the user. In addition, the proposed perturbation method based on the Johnson Lindenstrauss transform satisfies the differential privacy. Two popular point of interest queries,  $k$ -NN and Range, are used to evaluate the method on two real-world data sets. Extensive comparisons against two representative differential privacy-based methods show that the proposed method not only provides a strict privacy guarantee but also significantly improves performance.

4b28ccd714591e4dd9baae866f03b1389c4e8d9d	towards continuous and passive authentication via touch biometrics: an experimental study on smartphones		Current smartphones generally cannot continuously authenticate users during runtime. This poses severe security and privacy threats: A malicious user can manipulate the phone if bypassing the screen lock. To solve this problem, our work adopts a continuous and passive authentication mechanism based on a user’s touch operations on the touchscreen. Such a mechanism is suitable for smartphones, as it requires no extra hardware or intrusive user interface. We study how to model multiple types of touch data and perform continuous authentication accordingly. As a first attempt, we also investigate the fundamentals of touch operations as biometrics by justifying their distinctiveness and permanence. A onemonth experiment is conducted involving over 30 users. Our experiment results verify that touch biometrics can serve as a promising method for continuous and passive authentication.	authentication;biometrics;security hacker;smartphone;touchscreen;user interface	Hui Xu;Yangfan Zhou;Michael R.

3434b759674c91c0f5075630f289cbb3e09c8df4	dynamic tags for security protocols	formal methods;security protocols;veriﬁcation	The design and verification of cryptographic protocols is a notoriously difficult task, even in symbolic models which take an abstract view of cryptography. This is mainly due to the fact that protocols may interact with an arbitrary attacker which yields a verification problem that has several sources of unboundedness (size of messages, number of sessions, etc.). In this paper, we characterize a class of protocols for which deciding security for an unbounded number of sessions is decidable. More precisely, we present a simple transformation which maps a protocol that is secure for a bounded number of protocol sessions (a decidable problem) to a protocol that is secure for an unbounded number of sessions. The precise number of sessions that need to be considered is a function of the security property and we show that for several classical security properties a single session is sufficient. Therefore, in many cases our results yields a design strategy for security protocols: (i) design a protocol intended to be secure for a single session; and (ii) apply our transformation to obtain a protocol which is secure for an unbounded number of sessions.	cryptographic protocol;cryptography;decision problem;map;unbounded nondeterminism	Myrto Arapinis;Stéphanie Delaune;Steve Kremer	2014	Logical Methods in Computer Science	10.2168/LMCS-10(2:11)2014	universal composability;formal methods;computer science;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;distributed computing;programming language;computer security	Security	-36.469378006852594	72.99067787644157	46305

In anonymity PCL, equivalent messages and equivalent traces were proposed. On the basis of equivalent traces, three kinds of anonymity were defined: sender anonymity, recipient anonymity, and relation anonymity. Finally, taking direct anonymous attestation DAA as an example, we formalized the anonymity of DAA by the new framework, the result of which demonstrates that DAA satisfies anonymity and verifies the correctness and feasibility of the new framework.

There are also cryptographic protocols wherein discovering the secret is not too complex given the current state of technology, but logically impossible. One approach involves the use of a random deck of cards for such protocols. The messages in the protocol consist of announcements made by the two players attempting to exchange a secret. In that approach one may require that these two players can communicate their holding of cards to each other without the remaining players (eavesdroppers) learning a single card in these holdings. In past work we described combinatorial axioms to achieve that. The eavesdroppers may still be able to make an educated guess about individual card occurrence (card ownership). In this work we focus on overcoming such bias. From the perspective of cryptography there are two ways to do that: either use protocols that produce announcements that are unbiased for card occurrence, or use protocols that ensure that there is no relation between patterns in the announcement, such as card occurrence, and the actual holding. We focus on the first. We devise an additional requirement for the announcement in order to eliminate the possibility of making educated guesses. To that effect we propose an additional combinatorial axiom CA4, and we give a method to design announcements that meet this requirement. Additionally, we present unbiased protocols for incidental cases.	cryptographic protocol;hans moravec;logical possibility;public-key cryptography;requirement	Mike D.

It is especially designed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) providing business-to-customers services. Our protocol allows the SME to outsource its services to a cloud to reduce the running cost. At the same time, it does not require any communication between the cloud and the SME during user authentication stage. That is, SME can be offline after users have been registered. Users directly deal with the cloud for gaining access. This helps the SME to save a lot of resources, including a large bandwidth connecting with the cloud and a strong firewall system. Meanwhile, the user database never leaves the SME. In addition, our protocol can withstand common attacks such as dictionary attacks for server and phishing attacks for client. Our security protection is especially important for mobile users as mobile devices are easily exposed to such attacks. Furthermore, our protocol provides user traceability to SME and it is very efficient for mobile devices.	access control;mobile cloud computing	Wei Wu;Shun Hu;Xu Yang;Joseph K.

In this paper, we methodically analyze the security of all the possible iterated Even-Mansour schemes with two n-bit keys and up to four rounds, and show that none of them provides more than n-bit security. Our attacks are based on a new cryptanalytic technique called multibridge which splits the cipher to different parts in a novel way, such that they can be analyzed independently, exploiting its self-similarity properties. After the analysis of the parts, the key suggestions are efficiently joined using a meet-in-themiddle procedure. As a demonstration of the multibridge technique, we devise a new attack on 4 steps of the LED-128 block cipher, reducing the time complexity of the best known attack on this scheme from 2 to 2. Furthermore, we show that our technique can be used as a generic key-recovery tool, when combined with some statistical distinguishers (like those recently constructed in reflection cryptanalysis of GOST and PRINCE).	block cipher;classification tree method;cryptanalysis;iterated function;iteration;self-similarity;time complexity	Eli Biham;Yaniv Carmeli;Itai Dinur;Orr Dunkelman;Nathan Keller;Adi Shamir	2013	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-662-45611-8_23	cryptanalysis;related-key attack;theoretical computer science;higher-order differential cryptanalysis;mathematics;slide attack;computer security;algorithm;statistics	Crypto	-37.92729583010857	79.12679988476746	46490

Manual reactions fall behind the fast propagation of P2P worms. Current automatic techniques are still not adequate to be deployed on a large scale for several challenges including low accuracy, low efficiency, etc. In this paper, we bring forward a repair-andpatch approach to quarantine malicious worms quickly in unstructured P2P networks. Our work has two major contributions. Firstly, we propose two kinds of benign worms, which differ in functions and spread strategies, to cooperatively battle against malicious worms. Secondly, we derive discrete difference equations to depict the interplay between malicious and benign worms. Four factors — manual countermeasures, P2P topology, configuration diversity and attack and defense strategies — are modeled in the equations. Preliminary experiments are promising. Compared with sheer manual reactions, our approach is about two times faster and protects about 35% more hosts. In comparison with benign worms, which search targets by random scanning, our proposed method guards about 34.4% more hosts with lower consumption of bandwidth resources.

An important property of our method is that the ownership transfer is guaranteed to be atomic and the scheme is protected against desynchronisation leading to permanent DoS. Further, it is suited to the computational constraints of EPC Class-1 Gen-2 passive RFID tags as they only use the CRC and PRNG functions that passive RFID tags are capable of. We provide a detailed security analysis to show that our scheme satisfies the required security properties of tag anonymity, tag location privacy, forward secrecy, forward untraceability while being resistant to replay, desynchronisation and server impersonation attacks. Performance comparisons show that our scheme is practical and can be implemented on passive low-cost RFID tags.	closed-loop transfer function;cyclic redundancy check;electronic product code;forward secrecy;quadratic residue;radio-frequency identification;replay attack;server (computing);testbed;the australian	Robin Doss;Wanlei Zhou	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215482	radio-frequency identification;communications protocol;forward secrecy;computer science;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;security analysis;privacy;world wide web;computer security;radio frequency;server;computer network;satisfiability	Mobile	-45.20123212748423	74.76711709351652	46641
5c0035a9266d805edda606212158fa1e9618bef1	survey on evolutionary computation methods for cybersecurity of mobile ad hoc networks		In this paper, a comprehensive survey of evolutionary computation (EC) methods for cybersecurity of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is presented. Typically, EC methods are named based on the natural processes inspiring them, such as swarm intelligence (e.g., ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, and particle swarm optimization), evolutionary algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and differential evolution), artificial immune systems, and evolutionary games analyzing strategic interactions among different population types. We introduce these methods with their typical applications, and commonly used algorithms to improve cybersecurity within the scope of MANETs. Ongoing and speedy topology changes, multi-hop communication, non-hierarchical organization, and power and computational limitations are among the intrinsic characteristics of MANETs causing cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

daa43d6e4f5909e0d85d218461cb3e6aa5eacefb	privacy-aware access control in xml databases	digital repository;xml database;access control;la trobe university research online	With the growing use of XML for data transfer and data storage across the web, securing XML documents has become an important issue. The XML privacy and data access control issues are especially significant in XML data repositories because they typically store large collections of highly sensitive business data, health information, etc. Protecting privacy by only restricting access to individual nodes in the XML document tree is not sufficient, as combinations of nodes and aggregations thereof can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. Moreover, a mechanism is required to cope with such combined data privacy levels, as they must be validated on querytime. Extending from XML access control models, this paper proposes a privacy-aware access control model for XML with composite security levels, which adds a further level of fine-granularity to existing approaches. In order to enforce these composite security levels, we then introduce a methodology based on path-triggers. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our new approach using three different implementation techniques.	access control;algorithm;computer data storage;data access;document object model;experiment;information privacy;information sensitivity;research data archiving;scalability;xml database	Anders H.

However, even unconnected computers contract viruses and malware through the sharing of USB flash drives and other removable media. This paper introduces FlashPatch, a system for distributing software updates to computers in such areas by having software updates """"piggy-back"""" on the existing flow of flash drives in rural regions. FlashPatch requires no changes in user behavior once the software has been installed. We implemented a proof-of-concept FlashPatch prototype and evaluated it in a field trial in Ghana. We present data on the prevalence and spread of viruses at our study site and offer experimental evidence of FlashPatch's effectiveness from a nine-month field trial.

The proposed voting protocol was designed to be executed on a fixed group of N known participants, each of them casting one vote that may be a vote for abstention. Several attack vectors on the protocol are presented, and the detection of malicious behavior like spying, suppressing, inventing, and modifying protocol messages or votes by the protocol is shown. If some participants stop the protocol, a fair information exchange is achieved in the sense that either all votes are guaranteed to be valid and accessible to all participants, or malicious behavior has been detected and the protocol is stopped, but the votes are not disclosed.	information exchange;malware;spyware;trusted third party	Sebastian Obermeier;Stefan Böttcher	2011	IJESMA	10.4018/jesma.2011070103	universal composability;two-phase commit protocol;information exchange;trusted third party;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-42.71393366315274	72.02870120850953	46842

The security regulations stipulate the provisions implemented to guard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Undoubtedly, the cryptographic mechanisms are well defined to provide suitable solutions. In this paper, to comply with the HIPAA regulations, a flexible cryptographic key management solution is proposed to facilitate interoperations among the applied cryptographic mechanisms.

Unlike traditional periodic data collection, the traffic patterns generated from real-time data collection may expose the interests of users or the locations of unusual events to the attackers. To provide privacy in data collection, we propose a novel probabilistic sampling mechanism that can hide user queries and unusual events in the network, while supporting both routine and on-demand data reporting. Our goal is to prevent attackers from locating the unusual events and identifying interests of users by eavesdropping and analyzing the network traffic. In our probabilistic sampling scheme, the data are carefully reported at random times in order to mask the unusual events and user queries. In the meantime, our scheme can provide users with high data accuracy at minimized communication overheads. Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the security strength, data accuracy and communication overheads of the proposed scheme.	algorithm;algorithmic inference;interpolation;network packet;network traffic control;privacy;randomness;real-time computing;real-time data;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;traffic analysis;web service	João Guerreiro;Edith C.-H.

Our protocols improve on Tsang et al.'s Blacklistable Anonymous Credentials (BLAC) system and its variants by incorporating novel batch zero-knowledge proof and verification techniques. BLACRONYM provides comparable functionality and security guarantees to those of BLAC and its derivatives, but it is substantially faster and consumes much less bandwidth. At the heart of BLACRONYM is the first batch zero-knowledge protocol in the literature for proofs of partial knowledge over non-monotone access structures; we suspect that our new techniques will find applications in speeding up other cryptographic constructions that require proofs of similar statements.	computation;cryptography;digital credential;zero-knowledge proof;monotone	Ryan Henry;Ian Goldberg	2013		10.1145/2517840.2517855	computer science;distributed computing;efficiency;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-40.857929269587814	74.69709622958672	46907
5bc8c2be2d426aa17d5299dc6e76d4ab128c94d8	how secure are secure interdomain routing protocols?	interdomain routing;bgp;security	In response to high-profile Internet outages, BGP security variants have been proposed to prevent the propagation of bogus routing information. The objective of this paper is to inform discussions of which variant should be deployed in the Internet. To do this, we quantify the ability of the key protocols (origin authentication, soBGP, S-BGP, and data-plane verification) to limit the impact of traffic-attraction attacks; i.e., when an attacker deliberately draws traffic to its own network, in order to drop, tamper, or eavesdrop on packets. Our results and contributions are as follows:(1)One might expect that an attacker could maximize the volume of traffic it attracts by using the following intuitive strategy: the attacker should announce, to as many of its neighbors as possible, the shortest path that is not flagged as bogus by the secure protocol. Through simulations on an empirically-determined AS-level topology, we show that this strategy is surprisingly effective, even when an advanced security solution like S-BGP or data-plane verification is fully deployed. (2)Next, we show that these results underestimate the severity of attacks. In fact, counterintuitive strategies, like announcing longer paths, announcing to fewer neighbors, or triggering BGP loop-detection, can be used to attract even more traffic than the strategy above. We illustrate this using counterintuitive examples. We also demonstrate that these attacks are not merely hypothetical, by searching the empirical AS-level topology and identifying specific ASes that can launch these attacks. (3)We prove that it is NP hard to find a traffic-attraction attack strategy that attracts the maximum volume of traffic. Our results suggest that a clever export policy (i.e., where the attacker announces a legitimate path to a carefully chosen set of neighbors) an often attract almost as much traffic as a bogus path announcement. Thus, our work implies that mechanisms that police export policies (e.g., prefix filtering) are crucial, even if more advanced cryptographic solutions like S-BGP are fully deployed.	inter-domain;routing	Sharon Goldberg;Michael Schapira;Peter Hummon;Jennifer Rexford	2014	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2014.05.007	border gateway protocol;telecommunications;computer science;information security;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	ECom	-57.33463217487711	69.15046599679886	46909

Such highly-exposed environments employ white-box cryptography (WBC) for security protection. WBC operates on a security model far different from the traditional black-box model. The modern business world includes large commercial segments in which end-users are directly exposed to business application software hosted on web browsers, mobile phones, web-connected tablets, and an increasing number of other devices: the `internet of things' (IoT). Software applications and their communication activities now dominate much of the commercial world, and there have been countless hacks on such software, and on devices hosting it, with targets as diverse as mobile phones, web browser applications, vehicles, and even refrigerators! The business advantages of deploying computational power near the user encourage software migration to exposed network end-points, but this increasing exposure provides an ever growing attack surface. Here, we discuss goals and challenges of white-box cryptography and emerging approaches in a continual attempt to stay at least one step ahead of the attackers. We list some WBC techniques, both traditional and recent, indicating how they might be incorporated into a WBC AES implementation.	attack surface;black box;business software;cloud computing;computation;cryptography;internet of things;mobile device;mobile phone;software modernization	Yuan Xiang Gu;Harold Johnson;Clifford Liem;Andrew Wajs;Michael J.

We describe a weakness in a class of combiners with one-bit memory which makes them vulnerable in such applications requesting resynchronization. A correlation attack based on chi-square criterion, which in some aspects complements the attack studied by Daemen et. al., is presented. Stream ciphers are an important class of encryption algorithms. They encrypt individual characters of a plaintext one at a time, using encryption transformation, which varies with time. We consider a weakness of synchronous stream ciphers with one-bit memory. Our investigations justify the designers intuitive understanding that in conservative design of such combiners should not be used linear memory functions, despite their easy implementation.	algorithm;ciphertext;correlation attack;cryptography;encryption;memory bound function;plaintext;stream cipher	Yuri L.

The main goal of this paper is to explore the influences of removable devices on the interaction dynamics between malicious worms and benign worms by using a mathematical model. The model takes two important network environment factors into consideration: benign worms and the influences of removable devices. Besides, the model’s basic reproduction number is obtained, along with the correct control conditions of the local and global asymptotical stability of the worm-free equilibrium. Simulation results show that the effectiveness of our proposed model in terms of reflecting the influences of removable devices on the interaction dynamics of an anti-treat model. Based on numerical analyses and simulations, effective methods are proposed to contain the propagation of malicious worms by using anti-worms.	anti-worm;asymptote;broadcast delay;communications protocol;feasible region;malware;mathematical model;numerical analysis;removable media;simulation;software propagation;threat model	Jinhua Ma;Zhide Chen;Wei Wu;Rongjun Zheng;Jianghua Liu	2015	Information	10.3390/info6030536	basic reproduction number;simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Robotics	-57.45404855557255	74.51148316703447	47100

This emerging RF technology is well suited for supply chain management and is expected to replace barcodes in the near future. However, unlike barcodes, these tags have an extended range in which they are allowed to be queried by a reader. This may result in different attack scenarios such as unauthorized scanning by malicious readers Therefore, a security protocol for RFID enabled supply chain is necessary to ensure the privacy and authentication between each tag, the corresponding reader and the backend server . In order to counter the evolving security issues, we propose a secure RFID based architecture for supply chain hierarchy. This architecture comprises of four different phases depicting the movement of a tagged item from source to destination. There are four different protocols supporting this architecture. Although this architecture was designed for use in supply chains, it can also be used for other RFID enabled applications by incurring minute changes.	authentication;authorization;barcode;cryptographic hash function;cryptographic protocol;dspace;database;encryption;privacy;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;requirement;secure communication;server (computing)	Nauman Abdullah Shah;Muhammad Arif Wahla	2010		10.1109/PST.2010.5593233	radio-frequency identification;supply chain management;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-47.38343670681941	63.52637149230434	47109

The Bluetooth 2.1 standard introduces a new security mechanism called Secure Simple Pairing (SSP). However, to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks, SSP uses a 6-digit number for authentication. If a human error occurs while conducting visual verification, then data security could be breached. This paper presents an improved protocol to address this problem. This protocol not only secures consumer privacy, but also increases operational efficiency.	authentication;bluetooth;confidentiality;consumer privacy;data security;high-level programming language;human error;man-in-the-middle attack;personal identification number;user error	Tzu-Chang Yeh;Jian-Ren Peng;Sheng-Shih Wang;Jun-Ping Hsu	2012	I.

This results in numerous cyber security threats. In order to enhance the Internet accountability and deter potential cyber-attacks, in this paper, we propose TrueID, an IPv6 header extension scheme which can embed hash-based, creditable and undeniable user identity code inside IPv6 packets. We present the system architecture, header’s format and viable implementation approaches with different credibility granularities. Meanwhile, to verify packet credibility and integrity, we design an Autonomous System (AS) level public-key distribution systemwhich can disseminate user’s public keys between allied ASes safely. Also, the prototype experiment has proved that our scheme possesses these features with desirable performance. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	authentication;autonomous system (internet);computer security;internet;key distribution;network packet;prototype;public-key cryptography;systems architecture	Guangwu Hu;Wenlong Chen;Qi Li;Yong Jiang;Ke Xu	2017	Future Generation Comp.

We use this bound to derive a novel countermeasure against timing attacks, where the strength of the security guarantee can be freely traded for the resulting performance penalty. We give algorithms that efficiently and optimally adjust this trade-off for given constraints on the side-channel leakage or on the efficiency of the cryptosystem. Finally, we perform a case-study that shows that applying our countermeasure leads to implementations with minor performance overhead and formal security guarantees.	algorithm;application domain;concurrency (computer science);coprocessor;cryptography;cryptosystem;embedded system;information leakage;information theory;overhead (computing);provable security;side-channel attack;spectral leakage	Boris Köpf;Markus Dürmuth	2009	2009 22nd IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium	10.1109/CSF.2009.21	entropy;information flow;information theory;computer science;cryptography;cryptosystem;internet privacy;computer security;statistics;computer network	Security	-34.2402503787257	73.94521388883078	47165

In this study, an innovative system of securing CAD files based on the workplace against illegal piracy of design knowledge in ubiquitous environment is presented. The proposed technology is to store all design files in the secure workplace which can be accessed by the authorized users and design applications only using Application Programming Hooking at user level and System Service Table at kernel level. The technology is demonstrated in this paper using its implementation example in an automobile company to verify it and CAD files can be shared among users without a concern of its leakage to the competitors by internal user.	computer-aided design	H.

Theoretical results [2] provide a general construction of such protocols for any function. Protocols obtained in this way are, however, inefficient, and thus, practically speaking, useless when a large number of participants are involved.The contribution of this paper is to define a new privacy model -- k-privacy -- by means of an innovative, yet natural generalization of the accepted trusted third party model. This allows implementing cryptographically secure efficient primitives for real-world large-scale distributed systems.As an example for the usefulness of the proposed model, we employ k-privacy to introduce a technique for obtaining knowledge -- by way of an association-rule mining algorithm -- from large-scale Data Grids, while ensuring that the privacy is cryptographically secure.	algorithm;association rule learning;cryptography;data mining;distributed computing;privacy;scalability;secure multi-party computation;trusted third party	Bobi Gilburd;Assaf Schuster;Ran Wolff	2004		10.1145/1014052.1014120	association rule learning;trusted third party;computer science;information security;data grid;data mining;secure multi-party computation;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;distributed computing environment	ML	-40.90104083919481	74.42844986404202	47202

While criminal profiling has been frequently applied to support the prevention and investigation of crimes, particularly violent crimes, it has not been applied to industrial espionage. Criminal profiling such as behavioral and investigative data profiling could help to identify the criminals leaking the secrets. The application of criminal profiling may contribute to prevent and reduce industrial espionage. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to attempt to apply criminal profiling to industrial security and eventually prevent and control industrial espionage.	access control;human factors and ergonomics;physical security;profiling (computer programming)	Chang-Moo Lee	2014	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-014-2014-2	forensic profiling;industrial espionage;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security	SE	-58.66875943732828	61.67809983988374	47223

This work is motivated by an attack proposed in [1] and gives an insight into how public keys reused for long term in RLWE key exchange protocols can be exploited. This work specifically focuses on the attack on the KE protocol in [2] by initiating multiple sessions with the honest party and analyze the output of the signal function.

However, they are also relatively vulnerable: physically located off site, attackers can circumvent wireless security protocols such as WEP, WPA, and even to some extent WPA2, presenting a security risk to the entire network. To address this problem, we propose SecureAngle, a system designed to operate alongside existing wireless security protocols, adding defense in depth. SecureAngle leverages multi-antenna APs to profile the directions at which a client's signal arrives, using this angle-of-arrival (AoA) information to construct signatures that uniquely identify each client. We identify SecureAngle's role of providing a fine-grained location service in a multi-path indoor environment. With this location information, we investigate how an AP might create a """"virtual fence"""" that drops frames received from clients physically located outside a building or office. With SecureAngle signatures, we also identify how an AP can prevent malicious parties from spoofing the link-layer address of legitimate clients. We discuss how SecureAngle might aid whitespace radios in yielding to incumbent transmitters, as well as its role in directional downlink transmissions with uplink AoA information."""

4aeccebed4311e14cc339d8281d5530a0c6b3c27	standard security does imply security against selective opening for markov distributions		About three decades ago it was realized that implementing private channels between parties which can be adaptively corrupted requires an encryption scheme that is secure against selective opening attacks. Whether standard (IND-CPA) security implies security against selective opening attacks has been a major open question since. The only known reduction from selective opening to IND-CPA security loses an exponential factor. A polynomial reduction is only known for the very special case where the distribution considered in the selective opening security experiment is a product distribution, i.e., the messages are sampled independently from each other. In this paper we give a reduction whose loss is quantified via the dependence graph (where message dependencies correspond to edges) of the underlying message distribution. In particular, for some concrete distributions including Markov distributions, our reduction is polynomial.	ciphertext indistinguishability;encryption;markov chain;polynomial;time complexity	Georg Fuchsbauer;Felix Heuer;Eike Kiltz;Krzysztof Pietrzak	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-49096-9_12	telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-37.84726651115822	77.59083949323076	47410
598f70ee51daef3a39c5cf8a381e84be05726ef3	privateclean: data cleaning and differential privacy	local differential privacy;data cleaning;differential privacy	Recent advances in differential privacy make it possible to guarantee user privacy while preserving the main characteristics of the data. However, most differential privacy mechanisms assume that the underlying dataset is clean. This paper explores the link between data cleaning and differential privacy in a framework we call PrivateClean. PrivateClean includes a technique for creating private datasets of numerical and discrete-valued attributes, a formalism for privacy-preserving data cleaning, and techniques for answering sum, count, and avg queries after cleaning. We show: (1) how the degree of privacy affects subsequent aggregate query accuracy, (2) how privacy potentially amplifies certain types of errors in a dataset, and (3) how this analysis can be used to tune the degree of privacy. The key insight is to maintain a bipartite graph relating dirty values to clean values and use this graph to estimate biases due to the interaction between cleaning and privacy. We validate these results on four datasets with a variety of well-studied cleaning techniques including using functional dependencies, outlier filtering, and resolving inconsistent attributes.	aggregate data;aggregate function;differential privacy;functional dependency;numerical analysis;plasma cleaning;semantics (computer science)	Sanjay Krishnan;Jiannan Wang;Michael J.

It achieves anonymity by routing encrypted traffic across a few routers, where the required encryption keys are established using a key exchange protocol. Goldberg, Stebila and Ustaoglu recently characterized the security and privacy properties required by the key exchange protocol used in the OR network. They defined the concept of one-way authenticated key exchange (1W-AKE) and presented a provably secure 1W-AKE protocol called ntor, which is under consideration for deployment in Tor.  In this paper, we present a novel 1W-AKE protocol Ace that improves on the computation costs of ntor: in numbers, the client has an efficiency improvement of 46% and the server of nearly 19%. As far as communication costs are concerned, our protocol requires a client to send one additional group element to a server, compared to the ntor protocol. However, an additional group element easily fits into the 512 bytes fix-sized Tor packets (or cell) in the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) setting. Consequently, our protocol does not produce a communication overhead in the Tor protocol. Moreover, we prove that our protocol Ace constitutes a 1W-AKE. Given that the ECC setting is under consideration for the Tor system, the improved computational efficiency, and the proven security properties make our 1W-AKE an ideal candidate for use in the Tor protocol.	ace;anonymous web browsing;authenticated key exchange;authentication;byte;client (computing);communications protocol;computation;disk sector;elliptic curve cryptography;encryption;fits;one-way function;overhead (computing);provable security;router (computing);routing;server (computing);software deployment;tor messenger	Michael Backes;Aniket Kate;Esfandiar Mohammadi	2012		10.1145/2381966.2381974	internet protocol;wireless routing protocol;reverse address resolution protocol;otway–rees protocol;oakley protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;universal composability;user datagram protocol;neighbor discovery protocol;zone routing protocol;stateless protocol;resource reservation protocol;internet protocol control protocol;computer science;link control protocol;tunneling protocol;distributed computing;internet protocol suite;internet privacy;routing protocol;interior gateway routing protocol;path vector protocol;computer security;layer 2 tunneling protocol	Security	-47.06191608351478	72.74089466067754	47487

We enhance the key management scheme to protect the service provider's revenue against piracy. Using the enhanced scheme, even if a cracker could crack and reproduce set-top boxes, the pirated set-top boxes are only applicable in a small geographical region (i.e., they have limited spatial applicability) and they cannot function within one charging period (i.e., they have limited temporal applicability).	authorization;cryptography;encryption;key management;set-top box	Yiu-Wing Leung	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) (IEEE Cat.

All of them use periodic attack pulses to throttle TCP flows. These attacks could potentially become major threats to the Internet's stability and therefore they have motivated the development of a number of detection mechanisms for such attacks. However, those detection mechanisms are designed for specific attacks. Moreover, they assume that the period of the attack pulses is a nonzero constant. Unfortunately, these assumptions can be easily thwarted by more sophisticated attack strategies. In this paper, we propose a new detection system called Vanguard to identify a wide range of the aforementioned low-rate, DoS attacks, including the traditional flooding-based attacks as a special case. Vanguard can also detect attacks with randomized attack periods. We have validated Vanguard's efficacy based on extensive test-bed experiments.

The mechanism enforces access policy to data containing personally identifiable information. The key component of the framework is purpose involved access control models (PAC) that provide full support for expressing highly complex privacy-related policies, taking into account features like purposes, conditions and obligations. Policy conflicting problems may arise when new access policies are generated that are possible to be conflicted to existing policies. As a result of the policy conflicts, private information cannot be well protected. The structure of access control policy including conditions and obligations is studied. Based on the access policy, authorization models and policy operations are analysed.

The authentication usually means the entity authentication, but owing to the data centric nature of sensor network, much more importance must be put on the authentication(or attestation) for code of sensor nodes. The naive approach to the attestation is for the verifier to compare the previously known memory contents of the target node with the actual memory contents in the target node, but it has a significant drawback. In this paper, we show what the drawback is and propose a countermeasure. The basic idea of our countermeasure is not to give the malicious code any memory space to reside by cleaning the target node's memory space where the malicious code can reside. This scheme can verify the whole memory space of the target node and provides extremely low probability of malicious code's concealment without depending on accurate timing information unlike SWATT[1]. We provide this verification method and show the performance estimation in various environments.

7b294612e249ce72d60882292af86f0f4ebc0d64	energy-efficient security protocol for wireless sensor networks using frequency hopping and permutation ciphering		The security aspect of wireless sensor networks has taken the attention of numerous researchers in the past several years. It has recently been proven that public keys are now feasible in wireless sensor networks but still consume a lot of processing time and memory. In this paper we propose the use of public keys based on ECC to exchange symmetric keys that will be used to encrypt critical information. In addition, we propose a time segmentation approach that enables the use of frequency hopping time slotted communications. Nodes secretly exchange frequency hopping sequences that enable them to fight against jamming and eavesdropping.

This improves over previous IBE schemes from lattices, which either have a public key that grows at least linearly with the length of the supported identities, or achieve a non-adaptive notion of security, or require a random oracle. Additionally, our techniques from IBE can be adapted to construct a compact digital signature scheme, which achieves existential unforgeability under the standard Short Integer Solution (SIS) assumption with small polynomial parameters.	digital signature;id-based encryption;integer (computer science);learning with errors;polynomial;public-key cryptography;random oracle	Daniel Christopher Apon;Xiong Fan;Feng-Hao Liu	2016	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	-38.80975254794557	78.08553619850044	47805

It is well-known that such a many-to-one communication is highly vulnerable to the sinkhole attack, where an intruder attracts surrounding nodes with unfaithful routing information, and then performs selective forwarding or alters the data passing through it. A sinkhole attack forms a serious threat to sensor networks, particularly considering that such networks are often deployed in open areas and of weak computation and battery power. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for detecting the intruder in a sinkhole attack. The algorithm first finds a list of suspected nodes, and then effectively identifies the intruder in the list through a network flow graph. The algorithm is also robust to deal with cooperative malicious nodes that attempt to hide the real intruder. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm through both numerical analysis and simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm. Our results also suggest that its communication and computation overheads are reasonably low for wireless sensor networks.	algorithm;computation;effective method;flow network;intruder detection;numerical analysis;one-to-many (data model);routing;sensor web;simulation	Edith C.-H.

Newer Firewalls now days are providing prevention against such attack traffics. McAfee SecurityCenter Firewall is one of the most popular security software installed on millions of Internet connected computers worldwide. “McAfee claims that if you have installed McAfee SecurityCentre with anti-virus and antispyware and Firewall then you always have the most current security to combat the ever-evolving threats on the Internet for the duration of the subscription”. In this paper, we present our findings regarding the effectiveness of McAfee SecurityCentre software against some of the popular Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) attacks, namely ARP Flood, Ping-flood, ICMP Land, TCP-SYN Flood and UDP Flood attacks on the computer which has McAfee SecurityCentre installed. The McAfee SecurityCentre software has an in built firewall which can be activated to control and filter the Inbound/Outbound traffic. It can also block the Ping Requests in order to stop or subside the Ping based DDoS Attacks. To test the McAfee Security Centre software, we created the corresponding attack traffic in a controlled lab environment. It was found that the McAfee Firewall software itself was incurring DoS (Denial of Service) by completely exhausting the available memory resources of the host computer during its operation to stop the external DDoS Attacks.	arp spoofing;antivirus software;computer;denial-of-service attack;firewall (computing);host (network);inbound marketing;mcafee total protection;ping flood;requests;syn flood;spyware;udp flood attack	Sirisha Surisetty;Sanjeev Kumar	2011	J.

5bd7d5da46148f8808e1687baeec5ba5c4b1a805	blockpgp: a blockchain-based framework for pgp key servers		Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is one of the most prominent cryptographic standards offering end-to-end encryption for email messages and other sensitive information. PGP allows to verify the identity of the correspondent in information exchange as well as the information integrity. PGP implements asymmetric encryption with certificates shared through a network of PGP key servers. Many recent breaches show that certificate infrastructure can be compromised as well as exposed to operational errors. In this paper we propose a new PGP management framework with the key server infrastructure implemented using blockchain technology. Our framework resolves some problems of PGP key servers focusing in particular on fast propagation of certificate revocation among key servers and elimination of man-in-the-middle risk. We also provided user access right control where only the certificate holder can change information related to the certificate. We designed and developed a prototype for key server deployment on permissioned Ethereum blockchain. Permissioned blockchain should allow to control the costs of PGP key server infrastructure maintenance at the present level.		Alexander Yakubov;Wazen M.

Roughly speaking, a KDM secure scheme w.r.t. a function set F provides security even if one encrypts a key dependent message f(sk) for any f ∈ F . We present a construction of an efficient public key encryption scheme which is KDM secure with respect to a large function set F . Our function set is a function computable by a polynomial-size Modular Arithmetic Circuit (MAC); we represent the set as Straight Line Programs computing multi-variable polynomials (an extended scheme includes all rational functions whose denominator and numerator are functions as above). Unlike previous schemes, our scheme is what we call flexible: the size of the ciphertext depends on the degree bound for the polynomials, and beyond this all parameters of the scheme are completely independent of the size of the function or the number of secret keys (users). We note that although KDM security has practical applications, all previous works in the standard model are either inefficient feasibility results when dealing with general circuits function sets, or are for a small set of functions such as linear functions. Efficiency of our scheme is dramatically improved compared to the previous feasibility results.	ciphertext;computable function;encryption;kde display manager;linear function;polynomial;public-key cryptography	Tal Malkin;Isamu Teranishi;Moti Yung	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_28	standard model;rational function;modular arithmetic;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;public-key cryptography;algorithm;algebra	Crypto	-38.69747667440068	77.55862854435121	47990

The authors claim to achieve a fast diffusion in QTL by using a new variant of a generalized Feistel network structure that changes all block messages in one iterative round in contrast to traditional Feistel-type structures changing only half of block messages. In this paper, we evaluate the security claims of the designers and show that their claims are not valid as QTL is vulnerable to the standard statistical attacks on block ciphers.	block cipher;cryptanalysis	Sadegh Sadeghi;Nasour Bagheri;Mohamed Ahmed Abdelraheem	2017	Microprocessors and Microsystems - Embedded Hardware Design	10.1016/j.micpro.2017.05.007	higher-order differential cryptanalysis;quantitative trait locus;theoretical computer science;piling-up lemma;block cipher;differential cryptanalysis;computer science;linear cryptanalysis;cryptanalysis	EDA	-37.81286473395688	79.77148162047153	48022

Additionally, a report from Gartner claims, """"Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns"""". Generally, the research work of big data analytics for cyber security mainly includes building big data systems, designing efficient processing algorithms and exploring specific analysis methods and applications, such as detecting DDoS attacks, identifying malicious URLs, correlating IDS alert incidents and extracting threat intelligence from certain unstructured data. Of all these work, most is the extension of previous methods in the big data context, by employing big data techniques to improve the storage capacity, accelerate the calculation or carry out correlation analysis in a much longer time window. Instead, only a few cares about the real coordination of these multi-source, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose an adaptive analysis framework for correlating different kinds of cyber-security-related data, such as network traffic, alert incidents and external threat intelligence. This framework can help to improve the pertinence of analysis and better discover potential threats."""	algorithm;big data;computer security;data system;denial-of-service attack;information security;malware;mined;multi-source;network traffic control;relevance;sensor	Xiaohui Jin;Baojiang Cui;Jun Yang;Zishuai Cheng	2018	2018 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2018.00134	computer science;cyberspace;information security;big data;computer security;unstructured data;denial-of-service attack	DB	-61.14508165421549	62.80454093544335	48054

Recently, certificateless key agreement CL-KA protocol has drawn much attention because it not only efficiently eliminates the problems of key escrow and certificate management but also is more suitable for universal wireless communication environment. However, it is a challenge to design a CL-KA protocol to meet security and efficiency requirement concurrently. In this paper, we propose a new two-party CL-KA protocol with short message under GDH and GBDH assumption. We also present a full security proof for the proposed protocol in extended Canetti-Krawczyk eCK security model.

fc92a3d4bc27ef30b9073450d52a2521edf5d33d	the best defense strategy against session hijacking using security game in sdn		Session hijacking of controller attack is one of the most common ways of information leakage Software-Defined Networking is facing, which brings a serious threat to cyber security. However, the existing defense technologies mainly focus on how to detect attacks and reduce the attack success rate. The paper proposes a method from another perspective to minimize the cost that the network undertakes and find an optimal defender's strategy when an attack is unavoidable in some case. The main work is as follows. First of all, we models the scenario of attack and defense as a Stackelberg Games, and prove the optimal strategy is equal to the SSE (Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium). Furthermore, we design an algorithm to solve the equilibrium of the game in the case of infinite strategic space. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible, and then the optimal defense strategy we obtained is significantly superior to other general strategies and cut down the total cost of the whole network in practical.	algorithm;computer security;information leakage;session hijacking;software-defined networking;spectral leakage	Zhenping Lu;Fucai Chen;Guozhen Cheng;Shuxin Li	2017	2017 IEEE 19th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 15th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 3rd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)	10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2017.55	real-time computing;session hijacking;control theory;distributed computing;software-defined networking;information leakage;stackelberg competition;total cost;computer science	EDA	-59.83346577910379	70.06945078097107	48256

Such an ABE scheme can eliminate the burden of heavy communication and collaborative computation in the setup phase of multiauthority ABE schemes, thus is considered more preferable. Recently in IEEE Transactions Parallel Distributed Systems, Han et al. proposed an interesting privacy-preserving decentralized key-policy ABE scheme, which was claimed to achieve better privacy for users and to be provably secure in the standard model. However, after carefully revisiting the scheme, we conclude that their scheme cannot resist the collusion attacks, hence fails to meet the basic security definitions of the ABE system.	attribute-based encryption;computation;distributed computing;han unification;privacy;provable security	Aijun Ge;Jiang Zhang;Rui Zhang;Chuangui Ma;Zhenfeng Zhang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2012.328	cryptanalysis;information science;computer science;access control;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;privacy;world wide web;computer security;encryption;attribute-based encryption;polynomial	Security	-41.1849866341709	74.8526792540577	48353

In this paper, we propose a scrambling algorithm that reduces the security vulnerabilities of the WEP. The algorithm randomizes the data and prevents access from unauthorized users by adding some standard randomness to it. This random characteristic is a function of the private attribute shared between transmitter and receiver only. In this approach the randomness is achieved by RC4 algorithm, and the distribution of the randomness is provided with different algorithms to increase the complexity of rectifying the encrypted data and optimize utilization of the randomness. The algorithm is developed with a consideration for the least computational requirements to achieve both power and cost efficiency. The proposed software solution takes the WEP output as input and the original WEP implementation is not touched, thus it is an easy patch for the deployed systems. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

643b138bd3fab7055bfcf2d02c4e5dcd7095c36c	enabling efficient and privacy-preserving health query over outsourced cloud		With the pervasiveness of Body Sensor Network (BSN) and cloud computing, online health query service has attracted considerable attention and become a promising approach to improve our quality of healthcare service. However, it still faces many challenges on privacy of users’ sensitive personal information, confidentiality of health service provider’s diagnosis model, accuracy of the diagnosis result, and efficiency of the query result. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving health query scheme over outsourced cloud named HeOC. In the HeOC scheme, the authenticated users can send the encrypted physiological data to the cloud and query the specific disease level accurately on the encrypted medical data stored in the cloud. To reduce the query latency, we fist design a sensor anomaly detection technique to find the high risk disease according to the user’s sensor information. Then, with the oblivious pseudorandom function protocol, the user queries the diagnosis result accurately. Detailed security analysis shows that the HeOC scheme can achieve the diagnosis without disclosing the privacy of the user’s health information and confidentiality of the health service provider’s diagnosis model. In addition, the extensive experiments with an android app and two python programs demonstrate its efficiency in computations and communications.

Mobile payments should be both secure and convenient for the consumer. The problems of implementing mobile payment systems are manifold. The technical capabilities of mobile devices are – at least today – too limited to allow a simple re-use of existing Internet payment protocols. Moreover, a number of different mobile application environments exist today, which differ from a technical perspective as well as from geographical spread. This makes it extremely difficult to define mobile payment protocols, which can be used on a global basis. Therefore, compromise solutions have to be found and standardized, which offer a reasonable level of security based on the existing functions offered in mobile devices and networks.	electronic billing;interoperability;mobile app;mobile commerce;mobile device;mobile payment;proxy server;redirection (computing);requirement;server (computing)	Konrad S.

a5007474a2f02dc20ce562cebf39168990aace95	detecting failed attacks on human-interactive security protocols		One of the main challenges in pervasive computing is how we can establish secure communication over an untrusted high-bandwidth network without any initial knowledge or a Public Key Infrastructure. An approach studied by a number of researchers is building security though involving humans in a low-bandwidth “empirical” out-of-band channel where the transmitted information is authentic and cannot be faked or modified. A survey of such protocols can be found in [21]. Many protocols discussed there achieve the optimal amount of authentication for a given amount of human work. However it might still be attractive to attack them if a failed attack might be misdiagnosed as a communication failure and therefore remain undetected. In this paper we show how to transform protocols of this type to make such misdiagnosis essentially impossible.	authentication;bluetooth;commit (data management);cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher;error-tolerant design;multiplication algorithm;out-of-band agreement;public key infrastructure;secure communication;string (computer science);trust (emotion);ubiquitous computing;xml	A.

By collectingtiming information on thenetwork, Herbivorecanspeedup exhausti ve searchfor passwordsby a factorof 50. We alsopropose somecountermeasures. In generalour resultsapply not only to SSH, but also to a generalclassof protocolsfor encryptinginteracti ve traffic. We show that timing leaksopena new set of security risks, and hencecautionmust be taken when designingthis typeof protocol. This researchwassupportedin partby theDefenseAdvancedResearchProjectsAgency underDARPA contractN6601-99-28913(under supervisionof the SpaceandNaval WarfareSystemsCenterSan Diego) and by the National SciencefoundationundergrantsFD9979852andCCR-0093337. 1 Intr oduction Justa few yearsago,peoplecommonlyusedastonishingly insecurenetworking applicationssuch as telnet, rlogin, or ftp, which simply passall confidential information, including users’passwords, in the clear over the network. This situationwas aggravated throughbroadcast-based networks thatwerecommonly used(e.g.,Ethernet)which alloweda malicioususerto eavesdropon the network and to collect all communicatedinformation[CB94, GS96]. Fortunately, many usersandsystemadministratorshave becomeaware of this issue and have taken counter measures.To curb eavesdroppers, securityresearchers designedthe SecureShell (SSH), which offers an encryptedchannelbetweenthe two hostsand strongauthenticationof boththeremotehostandtheuser[Yl ö96, SSL01, YKS 00b]. Today, SSH is quitepopular, andit haslargely replacedtelnet andrlogin. Many usersbelieve that they aresecureagainsteavesdroppersif they useSSH. Unfortunately, in this paper we show that despitestate-of-the-artencryptiontechniquesandadvancedpassword authenticationprotocols [YKS 00a], SSH connectionscanstill leak significant information about sensiti ve data such as users’ passwords. This problemis particularlyseriousbecauseit meansusersmay have a false confidenceof security whenthey useSSH. In particularweidentify thattwoseeminglyminorweaknessesof SSH leadto serioussecurityrisks. First, the transmittedpackets are paddedonly to an eight-byte boundary(if a block cipher is in use). Thereforean eavesdroppercaneasilylearntheapproximatelengthof the original data. Second,in interacti ve mode, every individual keystroke that a usertypesis sentto the remote machinein a separateIP packet immediatelyafter the key is pressed(exceptfor somemetakeys such Shift or Ctrl). We show in thepaperthat this propertycanenabletheeavesdropper to learntheexactlength of users’passwords.More importantly, aswehaveverified,thetimeit takestheoperatingsystemto sendoutthe packet after the key pressis in generalnegligible comparing to the inter-keystroke timing. Hencean eavesdroppercanlearnthepreciseinter-keystroke timingsof users’typing from thearrival timesof packets. Experienceshows thatusers’typing follows stablepatterns1. Many researchershave proposedto usethe duration of key strokesandlatenciesbetweenkey strokes asa biometricfor userauthentication[GLPS80, UW85, LW88, LWU89, JG90, BSH90, MR97, RLCM98, MRW99]. A morechallengingquestionwhich hasnot yet beenaddressedin the literatureis whetherwe can usetiming informationaboutkey strokesto infer thekey sequences beingtyped.If wecan,canweestimatequantitatively how many bits of informationarerevealedby the timing information? Experienceseemsto indicate that the timing informationof keystrokesrevealssome informationaboutthe key sequencesbeing typed. For example,wemighthaveall experiencedthattheelapsed time betweentyping the two letters“er” can be much smallerthanbetweentyping “qz”. This observation is particularly relevant to security. Sinceaswe show the attackercangetpreciseinter-keystroketimingsof users’ typing in a SSH sessionby recordingthepacket arrival times,if theattacker caninfer whatuserstypefrom the inter-keystroke timings, thenhe could learnwhat users typein aSSH sessionfrom thepacket arrival times. In this paperwe study users’keyboarddynamicsand show thatthetiming informationof keystrokesdoesleak information about the key sequencestyped.

One of the most promising solutions is the generation of biometric-based cryptographic keys that can be used for authentication, encryption, and biometric template protection. Multiple important challenges are faced when dealing with such applications is the invariance of cryptographic keys to the modifications that occur in the biometric features. Fuzzy extractors have been proposed in the literature as efficient tools that cope with this issue by processing the noisy biometric data in order to produce a random cipher key. In this paper, we extend this concept through the introduction of a new construction scheme that relies on the use of chaotic maps in order to enhance the sensitivity of the key generation process to the biometric input. Throughout analytical and experimental performance evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing solutions especially in terms of entropy loss.	authentication;biometrics;cipher;cryptography;data protection directive;encryption software;information theory;key (cryptography);key generation;list of chaotic maps;map;performance evaluation;platform as a service	Ihsen Nakouri;Mohamed Hamdi;Tai-Hoon Kim	2016	2016 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)	10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568377	computer science;theoretical computer science;internet privacy;computer security	EDA	-37.68946062736562	69.94800162507117	48715

Unlike traditional hash comparison methods, an audit takes into account all of the files in the target directory and their relative paths. Not taking these data into account can impair examinations and tool certifications. An audit examines each file in the target directory, computes its hash, and compares it to a file containing the known hash values. Any file not in the set of known hashes is flagged as being inserted. When all of the files in the target directory have been examined, any known hashes that have not been matched are flagged as being missing. The result is a complete picture comparing the set of known hashes and the target directory.	jurassic park	Jesse D. Kornblum	2008	J.

The encryption used in the scheme is a combination of Boneh-Boyen identity-based encryption and a variation of HohenbergerWaters signature. The OT scheme is somewhat inefficient because it combines the two underlying schemes in a very simple way without making any optimizations. In this paper, we present a review on the Green-Hohenberger OT scheme and put forth a concrete improvement. We also show its security under 3DDH assumption. We think the optimizing skills developed in the paper are helpful for designing and analyzing other cryptographic schemes.	bilinear filtering;computational diffie–hellman assumption;cryptography;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;id-based encryption;oblivious transfer;simulation;synchronous optical networking	Zhengjun Cao;Lihua Liu	2015	I.

ecc69662e37e7a84973eb3f4973b3924ed1e93a8	security in mobile wireless sensor networks: attacks and defenses		In recent years wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are fast emerging as an important domain for both commercial and personal use. The advancement in robotics has enabled exploring another domain in WSNs i.e., mobile WSNs (MWSNs). A MWSN consists of a collection of nodes that can move on their own and interact with the physical environment. Several applications demand the need for mobility in nodes which, in general are static. Due to the nature of deployment of the nodes coupled with their resource constraints, providing security to such MWSNs have gained a prime importance. Also, they can be deployed in physically inaccessible environment as well as critical areas, and therefore the need to make them secure is very important. Mobility of nodes in MWSNs makes them more vulnerable to attacks by adversaries. Many works have been conducted in recent past where various promising solutions have been provided for detecting the attack, diagnosing the adversary nodes, and nullifying their capabilities for further damage in MWSNs. To start with, this chapter presents the need for MWSNs followed by security objectives, key issues and inherent challenges faced by these networks. Existing works dealing with basic security features and the different attacks faced by MWSNs are discussed. Finally, we give an insight into the possible directions for future work in securing MWSNs.

Yet, addressing network abnormalities and threats should not be done at the expense of users' privacy. In this study we illustrate the use of SKETURE, a packet analysis tool leveraging a sketch-based architecture, in summarizing the behavior of nodes in a real campus network for a whole month, without breaching users' privacy.

Constructions of identifications and signatures motivated by several existing CDR-based bandwidth-efficient encryption schemes are presented. Their securities are proven equivalent to famous hard problems, in the random oracle model. Motivated by Cocks[12], we construct an identity-based encryption from CDR. Its security is proven equivalent to a new problem, the JSR (Jacobi Symbol of Roots of two quadratic polynomials) Problem. We prove JSR is at least as hard as QRP (Quadratic Residuosity Problem). Furthermore, we present the first two-way equivalence reduction of the security of Cocks’ IBE, to the JSR Problem.	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;blind signature;computer security model;cryptanalysis;digital signature;id-based cryptography;id-based encryption;jacobi method;java community process;polynomial;qrpedia;quadratic residuosity problem;random oracle;ring signature;roots;turing completeness	Man Ho Au;Victor K.-W.

These incidents prevent service providers from constructing secure networking environments. To protect websites from attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, service providers use web application firewalls (WAFs). WAFs filter accesses from attackers by using signatures, which are generated based on the exploit codes of previous attacks. However, WAFs cannot filter unknown attacks because the signatures cannot reflect new types of attacks. In service provider environments, the number of exploit codes has recently increased rapidly because of the spread of vulnerable web applications that have been developed through cloud computing. Thus, generating signatures for all exploit codes is difficult. To solve these problems, our proposed scheme detects and filters malware downloads that are sent from websites which have already received exploit codes. In addition, to collect information for detecting malware downloads, web honeypots, which automatically extract the communication records of exploit codes, are used. According to the results of experiments using a prototype, our scheme can filter attacks automatically so that service providers can provide secure and cost-effective network environments.	malware	Takeshi Yagi;Naoto Tanimoto;Takeo Hariu;Mitsutaka Itoh	2010	IEICE Transactions		service provider;cost-effectiveness analysis;cloud computing;application service provider;vulnerability;computer science;information security;operating system;malware;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	OS	-57.17874452429433	64.13553129852228	49004

ef13f55fb482ecd0da5b883c1899ce3b4c1e9b4e	co-check: collaborative outsourced data auditing in multicloud environment		With the increasing demand for ubiquitous connectivity, wireless technology has significantly improved our daily lives. Meanwhile, together with cloud-computing technology (e.g., cloud storage services and big data processing), new wireless networking technology becomes the foundation infrastructure of emerging communication networks. Particularly, cloud storage has been widely used in services, such as data outsourcing and resource sharing, among the heterogeneous wireless environments because of its convenience, low cost, and flexibility. However, users/clients lose the physical control of their data after outsourcing. Consequently, ensuring the integrity of the outsourced data becomes an important security requirement of cloud storage applications. In this paper, we present Co-Check, a collaborative multicloud data integrity audition scheme, which is based on BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signature and homomorphic tags. According to the proposed scheme, clients can audit their outsourced data in a one-round challenge-response interaction with low performance overhead. Our scheme also supports dynamic data maintenance. The theoretical analysis and experiment results illustrate that our scheme is provably secure and efficient.	multicloud	Jian Mao;Wenqian Tian;Yan Zhang;Jian Cui;Hanjun Ma;Jingdong Bian;Jianwei Liu;Jianhong Zhang	2017	Security and Communication Networks	10.1155/2017/2948025	computer science;wireless network;computer security;computer network;cloud storage;big data;shared resource;data integrity;dynamic data;outsourcing;audit	DB	-43.04914285018394	66.77276362382692	49281

These models may be used for a multitude of tasks including forensic analyses and detection tasks of value to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, as well for as other typical tasks such as virus and spam detection. To demonstrate the power of the methods, we focus on the application of these models to detect the early onset of a viral propagation without “content-base ” (or signature-based) analysis in common use in virus scanners. We present several experiments using real email from 15 users with injected simulated viral emails and describe how the combination of different behavior models improves overall detection rates. The performance results vary depending upon parameter settings, approaching 99 % true positive (TP) (percentage of viral emails caught) in general cases and with 0.38 % false positive (FP) (percentage of emails with attachments that are mislabeled as viral). The models used for this study are based upon volume and velocity statistics of a user's email rate and an analysis of the user's (social) cliques revealed in the person's email behavior. We show by way of simulation that virus propagations are detectable since viruses may emit emails at rates different than human behavior suggests is normal, and email is directed to groups of recipients in ways that violate the users' typical communications with their social groups.	anti-spam techniques;antivirus software;attachments;computer virus;data mining;email;experiment;onset (audio);simulation;software propagation;velocity (software development)	Salvatore J.

In the proposed algorithm, each meter is identified with a unique binary-coded number. The BCGI algorithm can locate the unique malicious meter (if any) by one inspection step under the assumption that at most one meter becomes malicious in one reporting period. Furthermore, by controlling the reporting periods of meters, we could make the probability of the event that at most one meter becomes malicious in one reporting period arbitrarily close to 1 under some assumptions. We further extend the algorithm into a Generalized BCGI algorithm (G-BCGI) to deal with the case that there are two or more meters which happen to commit the theft of electricity in one reporting period. Simulation results demonstrate the inspection efficiency of the BCGI and G-BCGI algorithms.	algorithm;image scanner;malware;simulation;xslt/muenchian grouping	Xiaofang Xia;Wei Liang;Yang Xiao;Meng Zheng	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7249480	embedded system;data mining;computer security	Robotics	-55.600955127495844	76.62234658045158	49294

We introduce depender graphs, a new class of graphs that support efficient and fault-tolerant revocation. Nodes of a depender graph are participants that agree to forward revocation information to other participants. Our depender graphs are k-redundant, so that revocations are provably guaranteed to be received by all non-failed participants even if up to k1 participants have failed. We present a protocol for constructing k-redundant depender graphs that has two desirable properties. First, it is load-balanced, in that no participant need have too many dependers.

Trust is based on the first visual contact between users. Our proposal is a complete self-configured secure protocol that is able to create the network and share secure services without any infrastructure. The network allows sharing resources and offering new services among users in a secure environment. The protocol includes all functions needed to operate without any external support. We have designed and developed it in devices with limited resources. Network creation stages are detailed and the communication, protocol messages, and network management are explained. Our proposal has been implemented in order to test the protocol procedure and performance. Finally, we compare the protocol with other spontaneous ad hoc network protocols in order to highlight its features and we provide a security analysis of the system.	communications protocol;encryption;hoc (programming language);intrusion detection system;mind;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;secure communication;secure environment;social network;spontaneous order;usability;volatile memory	Raquel Lacuesta Gilaberte;Jaime Lloret Mauri;Miguel Garcia;Lourdes Peñalver Herrero	2013	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2012.168	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;otway–rees protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;universal composability;mobile ad hoc network;resource reservation protocol;internet protocol control protocol;dynamic circuit network;computer science;cryptography;link control protocol;ad hoc wireless distribution service;tunneling protocol;wide mouth frog protocol;authentication;distributed computing;order one network protocol;internet protocol suite;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.03402357285215	72.61574266016396	49465

To this end, user data is encrypted on the client and the server is used only as a backup data store. Authorized users may access their data through client-side software, but for ease of use, many commercial applications also offer browser-based interfaces that enable features such as remote access, form-filling, and secure sharing. We describe a series of web-based attacks on popular host-proof applications that completely circumvent their cryptographic protections. Our attacks exploit standard web application vulnerabilities to expose flaws in the encryption mechanisms, authorization policies, and key management implemented by these applications. Our analysis suggests that host-proofing by itself is not enough to protect users from web attackers, who will simply shift their focus to flaws in client-side interfaces. 1 Host-Proof Web Applications The remarkable increase in website attacks in recent years and the consequent loss of sensitive user data has motivated a security-focused redesign of web applications where data is now routinely stored in encrypted form on web servers and only decrypted when needed. This architecture protects users from malicious hackers who may steal a database from the server but will not be able to decrypt it. However, it does not prevent data theft by disgruntled employees, who may have access to the decryption keys. Moreover, since the server application has access to decrypted data and is itself accessible over the web, any vulnerability in its code risks leaking user data to a web-based attacker through standard attacks like cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Server-side encryption may be adequate for casual websites, but users of cloud-based storage and privacyFigure 1: Host-proof web application architecture sensitive applications such as password managers demand stronger security guarantees. For example, when the storage service Dropbox [5] revealed that some of its employees could read user files, it was widely criticized for violating user privacy [15]. Conversely, when the password manager LastPass [7] announced that its servers may have been compromised [16], public reaction was mitigated because of the host-proof [6] design that LastPass implements against this class of attacks. A host-proof web application follows the architecture depicted in Figure 1. Personal data is encrypted on the client using a key or passphrase known by the user, while the web server only acts as an encrypted data store. The full functionality of the application is implemented in the client-side app, which performs all encryptions and decryptions, backs up the database to the server and, only when the user authorizes it, shares decrypted data with other users or websites. Since the server never sees unencrypted data (nor any decryption key, ideally), even if an attacker steals the database from the server, he cannot recover the plaintext without substantial computational effort to brute-force through every user’s decryption key.	applications architecture;authorization;backup;client-side;cloud computing;cross-site request forgery;cross-site scripting;cryptography;data store;data theft;dropbox;encryption;key (cryptography);key management;lastpass;malware;passphrase;password manager;plaintext;server (computing);server-side;usability;web application;web server;wuala	Karthikeyan Bhargavan;Antoine Delignat-Lavaud	2012			web service;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-52.53153801214604	61.488643613827755	49482

We present an efficient method to select CRT-RSA parameters in such a manner so that the decryption becomes faster for small encryption exponents. This is the most frequently used situation for application of RSA in commercial domain. Our idea is to choose e and the factors (with low Hamming weight) of dp, dq first and then applying the extended Euclidean algorithm, we obtain p, q of same bit size. For small e, we get an asymptotic reduction of the order of ${{1}\over{3}}$ in the decryption time compared to standard CRT-RSA parameters for large N=pq. In case of practical parameters, with 1024 bits N and e=216+1, we achieve a reduction of more than 27%. Extensive security analysis is presented for our selected parameters and benchmark examples are also provided.	cathode ray tube;encryption	Subhamoy Maitra;Santanu Sarkar	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-11925-5_3	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Crypto	-38.376342395984956	79.18407093685634	49607
963db16715191afad7305384153ccfdac6df5a0b	ctc2 and fast algebraic attacks on block ciphers revisited		The cipher CTC (Courtois Toy Cipher) described in [4] has been designed to demonstrate that it is possible to break on a PC a block cipher with good diffusion and very small number of known (or chosen) plaintexts. It has however never been designed to withstand all known attacks on block ciphers and Dunkelman and Keller have shown [13] that a few bits of the key can be recovered by Linear Cryptanalysis (LC) – which cannot however compromise the security of a large key. This weakness can easily be avoided: in this paper we give a specification of CTC2, a tweaked version of CTC. The new cipher is MUCH more secure than CTC against LC and the key scheduling of CTC has been extended to use any key size, independently from the block size. Otherwise, there is little difference between CTC and CTC2. We will show that up to 10 rounds of CTC2 can be broken by simple algebraic attacks.	block cipher;block size (cryptography);key schedule;key size;linear cryptanalysis;scheduling (computing)	Nicolas Courtois	2007	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		algebraic number;cipher;world wide web;block size;theoretical computer science;block cipher;small number;key size;linear cryptanalysis;computer science;compromise	Crypto	-37.536754612988574	79.67678677339485	49638

Our first construction is based on the Diffie–Hellman-type assumptions, and compared with the KEM by Shoup at EUROCRYPT’00 that has security reductions in two security models (but its security proof in the random model is a loose reduction), our proposed KEM has a smaller ciphertext size with the same computational costs, and more importantly, ours has a tight security reduction also in the random oracle model. Our second construction is based on assumptions related to integer factoring, and compared with the KEM by Hofheinz and Kiltz at CRYPTO’09 that also has tight security reductions in two security models to factoring-related assumptions, our proposed KEM has similar efficiency (both ciphertext size and computational costs) and bases the security on incomparable assumptions.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving aggregation scheme that permits the smart appliances to aggregate their readings without involving the smart meter. The scheme deploys a lightweight lattice-based homomorphic cryptosystem that depends on simple addition and multiplication operations. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees the customers' privacy and message integrity with lightweight overhead.	aggregate data;computation;cryptosystem;homomorphic encryption;information security;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;privacy;smart meter	Asmaa R.

It is necessary to provide security services to these networks to ensure their survival. Providing security for WSN presents unique challenges. Existing key management are more appropriate for short -lifetime WSNs rather than longlived WSNs. We propose a novel, self-organizing key management scheme for large-scale and long-lived WSNs, called lightweight key administration layer (LIKAL). LIKAL provides administrative services that ensures the survivability of the network. Analytical and simulation results show that LIKAL is robust against the attacks and efficient with low communication and storage overhead on the sensor nodes.	depletion region;key (cryptography);key management;organizing (structure);overhead (computing);self-organization;sensor;simulation	Xizheng Zhang	2007	Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)	10.1109/SNPD.2007.549	clock synchronization;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;self-clocking signal;distributed computing;timing failure;clock drift;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;data synchronization;digital clock manager;computer network	Mobile	-50.468489020422275	77.44496436678817	49744

Recommender systems have become an integral part of many social networks and extract knowledge from a user’s personal and sensitive data both explicitly, with the user’s knowledge, and implicitly. This trend has created major privacy concerns as users are mostly unaware of what data and how much data is being used and how securely it is used. In this context, several works have been done to address privacy concerns for usage in online social network data and by recommender systems. This paper surveys the main privacy concerns, measurements and privacy-preserving techniques used in large-scale online social networks and recommender systems. It is based on historical works on security, privacy-preserving, statistical modeling, and datasets to provide an overview of the technical difficulties and problems associated with privacy preserving in online social networks.	computer security;evolutionary taxonomy;floor and ceiling functions;privacy;recommender system;social network;statistical model	Erfan Aghasian;Saurabh Garg;James Montgomery	2018	CoRR		data mining;computer security;recommender system;social network;computer science;statistical model	Security	-41.27005684171364	62.54186186402245	49760

Today researchers and renowned companies have proposed the use of this technology in other areas such as voting, identity management, smart city, and others. Regarding smart city, car navigation systems is one of the main research directions that aims to streamline traffic and calculate travel routes. Existing applications such as Google Traffic or Waze are often used, but for users worried about their personal data, these systems are something of a black box. Using blockchain technology, in this paper we describe the architecture of a car navigation system in which personal data protection is a major concern.

In this paper, we use the concept of proxy key to design a more secure and more efficient UMTS AKA protocol. Our protocol not only resists above-mentioned drawback of the original UMTS AKA protocol on the security, but also can improve the performance of UMTS AKA protocol, including the computational overhead, storage overhead, and communication overhead.	algorithm;authentication and key agreement (protocol);communications protocol;compaq lte;continuation;cryptography;distortion;encryption;key-agreement protocol;mobile phone;mutual authentication;overhead (computing);software bug	Hsia-Hung Ou;Iuon-Chang Lin;Min-Shiang Hwang	2012	IJMC	10.1504/IJMC.2012.048139	mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;information security;operating system;authentication;computer security;aka;computer network	Security	-46.16315507802392	73.91232847138907	49951

In PHR systems, patient’s health records and information are maintained by the patient himself through the Web. In reality, PHRs are often outsourced to be stored at the third parties like cloud service providers. However, there have been serious privacy concerns about cloud service as it may expose user’s sensitive data like PHRs to those cloud service providers or unauthorized users. Using attribute-based encryption (ABE) to encrypt patient’s PHRs in cloud environment, secure and flexible access control can be achieved. Yet, problems like scalability in key management, fine-grained access control, and efficient user revocation remain to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving PHR, which supports fine-grained access control and efficient revocation. To be specific, our scheme achieves the goals (1) scalable and fine-grained access control for PHRs by using multi-authority ABE scheme, and (2) efficient on-demand user/attribute revocation and dynamic policy update. In our scheme, we consider the situation that multiple data owners exist, and patient’s PHRs are encrypted and stored in semi-trust servers. The access structure in our scheme is expressive access tree structure, and the security of our scheme can be reduced to the standard decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption.	access control;access structure;attribute-based encryption;authorization;bilinear filtering;ciphertext;cloud computing;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;group identifier;information exchange;key management;lazy evaluation;overhead (computing);privacy;scalability;semiconductor industry;tree structure;world wide web	Huiling Qian;Jiguo Li;Yichen Zhang;Jinguang Han	2014	International Journal of Information Security	10.1007/s10207-014-0270-9	cloud computing;information privacy;computer science;database;internet privacy;computer security;attribute-based encryption	Security	-42.342683055109894	66.41008415274986	49957

Voting is implemented by exchanging messages with a fusion center or just between the participants. However, the communication and delay overheads of message-based voting can be prohibitive when voting is frequent. Additional overheads are incurred if voter authentication and vote integrity verification are required. In this paper, we propose a fast PHY-layer voting scheme called PHYVOS, which significantly reduces the voting overhead. In PHYVOS, wireless devices transmit their votes to a fusion center simultaneously, by exploiting the subcarrier orthogonality in OFDM and without explicit messaging. We show that PHYVOS is secure against attackers that attempt to manipulate the voting outcome. Security is achieved without employing cryptography-based authentication and message integrity schemes. We analytically evaluate the voting robustness as a function of PHY-layer parameters. We further discuss practical implementation challenges of PHYVOS related to multi-device frequency and time synchronization. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of PHYVOS on the USRP platform.	authentication;cryptography;fault tolerance;information security;message passing;overhead (computing);phy (chip);prototype;subcarrier;universal software radio peripheral	Bocan Hu;Yan Zhang;Loukas Lazos	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2015.7346834	casting;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;information security;computer security;robustness;computer network	Mobile	-51.147857559624704	74.94030403384691	50170

A new industry initiative, the 4C Entity, LLC (founded by IBM, Intel, Matsushita and Toshiba), presents a more mature approach, called """"Copy Protection for Prerecorded Media"""" (CPPM), which has already been adopted in DVD-Audio.A key-feature of CPPM is its advanced key-management, which allows for system renewability by revoking compromised devices. Renewability means that content provider can encrypt the content, such that compromised devices cannot decrypt it, whereas non-compromised devices still can.In this paper, we review the basic concepts of CPPM and propose a framework to study its cryptographic strengths based on the published specifications. We will focus our assessment especially on CPPM's key-management scheme, which, unfortunately, is not completely specified in the official publicly available specification. As a consequence, it is currently unknown, how the 4C Entity selects the device keys that are assigned to devices.

We show on an example how these basic specications may be combined in order to write abstract specications of cryptographic protocols and to verify their security. 1 Introduction Security evaluation criteria recommend that developers produce mathematical models of their systems and use these models in order to prove the security of their product. But developers are often reluctant to use formal methods because they have no evidence that this would actually increase the security of their products. They often consider that using mathematical notations produces very complex descriptions of real systems from which security proofs are very di-cult to obtain. Moreover, in general, formal methods cannot easily be integrated in usual development practices. This leads to the undesirable situation where the formal modeling work is treated separately from the development. Formal methods when used to study functional cor-rectness seem to have reached a higher level of maturity. This might help to change the relunctance to use formal methods. These methods are able to treat (to give a formal counterpart to) structuration concepts used to simplify the development of software as layer, service, module, interface. Furthermore, these methods are supported by tools that assist the user during the writing of specications and during the proofs. In this paper, we would like to show that it is possible to verify some aspects of security using available and general purpose technology. We were more particularly interested in the verication of the security of cryptographic protocols. We used, for that purpose , a formal software developement method called B [1].

In particular, we focus on the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication Protocol, TESLA. This protocol differs from the standard class of authentication protocols previously analysed using model checking techniques in the following interesting way: an unbounded stream of messages is broadcast by a sender, making use of an unbounded stream of keys; the authentication of the n-th message in the stream is achieved on receipt of the n + 1-th message. We show that, despite the infinite nature of the protocol, it is possible to build a finite model that correctly captures its behaviour.	authentication protocol;model checking	Philippa J.

A doi:10.1016/j.comcom.2011.09.003 ⇑ Corresponding author. Tel.: +86 10 62283240. E-mail address: liwenmin02@hotmail.com (W. Li). Value-added applications in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) come with the emergence of electronic trading. The restricted connectivity scenario in VANET, where the vehicle cannot communicate directly with the bank for authentication due to the lack of internet access, opens up new security challenges. Hence a secure payment protocol, which meets the additional requirements associated with VANET, is a must. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure payment protocol that aims at the restricted connectivity scenario in VANET. The protocol applies self-certified key agreement to establish symmetric keys, which can be integrated with the payment phase. Thus both the computational cost and communication cost can be reduced. Moreover, the protocol can achieve fair exchange, user anonymity and payment security. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

9ee19ae88b4fcd5675c6b6dab7f97556a077b4bd	unauthorized access point detection using machine learning algorithms for information protection		With the frequent use of Wi-Fi and hotspots that provide a wireless Internet environment, awareness and threats to wireless AP (Access Point) security are steadily increasing. Especially when using unauthorized APs in company, government and military facilities, there is a high possibility of being subjected to various viruses and hacking attacks. It is necessary to detect unauthorized Aps for protection of information. In this paper, we use RTT (Round Trip Time) value data set to detect authorized and unauthorized APs in wired / wireless integrated environment, analyze them using machine learning algorithms including SVM (Support Vector Machine), C4.5, KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). Overall, KNN shows the highest accuracy.	authorization;c4.5 algorithm;comparison of command shells;computer virus;hotspot (wi-fi);k-nearest neighbors algorithm;machine learning;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;support vector machine;wireless access point	Doyeon Kim;Dongil Shin;Dongkyoo Shin	2018	2018 17th IEEE International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications/ 12th IEEE International Conference On Big Data Science And Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE)	10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00284	hacker;computer network;support vector machine;computer security;wireless;the internet;algorithm;machine learning;information protection policy;computer science;multilayer perceptron;artificial intelligence;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;government	DB	-61.15518758545652	67.65550002651382	50407

This is the case especially if the data are confidential and access to the gateway server has to be strictly controlled, although there are several protocols and mechanisms that have been thoroughly scrutinized to tackle these problems.

Since personal data may be privacy-sensitive, the aggregator should only gain desired statistics without learning anything about the personal data. To guarantee differential privacy of personal data under an untrusted aggregator, existing approaches encrypt the noisy personal data, and allow the aggregator to get a noisy sum. However, these approaches suffer from either high computation overhead, or lack of efficient group management to support dynamic joins and leaves, or node failures. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving aggregation scheme to address these issues in participatory sensing applications. In our scheme, we first design an efficient group management protocol to deal with participants' dynamic joins and leaves. Specifically, when a participant joins or leaves, only three participants need to update their encryption keys. Moreover, we leverage the future ciphertext buffering mechanism to deal with node failures, which is combined with the group management protocol making low communication overhead. The analysis indicates that our scheme achieves desired properties, and the performance evaluation demonstrates the scheme's efficiency in terms of communication and computation overhead.	aggregate data;ciphertext;computation;differential privacy;encryption;internet privacy;overhead (computing);participatory sensing;performance evaluation;personally identifiable information	Jianwei Chen;Huadong Ma	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037225	fault tolerance;computer science;sensor;noise measurement;noise;distributed computing;internet privacy;privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-38.52007585289995	64.79710932523811	50547
70214cf149a4426356bcdba71b2da057750776fa	a storage-efficient and robust private information retrieval scheme allowing few servers		Since the concept of locally decodable codes was introduced by Katz and Trevisan in 2000 [11], it is well-known that information theoretically secure private information retrieval schemes can be built using locally decodable codes [15]. In this paper, we construct a Byzantine robust PIR scheme using the multiplicity codes introduced by Kopparty et al. [12]. Our main contributions are on the one hand to avoid full replication of the database on each server; this significantly reduces the global redundancy. On the other hand, to have a much lower locality in the PIR context than in the LDC context. This shows that there exists two different notions: LDC-locality and PIR-locality. This is made possible by exploiting geometric properties of multiplicity codes.	byzantine fault tolerance;global serializability;linguistic data consortium;locality of reference;locally decodable code;personally identifiable information;private information retrieval;server (computing)	Daniel Augot;Françoise Levy-dit-Vehel;Abdullatif Shikfa	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12280-9_15	discrete mathematics;theoretical computer science;locally decodable code;mathematics;distributed computing;computer security	Theory	-38.849575650450525	69.81897910911067	50627
6edb10ff7db1e1d1d73fb8b98fe3546600474ee8	when seeing isn't believing: on feasibility and detectability of scapegoating in network tomography		Network tomography is a vital tool to estimate link qualities from end-to-end network measurements. An implicit assumption in network tomography is that observed measurements indeed reflect the aggregate of link performance (i.e., seeing is believing). However, it is not guaranteed today that there exists no anomaly (e.g., malicious autonomous systems and insider threats) in large-scale networks. Malicious nodes can intentionally manipulate link metrics via delaying or dropping packets to affect measurements. Will such an assumption render a vulnerability when facing attackers? The problem is of essential importance in that network tomography is developed towards effective network diagnostics and failure recovery. In this paper, we demonstrate that the vulnerability is real and propose a new attack strategy, called scapegoating, in which malicious nodes can substantially damage a network (e.g., delaying packets) and at the same time maliciously manipulate end-to-end measurement results such that a legitimate node is misleadingly identified as the root cause of the damage (thereby becoming a scapegoat) under network tomography. We formulate three basic scapegoating approaches and show under what conditions attacks can be successful. We also reveal conditions to detect such attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show that simply trusting measurements leads to scapegoating vulnerabilities. Thus, existing methods should be revisited accordingly for security in various applications.	aggregate data;anomaly detection;autonomous system (internet);end-to-end principle;ibm notes;insider threat;lu decomposition;list of code lyoko episodes;malware;rendering (computer graphics);tomography;trust (emotion);vulnerability (computing)	Shangqing Zhao;Zhuo Lu;Cliff Wang	2017	2017 IEEE 37th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	10.1109/ICDCS.2017.23	distributed computing;computer network;computer science;insider;scapegoating;root cause;autonomous system (internet);vulnerability;network packet;network tomography	Metrics	-58.55389276245809	69.57245002791274	50735

In 2008, the headquarters of Kyushu University had defined medium-range policy of ICT infrastructure preparation, and the policy had indicated construction of a central authentication system. According to the policy, the authors elaborated an installation plan of the Kyu(Q)shu University authentication system (QUAS, for short). Since 2009, Information Infrastructure Initiative of Kyushu University, to which the authors belong, has been issuing ID cards to all employees, and also operating LDAP servers. This paper introduces the action plan and outline of QUAS. This paper also describes two recent topics of QUAS. One is high load of LDAP servers because of rapid increase of mobile devices, and the other one is development of a multifactor authentication Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP).	itil;identity provider;lightweight directory access protocol;mobile device;multi-factor authentication;shibboleth	Eisuke Ito;Yoshiaki Kasahara;Naomi Fujimura	2013		10.1145/2504776.2504788	engineering;database;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-46.415788544637834	64.03445231900356	50740

In most existing routing protocols, the participation of nodes in the routing process is taken as granted. However, in reality, nodes can be unwilling to participate. We first show in this paper the impact of the unwillingness of nodes to participate in existing routing protocols through a set of experiments. Results show that in the presence of even a small proportion of nodes that do not forward messages, performance is heavily degraded. We then analyze two major reasons of the unwillingness of nodes to participate, i.e., their rational behavior (also called selfishness) and their wariness of disclosing private mobility information. Our main contribution in this paper is to survey the existing related research works that overcome these two issues. We provide a classification of the existing approaches for protocols that deal with selfish behavior. We then conduct experiments to compare the performance of these strategies for preventing different types of selfish behavior. For protocols that preserve the privacy of users, we classify the existing approaches and provide an analytical comparison of their security guarantees.	delay-tolerant networking;experiment;routing	Jingwei Miao;Omar Hasan;Sonia Ben Mokhtar;Lionel Brunie;Kangbin Yim	2013	Int J.

Security of HWSNET becomes a very important issue with the rapid development of HWSNET. Intrusion detection system is one of the major and efficient defensive methods against attacks in HWSNET. Because of different constraints of sensor networks, security solutions have to be designed with limited usage of computation and resources. A particularly devastating attack is the sleep deprivation attack. Here a malicious node forces legitimate nodes to waste their energy by resisting the sensor nodes from going into low power sleep mode. The target of this attack is to maximize the power consumption of the affected node, thereby decreasing its battery life. Existing works on sleep deprivation attack have mainly focused on mitigation using MAC based protocols, such as S-MAC (sensor MAC), T-MAC (timeout MAC), B-MAC (Berkley MAC), G-MAC ( gateway MAC). In this article, a brief review of some of the recent intrusion detection systems in wireless sensor network environment is presented. Finally, a framework of cluster based layered countermeasure for Insomnia Detection has been proposed for heterogeneous wireless sensor network (HWSNET) to efficiently detect sleep deprivation attack. Simulation results on MATLAB exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.	b-mac;computation;hierarchical database model;intrusion detection system;matlab;malware;real life;sensor;simulation;sleep mode;tree (data structure)	Tapalina Bhattasali;Rituparna Chaki	2011	CoRR	10.5121/ijassn.2011.1202	intrusion detection system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;computer security;hierarchical database model;computer network	Mobile	-52.81153176668058	75.09537586700536	50812

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius’ goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one’s privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.	database;differential privacy;semantic security	Cynthia Dwork	2006		10.1007/11787006_1	privacy software;computer science;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-38.67220001908271	63.425489182791054	50864

We investigated the security of WSNs in an environmental monitoring application with the goal to demonstrate the overall security. We implemented a Secure Temperature Monitoring System (STMS), which served as our WSN application. Our results revealed a security flaw found in the bootstrap loader (BSL) password used to protect MSP430 micro-controller units (MCUs). We demonstrated how the BSL password could be brute forced in a matter of days. Furthermore, we illustrate how an attacker can reverse engineer WSN applications to obtain critical security information such as encryption keys. We contribute a solution to patch the weak BSL password security flaw and improve the security of MSP430 MCU chips. The Secure-BSL patch we contribute allows the randomization of the BSL password. Our solution increases the brute force time to decades. The impractical brute force time enhances the security of the MSP430 and prevents future reverse engineering tactics. Our research serves as proof that the security of WSNs and the overall IoT technology is broken if we cannot protect these everyday objects at the physical layer.	arm architecture;atmel avr;boost;booting;bootstrapping (statistics);brute-force attack;brute-force search;cryptography;encryption;flaw hypothesis methodology;internet of things;key (cryptography);pic microcontroller;password;reverse engineering;sensor;ti msp430;tamper resistance	Mauricio Tellez;Samy El-Tawab;Mohammad Hossain Heydari	2016	2016 IEEE 3rd World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845429	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;temperature measurement;computer science;information security;operating system;internet privacy;one-time password;security testing;computer security;computer network	Security	-51.88352751378393	73.290999310732	50874

However, this ubiquitous technology has inherent problems in security and privacy. This calls for the development of simple, efficient and cost effective mechanisms against a variety of security threats. This paper proposes a two-step authentication protocol based on the randomized hash-lock scheme proposed by S. Weis in 2003. By introducing additional measures during the authentication process, this new protocol proves to enhance the security of RFID significantly, and protects the passive tags from almost all major attacks, including tag cloning, replay, full-disclosure, tracking, and eavesdropping. Furthermore, no significant changes to the tags is required to implement this protocol, and the low complexity level of the randomized hash-lock algorithm is retained.	authentication protocol;challenge–response authentication;communications protocol;mutual authentication;privacy;public-key cryptography;radio-frequency identification;randomized algorithm;replay attack;spoofing attack;tag cloud	Kaleb Lee	2010	2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security	10.1109/NSS.2010.30	message authentication code;otway–rees protocol;communications protocol;cost-effectiveness analysis;computer science;authentication protocol;wide mouth frog protocol;authentication;cryptographic protocol;supply chain;internet privacy;computer security;ubiquitous computing;computer network;memory management	Security	-46.288920599996814	73.05368051622378	50931

The concept of capabilities, which requires that sources must acquire tokens prior to sending data, has been successfully applied on an end-to-end base to protect end systems. In this paper, we propose edge-based capabilities (EC), an architecture that prevents DDoS attacks and malware spread at the edge. EC introduces a novel network element termed gate. The gate controls IP packets that have previously been authenticated by an end-to-end mechanism. Authenticated traffic carries a session-specific tag in the IP header. Packets with valid tags are forwarded by the gate whereas traffic without or with wrong tags is treated with low priority or even dropped. EC achieves efficiency and scalability by defining a single lock against which tags are compared, removing the need to store per-flow information in the gate. Compared to related proposals, EC is easy to deploy as the gate can be added incrementally and EC requires only a single network element to be added at the edge	access network;authentication;computer virus;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;internet;key size;malware;overhead (computing);scalability;software deployment;turing	Roger Karrer	2006	20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)	10.1109/AINA.2006.159	internet protocol;telecommunications;computer science;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-57.96447423152122	68.8828807434255	50949

This paper studies shortest distance computing in the cloud, which aims at the following goals: i) preventing outsourced graphs from neighborhood attack, ii) preserving shortest distances in outsourced graphs, iii) minimizing overhead on the client side. The basic idea of this paper is to transform an original graph G into a link graph Gl kept locally and a set of outsourced graphs Go. Each outsourced graph should meet the requirement of a new security model called 1-neighborhood-d-radius. In addition, the shortest distance query can be answered using Gl and Go. Our objective is to minimize the space cost on the client side when both security and utility requirements are satisfied. We devise a greedy method to produce Gl and Go, which can exactly answer the shortest distance queries. We also develop an efficient transformation method to support approximate shortest distance answering under a given additive error bound. The final experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;bigraph;client-side;cloud computing;computation;graph (discrete mathematics);graph operations;greedy algorithm;householder transformation;information leakage;information sensitivity;local search (optimization);outsourcing;overhead (computing);reachability;requirement;spectral leakage;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jun Gao;Jeffrey Xu Yu;Ruoming Jin;Jiashuai Zhou;Tengjiao Wang;Dongqing Yang	2011		10.1145/1989323.1989367	computer security model;cloud computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;distributed computing;privacy;outsourcing;satisfiability	DB	-40.54602119901466	67.11410705208851	50988

Hence, the security of the e-coupon system has become important as well. In this paper, we propose a novel and complete chaotic maps-based authentication scheme for e-coupon systems. Security analysis shows that our scheme satisfies essential security and functionality requirements. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that the execution time of our scheme is efficient and suitable for practical implementation in real life. In other words, users such as shops and customers can use our e-coupon system conveniently and securely.	authentication;download;list of chaotic maps;profiling (computer programming);real life;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Ching-Chun Chang;Chin-Yu Sun	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-1680-8	e-commerce;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;authentication;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-47.176141939544365	66.35655023695149	51009

These algorithms and their weaknesses are frequently disclosed through reverse-engineering software, but it is commonly thought to be too expensive to reconstruct designs from a hardware implementation alone. This paper challenges that belief by presenting an approach to reverse-engineering a cipher from a silicon implementation. Using this mostly automated approach, we reveal a cipher from an RFID tag that is not known to have a software or micro-code implementation. We reconstruct the cipher from the widely used Mifare Classic RFID tag by using a combination of image analysis of circuits and protocol analysis. Our analysis reveals that the security of the tag is even below the level that its 48-bit key length suggests due to a number of design flaws. Weak random numbers and a weakness in the authentication protocol allow for pre-computed rainbow tables to be used to find any key in a matter of seconds. Our approach of deducing functionality from circuit images is mostly automated, hence it is also feasible for large chips. The assumption that algorithms can be kept secret should therefore to be avoided for any type of silicon chip. Il faut qu’il n’exige pas le secret, et qu’il puisse sans inconvénient tomber entre les mains de l’ennemi.

We study challenges that mobile application developers have with meeting such requirements, and highlight the promise of using new automated, static analysis-based solutions that identify and insert missing prompts in order to guard otherwise unprotected resource accesses. We find evidence that third-party libraries, incorporated by developers across the mobile industry, may access privacysensitive resources without seeking consent or even against the user’s choice. Based on insights from real examples, we develop the theoretical underpinning of the problem of mediating resource accesses in mobile applications. We design and implement a graphtheoretic algorithm to place mediation prompts that protect every resource access, while avoiding repetitive prompting and prompting in background tasks or third-party libraries. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by analyzing 100 apps, averaging 7.3 MB in size and consisting of dozens of DLLs. Our approach scales well: once an app is represented in the form of a graph, the remaining static analysis takes under a second on average. Overall, our strategy succeeds in about 95% of all unique cases.	algorithm;best practice;dynamic-link library;graph (discrete mathematics);information sensitivity;library (computing);megabyte;mobile app;requirement;static program analysis	Benjamin Livshits;Jaeyeon Jung	2013			simulation;operating system;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-54.42092576413253	60.982849279776524	51221

Rather than downloading a file from a single source, the protocol allows users to join a swarm of peers to download and upload from each other simultaneously. Worms exploiting information from BT servers or trackers can cause serious damage to participating peers, which unfortunately has been neglected previously. In this article, we first present a new worm, called Adaptive BitTorrent worm (A-BT worm), which finds new victims and propagates sending forged requests to trackers. To reduce its abnormal behavior, the worm estimates the ratio of infected peers and adaptively adjusts its propagation speed. We then build a hybrid model to precisely characterize the propagation behavior of the worm. We also propose a statistical method to automatically detect the worm from the tracker by estimating the variance of the time intervals of requests. To slow down the worm propagation, we design a safe strategy in which the tracker returns secured peers when receives a request. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the hybrid model, and the effectiveness of our detection method and containment strategy through simulations.	bittorrent;download;file sharing;peer-to-peer;simulation;software propagation;swarm;upload	Jiaqing Luo;Bin Xiao;Qingjun Xiao;Jiannong Cao;Minyi Guo	2014	TAAS	10.1145/2567925	epidemic model;bittorrent tracker;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Networks	-57.91793922926621	74.38704308475424	51240
e25944bd62654d85a0487810d2b9854321bf0fb2	combining homomorphic encryption with trusted execution environment: a demonstration with paillier encryption and sgx		Cloud database services offer performance and storage advantages that local client platforms do not have, and become very appealing solutions. We list three approaches that address data privacy concerns that are associated with depositing sensitive data on remote platforms. Users can protect their data privacy by locally encrypting it before uploading to remote cloud servers. This prevents the servers from carrying out operations on the data, and also increases the networking overheads. Another approach uses a Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to protect the data. Examples include OS containers, Virtual Machines or Intel's Software Guard Extension (SGX). This approach relies on the trustworthiness of the TEE for privacy and integrity of operations. The third approach is using Homomorhpic Encryption (HE) schemes. They can allow a remote platform to carry out computations on encrypted data, but are malleable. Adding authentication tags to database entries could solve this problem only if the server is in the user's trust domain. We present here a new combined model. It uses a TEE to guarantee the integrity and correctness of the database code and data, while the data itself is encrypted with some HE scheme. In this way, the malleability protection, achieved through the TEE, is decoupled from the privacy protection that is achieved through the HE. Of course, this comes at some performance costs, but the results of our demonstration, that uses SGX as the TEE and Paillier cryptosystem as the HE, indicate that the proposed combined solution is practical.	authentication;cloud computing;cloud database;computation;confidentiality;correctness (computer science);cryptosystem;data integrity;emoticon;homomorphic encryption;information privacy;instance (computer science);operating system;server (computing);trust (emotion);trusted execution technology;trusted computing base;trusted execution environment;universal instantiation;upload	Nir Drucker;Shay Gueron	2017		10.1145/3139923.3139933	information privacy;cloud computing;encryption;malleability;distributed computing;cloud database;computer security;paillier cryptosystem;computer science;upload;server	Security	-41.618146677036925	67.87635051637554	51350

In the security perspective, however, the characteristics of WMSNs and the nature of multimedia make data authentication schemes more complex, especially for data integrity. In this regard, the aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of content-based authentication using image hashing technique as an alternative data authentication scheme in WMSNs. To assess the feasibility, the general requirements for image authentication in WMSNs are discussed in this paper. Additionally, the performance of five selected image hashing algorithms is measured with respect to robustness, sensitivity, and security. By comparing and analyzing the performance of the selected algorithms, this paper provides a perspective on the potential feasibility and limitations as an alternative to the traditional authentication scheme in WMSNs.	algorithm;data integrity;download;hash function;message authentication;requirement	Jinse Shin;Christoph Ruland	2013	2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673369	embedded system;image processing;computer science;cryptography;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-56.94365185721501	73.35332401974071	51359

In this paper, we first provide new definitions for malleable signatures that allow us to capture a broader range of transformations than was previously possible. We then give a generic construction based on malleable zero-knowledge proofs that allows us to construct malleable signatures for a wide range of transformation classes, with security properties that are stronger than those that have been achieved previously. Finally, we construct delegatable anonymous credentials from signatures that are malleable with respect to an appropriate class of transformations (that we show our malleable signature supports). The resulting instantiation satisfies a stronger security notion than previous schemes while also scaling linearly with the number of delegations.	antivirus software;digital credential;digital signature;electronic signature;image scaling;non-malleable codes;scalability;simulation;type signature;universal instantiation;zero-knowledge proof	Melissa Chase;Markulf Kohlweiss;Anna Lysyanskaya;Sarah Meiklejohn	2014	2014 IEEE 27th Computer Security Foundations Symposium	10.1109/CSF.2014.22	delegation;nickel;computer science;internet privacy;malleability;public-key cryptography;privacy;world wide web;computer security	Crypto	-40.45896354070922	73.37781883842679	51383

229070b93bab341aaa962a91b8e3c2cdbdf21c87	private and flexible proximity detection based on geohash		Proximity detection is one of the critical components in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNS), which has attracted much attention recently. With the advent of LBSNS, more and more users' location information will be collected by the service providers. However, with a potentially untrusted server, such a proximity detection service may threaten the privacy of users. In this paper, aiming at achieving enhanced privacy against the untrusted service providers in LBSNS, we introduce a new architecture with dual-servers for the first time and propose a privacy-preserving proximity detection method based on Geohash. In our architecture, the location coordinates of users are converted into a bit-string by dichotomy approximation, and divided into two subsets: prefix and suffix. The social network server firstly selects the candidate neighbors only in the light of the prefix, and then a third-party server is introduced to compute the relative distance of candidate neighbors according to the suffix. Each server can only get a subset of location code, instead of the whole location information of users as the previous work. We also prove that the new construction is secure under the untrusted server model with enhanced privacy. Finally, we provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed construction.	approximation;computational complexity theory;euclidean distance;location-based service;one-to-many (data model);server (computing);social network	Ayong Ye;Qiuling Chen;Li Xu	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108632	computer network;service provider;computer science;cryptography;architecture;geohash;suffix;social network;server;prefix	DB	-40.07800960940411	60.80657605298297	51412

In order to release the huge potential of personal data and enhance the rights of possession, use, and disposal, a highly reliable, secure and available infrastructure is required. Regarding the personal data market, current solutions focus on data discovery and passive privacy protection. What's worse is that the data owner loses the right of control. In this paper, we present a prototype of DSPM: an efficient platform we devise to balance the data sharing and privacy protect, enhance the probability of data discovery and the ability of the individual to control the data.

The basis for benchmarking are statistics of performance measures of a group of companies. The companies need to collaborate in order to compute these statistics. Protocols for privately computing statistics have been proposed in the literature. This paper designs, implements and evaluates a privacy-preserving benchmarking platform which is a central entity that offers a database of benchmark statistics to its customers. This is the first attempt at building a practical privacy-preserving benchmarking system and the first attempt at addressing all necessary trade-offs. The paper starts by designing a protocol that efficiently computes the statistics with constant cost per participant. The protocol uses central communication where customers only communicate with the central platform which facilitates a simple practical orchestration of the protocol. The protocols scale to realistic problem sizes due to the constant communication (and computation) cost per participant of the protocol.	benchmark (computing);centralized computing;channel (communications);computation;privacy;secure multi-party computation	Florian Kerschbaum	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-09699-5_2	computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy	Security	-40.64272123461707	71.55058876397855	51621

Regarding the communication established from mobile devices such as PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), one of the most currently used standards is the IEEE 802.11b, which presents known security flaws. To overcome them, some alternative setups are commonly deployed, based on link, network, transport or application-layer. In this paper we evaluate the impact on data reception rate and energy consumption of IPSec-based PDAs access to 802.11b (WiFi) wireless LANs. As a result of this work we identify the overhead imposed by the security mechanisms and the capacity of the device to run CPU and network-intensive applications.	central processing unit;ipsec;mobile computing;mobile device;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;provisioning	Fernando Luis da Costa Junior;Luciano Paschoal Gaspary;Jorge Luis Vict&#x00F3;ria Barbosa;Gerson G.

b11e69a762d5441d9f4531dcf8dad24260d9432b	face flashing: a secure liveness detection protocol based on light reflections		Face authentication systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially with the rapid development of Deep Learning technologies. However, human facial information is easy to be captured and reproduced, which makes face authentication systems vulnerable to various attacks. Liveness detection is an important defense technique to prevent such attacks, but existing solutions did not provide clear and strong security guarantees, especially in terms of time. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new liveness detection protocol called Face Flashing that significantly increases the bar for launching successful attacks on face authentication systems. By randomly flashing well-designed pictures on a screen and analyzing the reflected light, our protocol has leveraged physical characteristics of human faces: reflection processing at the speed of light, unique textual features, and uneven 3D shapes. Cooperating with working mechanism of the screen and digital cameras, our protocol is able to detect subtle traces left by an attacking process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face Flashing, we implemented a prototype and performed thorough evaluations with large data set collected from real-world scenarios. The results show that our Timing Verification can effectively detect the time gap between legitimate authentications and malicious cases. Our Face Verification can also differentiate 2D plane from 3D objects accurately. The overall accuracy of our liveness detection system is 98.8%, and its robustness was evaluated in different scenarios. In the worst case, our system’s accuracy decreased to a still-high 97.3%.	amiga reflections;authentication;bios;best, worst and average case;deep learning;digital camera;formal verification;liveness;prototype;randomness;static timing analysis;tracing (software)	Di Tang;Zhe Zhou;Yinqian Zhang;Kehuan Zhang	2018	CoRR		real-time computing;computer security;computer science;robustness (computer science);deep learning;authentication;flashing;liveness;artificial intelligence	Security	-52.7844960847632	65.88359333922638	51695

However, as the IT is centered upon the electrical grid, the shortage of IT also appears in smart grid and the complexity of convergence is aggravating the problem. Also, various personal information and payment information within the smart grid are gradually becoming big data and target for external invasion and attack; thus, there is increase in concerns for this matter. The purpose of this study is to analyze the security vulnerabilities and security requirement within smart grid and the authentication and access control method for privacy protection within home network. Therefore, we propose a secure access authentication and remote control method for user&#x2019;s home device within home network environment, and we present their security analysis. The proposed access authentication method blocks the unauthorized external access and enables secure remote access to home network and its devices with a secure message authentication protocol.	authentication	Do-Eun Cho;Sang-Soo Yeo;Si-Jung Kim	2014	J.

acb28e0d1bc38f90d29a79bd0e3abb3a368256c3	a new efficient asymmetric cryptosystem based on the square root problem		The square root modulo problem is a known primitive in designing an asymmetric cryptosystem. It was first attempted by Rabin. Decryption failure of the Rabin cryptosystem caused by the 4-to-1 decryption output is overcome efficiently in this work. The proposed scheme (known as the AA β-cryptosystem) has its encryption speed having a complexity order faster than the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, El-Gammal, RSA and ECC. It can also transmit a larger data set securely when compared to existing asymmetric schemes. It has a simple mathematical structure. Thus, it would have low computational requirements and would enable communication devices with low computing power to deploy secure communication procedures efficiently.	computation;cryptosystem;diffie–hellman key exchange;ecc memory;encryption;mathematical structure;modulo operation;requirement;secure communication	Muhammad Rezal Kamel Ariffin;M.

06f172a559b3a7cbf0c7921bee6f7623ab1fcca5	a novel and provably secure authentication and key agreement scheme with user anonymity for global mobility networks	smart card;global mobility network;formal proof;formal verification;mutual authentication	Ubiquitous networks support the roaming service for mobile communication devices. The mobile user can use the services in the foreign network with the help of the home network. Mutual authentication plays an important role in the roaming services, and researchers put their interests on the authentication schemes. Recently, in 2016, Gope and Hwang found that mutual authentication scheme of He et al. for global mobility networks had security disadvantages such as vulnerability to forgery attacks, unfair key agreement, and destitution of user anonymity. Then, they presented an improved scheme. However, we find that the scheme cannot resist the off-line guessing attack and the de-synchronization attack. Also, it lacks strong forward security. Moreover, the session key is known to HA in that scheme. To get over the weaknesses, we propose a new two-factor authentication scheme for global mobility networks. We use formal proof with random oracle model, formal verification with the tool Proverif, and informal analysis to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. Compared with some very recent schemes, our scheme is more applicable.

In addition to presenting randomness properties of these triples, which turn out to be similar to that of prime partitions of even numbers, we explore the question of restricted partition sets. We propose a protocol for key distribution that is based on these numbers. Two of the three partitions of the randomly chosen number serve as cover to send the third number to the two parties that wish to communicate with each other. This third number can serve as session key and the original number of which it is a partition can be used for audit purposes.	disk partitioning;key (cryptography);key distribution;randomness;session key	Deepthi Cherlopalle;Subhash C.

The security of these transmissions is based on the inviolability of the laws of quantum mechanics. Quantum cryptography was born in the early seventies when Steven Wiesner wrote """"Conjugate Coding"""", which took more than ten years to end this paper. The quantum cryptography relies on two important elements of quantum mechanics - the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle and the principle of photon polarization. The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle states that, it is not possible to measure the quantum state of any system without distributing that system. The principle of photon polarization states that, an eavesdropper can not copy unknown qubits i.e. unknown quantum states, due to no-cloning theorem which was first presented by Wootters and Zurek in 1982.

8e27feaa38fc8ade75bde919209174e3c733f5b4	trust and privacy		In this chapter we demonstrate how to increase the value of shared information by providing context on its quality via trust metrics. In order to evaluate the achieved level of trust, a trust evaluation system is described. This system assesses the quality of information based on past behaviour, direct experience, recommendation, referral, and roles. This management process filters and prioritises information provided by Semantic Room (SR) members while dynamically adjusting the trust level of members. Sharing of sensitive information in a commons requires that precautions be taken to safeguard the interest of members and to uphold codes of privacy. In the case of financial institutions, the requisites for security and privacy place demands on the CoMiFin platform that are satisfied using advanced modelling techniques, rigorous data analysis, and information management.

To this end, in this chapter we present a distributed SR architecture which is capable of correlating events coming from SR members while preserving the privacy of sensitive data items. The SR consists of SR Gateways deployed at each financial institution and a set of private clouds forming the SR collaborative processing system (CSP). SR Gateways perform data pre-processing and anonymize data items, as prescribed by the SR contract, using the Shamir secret sharing scheme. Anonymous data are sent to the CPS, which aggregates information through MapReduce-based computations. The anonymous data resulting from the collaborative computation are revealed to the SR members only if suspicious activities are detected. We show how this SR can be leveraged for detecting Man-in-the-Browser attacks.	code;computation;data pre-processing;email;information management;information sensitivity;mail (macos);man-in-the-browser;mapreduce;national research council (italy);preprocessor;privacy;representation oligonucleotide microarray analysis;sensor;shamir's secret sharing;springer (tank);trust metric	Paulo Esteves Verssimo;Jimmy McGibney;Hisain Elshaafi;Barry P.

Attacks utilizing GPUs to inflate computational capacity, known as resource inflation, are a novel and powerful threat that dramatically increase the computational disparity between clients. This disparity renders proof of work schemes based on hash reversal ineffective and potentially destructive. This paper examines various such schemes in view of GPU-based attacks and identifies characteristics that allow defense mechanisms to withstand attacks. In particular, we demonstrate that, hash-reversal schemes which adapt solely on server load are ineffective under attack by GPU utilizing adversaries; whereas, hashreversal schemes which adapt based on client behavior are effective even under GPU based attacks. 1	binocular disparity;denial-of-service attack;graphics processing unit;proof-of-work system;rendering (computer graphics);server (computing)	Jeff Green;Joshua Juen;Omid Fatemieh;Ravinder Shankesi;Dong Jin;Carl A.

Multi-proxy signature schemes have been suggested to use in a number of applications, particularly in distributed computing where delegation of rights is quite common. Although some work has been done in multi-proxy signature schemes, until now there is no formalized definition and security model for them. In this paper, we give the formal definition of multi-proxy signature schemes and formalize a notion of security for them.

There are two main mechanisms to detect repackaged apps. The first way is to insert self-checking codes to determine whether it is repackaged when the app is running, which can be done by developers. However, the self-checking codes are easy to be cracked. The second way is to scan and compare APK files to search potential repackaged apps, which can be done by app markets. However, some of app markets do not conduct repackaging detection in reality. Therefore, it is necessary for app users to defense against repackaged apps. For app users, we propose a new repackaging detection method, which is a novel online approach based on multi-user collaboration.	android;ccir system a;code;crowdsourcing;feature data;microsoft windows;mobile malware;multi-user;sensor;universality probability;ios	Qigeng Chen;Jiayu Wang;Yuping Wang	2015	2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2015 IEEE 12th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2015 IEEE 15th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops (UIC-ATC-ScalCom)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP.2015.66	mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;fingerprint recognition;server;collaboration	Mobile	-56.079651705712585	62.204042472770546	52144
91a68d2900c046afe23152078b5808943beabfac	cpar: cloud-assisted privacy-preserving image annotation with randomized kd-forest		With the explosive growth in the number of pictures taken by smart phones, organizing and searching pictures has become important tasks. To efficiently fulfill these tasks, the key enabler is annotating images with proper keywords, with which keywords-based searching and organizing become available for images. Currently, smart phones usually synchronize photo albums with cloud storage platforms, and have their images annotated with the help of cloud computing. However, the “offloading-to-cloud” solution may cause privacy breach, since photos from smart photos contain various sensitive information. For privacy protection, our preliminary research made effort to support cloud-based image annotation on encrypted images by utilizing cryptographic primitives. Nevertheless, for each annotation, it requires the cloud to perform linear checking on the large-scale encrypted dataset with high computational cost. This paper addresses the challenge and proposes a cloudassisted privacy-preserving image annotation with randomized kd-forest, namely CPAR. A novel privacy-preserving randomized kd-forest structure is proposed in CPAR as an secure and efficient index for the dataset, with which CPAR significantly improves the annotation performance. Thorough analysis is carried out to demonstrate the security of CPAR. Experimental evaluation on the well-known IAPR TC-12 dataset validates the efficiency and effectiveness of CPAR.	algorithmic efficiency;automatic image annotation;cloud computing;cloud storage;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;encryption;information sensitivity;international association for pattern recognition;kullback–leibler divergence;numerical analysis;organizing (structure);privacy law;prototype;randomized algorithm;smartphone;taxicab geometry;threat model;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yifan Tian;Yantian Hou;Jiawei Yuan	2018	CoRR			Security	-41.53003907246469	64.98913570765306	52165

Many mechanisms have been proposed for solving varying types of malicious attacks. However, few of them discussed malicious packet-modifying attacks (MPA). The MPA come from some malicious nodes that modify contents of data packets while relaying. Once MPA occur, the sink node may make wrong decisions according to the incorrect packets. In this paper, an overhearing-based detection mechanism (OBD) is presented for detecting the occurrence of MPA. Both OBD and a traditional two-path detection mechanism were successfully implemented for comparison using the NS2. The simulation measured the metrics in successful detection rate, end-to-end delay, power consumption, and detection latency. Compared to the two-path detection mechanism, the overhearing-based mechanism not only incurred less overhead but provided more accurate failure detection performance.	network packet	Kuo-Feng Ssu;Chih-Hsun Chou;Li-Wen Cheng	2007	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2007.04.013	embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-54.78519612022608	77.01084166401417	52276

Web service providers must assure their clients’ confidentiality, integrity and availability over a trusted relationship that may be asynchronous and that may involve multiple business partners. Despite the continued significance of the traditional approaches to securing content, transmission and connection in a Web-based business environment, including Secure Socket Layer, Virtual Private Networks, Internet Protocol Security, and so on, they are not able to address the new challenges posed by Web services. This paper aims to provide insight into the management of Web services security. We first introduce key concepts and reviews state-of-the-art standards for Web services security. Then, by aligning the Web services security standards with security threats, we provide guidance for the practical implementation of Web services security.

To order goods, a customer typically sends credit card details. To order life insurance, the customer might have to supply confidential personal data. Internet users would like to know that such information is safe from eavesdropping or tampering. Many Web browsers protect transmissions using the protocol SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The client and server machines exchange nonces and compute session keys from them. Version 3.0 of SSL has been designed to correct a flaw of previous versions, where an attacker could induce the parties into choosing an unnecessarily weak cryptosystem. The latest version of the protocol is called TLS (Transport Layer Security) [1]; it closely resembles SSL 3.0. Is TLS really secure? My proofs suggest that it is, but one should draw no conclusions without reading the rest of this report, which describes how the protocol was modelled and what properties were proved. I have analyzed a much simplified form of TLS; I assume hashing and encryption to be secure. My abstract version of TLS is simpler than the concrete protocol, but it is still more complex than the protocols typically verified. We have not reached the limit of what can be analyzed formally. The proofs were conducted using Isabelle/HOL [4], an interactive theorem prover for higher-order logic. They follow the inductive method [6], which has a clear semantics and treats infinitestate systems. Model-checking is not used, so there are no restrictions on the agent population, numbers of concurrent runs, etc. The paper gives an overview of TLS (§2) and of the inductive method for verifying protocols (§3). It continues by presenting the Isabelle formalization of TLS (§4) and outlining some of the properties proved (§5). Finally, the paper discusses related work (§6) and concludes (§7).	automated theorem proving;confidentiality;cryptographic nonce;cryptosystem;e-commerce;encryption;flaw hypothesis methodology;hol (proof assistant);inductive reasoning;internet;isabelle;model checking;personally identifiable information;proof assistant;secure communication;server (computing);session key;transport layer security;verification and validation	Lawrence C.

Our experimental results demonstrate that the Hummingbird-2 mutual authentication protocol provides a highly effective and efficient security and privacy solution for low-cost passive RFID tags.	algorithm;authentication protocol;cryptography;encryption;laptop;mutual authentication;privacy;radio-frequency identification;wisp	Xinxin Fan;Guang Gong;Daniel W.

The operating systems used were Windows phone 8.1, Android 5.0.1 (Lollipop) and iOS 8.3. Results show that due to strong security features built into the Windows 8.1 system forensic examiners may not be able to access data with standard forensic suite and they must decide whether to perform a live forensic acquisition.

9ad6f6c642f3a9793a60f6364af362ea8dc2e168	towards characterizing international routing detours	mitm;routing detours;as geolocation	There are currently no requirements (technical or otherwise) that routing paths must be contained within national boundaries. Indeed, some paths experience international detours, i.e., originate in one country, cross international boundaries and return to the same country. In most cases these are sensible traffic engineering or peering decisions at ISPs that serve multiple countries. In some cases such detours may be suspicious. Characterizing international detours is useful to a number of players: (a) network engineers trying to diagnose persistent problems, (b) policy makers aiming at adhering to certain national communication policies, (c) entrepreneurs looking for opportunities to deploy new networks, or (d) privacy-conscious states trying to minimize the amount of internal communication traversing different jurisdictions.  In this paper we characterize international detours in the Internet during the month of January 2016. To detect detours we sample BGP RIBs every 8 hours from 461 RouteViews and RIPE RIS peers spanning 30 countries. We use geolocation of ASes which geolocates each BGP prefix announced by each AS, mapping its presence at IXPs and geolocation infrastructure IPs. Finally, we analyze each global BGP RIB entry looking for detours. Our analysis shows more than 5K unique BGP prefixes experienced a detour. 132 prefixes experienced more than 50% of the detours. We observe about 544K detours. Detours either last for a few days or persist the entire month. Out of all the detours, more than 90% were transient detours that lasted for 72 hours or less. We also show different countries experience different characteristics of detours.	border gateway protocol;cloud computing;emoticon;file spanning;geolocation;peering;requirement;route views;routing	Anant Shah;Romain Fontugne;Christos Papadopoulos	2016		10.1145/3012695.3012698	man-in-the-middle attack;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-57.22766275941715	68.774437863084	52460
be9d7fb33a13fab8343640c59e6784163dfaa4e2	securing mobile devices: malware mitigation methods		Malware on mobile handsets has always been a point of concern for its users. With the widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets and the emergence of centralized application markets it started to represent a significant threat. This situation has led to the development of defence methods for securing mobile devices coming from operating system developers, antivirus vendors and security researchers. In this paper we focus on the solutions proposed by security researchers which include both methods inherited from malware detection on personal computers and new methods specific to mobile device environment. This paper gives an overview of the history and development of mobile malware and provides a survey of the methods proposed for malware mitigation on mobile devices in the last years.	antivirus software;application security;centralized computing;cloud computing;code coverage;decompiler;emergence;graphical user interface;machine learning;malware analysis;mandatory access control;mobile device;mobile malware;mobile phone;mobile security;operating system;personal computer;smartphone;software deployment;static program analysis;tablet computer	Anastasia Skovoroda;Dennis Gamayunov	2015	JoWUA		internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.20989988175973	62.4766806295995	52549
02a95ac524f0bb3fd65f4337c7758ba46ea1bc29	a blockchain based data management system for energy trade		A new type of energy trade called the distributed energy resource has emerged in recent years, which can bring several benefits to people. However, trust issue also appeared among governments, users and energy companies. To solve the problem, smart contract and Ethereum are used to develop a system for distributed energy trade. A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Ethereum is one of the decentralized platforms that run smart contracts. With the usage of smart contract and Ethereum, the system is reliable and it avoids the risk of using centralized energy management system. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop a blockchain based data management IoT system for energy chain transaction by Ethereum and test the smart contract by communicating sequential process (CSP) which is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems.

In this paper we present an approach for encrypted database indexes that enable fast inequality, i.e., range searches, such that also prefix searches on lexicographically ordered but encrypted data are possible. Unlike common techniques that address this issue as well, like hardware-based solutions or order-preserving encryption schemes, our indexes do not require specialized, expensive hardware and use only well-accredited software components; they also do not reveal any information about the encrypted data besides their order. Moreover, when implementing the indexing approach in a commercial software product, multiple application-centric optimization opportunities of the index's performance did emerge, which are also presented in this paper. They include basic performance-increasing measures, pipelined index scans and updates and caching strategies. We further present performance test results proving that our indexing approach shows good performance on substantial amounts of data.	cache (computing);commercial software;component-based software engineering;concurrency (computer science);encryption;information system;jdbc;lexicographical order;library (computing);mathematical optimization;multitier architecture;protocol buffers;redundancy (information theory);refinement (computing);sql;serialization;server (computing);social inequality;tree (data structure)	Jan Lehnhardt;Tobias Rho;Adrian Spalka;Armin B.

7db752159f3212e81d91c84f80ca3b981cdcf48f	automatic search of bit-based division property for arx ciphers and word-based division property		Division property is a generalized integral property proposed by Todo at Eurocrypt 2015. Previous tools for automatic searching are mainly based on the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method and trace the division property propagation at the bit level. In this paper, we propose automatic tools to detect ARX ciphers’ division property at the bit level and some specific ciphers’ division property at the word level. For ARX ciphers, we construct the automatic searching tool relying on Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) instead of MILP, since SAT method is more suitable in the search of ARX ciphers’ differential/linear characteristics. The propagation of division property is translated into a system of logical equations in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Some logical equations can be dynamically adjusted according to different initial division properties and stopping rule, while the others corresponding to r-round propagations remain the same. Moreover, our approach can efficiently identify some optimized distinguishers with lower data complexity. As a result, we obtain a 17-round distinguisher for SHACAL-2, which gains four more rounds than previous work, and an 8-round distinguisher for LEA, which covers one more round than the former one. For word-based division property, we develop the automatic search based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), which is a generalization of SAT. We model division property propagations of basic operations and S-boxes by logical formulas, and turn the searching problem into an SMT problem. With some available solvers, we achieve some new distinguishers. For CLEFIA, 10-round distinguishers are obtained, which cover one more round than the previous work. For the internal block cipher of Whirlpool, the data complexities of 4/5-round distinguishers are improved. For Rijndael-192 and Rijndael-256, 6-round distinguishers are presented, which attain two more rounds than the published ones. Besides, the integral attacks for CLEFIA are improved by one round with the newly obtained distinguishers.	addressing mode;algorithm;arx;asiacrypt;bit-level parallelism;block cipher;boolean satisfiability problem;clefia;computation;conjunctive normal form;cryptography;eurocrypt;exclusive or;gurobi;linear programming;mathematical optimization;modulo operation;norm (social);route distinguisher;s-box;satisfiability modulo theories;software propagation;solver	Ling Sun;Wei Wang;Meiqin Wang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_5	discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;integer programming	Logic	-36.971559920239564	82.15505124024517	52616

However, this hypothesis might easily be violated by the presence of selfish nodes constrained with energy, bandwidth, and processing power. To address this problem, we propose a practical reputation-based incentive scheme, named PRI, to stimulate honest forwarding and discipline selfish behavior. A novel concept of successful forwarding credential and an observation protocol are presented to cope with the detection of nodes’ behavior, and a reputation model is proposed to determine egoistic individuals. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposal.

In this paper, we review the secure infrastructure of VANET, some potential applications and interesting security challenges. To cope with these security challenges, we propose a novel secure scheme for vehicular communication on VANETs. The proposed scheme not only protects the privacy but also maintains the liability in the secure communications by using session keys.

This paper posits that by identifying human-generated traffic as such, one can service it with improved reliability or higher priority, mitigating the effects of botnet attacks. The key challenge is to identify human-generated traffic in the absence of strong unique identities. We develop NAB (“Not-A-Bot”), a system to approximately identify and certify human-generated activity. NAB uses a small trusted software component called an attester, which runs on the client machine with an untrusted OS and applications. The attester tags each request with an attestation if the request is made within a small amount of time of legitimate keyboard or mouse activity. The remote entity serving the request sends the request and attestation to a verifier, which checks the attestation and implements an application-specific policy for attested requests. Our implementation of the attester is within the Xen hypervisor. By analyzing traces of keyboard and mouse activity from 328 users at Intel, together with adversarial traces of spam, DDoS, and click-fraud activity, we estimate that NAB reduces the amount of spam that currently passes through a tuned spam filter by more than 92%, while not flagging any legitimate email as spam. NAB delivers similar benefits to legitimate requests under DDoS and click-fraud attacks.	botnet;click fraud;client (computing);component-based software engineering;denial-of-service attack;email filtering;game controller;hypervisor;operating system;spamming;tracing (software);video game bot	Ramakrishna Gummadi;Hari Balakrishnan;Petros Maniatis;Sylvia Ratnasamy	2009			srizbi botnet;computer science;operating system;database;distributed computing;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Networks	-56.02699326857427	60.7352099142996	52696

To enable authentication of sporadic multicast messages, a conventional digital signature scheme is appropriate. To enable authentication of a multicast data stream, however, an authenticated multicast or multicast authentication (MA) scheme is necessary. An MA scheme can be constructed from a conventional digital signature scheme or a multiple-time signature (MTS) scheme. A number of MTS-based MA schemes have been proposed over the years. Here, we formally analyze four MA schemes, namely BiBa, TV-HORS, SCU+ and TSV+. Among these MA schemes, SCU+ is an MA scheme we constructed from an MTS scheme designed for secure code update, and TSV+ is our patched version of TSV, an MA scheme which we show to be vulnerable. Based on our simulation-validated analysis, which complements and at places rectifies or improves existing analyses, we compare the schemes' computational and communication efficiencies relative to their security levels. For numerical comparison of the schemes, we use parameters relevant for a smart (power) grid component called wide-area measurement system. Our comparison shows that TV-HORS, while algorithmically unsophisticated and not the best performer in all categories, is the most balanced performer. SCU+, TSV+ and by implication the schemes from which they are extended do not offer clear advantages over BiBa, the oldest among the schemes.	algorithm;authentication;biba model;digital signature;multicast;numerical analysis;simulation;system of measurement;through-silicon via	Yee Wei Law;Zheng Gong;Tie Luo;Slaven Marusic;Marimuthu Palaniswami	2013		10.1145/2484313.2484349	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;smart grid;computer security;xcast;computer network	Security	-45.595526055940326	76.3145213159331	52775
c303848364a96f2d774b3965dfe50c5b1dbc0017	clone detection based on physical layer reputation for proximity service		Proximity-based service (ProSe) provides direct communications among smart sensor nodes in proximity which aims at reserving resource consumption and alleviating the load in base stations, which is a promising solution for smart sensor systems that possess limited computing and energy resources. During the ProSe direct communications, most of the prior art security methods are usually provided by the ProSe function and are based on complex cryptography. However, despite the computing complexity, it is difficult for cryptographic methods to detect clone attack which is a common kind of attack in sensor systems. Clone nodes feature different physical positions but claim colliding IDs with captured nodes. Thus, clone nodes can be detected by spatial differences, in particular, by the surveillance of physical layer channel state information (CSI). However, CSI is not absolute static due to the random noise in wireless propagation environment. Accordingly, the detection accuracy varies with the stability of CSI. To address this challenge, we take the first attempt to introduce physical layer reputation and then elaborate the physical layer reputation based clone detection protocol to detect clone attack in multiple scenarios. The proposed protocol significantly improves the detection rate and false alarm rate and it is validated both by simulations and realizations.

Gadgets like mobile phones and smart phones are very commonplace in today’s society with powerful features. Criminals started using handheld devices for committing crimes as it is easy to handle and always portable. BlackBerry is a widely used smart phone because of its unique features. As the usage is very high, the evidentiary value of this device assumes greater importance in the litigation process. The very common methodology applied in BlackBerry forensics is the IPD file generation using Blackberry Desktop Manager. The methodology explained in this paper uses a different approach. Here forensic image of the BlackBerry handheld is generated using a software agent, which is injected on the device before acquisition. The tool also analyzes the forensic image and shows phone contents in different file viewers.	blackberry;computer forensics	Satheesh Kumar Sasidharan;Kate L Thomas	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22709-7_54	data mining;database;internet privacy	AI	-51.0168540342337	64.03123153644754	52807

Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.	baseline (configuration management);experiment;hoc (programming language);malware;network packet;routing;sensor;simulation;universal instantiation	Issa M.

Nodes must collaborate in order to compute the path metric and forward data. The assumption that all nodes are honest and behave correctly during metric computation, propagation, and aggregation, as well as during data forwarding, leads to unexpected consequences in adversarial networks where compromised nodes act maliciously. In this work, we identify novel attacks against high-throughput multicast protocols in wireless mesh networks. The attacks exploit the local estimation and global aggregation of the metric to allow attackers to attract a large amount of traffic. We show that these attacks are very effective against multicast protocols based on high-throughput metrics. We conclude that aggressive path selection is a double-edged sword: While it maximizes throughput, it also increases attack effectiveness in the absence of defense mechanisms. Our approach to defend against the identified attacks combines measurement-based detection and accusation-based reaction techniques. The solution accommodates transient network variations and is resilient against attempts to exploit the defense mechanism itself.

84e84bed92a5761e30f899720eca680f1a45352a	an efficient non-interactive multi-client searchable encryption with support for boolean queries		Motivated by the recent searchable symmetric encryption protocol of Cash et al., we propose a new multi-client searchable encryption protocol in this work. By tactfully leveraging the RSA-function, our protocol avoids the per-query interaction between the data owner and the client, thus reducing the communication overhead significantly and eliminating the need of the data owner to provide the online services to clients at all times. Furthermore, our protocol manages to protect the query privacy of clients to some extent, meaning that our protocol hides the exact queries from the data owner. In terms of the leakage to server, it is exactly the same as Cash et al., thus achieving the same security against the adversarial server. In addition, by employing attribute-based encryption technique, our protocol also realizes the finegrained access control on the stored data. To be compatible with our RSA-based approach, we also present a deterministic and memory-efficient ‘keyword to prime’ hash function, which may be of independent interest.	access control;attribute-based encryption;cryptographic protocol;e-services;hash function;overhead (computing);server (computing);spectral leakage;symmetric-key algorithm	Shifeng Sun;Joseph K.

This assumption renders wireless ad hoc networks vulnerable to various types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. We present a distributed probing technique to detect and mitigate one type of DoS attacks, namely malicious packet dropping, in wireless ad hoc networks. A malicious node can promise to forward packets but in fact fails to do so. In our distributed probing technique, every node in the network will probe the other nodes periodically to detect if any of them fail to perform the forwarding function. Subsequently, node state information can be utilized by the routing protocol to bypass those malicious nodes. Our experiments show that in a moderately changing network, the probing technique can detect most of the malicious nodes with a relatively low false positive rate. The packet delivery rate in the network can also be increased accordingly.	ansi escape code;denial-of-service attack;experiment;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);rendering (computer graphics);routing;wrapper function	Mike Just;Evangelos Kranakis;Tao Wan	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39611-6_14	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;routing protocol;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-54.80034480329444	77.01061389209953	53248

With the increased use of mobile devices and escalating privacy concerns for mobile users, browser applications on mobile devices have also started incorporating private browsing mode. Even so, the use of private browsing mode is limited to the browser applications and cannot be applied directly on other third-party mobile applications. In this paper, we propose Private Droid, which provides a private browsing mode for third-party applications on the Android platform. First, we discuss three possible approaches of implementing mobile private browsing mode: code instrumentation, an extra sandbox, and a Linux container approach. Then, we implement Private Droid, which creates a new sandbox for every application in private mode and destroys the sandbox once the application is closed. After that, we evaluate usability, efficiency and security of the system with 25 popular Android applications. Our design considerations, implementation details, evaluation results, and challenges lay a foundation of private browsing mode on mobile platforms.	android;browsing;cpu cache;features of the opera web browser;lxc;mobile app;mobile device;privacy;prospective search;sandbox (computer security);threat model;usability	Su Mon Kywe;Christopher Landis;Yutong Pei;Justin Satterfield;Yuan Tian;Patrick Tague	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2014.8	mobile search;mobile web;engineering;internet privacy;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	Mobile	-51.25015148339439	63.0282129242783	53291

Using homomorphic encryption, Ostrovsky and Skeith proposed a computationally secure solution to this problem in 2005. However, their solution requires the server to send an answer of size O(mS log m) bits when m documents of S bits match the query, while a non-private query only requires mS bits. In this work we propose two new communication optimal constructions, both allowing a communication expansion factor (compared to a non-private query) asymptotically equal to 1 when m and S increase. More precisely, our first scheme requires m(S + O(log t)) bits (where t is the size of the database) and our second scheme m(S +C) where C is a constant depending on the chosen computational security level.	communication complexity;computational hardness assumption;homomorphic encryption;low-density parity-check code;online and offline;physical symbol system;privacy;qr code;semantic security;server (computing);server-side	Matthieu Finiasz;Kannan Ramchandran	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory Proceedings	10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283979	information privacy;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;mathematics;internet privacy;world wide web;statistics	DB	-39.70502132674175	68.49162999599488	53349

These systems differ from each other only in the timing of re-encryption. As re-encryption is an expensive operation, it is significant to avoid re-encryption. The purpose of this paper is to advise a direction to avoid re-encryption and facilitate file sharing in cryptographic file sharing system. A Black-box model is set up to achieve this objective. In the model, FPGA or ASIC chips are used to act as the black-box as they have been extensively researched and applied in cryptography. Some applications of FPGA and ASIC in cryptography are detailed in this paper. Their feasibility to be functioned as the black-box is discussed.

We propose a novel graphical password scheme, PassApp, which utilizes users' everyday memory about installed apps on mobile devices as shared secrets. As the registration stage is no longer needed, PassApp exempts users from additional memory burden and greatly enhances user experience. Additionally, PassApp owns a large password set and only a small part of passwords may be exposed during a login. Therefore, PassApp has a natural advance on effectively resisting guessing attacks and shoulder surfing attacks. Our user studies demonstrate that PassApp performs well with a reasonable login time (7.27s) and a high success rate (95.48%). Our security analysis shows PassApp can effectively withstand one-time shoulder surfing attacks and on average 30 times of shoulder surfing are necessary to expose all passwords.	graphical user interface;login;mobile device;password;shared secret;user experience	Huiping Sun;Ke Wang;Xu Li;Nan Qin;Zhong Chen	2015		10.1145/2785830.2785880	cognitive password;shoulder surfing;password policy;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;world wide web;password;computer security	Security	-51.36405863223512	65.15032720347065	53478

6507d597a1dfde373f791c926d058c069b9af5f4	short paper: industrial feasibility of private information retrieval		A popular security problem in database management is how to guarantee to a querying party that the database owner will not learn anything about the data that is retrieved — a problem known as Private Information Retrieval (PIR). While a variety of PIR schemes are known, they are rarely considered for practical use cases yet. We investigate the feasibility of PIR in the telecommunications world to open up data of carriers to external parties. To this end, we first provide a comparative survey of the current PIR state of the art (including ORAM schemes as a generalized concept) as well as implementation and analysis of two PIR schemes for the considered use case. While an overall conclusion is that PIR techniques are not too far away from practical use in specific cases, we see ORAM as a more suitable candidate for further R&D investment. 1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION The telecommunications world is undergoing a transition where carriers not only provide services such as telephony or internet access, but also attempt to monetize the huge amount of data associated with their subscribers’ activity. Analyzing data like call statistics or roaming behavior can be used to offer specifically tailored services and packages. The combination of such data with other data from 3rd parties can potentially result in even more value. As such, one direction is to open up the existing databases to subscribing external parties. In fact, it may well be the case that two rivaling carriers allow each other to query their subscriber databases, e.g. for detecting fraudulent activities or faults in the network. Another real-world scenario is that of answering to the demands of public authorities wanting to verify that a user has been making a call at a certain time or to assess whether a certain IMEI or IMSI is part of the carriers subscriber base. An open practical problem is how to guarantee to the querying party that the database owner will not learn anything about the data that is retrieved — a problem known as Private Information Retrieval (PIR) (Goldreich and Ostrovsky, 1996). Accordingly, we assessed the feasibility of PIR schemes to support such use cases, where the typical database consists of 400.000-800.000 entries of IMEIs and/or IMSIs. This paper provides a comparative survey of PIR schemes as part of Section 2. We then discuss two schemes in detail, i.e. a Trapdoor Group scheme in Section 3.1 and an ORAM approach in Section 3.2. We provide detailed performance and runtime analysis data in Section 4. 2 OVERVIEW AND COMPARISON OF EXISTING SCHEMES The trivial solution for a user who wants to query a database without the database server learning about the query is to retrieve the entire database from the server and ignore all except the queried entries. Of course, this is very inefficient in terms of communication, but very efficient regarding computational effort because there is (almost) none. Thus, the incurred effort provides a good starting point in that any new solution should have less communication than this trivial solution, often trading this for computational complexity in some form. We split existing works that realize some form of private information retrieval into four main approaches. In a forthcoming paper, we present a detailed overview of the different schemes, here we only categorize the schemes into these high-level approaches. Some of the mentioned schemes have also Jäschke, A., Grohmann, B., Armknecht, F. and Schaad, A. Short Paper: Industrial Feasibility of Private Information Retrieval.

All rights reserved 395 been presented in (Ostrovsky and Skeith(III), 2007) and (Olumofin and Goldberg, 2011), and some observations about computational complexity can be found in (Gasarch, 2004) and (Sion and Carbunar, 2007). • Homomorphic Approaches: The user masks (e.g., homomorphically encrypts) the queried index, and the server algebraically combines all indices with the database entries to obtain a masked version of only the queried entry. The user then removes the mask to obtain the result. Publications following this general idea are (Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky, 1997), (Chang, 2004), (Melchor et al., 2016) (Group Homomorphic), (Trostle and Parrish, 2010) (Trapdoor Group), (Kiayias et al., 2015; Lipmaa, 2009; Ishai and Paskin, 2007) (Branching Programs), (Melchor and Gaborit, 2007) (Lattice-based) and (Doröz et al., 2014) (FHE-based). • ORAM Approaches: Comes from the field of software protection, but can also be used to protect privacy in databases. ORAM requires a slightly different setup: The database must be encrypted and thus there must be some key management mechanism. In contrast to pure PIR, ORAM offers the added option of writing, i.e., changing or adding entries. Publications based on ORAM are (Mayberry et al., 2014; Stefanov et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2016) (ORAM-Tree), (Devadas et al., 16 A) (Onion-ORAM), (Apon et al., 2014) (FHEORAM) and (Lorch et al., 2013) (Parallel-TreeORAM). • Garbled Approaches: Since PIR consists of two parties (the user and the server) trying to compute a function (the correct database entry) without the server learning the users input (the query index), it is natural to look to Multiparty-Computation, where two or more parties compute a function together without learning any input except their own, and the result of the computation. Publications involving this approach are (Lu and Ostrovsky, 2013; Gentry et al., 2014a; Gentry et al., 2014b). • Other Approaches: The φ-Hiding Approach (Cachin et al., 1999), the Trapdoor Permutation Approach (Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky, 2000), and the Sender Anonymity Approach (Trostle and Parrish, 2010). Table 1 compares the schemes from the above approaches, indicating a particularly good value with a (light) green background and particularly unfavorable aspects with a (darker) red background. The aspects considered are CommU (communication from user to the server), CommS (communication from server to the user), CompU (user computation effort) and CompS (server computation effort). The variables used are: • n is the number of database elements • B is the block size • λ is the security parameter • M (resp. C) is the message (resp. ciphertext) space of the encryption scheme • m is a finite group order The leftmost column denotes the approach as presented above: H for homomorphic, O for ORAM, G for garbled and “-” if none apply. 3 CHOOSING AND OPTIMIZING To test performance for the use cases described in Section 1, we implemented two approaches — one homomorphic and one ORAM-approach, as these differ greatly, yet can both solve our problem of PIR. Concretely, we chose and modified a Trapdoor Group Scheme based on (Trostle and Parrish, 2010) and the Path-ORAM Scheme (Stefanov et al., 2013) for their conceptual simplicity. 3.1 The (Optimized) Trapdoor Group Scheme The original scheme (Trostle and Parrish, 2010) only allows retrieval of an entire row (i.e., √ n out of n) of database entries, which we extend to allow singleentry-retrieval and minimize communication. We present this optimized scheme as a protocol: Database Structure: n elements of ZN arranged as a ln(n)-dimensional array with entries xi1,...,iln(n) , i j = 1, . . . ,n1/ ln(n) for j = 1, . . . , ln(n). Prerequisites: We assume that we work in the group (Zm,+) and that m and N are coprime. Queries: Suppose the user wants to query the element xi1,...,iln(n) . 1. The user selects m as the group order above depending on the required security level, but at least m > Ndln(n)e ·n · (N−1). 2. The user randomly selects secret b j ∈ Zm, j = 1, . . . , ln(n) and ln(n) ·n1/ ln(n) coefficients ei, j, i = 1, . . . ,n1/ ln(n), j = 1, . . . , ln(n) with three restrictions: i. ei, j < ln(n) √ m n·(N−1) for all (i, j). ii. For j = 1, . . . , ln(n): If ij 6= i,ei, j is a multiple of N (i.e., ei = ai ·N for some ai).

8d2ec1ec11aa7b2cd48048e351b7c2598335e2c3	on the security of linear sketch schemes against recovering attacks		Recently, the notion of fuzzy signature was introduced by Takahashi et al. (ACNS 2015, ACNS 2016, ePrint 2017). It is a signature scheme in which signatures can be generated using “fuzzy data” (i.e. noisy data such as biometric features) as a signing key, without using any additional user-specific data (such as a helper string in the context of fuzzy extractors). One of the main building blocks in the existing fuzzy signature schemes, is a primitive called linear sketch, which can be interpreted as a certain form of (one-way) encoding with which fuzzy data is encoded, and is used in combination with an ordinary signature scheme with certain functional and security properties, to construct a fuzzy signature scheme. Although the security of the underlying linear sketch scheme is very important for the security of the constructed fuzzy signature schemes, a linear sketch scheme is a relatively new primitive, and what security properties its definition and the existing constructions satisfy, has not been understood well. In order to deepen our understanding of this primitive, in this paper we clarify the security properties achieved by the existing linear sketch schemes. More specifically, we formalize security of a linear sketch scheme against “recovering” attacks, and then clarify that the existing linear sketch schemes achieve sufficiently strong security against them.	biometrics;digital signature;fuzzy logic;one-way function;signal-to-noise ratio;sketch;tomotaka takahashi;type signature	Takahiro Matsuda;Kenta Takahashi;Goichiro Hanaoka	2018		10.5220/0006847102420253	computer security;computer science;sketch	Security	-39.6576148621296	76.12159341123044	53589

We propose a novel methodology to address the detection of such attacks, and further incorporate appropriate remedial actions in the estimator. Our methodology is based on the notions of local consistency and nodal consistency and is further reinforced by the exploiting the underlying physical-layer in the cyber-physical description.	cyber-physical system;dynamical system;inter-process communication;local consistency;sensor	Usman A.

Security requirements change drastically when instant messaging systems are employed in the corporate world as sensitive data needs to be transmitted. Many security enhancements have been proposed for instant messaging from the perspective of peer-to-peer talk. In this paper, we study the extension of secure instant messaging for group settings. We also propose a scheme, IBECRT, which uses ID-based encryption and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The scheme does not require a central trusted entity for key distribution and achieves uniform work-load distribution. Additionally, the protocol has the following properties: hiding the users' identity in a conference, authentication of senders, and integrity protection of the messages exchanged.

f0ae035bbb184f25fbb8d5d10c2b97926648099a	accountable authority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with white-box traceability and public auditing in the cloud	会议论文	As a sophisticated mechanism for secure fine-grained access control, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a highly promising solution for commercial applications such as cloud computing. However, there still exists one major issue awaiting to be solved, that is, the prevention of key abuse. Most of the existing CP-ABE systems missed this critical functionality, hindering the wide utilization and commercial application of CP-ABE systems to date. In this paper, we address two practical problems about the key abuse of CP-ABE: (1) The key escrow problem of the semi-trusted authority; and, (2) The malicious key delegation problem of the users. For the semi-trusted authority, its misbehavior (i.e., illegal key (re-)distribution) should be caught and prosecuted. And for a user, his/her malicious behavior (i.e., illegal key sharing) need be traced. We affirmatively solve these two key abuse problems by proposing the first accountable authority CP-ABE with whitebox traceability that supports policies expressed in any monotone access structures. Moreover, we provide an auditor to judge publicly whether a suspected user is guilty or is framed by the authority.	access control;algorithm;alternating direction implicit method;attribute-based encryption;black box;brent's method;business models for open-source software;ciphertext;cloud computing;communications security;computer security;credential;cryptosystem;decision linear assumption;eurocrypt;functional encryption;id-based encryption;ieee transactions on information forensics and security;key (cryptography);key escrow;malware;pkc (conference);pei-yuan wei;provable security;public-key cryptography;rafail ostrovsky;security hacker;semiconductor industry;springer (tank);traceability;tweaking;well-formed formula;yang;monotone	Jianting Ning;Xiaolei Dong;Zhenfu Cao	2015	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-319-24177-7_14	computer science;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-42.768399668545655	68.38362890257098	53642

7c8a4abc7624802783bde0688969fcdf373d01e7	practical confidentiality preserving big data analysis		The “pay-as-you-go” cloud computing model has strong potential for efficiently supporting big data analysis jobs expressed via data-flow languages such as Pig Latin. Due to security concerns — in particular leakage of data — government and enterprise institutions are however reluctant to moving data and corresponding computations to public clouds. We present Crypsis, a system that allows execution of MapReduce-style data analysis jobs directly on encrypted data. Crypsis transforms data analysis scripts written in Pig Latin so that they can be efficiently executed on encrypted data. Crypsis to that end employs existing practical partially homomorphic encryption schemes, and adopts a global perspective in that it can perform partial computations on the client side when PHE alone would fail. We outline the original program transformations underlying Crypsis for reducing the cost of data analysis computations in this larger perspective. We show practicality of our approach by evaluating Crypsis on standard benchmarks.	benchmark (computing);big data;client-side;cloud computing;computation;confidentiality;dataflow;heuristic (computer science);high- and low-level;homomorphic encryption;job stream;level design;mapreduce;microsoft outlook for mac;program transformation;sampling (signal processing);spectral leakage	Julian James Stephen;Savvas Savvides;Russell Seidel;Patrick Th.

938323e9db99654d61d840f0075b85ad6239381e	information leakage prevention in emerging technologies (mist 2012 volume 2)		The ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) infrastructure has been tremendously changed during the last couple of decades and the result made a big change in the computing environment. Due to this drastic advance, now we are enjoying a convenient living environment that we couldn’t have ever experienced before. In addition to this situation, the prospective emerging technologies such as the cloud computing and the mobile computing are newly approached and trying to realize a new life infrastructure combined with so-called a whole-cyber complex that is becoming fully connected and proportional to our real world. These results of this evolutionary transformation are part of essential components of the world with the augmented three dimensional common user interface to a single unified cyber-physical space. Even though the convenience the ICT environment gives, some accompanied adverse activities have been arisen continuously. In particular, the information leakage is a severe one of these problems. Due to the features of the digitalized data, which are pseudo-invisible and pseudo-conceptual, they tend to be more easily exposed to others than the physical resources in the traditional environment. Moreover, the situation is becoming worse because these data are extended to include such sensitive information as personal privacy and enterprise secrets. Additionally, adversaries can easily deceive legitimators though the legitimators have difficulties to detect the adversaries during a leakage happens. For example, the user passwords are stealthily duplicated through eavesdropping the keyboard inputs. Even secure USB memories are completely copied through several trials of reversing. To make the problem worse, the networked environment may also provide potential covert holes for the leakage. As the information leakage has been one of the most concerned problems in the existing ICT environment, this will still look much more serious in the new cyber-physical environment because its complex combinations of vulnerabilities may become the foundation for potential leaks. Even though many researches have been trying to evade the problem, preventing the information leakage is still more than a degree of challenge, of which technologies span from theories to practices including cryptography, access control, management, assessment and etc. As mentioned, the two representative entities in the new environment will be the cloud and the mobile, which are the server and the client in the new service space. In public cloud services, many independent people or companies may delegate processing and storing most of their own information to unauthorized remote agents and access it through the mobile clients. Unauthorized leak of critical information in this case can cause a significant damage to the agent’s reputation and to the customers’ property as well. For this special issue, we qualified the presentations in MIST20121(The 4th International Workshop on Managing Insider Security Threats held on November 8-9, 2012 at Kyushu University in Japan) and the thirteen best papers were carefully selected through several rounds of strict three reviews.

The security of Camellia against these attacks has been evaluated by upper bounds of maximum differential characteristic probability (MDCP) and maximum linear characteristic probability (MLCP) calculated by the least numbers of active S-boxes which are found by a search method[2]. However, we found some truncated differential paths generated by the method have wrong properties. We show a new evaluation method for truncated differential and linear paths to discard such wrong paths by using linear equations systems and sets of nonzero conditions. By applying this technique to Camellia, we found tighter upper bounds of MDCP and MLCP for reduced-round Camellia. As a result, 10-round Camellia without FL/FL has no differential and linear characteristic with probability higher than 2.	algorithm;block cipher;feistel cipher;linear equation;multi-storey car park;s-box;truncated differential cryptanalysis	Taizo Shirai;Shoji Kanamaru;George Abe	2002		10.1007/3-540-45661-9_10	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	-39.552990129467524	82.24290759693973	53704

The absence of face-to-face interaction increases the number of authentication challenges. The authors developed and implemented a Profile Based Authentication Framework (PBAF) with the aim to integrate learning and examination processes for secure online examinations. The PBAF approach utilizes the widely used knowledge-based authentication mechanisms: login identifier and passwords and challenge questions. These approaches are reported with a number of benefits and limitations in term of usability and security. Previous studies suggests that the use of image-based graphical authentication may provide usable and secure solution. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study, utilizing a hybrid approach combining image and text-based challenge questions in a real online learning environment. A traffic light system was implemented to improve usability of the PBAF. The traffic light system relaxed authentication constraints for a significant number of users' attempts which would otherwise be penalized (p<; 0.01). An abuse case scenario was designed to assess the security of the PBAF method against impersonation attack. The number of participants in abuse case scenario was small, however, results demonstrate that participants were able to share both text-based and image-based questions for impersonation attack.	abuse case;challenge–response authentication;computer security;graphical user interface;human–computer interaction;identifier;imperative programming;knowledge-based authentication;login;password;text-based (computing);usability	Abrar Ullah;Hannan Xiao;Trevor Barker;Mariana Lilley	2014	The 9th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2014)	10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038825	challenge–response authentication;computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-52.619843950611624	64.17223682844028	53744

In this paper, we analyze a reputation mechanism that objectively maintains accurate reputation evaluation of selfish agent-based web services. In the proposed framework, web services are ranked using their reputation as result of provided feedback reflecting consumers’ satisfaction. However, selfish web services may alter their public reputation level by managing to get fake feedback. We investigate the payoffs of different scenarios by focusing on the issues that discourage web services to act maliciously. We also analyze the details of the proposed mechanism by discussing simulation and empirical results that fully depict the system parameters and show the feasibility of the proposed approach.	agent-based model;algorithm;game theory;malware;pareto efficiency;reputation management;reputation system;robust control;simulation;web service	Jamal Bentahar;Babak Khosravifar;Mohamed Adel Serhani;Mahsa Alishahi	2012	Expert Syst.

In CP-ABE, the set of user attributes is associated with his/her secret key whereas a policy is associated with a ciphertext so that only users whose attributes satisfy the policy can decrypt the ciphertext. CP-ABE may be applied to a variety of services such as access control for file sharing systems and content distribution services. However, CP-ABE costs more for encryption and decryption in comparison with conventional public key encryption schemes since it can handle more flexible policies. In particular, wildcards, which mean that certain attributes are not relevant to the ciphertext policy, are not essential for a certain service. In this paper, we construct a partially wildcarded CP-ABE scheme with a lower decryption cost. In our scheme, the user's attributes are separated into those requiring wildcards and those not requiring wildcards. Our scheme hence embodies a CP-ABE scheme with a wildcard functionality and an efficient CP-ABE scheme without wildcard functionality. We compare our scheme with the conventional CP-ABE schemes and describe a content distribution service as an application of our scheme.	access control;attribute-based encryption;ciphertext;content delivery network;digital distribution;file sharing;key (cryptography);policy-based design;public-key cryptography;wildcard character	Go Ohtake;Yuki Hironaka;Kenjiro Kai;Yosuke Endo;Goichiro Hanaoka;Hajime Watanabe;Shota Yamada;Kohei Kasamatsu;Takashi Yamakawa;Hideki Imai	2013	2013 International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT)		multiple encryption;games;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;theoretical computer science;ciphertext indistinguishability;symmetric-key algorithm;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;deterministic encryption;silicon;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;ciphertext;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption;keyfile	Security	-41.73203925679357	70.62680381041457	53767

In this paper, we propose a proactive secure routing algorithm (PSR) to conquer the undetected compromised nodes-the compromised nodes that the system has not detected them yet. Compared with other secure routing algorithms or ideas, routing paths in PSR not only bypass the detected compromised nodes but also bypass the nodes with larger probabilities of being compromised. To estimate the probability of node compromise, we introduce a node compromise distribution model. Simulations show that PSR is effective to prevent routing path from passing compromised nodes whether detected or not.	algorithm;computer simulation;effective method;routing	Xiangqian Chen;Kia Makki;Kang Yen;Niki Pissinou;Zhifeng Liu	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664235	wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol;computer science;dynamic source routing;information security;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-53.93012774033202	76.73913246793155	53806

NIST received many submissions, 51 of which got accepted to the first round. At present, 14 candidates are left in the second round. An important criterion in the selection process is the SHA-3 hash function security and more concretely, the possible security reductions of the hash function to the security of its underlying building blocks. While some of the candidates are supported with firm security reductions, for most of the schemes these results are still incomplete. In this paper, we compare the state of the art provable security reductions of the second round candidates. We discuss all SHA-3 candidates at a high functional level, and analyze and summarize the security reduction results. Surprisingly, we derive some security bounds from the literature, which the hash function designers seem to be unaware of. Additionally, we generalize the well-known proof of collision resistance preservation, such that all SHA-3 candidates with a suffix-free padding are covered.	algorithm;collision resistance;cryptographic hash function;cryptography;hash function security summary;md5;merkle–damgård construction;preimage attack;provable security;random oracle;route distinguisher;sha-1;sha-3;whole earth 'lectronic link	Elena Andreeva;Bart Mennink;Bart Preneel	2010	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-18178-8_5	security of cryptographic hash functions;hash function;collision attack;merkle tree;sha-2;computer science;secure hash algorithm;secure hash standard;hash chain;hash buster;nist hash function competition;hash list;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;cryptographic hash function;swifft	Security	-37.23829759507718	78.74552532370332	53810

Currently, the verifier could not easily detect where the signature-verification fault was located in most schemes, if the batch verification fails. In this article, we proposed a new batch verifying multiple RSA digital signatures scheme based on a cube. The scheme can detect accurately where the signature-verification fault is located. Moreover, once the total number of signatures is fixed, the size of exponentiation operations is independent from the number of illegal signatures in our scheme. Therefore, our scheme has a better performance and higher efficiency than the previous ones. Finally, we described an extend batch verifying scheme under the condition of n-dimension.	antivirus software;digital signature;electronic signature;experiment;operation time;time complexity;type signature;verification and validation	Yanli Ren;Shuozhong Wang;Xinpeng Zhang;Min-Shiang Hwang	2015	I.

The DAA scheme developed by Brickell, Camenisch, and Chen has been adopted by the Trust Computing Group for remote anonymous attestation of Trusted Platform Module, which is a small hardware device with limited storage space and communication capability. In this paper, we provide two contributions to DAA. We first introduce simplified security notions of DAA including the formal definitions of user controlled anonymity and traceability. We then propose a new DAA scheme from elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear maps. The lengths of private keys and signatures in our scheme are much shorter than the lengths in the original DAA scheme, with a similar level of security and computational complexity. Our scheme builds upon the Camenisch–Lysyanskaya signature scheme and is efficient and provably secure in the random oracle model under the LRSW (stands for Lysyanskaya, Rivest, Sahai and Wolf) assumption and the decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption.	antivirus software;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;computational complexity theory;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman key exchange;digital signature;direct anonymous attestation;elliptic curve cryptography;entity–relationship model;integer factorization;key size;provable security;random oracle;reza iravani;traceability;trusted platform module	Ernie Brickell;Liqun Chen;Jiangtao Li	2008	International Journal of Information Security	10.1007/s10207-009-0076-3	random oracle;direct anonymous attestation;bilinear map;computer science;provable security;distributed computing;trusted platform module;elliptic curve cryptography;internet privacy;computational complexity theory;trustworthy computing;computer security	Security	-41.36415173584391	75.2790202265871	53845

The chosen biometric authentication method is the dynamic signature verification of the ID cardholder, while we use a specific integrity watermark technique we developed, called Hologram Watermark, to embed and retrieve the off-line data onto an ID card. We take advantage of the fact, that two static biometric features (images of the user's face and signature) are already integral part of ID cards for manual verification and extent the stored biometric information by embedding on-line handwriting features of the signature as holographic watermarks in the overall image information of an ID card. Manipulation of any of the image information can be detected and will further disallow biometric verification of the forger. The Hologram Watermark technique produces content-related data using computer-generated hologram coding techniques. These data are embedded with watermarking techniques into the personal data printed on an ID card. The content-related data in this specific application are the dynamic features of the cardholder's signature. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the suitability of dynamic signature verification in combination with the Hologram Watermark technique, to facilitate automated user authentication based on information transparently embedded in ID cards.© (2002) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

In this paper, we formalized the definition and security model of identity-based plaintext-checkable encryption (IBPCE) schemes, and proposed an IBPCE scheme. Furthermore, we designed an accountable mobile e-commerce (AMEC) scheme. This scheme can provide the following features: (1) users can register to the e-commerce system by using their mobile identities, such as mobile phone numbers; (2) the transactions between a buyer and a vendor are encrypted; (3) if there is a dispute, an offline adjudicator can identify who is dishonest by checking the encrypted transactions. Hence, our scheme is an ideal primitive to balance the need for privacy and accountability. In mobile e-commerce systems, users conduct transactions using wireless or Internet-based devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. It is different from traditional e-commerce systems relying on workstations or desktops, which is usually used in a fixed location. Recently, privacy and accountability have become users' primary concerns in mobile e-commerce applications. In this paper, a novel mobile e-commerce scheme is developed to address the fundamental requirements. We first propose an identity-based plaintext-checkable encryption (IBPCE) scheme where anyone can check whether a ciphertext is the encryption of a plaintext under a specific identity without knowing the secret key. Furthermore, the proposed IBPCE scheme is incorporated into the mobile e-commerce scenario, which results in an accountable mobile e-commerce (AMEC) scheme. Our proposed AMEC scheme has several superior features: (1) Users can register to the e-commerce system by using their mobile identities, such as mobile phone numbers; (2) The transactions between a buyer and a vendor are encrypted; (3) If there is a dispute, an offline adjudicator can identify who is dishonest by checking the encrypted transactions. We evaluate the proposed scheme and confirm that the new scheme can effectively balance the need for privacy and accountability.

3284696249b7214d06a8acecd046cf6a6f8c5e0e	turning online ciphers off		CAESAR has caused a heated discussion regarding the merits of one-pass encryption and online ciphers. The latter is a keyed, length preserving function which outputs ciphertext blocks as soon as the respective plaintext block is available as input. The immediacy of an online cipher affords a clear performance advantage, but it comes at a price: ciphertext blocks cannot depend on later plaintext blocks, limiting diffusion and hence security. We show how one can attain the best of both worlds by providing provably secure constructions, achieving full cipher security, based on applications of an online cipher around blockwise reordering layers. Explicitly, we show that with just two calls to the online cipher, prp security up to the birthday bound is both attainable and maximal. Moreover, we demonstrate that three calls to the online cipher suffice to obtain beyond birthday bound security. We provide a full proof of this for a prp construction, and, in the ±prp setting, security against adversaries who make queries of any single length. As part of our investigation, we extend an observation by Rogaway and Zhang by further highlighting the close relationship between online ciphers and tweakable blockciphers with variable-length tweaks.	birthday attack;block cipher;cipher security summary;ciphertext;encryption;key (cryptography);maximal set;plaintext;provable security	Elena Andreeva;Guy Barwell;Dan Page;Martijn Stam	2015	IACR Trans.

Specifically, we focus on User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) modules that track and monitor behaviors of users, IP addresses and devices in an enterprise. Anomalous behavior is automatically detected using machine learning algorithms based on Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). Such anomalous behavior indicative of potentially malicious activity is alerted to analysts with relevant contextual information for further investigation and action.

This kind of security does not protect the secrecy of the network topology against being discovered if some kind of communication has taken place. But there are several scenarios where the network topology has to be a part of the secret. In this paper we study the question of communication within a secret network where the processing nodes of the network have only partial knowledge (e.g. given as routing tables) of the topology. We introduce a model for measuring the loss of security of the topology when far distance communication takes place. A communication protocol preserves the secret of topology if no processing node can deduce additional information about the topology from the communication. We will investigate lower bounds on the knowledge that can be revealed from the communication string and show, for instance, that some knowledge about distances can always be revealed. Then, we consider routing tables. We show that several kinds of routing tables are not sufficient to guarantee the secrecy of topology. On the other hand, if a routing table allows us to specify the direction from which a message is coming, we can run a protocol solving the all-to-all communication problem such that no processing node can gain additional knowledge about the network. Finally, we investigate the problem of whether routing tables can be generated from the local knowledge of the processing nodes without losing the secrecy of the network topology with respect to the resulting knowledge base. It will be shown that this is not possible for static networks and most kinds of dynamic networks. c © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Typically, ad hoc networks are deployed in un-trusted environments. Consequently, authentication is a precursor to any secure interactions in these networks. Recently, numerous authentication protocols have been proposed for ad hoc networks. To date, there is no common framework to evaluate these protocols. Towards developing such a framework, this paper proposes a generic authentication process and a new taxonomy that clarifies similarities and differences among authentication protocols reported in the literature. The taxonomy is based upon the role of nodes in the authentication function, establishment of credentials, and type of credentials. We also motivate the need for an authentication management architecture and discuss some open research issues.	authentication protocol;credential;hoc (programming language);interaction;open research;sensor;taxonomy (general)	Nidal Aboudagga;Mohamed Tamer Refaei;Mohamed Eltoweissy;Luiz A.

af09bfaf085771bb1663552c7110ef848bde9f3b	messages in a concealed bottle: achieving query content privacy with accurate location-based services		"""Query privacy has led to a serious concern for location-based services (LBSs). Existing mainstream schemes preserve query privacy by either introducing a third party or degrading the accuracy of LBS. To address these deficiencies, we propose a scheme named <italic>the content sealed bottle</italic> in this paper for the users to get accurate LBSs while the server learns zero knowledge on the query content. To realize this objective, the Euclidean distance based on homomorphic encryption is used to signal the difference between the query attribute vector of a user and each database attribute vector of the server; then, a Boolean circuit is designed to identify the exact match for the query attribute vector. By optimizing the traditional subcircuits, the total number of non-XOR gates, which is the main cost during the matching process, can be reduced by a factor of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$l$</tex-math> </inline-formula> compared to that of the traditional <italic>M</italic>-to-1 MIN subcircuit, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$l$</tex-math></inline-formula> is the input bit length of the Boolean circuit. Finally, the computationally private information retrieval technique is employed to privately retrieve the points-of-interest set. To the best of our knowledge, our <italic>content sealed bottle</italic> is the first scheme that can achieve cost-effective query privacy preservation without the involvement of a third party or sacrificing the accuracy of LBSs.

A security extension DNSSEC has been proposed to introduce the public-key authentication, but it is still on the deployment phase. DNSSEC assumes IP fragmentation allowance for exchange of its messages over UDP large payloads. IP fragments are often blocked on network packet filters for administrative reasons, and the blockage may prevent fast exchange of DNSSEC messages. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect the UDP large-payload transfer capability between two DNSSEC hosts. The proposed detection scheme does not require new protocol elements of DNS and DNSSEC, so it is applicable by solely modifying the application software and configuration. The scheme allows faster capability detection to probe the end-to-end communication capability between two DNS hosts by transferring a large UDP DNS message. The DNS software can choose the maximum transmission unit (MTU) on the application level using the probed detection results. Implementation test results show that the proposed scheme shortens the detection and transition time on fragment-blocked transports. key words: DNS, DNSSEC, IP fragmentation, application MTU discovery	decibel;domain name system security extensions;end-to-end principle;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);ip fragmentation;key authentication;network packet;network security;progressive enhancement;public-key cryptography;rise time;software deployment;strong authentication	Kenji Rikitake;Koji Nakao;Shinji Shimojo;Hiroki Nogawa	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietisy/e91-d.5.1261	dns zone transfer;telecommunications;computer science;authentication;computer security;domain name system;computer network	Security	-57.92657499809389	71.26755049961015	54346

Vaguely, a cryptographic protocol is a mean whereby two or more people can interact in such a manner as to exchange a certain amount of information, while keeping other information secret (either from one of the participants or from another party). One interesting task for which one would like a protocol is the """"oblivious transfer"""" introduced by Rabin in [4]. This involves two parties A and B; A would like to send a message of some sort to B, with the constraint that B has a 50% chance of receiving the message, and the other half of the time B receives no information at all about the message. The additional constraint is that A has no idea whether or not B received the message. Oblivious transfer can be viewed as a special type of coin tossing. Although it is not useful in and of itself, it appears to be very useful as a means towards other ends, and in fact has been used in a number of other protocols by a number of different researchers [1]-[3]. In [4], Rabin proposed a protocol for the oblivious transfer. It was intended that the protocol be correct, assuming only that it is hard to factor certain large composite numbers. However, as described below, there is a potential flaw in his protocol; it is possible that B can cheat and obtain extra information from A, even if the assumption about the difficulty of factoring is true. Although we cannot prove that B can cheat in this way, no one has yet been able to prove that B cannot. In Section 4 we present a new protocol for the oblivious transfer. It is similar to Rabin's, but we fix the potential flaw so that it is possible to prove that our protocol works, subject only to the assumption about the difficulty of factoring."""	communications protocol;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;flaw hypothesis methodology;integer factorization;oblivious transfer	Michael J.

Security in distributed systems can be divided into two parts. One part concerns the communication between users and processes, possibly residing on different machines. The principal mechanism for ensuring secure communication is that of a secure channel and via authorization.  In this research paper, we focus on the study of several encryption algorithms for security in distributed systems. The RSA algorithm has some important parameters affecting its level of security. It is shown here that increasing the modules length plays an important role in increasing the complexity of decomposing it into its factors.  This will increase the length of the public key and the length of the encrypted message making it more difficult to be decrypted without knowing the decryption key. However the public key length has no major affect on the private key length. When the length of the message is changed then the length of the encrypted message will proportionally change, hence larger chunks are selected to obtain larger encrypted message to increase the security of the data in use.	algorithm;authorization;data in use;distributed computing;encryption;key (cryptography);mind;process (computing);public-key cryptography;rsa (cryptosystem);secure channel;secure communication	P.

069151e128addc4080f2a8cbbe39a3085be82b47	a novel honeypot based security approach for real-time intrusion detection and prevention systems		Abstract In the digitalized modern world in parallel to the new technological developments, information security has become the highest priority in the individual and institutional sense. In order to ensure the security of information systems, various systems are used techniques and technologies, including encryption, authorization, firewall, honeypot based systems. In this study, a honeypot based approach for intrusion detection/prevention systems (ID/PS) is proposed. The developed honeypot server application is combined with IDSs to analyze data in real-time and to operate effectively. Moreover, by associating the advantages of low and high-interaction honeypots, a superior hybrid honeypot system is performed. Therefore, in order to reduce the cost of configuration, maintenance, and management, after viewing the usage of honeypots on corporate networks, virtualization technologies are used. The developed system is a honeypot based intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) type and it is able to show the network traffic on servers visually in real-time animation. Thereby, it provides system information easily. Finally, the developed system can detect zero-day attack due to the configuration of intrusion detection, which makes it superior in performance compared to other IDSs. This system also helps in reducing the false positive level in IDSs.	honeypot (computing);intrusion detection system;real-time transcription	Muhammet Baykara;Resul Das	2018	J. Inf. Sec.

The drawback of this approach is that it compromises the user's privacy. Malicious authorities can collect user's attributes by tracing the user GID, thus compromises the privacy of the user. The other privacy concern is access structures that sent along with ciphertext in traditional CP-ABE schemes may have sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a multi-authority ABE scheme with fully hidden access structure that authorities can get nothing about user GID when generating and issuing user private keys and access structures are hidden to receivers. We prove the security of our scheme under a standard complexity assumption of decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. The access structure we used in our scheme is AND, OR gates on multi-valued attributes.	access structure;attribute-based encryption;ciphertext	Huiling Qian;Jiguo Li;Yichen Zhang	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-02726-5_26	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Crypto	-41.76781683942414	71.08039740197995	54555

We focus here on the case of perfectly-secure VSS where the number of corrupted parties t satisfies t < n/3, with n being the total number of parties. Work of Gennaro et al. (STOC 2001) and Fitzi et al. (TCC 2006) shows that, assuming a broadcast channel, 3 rounds are necessary and sufficient for efficient VSS. The efficient 3-round protocol of Fitzi et al., however, treats the broadcast channel as being available “for free” and does not attempt to minimize its usage. This approach leads to relatively poor round complexity when protocols are compiled for a point-to-point network. We show here a VSS protocol that is simultaneously optimal in terms of both the number of rounds and the number of invocations of broadcast. Our protocol also has a certain “2-level sharing” property that makes it useful for constructing protocols for general secure computation.	compiler;fibre channel point-to-point;secure multi-party computation;symposium on theory of computing;verifiable secret sharing	Jonathan Katz;Chiu-Yuen Koo;Ranjit Kumaresan	2007	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_41	point-to-point;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;secret sharing;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-37.23674637111015	75.12243195287944	54573

Such vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are important to enhance traffic safety since critical environmental conditions, such as road or traffic conditions, can be rapidly exchanged between vehicles in VANETs. However, to be useful for the driver, the information must be reliable, i.e., with great probability, the received information indeed reflects the actual situation. One approach to this is to regard information as reliable if it is confirmed by various sources. To achieve this, messages received must be distinguishable. This may become a threat against the privacy of drivers since by observing messages, vehicles may be traced. In this paper, we address the mentioned problems. We base the reliability of information on the number of different sources that confirmed specific information, and that number must be greater than a given threshold. We address the nontraceability by letting vehicles change their identity frequently. Our approach scales with respect to storage on the vehicle, as well as management of identities at a certification authority.	certificate authority;hoc (programming language)	Gina Kounga;Thomas Walter;Sven Lachmund	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.2010325	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;information security;authentication;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-46.815393613596164	78.88809443079884	54619

In this paper, we suggest a technique for traffic anomaly detection based on analyzing correlation of destination IP addresses in outgoing traffic at an egress router. This address correlation data are transformed through discrete wavelet transform for effective detection of anomalies through statistical analysis. Our techniques can be employed for postmortem and real-time analysis of outgoing network traffic at a campus edge. Results from trace-driven evaluation suggest that proposed approach could provide an effective means of detecting anomalies close to the network. We also present data analyzing the correlation of port numbers as a means of detecting anomalies.	aggregate function;amortized analysis;anomaly detection;discrete wavelet transform;egress filtering;egress router;network traffic control;norm (social);real-time clock;router (computing);sensor	Seong Soo Kim;A.

f27ad44801f1be2c35a0b512b3cbfdce2a2c643f	on the security of the schnorr signature scheme and dsa against related-key attacks		In the ordinary security model for signature schemes, we consider an adversary that may forge a signature on a new message using only his knowledge of other valid message and signature pairs. To take into account side channel attacks such as tampering or faultinjection attacks, Bellare and Kohno (Eurocrypt 2003) formalized relatedkey attacks (RKA), where stronger adversaries are considered. In RKA for signature schemes, the adversary can also manipulate the signing key and obtain signatures for the modified key. This paper considers RKA security of two established signature schemes: the Schnorr signature scheme and (a well-known variant of) DSA.

Second, we demonstrate that, on the other hand, neither the Schnorr signature scheme nor DSA achieves the standard notion of RKA security, by showing concrete attacks on these. Lastly, we show that a slight modification of both the Schnorr signature scheme and (the considered variant of) DSA yields fully RKA	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;antivirus software;computational complexity theory;dictionary attack;digital signature;eurocrypt;forge;linear function;mihir bellare;polynomial;provable security;public-key cryptography;random oracle;related-key attack;scheme;schnorr group;side-channel attack	Hiraku Morita;Jacob C.

0183c45c9f36054c922e9721d6584127ce453b86	rflow+: an sdn-based wlan monitoring and management framework		In this work, we propose an SDN-based WLAN monitoring and management framework called RFlow+ to address WiFi service dissatisfaction caused by the limited view (lack of scalability) of network traffic monitoring and absence of intelligent and timely network treatments. Existing solutions (e.g., OpenFlow and sFlow) have limited view, no generic flow description, and poor trade-off between measurement accuracy and network overhead depending on the selection of the sampling rate. To resolve these issues, we devise a two-level counting mechanism, namely a distributed local counter (on-site and real-time) and central collector (a summation of local counters). With this, we proposed a highly scalable monitoring and management framework to handle immediate actions based on short-term (e.g., 50 ms) monitoring and eventual actions based on long-term (e.g., 1 month) monitoring. The former uses the local view of each access point (AP), and the latter uses the global view of the collector. Experimental results verify that RFlow+ can achieve high accuracy (less than 5% standard error for short-term and less than 1% for long-term) and fast detection of flows of interest (within 23 ms) with manageable network overhead. We prove the practicality of RFlow+ by showing the effectiveness of a MAC flooding attacker quarantine in a real-world testbed.	hogging and sagging;mac flooding;network packet;openflow;overhead (computing);real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);scalability;software-defined networking;testbed;wireless access point	RhongHo Jang;DongGyu Cho;Youngtae Noh;DaeHun Nyang	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8056995		Mobile	-59.95659748162157	70.55328494982734	54943

To mitigate the damage of secret key exposure, forward-secure signature schemes and threshold signature schemes are devised. Forward-secure signature schemes address the key exposure problem by dividing the usage life time of the public key into discrete time periods and using different secret keys in different periods, such that all signatures generated in previous time periods with old secret keys are still considered valid even if the current secret key is compromised. Threshold signature schemes lower the chance of complete exposure of the secret by sharing it among different entities. Combining these properties enhances the security of the whole scheme and is particularly useful in an ad-hoc network environment where the security and the availability of a single certificate authority is not guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a robust forward-secure threshold signature scheme based on multiplicative secret sharing. When compared to the existing schemes, our scheme is more efficient in key updates and use fewer communication rounds in signing. The security of our threshold scheme is reducible to the security of the scheme in single user settings, which has been already proven to be secure under the random oracle model.	certificate authority;digital signature;entity;hoc (programming language);key (cryptography);public-key cryptography;random oracle;secret sharing;type signature	Sherman S.

What makes them especially attractive, is that they work equally well in a concurrent setting, which is notoriously hard for interactive zero-knowledge protocols. However, while for interactive zeroknowledge we know how to construct statistical zero-knowledge argument systems for all NP languages, for non-interactive zero-knowledge, this problem remained open since the inception of NIZK in the late 1980’s. Here we resolve two problems regarding NIZK: – We construct the first perfect NIZK argument system for any NP language. – We construct the first UC-secure NIZK argument for any NP language in the presence of a dynamic/adaptive adversary. While it is already known how to construct efficient prover computational NIZK proofs for any NP language, the known techniques yield large common reference strings and large proofs. Another contribution of this paper is NIZK proofs with much shorter common reference string and proofs than previous constructions.	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;common reference string model;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;cryptosystem;digital signature;interactivity;non-interactive zero-knowledge proof;randomness;regular expression;uc browser	Alfredo De Santis;Giovanni Di Crescenzo;Giuseppe Persiano	1999		10.1007/3-540-48523-6_24	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;algorithm	Crypto	-37.79306397538969	75.69452858017122	55048
ac9516a589901f1421e8ce905dd8bc5b689317ca	a practical framework for executing complex queries over encrypted multimedia data		Over the last few years, data storage in cloud based services has been very popular due to easy management and monetary advantages of cloud computing. Recent developments showed that such data could be leaked due to various attacks. To address some of these attacks, encrypting sensitive data before sending to cloud emerged as an important protection mechanism. If the data is encrypted with traditional techniques, selective retrieval of encrypted data becomes challenging. To address this challenge, efficient searchable encryption schemes have been developed over the years. Almost all of the existing searchable encryption schemes are developed for keyword searches and require running some code on the cloud servers. However, many of the existing cloud storage services (e.g., Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, etc.) only allow simple data object retrieval and do not provide computational support needed to realize most of the searchable encryption schemes. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient execution of complex search queries over wide range of encrypted data types (e.g., image files) without requiring customized computational support from the cloud servers. To this end, we provide an extensible framework for supporting complex search queries over encrypted multimedia data. Before any data is uploaded to the cloud, important features are extracted to support different query types (e.g., extracting facial features to support face recognition queries) and complex queries are converted to series of object retrieval tasks for cloud service. Our results show that this framework may support wide range of image retrieval queries on encrypted data with little overhead and without any change to underlying data storage services.	cloud computing;cloud storage;computer data storage;cryptography;dropbox;encryption;facial recognition system;google drive;image retrieval;overhead (computing);protection mechanism;provable security;search engine indexing;server (computing);web search query	Fahad Shaon;Murat Kantarcioglu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-41483-6_14	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-40.4392096463076	67.1727073528687	55054

In this paper, we focus on two-party identitybased AKA schemes in the escrow mode, and present a strongly secure escrowable identity-based AKA protocol which captures all basic desirable security properties including perfect forward secrecy, ephemeral secrets reveal resistance and so on. The protocol is provably secure in the extended Canetti-Krawczyk model, and its security can be reduced to the standard computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. Assuming no adversary can obtain the master private key for the escrow mode, our scheme is secure as long as each party has at least one uncompromised secret. Also, we present two strongly secure variants of the protocol, which are computationally more efficient than the original scheme.	adversary (cryptography);authentication;bilinear filtering;communications protocol;computational diffie–hellman assumption;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;forward secrecy;key-agreement protocol;provable security;public-key cryptography;random oracle;session key	Liang Ni;Gongliang Chen;Jianhua Li;Yanyan Hao	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4520-4	computer science;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-41.64822490628165	75.46839860862129	55115

Unfortunately, this market-centric model is affected by several major security and trust issues, due to the fact that anyone can easily create, and deploy through the market, a malicious app that could potentially lead to a massive malware spread.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we propose a framework to classify Android malware based upon the concept of common patterns of actions executed by malicious applications. The basic idea is to extract, from known malware, a subset of frequent subgraphs of system calls that are executed by most of the malware. This set of subgraphs constitutes a database of known malicious features. Then, when a new application is downloaded from a market, it is first run in a sandbox to monitor its behavior. This will result in an execution trace that may contain some of the subgraphs previously found in malware. The resulting vector of the found subgraphs is given to a classifier that returns its decision in terms of a likely malware or not. Preliminary tests executed both on known good apps and malware confirm the effectiveness and quality of our proposal.	algorithm;android;criticality matrix;feature selection;high-level programming language;malware;mined;pattern recognition;system call	Fabio Martinelli;Andrea Saracino;Daniele Sgandurra	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-54568-9_17	computer science;cryptovirology;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	SE	-57.982335855655826	60.51737535067958	55148

This results in tremendous amounts of rich user-generated data. This data provides opportunities for researchers and service providers to study and better understand usersu0027 behaviors and further improve the quality of the personalized services. Publishing user-generated data risks exposing individualsu0027 privacy. Users privacy in social media is an emerging task and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. These works study privacy issues in social media from the two different points of views: identification of vulnerabilities, and mitigation of privacy risks. Recent research has shown the vulnerability of user-generated data against the two general types of attacks, identity disclosure and attribute disclosure. These privacy issues mandate social media data publishers to protect usersu0027 privacy by sanitizing user-generated data before publishing it. Consequently, various protection techniques have been proposed to anonymize user-generated social media data. There is a vast literature on privacy of users in social media from many perspectives. In this survey, we review the key achievements of user privacy in social media. In particular, we review and compare the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the privacy leakage attacks and anonymization algorithms. We overview the privacy risks from different aspects of social media and categorize the relevant works into five groups 1) graph data anonymization and de-anonymization, 2) author identification, 3) profile attribute disclosure, 4) user location and privacy, and 5) recommender systems and privacy issues. We also discuss open problems and future research directions for user privacy issues in social media.	algorithm;attribute grammar;categorization;data anonymization;de-anonymization;graph coloring;identity provider;information sensitivity;information source;internet privacy;online service provider;personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy;recommender system;social media;spectral leakage;table (information);text corpus;tracing (software);user-generated content;world wide web	Ghazaleh Beigi;Huan Liu	2018	CoRR		service provider;internet privacy;computer security;recommender system;categorization;popularity;computer science;social media;publishing;data anonymization;vulnerability	DB	-41.64424408817976	62.74300974871506	55292

The benefit of this paradigm is, on one hand to avoid the sensitive information leakage when individual devices failed or lost, on the other hand to make only the authorized users access and share the delegated information online anytime and anywhere. However, in this paradigm the critical problems to be resolved are to guarantee both the privacy of delegated individual information and the privacy of authorized users, and what is more important to afford the owners of communication devices to have high level of control and power to create their own particular access control policies. In this paper, we present an approach to implement the personalized access control at third service provider in a privacy preserving way. Our approach implements the critical problems above in this paradigm by using selective encryption, blind signature and the combination of role based access control and discretionary access control.	access control service;anytime algorithm;authorization;blind signature;contact list;discretionary access control;encryption;high-level programming language;information leakage;information sensitivity;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;personalization;privacy;programming paradigm;role-based access control;spectral leakage	XiuXia Tian;Chaofeng Sha;Xiaoling Wang;Aoying Zhou	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Web Services	10.1109/ICWS.2011.46	information privacy;computer science;authorization;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-43.690544273395844	66.2041783562968	55320

However, sensor networks are susceptible to various attacks because they are deployed in open and unprotected environments. It is necessary to use effective mechanisms to protect sensor nodes against attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure code update mechanism over the energy-efficient minimum virtual backbone reducing the number of broadcasting packets using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values. We also propose a group key establishment and rekeying mechanism which provides authentication among the entities for code update. Our mechanism considers all security requirements such as confidentiality, integrity and authentication to defend the battery exhaustion attack, DoS attacks, the routing attacks, etc. during the code update. Simulation results show that our mechanism significantly reduces the number of transmitted messages, the energy consumption and the computation overhead for the secure code update in comparison to other existing secure code update mechanisms. We also prove that our group key mechanism is efficient and much more secure than compared ones.	group key;internet backbone;key management	Inshil Doh;Jiyoung Lim;Kijoon Chae	2013	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2012.04.001	wireless sensor network;information security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-51.229264395958815	76.76193032754479	55328

Traditional healthcare systems rely on cloud computing servers for back-end storage and processing. However, cloud servers are heavily vulnerable to privacy threats and the problem is even more intense as physiological data carry sensitive information. To resolve the aforementioned issue, this letter proposes the blind cloud framework. The goal is to take advantage of the enormous computing and storage abilities of the cloud servers, and yet maintain data anonymity simultaneously. To preserve the privacy of the medical data, the cloud server is forcefully blinded, i.e., the identities of the patients are masked off and a pseudo-identity is generated, thereby, obtaining unidentified in-cloud data for storage and analysis. We also propose a parallel method to be executed within the non-cloud servers for efficient and lossless identity management and retrieval. Results indicate that the performance of the processes of pseudo-identity generation and identity retrieval is independent of the data volumes, and negligibly vary with the increase in the number of the clients of the system.	cloud computing;experiment;identity management;information sensitivity;lossless compression;network packet;privacy;server (computing);virtual private server	Subhadeep Sarkar;Subarna Chatterjee;Sudip Misra;Rajesh Kudupudi	2017	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2739141	computer network;anonymity;computer security;computer science;information sensitivity;cloud computing;identity management;cloud computing security;server;lossless compression	DB	-42.779756482065935	65.76443127060709	55389

However, existing anonymity systems are designed for the Internet environment, which suffer from high computational and network resource consumption and deliver low performance, thus failing to be directly deployed in data centers. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient and easily deployed anonymity scheme for SDN-based data centers, called MIC. The main idea behind MIC is to conceal the communication participants by modifying the source/destination addresses (such as MAC, IP and port) at switch nodes, so as to achieve anonymity. Compared with the traditional overlay-based approaches, our in-network scheme has shorter transmission paths and less intermediate operations, thus achieving higher performance with less overhead. We also propose a collision avoidance mechanism to ensure the correctness of routing, and two mechanisms to enhance the traffic-analysis resistance. Our security analysis demonstrates that MIC ensures unlinkability and improves traffic-analysis resistance. Our experiments show that MIC has extremely low overhead compared with the base-line TCP (or SSL), e.g., less than 1% overhead in terms of throughput.	collision detection;correctness (computer science);data center;experiment;failure;internet;multicast;network planning and design;overhead (computing);routing;software-defined networking;throughput;tor messenger;traffic analysis;transport layer security	Tingwei Zhu;Dan Feng;Yu Hua;Fang Wang;Qingyu Shi;Jiahao Liu	2016	2016 45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)	10.1109/ICPP.2016.9	routing;computer science;information security;manganese;operating system;distributed computing;resistance;computer security;computer network	Networks	-56.36750494040863	70.98188781716934	55428

Misusing this feature, malicious nodes cooperate with normal nodes to disrupt network operation and reduce its efficiency. These nodes attack other network nodes and prevent being detected by other nodes through using the mobility characteristic of nodes in MANETs. One of the effective ways to detect malicious nodes is using game theory. Focusing on this issue, in this paper, an approach is presented for malicious node detection using Games Theory. Data exchange between two nodes forms a game, and the history of the successful and unsuccessful sending/receiving of data, is stored to be used for future decisions. Malicious nodes are detected by the game components, sent and received data as well as information that have been stored in different stages. The experimental results indicate that if the density of malicious nodes approximately reaches 20%, and the game is repeated more than four times between neighboring nodes, the proposed approach raises the malicious node detection rate to 91%. However, if the density of malicious nodes is more than 30%, the algorithm can detect more than 87% of them after being repeated six times.	algorithm;download;game theory;hoc (programming language);malware	Yaser Taheri;Hossein Gharaee Garakani;Naser MohammadZadeh	2016	J.

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution.

5d02dbe3abb6b811693d018c825f6883859bf53f	a design of secure and reliablewireless transmission channel for implantable medical devices		Implantable medical devices (IMDs) have increasing impact in people’s life nowadays. With the development of electrical and computer engineering, the IMDs are of great convenience to patients by their small sizes and portable wireless monitors or controllers. However, because of the insecure wireless communication between the devices and their controllers, it makes way for attackers to passively and actively attack the devices and so the patients. Unlike other attacks which target on victims’ information or property, the medical attacks threat victims’ life directly. Up to now there are few efficient solutions to those attacks which balance security, reliability, and power consumption. In response to the situation, this paper proposes a scheme against the existing and potential attacks to IMDs while keeping a low overhead in hardware and power consumption.	computer engineering;overhead (computing)	Lake Bu;Mark G.

Nowadays, several platforms (such as the FVC-onGoing) exist to assess the performance of such systems. Despite this, none platform exists for the security evaluation of biometric systems. Hence, the aim of this paper is to present an on-line platform for the security evaluation of biometric systems. The key benefits of the presented platform are twofold. First, it provides the research community in biometrics an evaluation tool to assess biometric systems in term of security. Second, the platform provides a database of common threats and vulnerabilities of biometric systems that can be updated by researchers feedbacks. The presented tool is modality-independent. A keystroke dynamics system is used to illustrate the benefits of the presented platform.	authentication;biometrics;database;event (computing);fingerprint verification competition;interpreter (computing);keystroke dynamics;modality (human–computer interaction);online and offline	Mohamad El-Abed;Patrick Lacharme;Christophe Rosenberger	2012	2012 5th IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)	10.1109/ICB.2012.6199793	database index;risk management;computer science;archaeology;authentication;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;biometrics;measurement	SE	-52.17187258503282	65.16663258564593	55697

The family Γ of authorized sets is called the access structure. To design new cryptographic protocols, we introduce in this work the concept of extension of an access structure: given a monotone family $${{\it \Gamma} \subset 2^\mathcal{P}}$$ and a larger set $${\mathcal{P}^{\prime} = \mathcal{P} \cup \tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$$ , a monotone access structure $${{\it \Gamma}^{\prime}\subset 2^{\mathcal{P}^{\prime}}}$$ is an extension of Γ if the following two conditions are satisfied: (1) The set $${\mathcal{P}}$$ is a minimal subset of Γ′, i.e. $${\mathcal{P} \in {\it \Gamma}^{\prime}}$$ and $${\mathcal{P} - \{R_i\}\notin {\it \Gamma}^{\prime}}$$ for every $${R_i \in \mathcal{P}}$$ , (2) A subset $${A \subset \mathcal{P}}$$ is in Γ if and only if the subset $${A \cup \tilde{\mathcal{P}}}$$ is in Γ′. As our first contribution, we give an explicit construction of an extension Γ′ of a vector space access structure Γ, and we prove that Γ′ is also a vector space access structure. Although the definition may seem a bit artificial at first, it is well motivated from a cryptographic point of view. Indeed, our second contribution is to show that the concept of extension of an access structure can be used to design encryption schemes with access structures that are chosen ad-hoc at the time of encryption. Specifically, we design and analyze a dynamic distributed encryption scheme and a ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme. In some cases, the new schemes enjoy better properties than existing ones.	access structure;attribute-based encryption;authorization;ciphertext;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;dummy variable (statistics);hoc (programming language);linear algebra;point of view (computer hardware company);secret sharing;monotone	Vanesa Daza;Javier Herranz;Paz Morillo;Carla Ràfols	2010	Applicable Algebra in Engineering, Communication and Computing	10.1007/s00200-010-0125-1	discrete mathematics;vector space;theoretical computer science;cryptographic protocol;mathematics;secret sharing;algorithm;attribute-based encryption;satisfiability	Theory	-40.151556434042746	74.91259015939215	55722
2c1ed41f733efb0da003bd35cf77ed2d94136902	technical perspective - reframing security for the web	reframing security;technical perspective	thE WEB has brought exciting new functionality while simultaneously requiring new mechanisms to make it secure. We’ve repeatedly discovered that these mechanisms are not good enough, as clever hackers and academics have figured out how to circumvent and misuse them to compromise security. We now live in a world in which viewing an advertisement might compromise your bank account. In the following paper, “Securing Frame Communication in Browsers,” researchers Adam Barth, Collin Jackson, and John Mitchell not only illustrate how subtle some of these security vulnerabilities can be, they show how to solve them in a principled way. This paper has had a real impact: their solutions have already been widely adopted. Why is Web security difficult? It’s because the Web browser is a place where programs and data from different sources interact. Each source may control resources whose security can be affected by the programs and data from other sources. In fact, there is a deep, underlying problem that has never been satisfactorily solved: how to securely permit fine-grained sharing and communication between programs from mutually distrusting sources. Conventionally, security was considered the job of the operating system. But the granularity of operating system enforcement is far too coarse for Web applications, whose security depends on the precise details of the interactions between application-level data structures such as frames, cookies, and interpreted application code. Web security forces us to think anew about the problem of fine-grained sharing across trust domains because many exciting new applications and services require this sharing. Some of the techniques developed for operating system security, such as controlled communication between processes, can be adapted to the Web. But Web security poses new challenges as well. For example, Web security violations can occur within the context of a single Web page, which often comprises multiple frames controlled by code from different sources. These frames may be third-party advertisements or integrated content from multiple parties who do not trust each other; the many mashups based on Google Maps are examples of the latter. The absence of effective solutions to the problem of fine-grained interaction between trust domains—coexisting on the very same Web page—has left Web applications vulnerable. Fortunately, researchers like Barth, Jackson, and Mitchell are applying principled methods to identify and eliminate these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities they address arise from the feature of frame navigation in Web browsers. Code running in one frame (that is, one trust domain) can control where another frame loads its content from. The authors use elegant reasoning to identify the most permissive secure policy for controlling frame navigation. This argument is so simple and convincing that the policy they identify has been adopted by most major browsers. In itself, this would be a significant contribution, but the paper goes farther. It newly identifies vulnerabilities in two important mechanisms for communication between different frames; one of these mechanisms is in the HTML 5 standard. The paper gives a thoughtful and principled analysis of each communication mechanism and identifies a fix for each. These fixes have also been adopted by current browsers and communication libraries. The paper is a great example of research that has impact precisely because it offers principled solutions. Too often, proposed computer security mechanisms merely raise the bar against attacks, starting the next phase of an arms race. This is a different kind of work—work that clearly identifies and convincingly solves a real security problem. The work described in this paper makes our lives more secure and helps the next generation of applications to be built securely. And their work also helps us understand how to think about the new security challenges that lie ahead.	coat of arms;computer security;data structure;framing (world wide web);html5;http cookie;interaction;internet security;interpreted language;jackson;library (computing);mashup (web application hybrid);mitchell corporation;next-generation network;operating system;principle of good enough;vulnerability (computing);web application;web page;world wide web	Andrew C.

550e5a935b129370f2d4442dfd946911b07df3cd	software implementation and evaluation of lightweight symmetric block ciphers of the energy perspectives and memory		Lightweight ciphers are the form of encryption that strictly limited to devices such as tags, RFID, wireless sensor networks applications. Low-resource devices has many limitations in power, energy and memory. In this work, the lightweight block ciphers is implemented on the Atmega128 microprocessor and the results of the energy perspectives and memory were assessed. The results of the evaluation show that the SPECK(64,96) cipher has been the best value of the perspective of energy and is appropriate for wireless sensor networks with the main requirement of energy. If the measure is memory usage, the TWINE-80 is the most appropriate implemented lightweight ciphers on the Atmega128 microprocessor. The SPECK(64,96) cipher is in third place of the perspective of consumer memory. In other side, TWINE-80 cipher is In the second place of the perspective of energy.

651d15e1787a79369467e595317faa43b3e46d6e	classification of high-order boolean masking schemes and improvements of their efficiency		This article provides an in-depth study of high-order (HO) Boolean masking countermeasure against side-channel attacks. We introduce the notion of HO-CPA immunity as a metric to characterize a leakage function. We show that this notion intervenes to assess both the resistance against HO-CPA attacks and the amount of leakage. Namely, the HO-CPA immunity, denoted HCI ∈ N, coincides with the lowest order of a successful HO-CPA and gives the dependence of leakage behavior with the noise’s variance σ (according to O(1/σ) in Landau notation). Then, we introduce the technique of leakage squeezing. It is an optimization of the straightforward masking where masks are recoded relevantly by bijections. Our main contribution is to show that the HOCPA immunity of a masking countermeasure can be incremented by one or even by two at virtually no added cost. Indeed, the bijections (and inverse bijections) can be incorporated in tables that are often found in cryptographic algorithms (e.g. substitution boxes).	algorithm;boolean satisfiability problem;cryptography;human–computer interaction;information theory;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;s-box;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;variable shadowing	Houssem Maghrebi;Sylvain Guilley;Claude Carlet;Jean-Luc Danger	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive			Crypto	-37.73943500398718	82.54783345822388	55906

However, data owners also have concerns on data privacy due to the lost control of the infrastructure. This demonstration shows a prototype for efficient and confidential range/kNN query services built on top of the random space perturbation (RASP) method. The RASP approach provides a privacy guarantee practical to the setting of cloudbased computing, while enabling much faster query processing compared to the encryption-based approach. This demonstration will allow users to more intuitively understand the technical merits of the RASP approach via interactive exploration of the visual interface.	cloud computing;confidentiality;database;encryption;ibm notes;information privacy;prototype;random-access stored-program machine;scalability	Zohreh Alavi;Lu Zhou;James Powers;Keke Chen	2014	PVLDB	10.14778/2733004.2733061	computer science;data mining;database;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-40.7839767643386	66.53342146409624	56023

In this work we propose two one-time proxy signature schemes with different security properties. Unlike other existing one-time proxy signatures that are constructed from public key cryptography, our proposed schemes are based one-way functions without trapdoors and so they inherit the communication and computation efficiency from the traditional one-time signatures. Although from a verifier point of view, signatures generated by the proxy are indistinguishable from those created by the primary signer, a trusted authority can be equipped with an algorithm that allows the authority to settle disputes between the signers. In our constructions, we use a combination of one-time signatures, oblivious transfer protocols and certain combinatorial objects.

We suggest several NIZK proof systems based on prime order groups with a bilinear map. We obtain linear size proofs for relations among group elements without going through an expensive reduction to an NP-complete language such as Circuit Satisfiability. Security of all our constructions is based on the decisional linear assumption. The NIZK proof system is quite general and has many applications such as digital signatures, verifiable encryption and group signatures. We focus on the latter and get the first group signature scheme satisfying the strong security definition of Bellare, Shi and Zhang [7] in the standard model without random oracles where each group signature consists only of a constant number of group elements. We also suggest a simulation-sound NIZK proof of knowledge, which is much more efficient than previous constructions in the literature. Caveat: The constants are large, and therefore our schemes are not practical. Nonetheless, we find it very interesting for the first time to have NIZK proofs and group signatures that except for a constant factor are optimal without using the random oracle model to argue security.	bilinear filtering;circuit satisfiability problem;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;decision linear assumption;digital signature;electronic signature;encryption;formal verification;group signature;mihir bellare;np-completeness;non-interactive zero-knowledge proof;proof calculus;proof of knowledge;random oracle;simulation;type signature	Jens Groth	2006		10.1007/11935230_29	random oracle;discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;database;mathematics;distributed computing;group signature;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-42.06454627992037	77.64306609952254	56138
be3863562bd36ad96ebc90d63e8eee7f85913a51	phishmon: a machine learning framework for detecting phishing webpages		Despite numerous research efforts, phishing attacks remain prevalent and highly effective in luring unsuspecting users to reveal sensitive information, including account credentials and social security numbers. In this paper, we propose PhishMon, a new feature-rich machine learning framework to detect phishing webpages. It relies on a set of fifteen novel features that can be efficiently computed from a webpage without requiring third-party services, such as search engines, or WHOIS servers. These features capture various characteristics of legitimate web applications as well as their underlying web infrastructures. Emulation of these features is costly for phishers as it demands to spend significantly more time and effort on their underlying infrastructures and web applications; in addition to the efforts required for replicating the appearance of target websites. Through extensive evaluation on a dataset consisting of 4,800 distinct phishing and 17,500 distinct benign webpages, we show that PhishMon can distinguish unseen phishing from legitimate webpages with a very high degree of accuracy. In our experiments, PhishMon achieved 95.4% accuracy with 1.3% false positive rate on a dataset containing unique phishing instances.

f4ceecc969599270330c429aa98adf9784a031ca	new collision attacks on round-reduced keccak		In this paper, we focus on collision attacks against Keccak hash function family and some of its variants. Following the framework developed by Dinur et al. at FSE 2012 where 4-round collisions were found by combining 3-round differential trails and 1-round connectors, we extend the connectors one round further hence achieve collision attacks for up to 5 rounds. The extension is possible thanks to the large degree of freedom of the wide internal state. By linearization of all S-boxes of the first round, the problem of finding solutions of 2-round connectors are converted to that of solving a system of linear equations. However, due to the quick freedom reduction from the linearization, the system has solution only when the 3-round differential trails satisfy some additional conditions. We develop a dedicated differential trail search strategy and find such special differentials indeed exist. As a result, the first practical collision attack against 5-round SHAKE128 and two 5-round instances of the Keccak collision challenges are found with real examples. We also give the first results against 5-round Keccak-224 and 6-round Keccak collision challenges. It is remarked that the work here is still far from threatening the security of the full 24-round Keccak family.	active galactic nucleus;algorithm;backward induction;collision attack;computation;endianness;fast software encryption;hash function;heuristic;hexadecimal;linear equation;linear programming relaxation;linux;powerbook 160;s-box;sha-3;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;traverse;tree structure	Kexin Qiao;Ling Song;Meicheng Liu;Jian Guo	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-56617-7_8	collision attack;differential (mechanical device);degrees of freedom (statistics);system of linear equations;discrete mathematics;collision;computer science;sha-3;hash function;linearization	Crypto	-37.590713867654	81.83978798885288	56196

18166400978c40c391d06c96ab7016e469c3c6de	a lightweight two-gateway based payment protocol ensuring accountability and unlinkable anonymity with dynamic identity		In the current scenario, mobile web payment provides a standard platform to the Internet users for online digital goods shopping. Though the majority of online transactions use single gateway, there is a need for multi-gateway, due to insufficient balance in a customer’s account in a specific bank. There are a few payment protocols which support a transaction using multiple cards, but they too have some limitations like cards should be of the same bank and the process should be based on independent transactions. This paper proposes an efficient payment protocol that is used for making online transactions via two gateways for purchasing digital goods to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The proposed protocol is simulated using the automated tool Cryptographic Protocol Shape Analyzer (CPSA) and it satisfies accountability, anonymity and atomicity properties. Formal proof of correctness is provided using the strand space model. The protocol is then compared with the state-of-the-art protocols in terms of different security features and computational overhead. Results show that our protocol achieves better performance than other protocols. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

90cf5c9d7c80c2643f4e9c366443dd8b6ff60460	towards rsa-oaep without random oracles		We give the first positive results about instantiability of the widely implemented and standardized RSAOAEP encryption scheme of Bellare and Rogaway (EUROCRYPT 1994) and variants under chosen-ciphertext attack. Recall that RSA-OAEP adds redundancy and randomness to a message before composing two rounds of an underlying Feistel transform, whose round functions are modeled as random oracles (ROs), with RSA. First, we show that either of the two oracles (while still modeling the other as a RO) can be instantiated in RSAOAEP under IND-CCA2 using mild standard model assumptions. Ours are the first “partial instantiation” results for RSA-OAEP. We obtain them by exploiting (generalizations of) algebraic properties of RSA proven by Barthe, Pointcheval, and Báguelin (CCS 2012). Second, we show that both oracles can be instantiated simultaneously for two variants of RSA-OAEP, called “t-clear” and “s-clear” RSA-OAEP. In particular, we are the first show positive results for s-clear RSA-OAEP, and our results for it yield the most efficient RSAbased IND-CCA2 secure scheme (under plausible assumptions) in the standard model to date. We obtain it by leveraging a new hierarchy of extractability-style assumptions in the sense of Canetti and Dakdouk (TCC 2010) on the round functions, as well as novel yet plausible “XOR-type” assumptions on RSA. Notably, our full instantiation results avoid impossibility results of Shoup (J. Cryptology 2002), Kiltz and Pietrzak (EUROCRYPT 2009), and Bitansky et al.

However, protocols that provide a high level of anonymity generally have poor scalability due to delays and overhead introduced by cryptographic operations, while other approaches sacrifice anonymity to achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel anonymous routing protocol that provides improved anonymity and security while achieving similar or better performance, as compared to existing proposals. Our proposal achieves anonymity using a novel efficient solution for invisible implicit addressing based on keyed hash chain and security via a novel application of one-to-many Diffie-Hellman mechanism, used to exchange keys for symmetric encryption. The final contribution includes a mechanism to facilitate selection of a trusted route by verifying connections between intermediate nodes. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal in comparison with previous approaches using analysis and simulation.	cryptography;diffie–hellman key exchange;encryption;entity;hash chain;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);man-in-the-middle attack;one-to-many (data model);overhead (computing);replay attack;routing;scalability;secure communication;simulation;symmetric-key algorithm;verification and validation;vii	Jiefeng Chen;Roksana Boreli;Vijay Sivaraman	2010	2010 IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/EUC.2010.119	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;information security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-52.35036759678385	77.11109679123231	56321

A successful EPS supports the transfer of electronic money and sensitive information with security, accuracy, and integrity between the seller and buyer over the Internet. SET, CyberCash, Paypal, and iKP are the most popular Credit CardBased EPSs (CCBEPSs). Some CCBEPSs only use SSL to provide a secure communication channel. Hence, they only prevent “Man in the Middle” fraud but do not protect the sensitive cardholder information such as the credit card number from being passed onto the merchant, who may be unscrupulous. Other CCBEPSs use complex mechanisms such as cryptography, certificate authorities, etc. to fulfill the security schemes. However, factors such as ease of use for the cardholder and the implementation costs for each party are frequently overlooked. In this paper, we propose a Web service based new payment system, based on ANSI X9.59-2006 with extra features added on top of this standard. X9.59 is an Account Based Digital Signature (ABDS) and consumeroriented payment system. It utilizes the existing financial network and financial messages to complete the payment process. However, there are a number of limitations in this standard. This research provides a solution to solve the limitations of X9.59 by adding a merchant authentication feature during the payment cycle without any addenda records to be added in the existing financial messages. We have conducted performance testing on the proposed system via a comparison with SET and X9.59 using simulation to analyze their levels of performance and security.

52fd7e071fbc357840147245dd6a1cbb45358a34	time-memory trade-offs for side-channel resistant implementations of block ciphers		Currently, the most efficient first-order masked implementations use the classical randomized table countermeasure, which induces a penalty factor of around 2–3 in execution time compared to an unmasked implementation. However, an S-box with n-bit input and m-bit output requires (2^nm) bit memory; for example, AES requires 256 bytes of RAM. Conversely, generic S-box computation method due to Rivain-Prouff requires almost no memory, but the penalty factor to achieve first-order resistance is roughly 30–35. Therefore, we suggest studying time-memory trade-offs for block-cipher implementations based on an adaptation of a table compression technique proposed by IBM. We use the similar approach to study time-memory trade-offs for second-order masked implementations as well. We show that for the case of AES, reasonably efficient implementations can be obtained with just 40 bytes of RAM in both the cases and hence they can be used in highly memory constrained devices.	block cipher;field-programmable gate array	Praveen Kumar Vadnala	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-52153-4_7	linear cryptanalysis	Crypto	-34.87319264701566	79.38893927050378	56421
495a03b0d8d919c54c72cc649fd972a518540870	security analysis of wirelesshart communication scheme		Communication security is a major concern in industrial process management. Indeed, in addition to real-time requirements, it is very important to ensure that sensing data sent by field sensors are not altered or modified during their transmission. This is more true in Wireless Sensor Networks where communication can be hijacked and false data injected. Therefore wireless communication protocols include several security mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we present an attack against WirelessHART, the leading wireless communication protocol in industrial environment. We show that an insider attacker can bypass security mechanisms and inject false commands in the network. Such attacks can have harmful economical consequences or even more can threaten human lives. We propose also some solutions that can be applied for detecting and mitigating this kind of attacks.	authentication;communication complexity;communications protocol;confidentiality;credential;intrusion detection system;real-time clock;requirement;sensor;source routing	Lyes Bayou;David Espes;Nora Cuppens-Boulahia;Frédéric Cuppens	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-51966-1_15	engineering;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-53.78270921028557	74.46759243611757	56445

However, due to the characteristics of WSN, such as restricted resources and operation in a hostile environment, WSNs are subjected to numerous threats and are vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we present a rekey-boosted security protocol in LEACH (RBS-LEACH) to enhance network security and survivability. Compared to other LEACH security solutions, the salient advantage of this work is that a unique rekey mechanism, which can efficiently protect the network against attacks of eavesdropping or captured nodes compromise, is adopted to address challenging security issues of runtime WSN. Even if the adversaries crack WSN keys, the entire network still remains safe under the timely protection of the rekey mechanism.	cryptographic protocol;cyclic redundancy check;network security	Yi-Ying Zhang;WenCheng Yang;Kee-Bum Kim;Min-Yu Cui;Myong-Soon Park	2008	2008 International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering (mue 2008)	10.1109/MUE.2008.10	wireless sensor network;computer science;network security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-51.81199699377851	76.3315953395398	56542

Various approaches are proposed to detect privacy leakage with different indicators to determine privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose a unified security model to determine privacy leakage. Our unified model includes three typical indicators for detecting privacy leaks, which are sensitive transmission, user intention and application behavior. The proposed model formalizes privacy leakage behavior based on information flows and state transitions. We identify three typical frameworks of privacy leakage. By analyzing the security model, it is feasible to use our model to implement three typical frameworks.	android;spectral leakage;unified model	Xueqi Ren;Xinming Wang;Hua Tang;Zhaohui Ma;Jiechao Wu;Gansen Zhao	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72389-1_38	computer security model;computer security;leakage (electronics);private information retrieval;unified model;android (operating system);computer science	Security	-45.59377712556171	61.52429029057067	56588

Due to the autonomy, self-interest and heterogeneousness of peers, the interaction outcomes are uncertain. One way to minimize the threats in such an open environment is exploiting the reputation method to evaluate the trustworthiness and predict the future behaviors of peers. While most of the existing reputation-based trust models focus on preventing network from the malicious peers, peers’ capabilities to fulfill the tasks are mostly ignored. In this paper, we present a novel trust model MHFTrust which quantifies and compares the trustworthiness of peers based on hierarchical fuzzy system. Six capability factors are identified to describe the peers’ trust on the capability, and one security factor, named “Malicious behavior” is used to evaluate the peers’ trust on security. Our trust model consisted of local-trust computation based on fuzzy techniques and global reputation aggregation, which integrates feedback from other peers to produce a global reputation for each peer. Credibility and weight of feedback are introduced to facilitate the computation of global reputation. It is shown in simulation that our trust model greatly improves the efficiency of P2P system, while the number of inauthentic files on the network is significantly decreased.	booting;bootstrapping (statistics);computation;computer science;context-sensitive language;download;faceted classification;feedback;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;interaction;iteration;malware;peer-to-peer file sharing;public-key cryptography;reputation management;server (computing);simulation;software propagation;threshold cryptosystem;trust (emotion);trust management (information system);trust management (managerial science);upload	Huaiqing Lin;Zhitang Li;Qingfeng Huang	2011	Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications	10.1007/s12083-010-0096-9	world wide web;computer security;computational trust	Web+IR	-59.79668489069374	72.8618917141052	56702
47b1dfc57b51143bed985dae8d3c749d4f20b96b	cube attacks and cube-attack-like cryptanalysis on the round-reduced keccak sponge function		In this paper, we comprehensively study the resistance of keyed variants of SHA-3 (Keccak) against algebraic attacks. This analysis covers a wide range of key recovery, MAC forgery and other types of attacks, breaking up to 9 rounds (out of the full 24) of the Keccak internal permutation much faster than exhaustive search. Moreover, some of our attacks on the 6-round Keccak are completely practical and were verified on a desktop PC. Our methods combine cube attacks (an algebraic key recovery attack) and related algebraic techniques with structural analysis of the Keccak permutation. These techniques should be useful in future cryptanalysis of Keccak and similar designs. Although our attacks break more rounds than previously published techniques, the security margin of Keccak remains large. For Keyak – a Keccak-based authenticated encryption scheme – the nominal number of rounds is 12 and therefore its security margin is smaller (although still sufficient).	authenticated encryption;authentication;brute-force search;cryptanalysis;cube attack;key escrow;key-recovery attack;linear algebra;pseudorandom permutation;sha-3;sponge function;structural analysis	Itai Dinur;Pawel Morawiecki;Josef Pieprzyk;Marian Srebrny;Michal Straus	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-662-46800-5_28	theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;computer security	Crypto	-38.88749907642797	78.494195245054	56736

In this paper, we designed and constructed the network based on real mobile node and experimented the modeling of IKEv2 protocol through the simulation. We analyzed the resetting of authentication key and re-exchange problem. And we experimented the effect that key exchange is affected by a limited bandwidth based on data analysis. To overcome delay time, we proposed multi-interface of node and analyzed performance and latency for authentication setting and exchange process. The simulation results show that re-authentication of key is impossible to reset because of limited bandwidth of network. Also, the use of proposed multi-interface can minimize key exchange latency that happened by hand off for IPSec transmission.	authentication;confidentiality;ipsec;internet key exchange;mobile ip;mobile phone;multihoming;profiling (computer programming);retransmission (data networks);router (computing);simulation	Do Hyeon Lee;Jeom Goo Kim	2013	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-013-0669-8	oakley protocol;ipsec;mobile telephony;key exchange;computer science;handover;authentication protocol;authentication;internet privacy;key distribution;computer security;mobile ip;computer network	Security	-47.9562621261014	78.85581235527332	56746

The former enables an energy supplier to allocate and balance resources. The latter provides dynamic pricing schemes according to fine-grained consumption profiles. Moreover, smart meters and their energy supplier can prove their billing values. Since the energy supplier knows the amount of generated electricity and the consolidated consumption in a round of measurements, the energy supplier can detect energy loss and fraud. To preserve customers' privacy, we use a homomorphic commitment scheme with a homomorphic encryption scheme. All data sent from a meter to any other component in the communication network is either a commitment or an encrypted message. To provide security and privacy, we only require software modifications, leaving the hardware of the smart grid unchanged.	commitment scheme;communication complexity;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;data aggregation;electronic billing;formal verification;homomorphic encryption;mobile payment;privacy;smart tv;smart meter;telecommunications network	Fábio Borges;Denise Demirel;Leon Bock;Johannes A.

In such service-based data sharing environments, Web service composition emerged as a viable approach to query data scattered across independent locations. Patient data privacy preservation is an important aspect that must be considered when composing medical Web services. In this paper, the authors show how data privacy can be preserved when composing and executing Web services. Privacy constraints are expressed in the form of RDF queries over a mediated ontology. Query rewriting algorithms are defined to process those queries while preserving users’ privacy.

This paper presents techniques to automatically learn attack strategies from correlated intrusion alerts. Central to these techniques is a model that represents an attack strategy as a graph of attacks with constraints on the attack attributes and the temporal order among these attacks. To learn the intrusion strategy is then to extract such a graph from a sequences of intrusion alerts. To further facilitate the analysis of attack strategies, which is essential to many security applications such as computer and network forensics, this paper presents techniques to measure the similarity between attack strategies. The basic idea is to reduces the similarity measurement of attack strategies into error-tolerant graph/subgraph isomorphism problem, and measures the similarity between attack strategies in terms of the cost to transform one strategy into another. Finally, this paper presents some experimental results, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques.	algorithm;computer;error-tolerant design;graph (discrete mathematics);graph isomorphism problem;intrusion detection system;subgraph isomorphism problem	Peng Ning;Dingbang Xu	2003		10.1145/948109.948137	intrusion detection system;computer science;technical report;data mining;internet privacy;computer security;intrusion prevention system;network forensics	Security	-62.044685026579664	60.88156446239387	56898

Such motivation is not only natural for multi-agent systems, but is one of the main reasons, why multi-agent planning problems cannot be solved centrally. Although the motivation is common in the literature, formal treatment of privacy is mostly missing. An exception is a definition of two extreme concepts, weak and strong privacy.  In this paper, we first analyze privacy leakage in the terms of secure Multi-Party Computation and Quantitative Information Flow. Then, we follow by analyzing privacy leakage of the most common MAP paradigms. Finally, we propose a new theoretical class of secure MAP algorithms and show how the existing techniques can be modified in order to fall in the proposed class.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;information flow;information leakage;internet privacy;multi-agent system;personally identifiable information;strips;secure multi-party computation;spectral leakage	Michal Stolba;Jan Tozicka;Antonín Komenda	2016		10.1145/2970030.2970042	privacy software;privacy by design;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;computer security	ML	-36.33301185194554	71.03254962073888	57014

We show that the natural contextual equivalence, barbed congruence, coincides with early bisimilarity, which is thus its co-inductive characterisation. Moreover, we relate early bisimilarity with the other usual notions, ground, late and open, obtaining a lattice of equivalence relations that clarifies the relationship among the “standard” bisimilarities. Furthermore, we apply the theory developed to obtain an expressiveness result: epi extended with key encryption primitives may be fully abstractly encoded in the original epi calculus. The proposed encoding is sound and complete with respect to barbed congruence; hence, cryptographic epi (crypto-epi) gets behavioural theory for free, which contrasts with other process languages with cryptographic constructs that usually require a big effort to develop such theory. Therefore, it is possible to use crypto-epi to analyse and to verify properties of security protocols using equational reasoning. To illustrate this claim, we prove compliance with symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic system laws, and the correctness of a protocol of secure message exchange.	bisimulation;congruence of squares;correctness (computer science);cryptography;cryptosystem;encryption;observational equivalence;turing completeness	Joana Martinho;António Ravara	2008	Journal of Automated Reasoning	10.1007/s10817-010-9189-7	cryptographic primitive;discrete mathematics;π-calculus;computer science;mathematics;equivalence relation;programming language;algorithm	Logic	-35.72372882837326	73.2169676030083	57034

What makes them especially attractive, is that they work equally well in a concurrent setting, which is notoriously hard for interactive zero-knowledge protocols. However, while for interactive zero-knowledge we know how to construct statistical zero-knowledge argument systems for all NP languages, for non-interactive zero-knowledge, this problem remained open since the inception of NIZK in the late 1980’s. Here we resolve two problems regarding NIZK: • we construct the first perfect NIZK argument system for any NP language. • we construct the first UC-secure NIZK protocols for any NP language in the presence of a dynamic/adaptive adversary. While it was already known how to construct efficient prover computational NIZK proofs for any NP language, the known techniques yield large common reference strings and large NIZK proofs. As an additional implication of our techniques, we considerably reduce both the size of the common reference string and the size of the proofs.	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;common reference string model;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;cryptosystem;digital signature;interactivity;non-interactive zero-knowledge proof;regular expression;uc browser	Jens Groth;Rafail Ostrovsky;Amit Sahai	2005	Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity (ECCC)	10.1007/11761679_21	digital signature;universal composability;computer science;cryptography;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;proof theory;mathematics;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	-37.77248722224226	75.6854323792394	57069

In thispaper, a threshold key management scheme for MANETs ispresented. The proposed scheme is implemented using ellipticcurve dlog-based cryptosystem. In this scheme, an off-line centralauthority is required in the initialization phase before networkdeployment. The central authority creates and preloads theshares matrix for each mobile node in the network initializationphase. Each session member generates its private/public keypair, and the session public key by collaborating with its trustedneighbors. The generation of the node private/public key pair,and the session public key is performed without any priorcommunication between session members. The advantages ofthe proposed scheme are justified through extensive timing andnetwork simulations.	centralized computing;cryptosystem;hoc (programming language);key management;key size;online and offline;public-key cryptography;simulation;software deployment	Hisham Dahshan;James Irvine	2010	2010 8th Annual Communication Networks and Services Research Conference	10.1109/CNSR.2010.48	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;threshold cryptosystem;internet privacy;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-48.59231539333267	76.60101199474168	57070

Because of their efficiency and usability on a wide range of platforms, solutions based on symmetric primitives (such as block ciphers) are particularly attractive in this context. So far, the literature has mostly focused on the design of leakage-resilient pseudorandom objects (e.g. PRGs, PRFs, PRPs). In this paper, we consider the complementary and practically important problem of designing secure authentication and encryption schemes. For this purpose, we follow a pragmatic approach based on the advantages and limitations of existing leakage-resilient pseudorandom objects, and rely on the (arguably necessary, yet minimal) use of a leak-free component. The latter can typically be instantiated with a block cipher implementation protected by traditional countermeasures, and we investigate how to combine it with the more intensive use of a much more efficient (less protected) block cipher implementation. Based on these premises, we propose and analyse new constructions of leakage-resilient MAC and encryption schemes, which allow fixing security and efficiency drawbacks of previous proposals in this direction. For encryption, we additionally provide a detailed discussion of why previously proposed (indistinguishability based) security definitions cannot capture actual side-channel attacks, and suggest a relaxed and more realistic way to quantify leakage-resilience in this case, by reducing the security of many iterations of the primitive to the security of a single iteration, independent of the security notion guaranteed by this single iteration (that remains hard to define).	authentication;block cipher;cryptosystem;encryption;iteration;physical information;pseudorandomness;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;usability	Olivier Pereira;François-Xavier Standaert;Srinivas Vivek	2015		10.1145/2810103.2813626	h.235;computer science;theoretical computer science;side channel attack;symmetric-key algorithm;internet privacy;computer security	Security	-36.02141328527735	75.4297865445054	57087

The security and efficiency of these ciphers mainly depend upon the algebraic construction of their Substitution Boxes. In this paper, the algebraic construction of the Substitution Boxes for the AES algorithm is analyzed with different irreducible polynomials. This paper emphasizes on the study of the ways of constructing the Substitution Boxes and the other important feature of a Substitution Box is how secure it is cryptographically. The cryptographic properties namely correlation immunity bias, strict avalanche criteria, non-linearity and entropy are used to evaluate the level of security for Substitution Boxes. The results show that the other irreducible polynomial equation offer better level of security compared to that of standard polynomial equation used in Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Moreover, the Substitution Box used in AES can be constructed with different irreducible polynomial equations.	algebraic equation;algorithm;block cipher;correlation immunity;cryptography;encryption;irreducibility;irreducible polynomial;linear algebra;nonlinear system;s-box	Bhoopal Rao Gangadari;Shaik Rafi Ahamed	2015	2015 Eighth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3)	10.1109/IC3.2015.7346738	annealing;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer security;encryption;algorithm	Crypto	-38.74812189267121	82.33724965829698	57088

The sensor nodes along with the data, while in transit, must be protected from malicious attackers. Though using public key cryptographic schemes like RSA and elliptic curve cryptography would provide sufficient security. Their use has been limited owing to their computationally intensive operations which conflict with the resource limitations in wireless sensor nodes. Key pre-distribution has proved to be the most feasible amongst key management schemes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Research in key management continues to take center stage due to its importance amongst security primitives in WSNs. An improved energy efficient key distribution and management scheme is proposed in this paper. Results and simulations show that the proposed scheme conserves energy and performs better than other existing techniques.	key distribution	Tafadzwa Tapuwa Chakavarika;Shashi K.

3340760c83c888d47e2e179908aa69238200d981	a comprehensive and effective mechanism for ddos detection in sdn		DDoS attack is one of the major concerns for network and cloud service providers, due to its substantial impact on revenue/cost and especially on their reputation. Also, network administrators are looking for solutions to manage voluminous data traffic. SDN is an emerging networking paradigm that provides a flexible network management. Hence, SDN is being widely adopted for wired, wireless, and mobile networks. Apart from a single point of failure (the controller), an attacker can target SDN at various levels by DDoS attacks. Existing solutions either focus on a particular attack type or require cumbersome alterations in SDN infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive, yet effective and lightweight approach to detect various fundamentally different DDoS attacks in SDN. Our approach relies on sequential analysis. We employ a non-parametric change point detection technique called Cumulative Sum (CuSum). Our framework also includes an adaptive threshold scheme that adapts with the changing traffic pattern. Additionally, our framework can be tuned to suffice critical security requirements such as high detection rate and low false alarm rate. We evaluated the effectiveness of our solution using CAIDA Internet traces as well as DARPA intrusion detection evaluation dataset. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our mechanism. In particular, average false alarm rate in our experiments was under 11.64%. On average, our method is able to detect DDoS attacks within 4.15 seconds.	attack model;cloud computing;denial-of-service attack;experiment;intrusion detection system;programming paradigm;reliability engineering;requirement;san diego supercomputer center;scheme;secret sharing;sensor;single point of failure;software-defined networking;tracing (software)	Mauro Conti;Ankit Gangwal;Manoj Singh Gaur	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2017.8115796	single point of failure;computer network;the internet;change detection;network management;cloud computing;constant false alarm rate;intrusion detection system;computer science;denial-of-service attack	Security	-60.96582526321689	60.978365893850466	57118

The method indirectly distributes shares of the main secret with one random secret among a set of players. Again the shares of some unknown random secrets are calculated by the players and shared among themselves. At each level, the players can change their threshold to any arbitrary value dynamically. Each subset of the players can only recover the secret corresponding to their own level. The main secret will be retrieved by any level players if and only if all the secrets in other levels are first recovered. The access structure that our scheme realizes is such that the players of different levels calculate secrets individually but to recover the main secret cooperation of players from all the levels are required.	access structure;adversary (cryptography);secret sharing;verifiable secret sharing	Appala Naidu Tentu;Banita Mahapatra;V.

c4eba96ff5001c43b4c5acaeffd3e555e3ff664a	where the light gets in: analyzing web censorship mechanisms in india		In this work we present a detailed study of the Internet censorship mechanism in India. We consolidated a list of potentially blocked websites from various public sources to assess censorship mechanisms used by nine major ISPs. To begin with, we demonstrate that existing censorship detection tools like OONI are grossly inaccurate. We thus developed various techniques and heuristics to correctly assess censorship and study the underlying mechanism used by these ISPs. At every step we corroborated our finding manually to test the efficacy of our approach, an exercise largely ignored by several others. We fortify our findings by adjudging the coverage and consistency of censorship infrastructure, broadly in terms of average number of network paths and requested domains the infrastructure censors. Our results indicate a clear disparity among the ISPs, on how they install censorship infrastructure. For instance, in Idea network we observed the censorious middleboxes in over 90% of our tested intra-AS paths, whereas for Vodafone, it is as low as 2.5%. We conclude our research by devising our own novel anti-censorship strategies, that does not depend on third party tools (like proxies, Tor and VPNs etc.). We managed to access all blocked websites in all ISPs under test.	binocular disparity;heuristic (computer science);middlebox;proxy server;self-censorship;tor messenger;virtual private network	Tarun Kumar Yadav;Akshat Sinha;Devashish Gosain;Piyush Kumar Sharma;Sambuddho Chakravarty	2018		10.1145/3278532.3278555	internet privacy;data mining;the internet;censorship;heuristics;computer science	Metrics	-56.88257568622335	68.91231710921505	57272

The model has strong scalability properties and is robust against common insider threats, such as a compromised or malfunctioning peer.

However, several disadvantages exist, such as the loss of control over data or unwanted data processing and analysis by providers. A central data storage, which is applied by Online Social Networks (OSN), such as Facebook or driven by the government, such as storing medical health data of citizens centrally, is likewise affected. Efforts to store citizens' medical data centrally, driven by political, economic or IT-security reasons, bear the risk of data leakage. We envision a decentralized and data-owner-centric system, capable to support secure data sharing within private or business driven scenarios. A central aspect is to increase management capabilities, such as revocation for the data to be shared, while supporting fine grained access policies provided by Attribute-based Encryption (ABE). In this paper we introduce the Entrance system architecture, requirements and basic use-cases before we reach our main contribution: we discuss challenges and provide solutions arising from applying a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for an Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) key distribution.

This paper presents the first systematic study of security issues in crowd-sourced WiFi-based IPSes to promote security considerations in designing and deploying crowdsourced IPSes. We identify three attacks on crowdsourced WiFi-based IPSes and propose the corresponding countermeasures. The efficacy of the attacks and also our countermeasures are experimentally validated on a prototype system. The attacks and countermeasures can be easily extended to other crowdsourced IPSes.	algorithm;countermeasure (computer);crowdsourcing;database;experiment;fingerprint;global positioning system;indoor positioning system;location-based service;map;prototype;rss;tracing (software);trust (emotion)	Tao Li;Yimin Chen;Rui Zhang;Yanchao Zhang;Terri Hedgpeth	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486398	global positioning system;distributed computing;computer science;crowdsourcing	Mobile	-52.640932420659944	71.09320824543778	57377

When a mobile device hands over from one BS to another, the handover latency is usually one of the key factors affecting wireless service QoS. However, a strict security scheme often requires a longer handover delay. Also, a short handover delay often can only perform a simple security processes. Currently the authentication processes of L2 and L3 are independent to each other. In fact, they redundantly authenticate the same entities with two different authentication processes. If we can combine them, then less resource will be consumed and, handover delay will be shortened. Therefore, in this study, we design a cross-layer security mechanism based on PMIPv6 fast handover which run on LTE wireless system.	compaq lte;entity;ipsec;mobile device;mutual authentication;proxy mobile ipv6;security association	Fang-Yie Leu;Yi-Li Huang;Chien-Nan Chen	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2012.80	ipsec;digital signature;computer science;lte advanced;security service;security parameter index;internet privacy;computer security;soft handover;computer network	Mobile	-48.39390052944727	73.17480972358908	57444

This paper analyzes a model [7] to prevent traffic analysis b y rerouting and padding the traffic matrix, so that the apparent final traffic matrix is neutral. The objective of this analysis is to justify the claims of the model and to show that rerouting of traffic via intermediate nodes with minimal padding is indeed a cost effective method to prevent traffic analysis. Simulation results supporting the above claim are also presented in this paper. The requirement that final trafic matrix be neutral may be too restrictive in some cases and we suggest various modifications t o the model while still ensuring prevention of traffic analysis. Prevention of traffic analysis in real time is a very interesting and relevant issue and we address this briefly.	communications security;effective method;high-level programming language;profiling (computer programming);simulation;traffic analysis	Richard E.

In this regard, we revisit the definition of Transparency Order (TO) from the work of Prouff (FSE 2005) and find that the definition has certain limitations. Although this work has been quite well referred in the literature, surprisingly, these limitations remained unexplored for almost a decade. We analyse the definition from scratch, modify it and finally provide a definition with better insight that can theoretically capture DPA in Hamming weight model for hardware implementation with precharge logic. At the end, we confront the notion of (revised) transparency order with attack simulations in order to study to what extent the low transparency order of an s-box impacts the efficiency of a side channel attack against its processing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a critical analysis is conducted (even considering the original notion of Prouff). It practically confirms that the transparency order is indeed related to the resistance of the s-box against side-channel attacks, but it also shows that it is not sufficient alone to directly achieve a satisfying level of security. Regarding this point, our conclusion is that the (revised) transparency order is a valuable criterion to consider when designing a cryptographic algorithm, and even if it does not preclude to also use classical countermeasures like masking or shuffling, it enables to improve their effectiveness.	algorithm;cryptography;definition;fast software encryption;hamming code;hamming weight;s-box;side-channel attack;simulation	Kaushik Chakraborty;Subhamoy Maitra;Sumanta Sarkar;Bodhisatwa Mazumdar;Debdeep Mukhopadhyay	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/s10623-016-0250-3	advanced encryption standard;power analysis;autocorrelation;cross-correlation;mathematics;s-box;algorithm;statistics	Security	-37.74780293835964	82.21940294197069	57517

With the extension of untraceable electronic cash, we have designed a fair transaction protocol to satisfy both the anonymity and the fairness properties simultaneously. Under the existence of an off-line trusted third party (FTP), the protocol is efficient and practical. Furthermore, the payment information of each customer is not revealed to anyone else including the TTP, and thus, the anonymity or privacy of the customer is protected completely in our protocol. Especially, the proposed method is independent of the underlying electronic cash (e-cash) scheme such that it can be realized by any e-cash system based on the concept of blind signatures	antivirus software;blind signature;fairness measure;online and offline;privacy;trusted third party	Chun-I Fan;Yu-Kuang Liang;Bo-Wei Lin	2006	2006 Seventh International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'06)	10.1109/PDCAT.2006.64	communications protocol;digital signature;electronic money;trusted third party;computer science;internet privacy;blind signature;world wide web;computer security;computer network;satisfiability	Security	-43.99778496961613	72.29757436176816	57543

Even if the sender or the receiver is coerced to show the plaintext and the used random numbers in encryption, a deniable encryption scheme behaves like only an innocent message is encrypted. Because it protects privacy against malicious coercer, the deniable encryption is very useful in communication systems such as the cloud storage system when the communication channel is eavesdropped by a coercer. Previous deniable encryptions only concern the security under the adversary's chosen plaintext attack (CPA). For non-interactive deniable encryptions, this paper introduce some security notions under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA). Furthermore, the first sender-deniable construction with deniability and indistinguishability against CCA attack is constructed.	adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext	Chong-zhi Gao;Dongqing Xie;Baodian Wei	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29101-2_4	semantic security;chosen-ciphertext attack;watermarking attack;plaintext-aware encryption;computer science;deniable encryption;ciphertext indistinguishability;ciphertext-only attack;internet privacy;malleability;deterministic encryption;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;ciphertext;attribute-based encryption;computer network	Crypto	-41.03819186794974	74.6064439898207	57550

However, to fully satisfy user requests it is probably necessary to use facilities across multiple domains, for which the conventional resource provisioning methods are unsuitable for the multiple domains because they require unrevealed information from infra-providers. The competitive relationships among infra-providers make it difficult for them to reveal their information to the infra-providers. In this paper, we propose a framework and method for resource provisioning across multiple domains that uses infra-providers' confidential information without exposing it to other infra-providers. To preserve the confidentiality of the infra-providers' information, we propose a cooperative framework using multiparty computation (MPC). However, although MPC provides confidentiality it also brings about nearly intractable computational overhead. Therefore, we pick out values that are locally commutable in each domain and essential for resource provisioning. By using MPC only for these values, our proposed method achieves both tractable MPC overhead and good quality provisioning while preserving information secrecy. Evaluation results show that the computational overhead is tractable and that the average utility fee is at least on the same level as that of the conventional methods.	analysis of algorithms;cobham's thesis;computation;confidentiality;overhead (computing);provisioning	Toru Mano;Kimihiro Mizutani;Osamu Akashi	2013	2013 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2013)		resource allocation;computer science;network security;distributed computing;management;computer security;computer network	HPC	-41.57369809385287	67.15103553125188	57574

There are some relatively insecure devices (smart cards, mobile phones etc.) which have threat of key exposure. The goal of the forward security is to protect security of past uses of key even if the current secret key is exposed. In this paper we propose lattice based forward-secure identity based encryption scheme based on LWE assumption in random oracle model.

078211a74dcb15d2f3844a4971e48e361d68af4f	securecoin: a robust secure and efficient protocol for anonymous bitcoin ecosystem		Bitcoin is the first decentralized peer-to-peer electronic virtual asset and payment cryptocurrency, through which, users can transact digital currency directly, without the need for an intermediary (or authority), using a hashed version of cryptographic public keys, as pseudonyms called addresses. The Bitcoin ecosystem was supposed to be anonymous and untraceable. However, transactions from input to output addresses of the Bitcoin users are observed to be linkable, therefore, missing unlinkability as an important requirement of anonymity. Several protocols appeared to enhance Bitcoin users’ anonymity and to ensure unlinkability of input-output addresses, to make input and output addresses of transactions unlinkable to each other, and hence untraceable. In this paper, we spot several vulnerabilities in the most recently proposed protocols, then we propose SecureCoin as an efficient protocol for anonymous and unlinkable Bitcoin transactions that covers these vulnerabilities in a robust and secure way and in full compatibility with the standard Bitcoin ecosystem. Our protocol provides better protection for the participating peers against malicious behavior of minority of the peers and protection against the most serious sabotage attack attempted by any number of saboteur peers. We analyze the security properties of our protocol and evaluate its efficiency. Finally, we compare the performance of our protocol with the recently proposed protocols and show that our protocol is computationally efficient and requires less Bitcoin fees.	algorithmic efficiency;bitcoin;cryptocurrency;cryptography;digital currency;ecosystem;input/output;malware;peer-to-peer;pseudonymity	Maged Hamada Ibrahim	2017	I.

Kumar Das first presented the concept of the protocol anomaly detection. The idea of protocol anomaly detection is not new but interesting. It aims to set up models for proper use of protocols and any behavior that departs from the models will be regarded as an intrusive or suspicious one. In this paper, we made some improvements that aim at the lack of stochastic protocol models based on Markov Chain and made some evaluations for that presented by Juan M. Some necessary states are added to the protocol model. Furthermore, the initial and transition probabilities are more precise. Also, we propose to combine Chi-Square Distance into Markov Chain method to detect protocol anomaly. The experimental results show that SYN Flooding attack can be detected efficiently by the new approach.	anomaly detection;markov chain	Zheng Qin;Na Li;Dafang Zhang;Nai-Zheng Bian	2005		10.1007/11576259_43	markov chain;anomaly detection;computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm;statistics	Logic	-62.74709232386902	70.1977343626672	57601

However, procedures for authorizing the holders of these identities to perform specific actions still need additional research and development. While there are a number of proposed standards for authorization structures and protocols such as KeyNote, SPKI, and SAML based on X.509 or other key-based identities, none have been widely adopted. As part of an effort to use X.509 identities to provide authorization in highly distributed environments, we have developed and deployed an authorization service based on X.509 identified users and access policy contained in certificates signed by X.509 identified stakeholders. The major goal of this system, called Akenti, is to produce a usable authorization system for an environment consisting of distributed resources used by geographically and administratively distributed users. Akenti assumes communication between users and resources over a secure protocol such as transport layer security (TLS) to provide mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. This paper explains the authorization model and policy language used by Akenti, and how we have implemented an Apache authorization module to provide Akenti authorization.	access control;authorization;keynote;mutual authentication;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;security assertion markup language;simple public-key infrastructure;transport layer security;x.509	Mary R.

In this protocol Alice has the same capability as in the traditional BB84 protocol, but Bob is limited by the constraint that he can measure or prepare qubits only in {|0, |1} basis and reflect any other qubit (or in other words, let it go undisturbed). In this scheme the qubits travel from Alice to Bob and then again from Bob to Alice. We study an eavesdropping strategy on this scheme that listens to the channel in both the directions. With the same level of disturbance induced in the channel, Eve can be extract more information using our two-way strategy than what can be obtained by the direct application of one-way eavesdropping in case of BB84 protocol. Towards resisting this eavesdropping strategy, we modify the semiquantum scheme by incorporating a Hadamard gate at Bob's end.	alice and bob;bb84;communications protocol;eve;hadamard transform;information leakage;one-way function;pattern recognition letters;physical review a;quantum key distribution;qubit;randomness;retransmission (data networks);spectral leakage	Arpita Maitra;Goutam Paul	2013	Inf.

Recently, regenerating code has caught researchers' attention due to low repair traffic while preserving fault tolerance. Existing integrity checking schemes for regenerating code storage only support static data and have high auditing cost, which are not suitable for practical application. In this work, We propose a public auditing scheme for regenerating code based cloud storage supporting data dynamics. Our scheme allows the auditor to check the integrity of data stored across multiple servers and identify the location of corrupted data when data corruption is detected within one round. To support data dynamics, we design a novel update method based on matrix and index mechanism. The update method support multiple update requests performed in batch way without downloading and re-coding the data file and re-computing the data tags, such that the communication and computation cost can be greatly reduced. Theoretic analysis and experimental results show the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme.	cloud storage;computation;data integrity;download;fault tolerance;provable security;server (computing)	Kai He;Chuanhe Huang;Jiaoli Shi;Jinhai Wang	2016	2016 IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communication (ISCC)	10.1109/ISCC.2016.7543800	maintenance engineering;database index;data modeling;cloud computing;computer science;operating system;data integrity;data mining;database;computer security;server;computer network;symmetric matrix	DB	-42.690563869255065	67.93010918679416	57728

E-services on the mobile Internet (mi-services) are no exception. However, for mi-services, the level and type of security may depend on the user's security preferences for the service, the power of the mobile platform, and the location of the mobile platform (we label these UPL). For example, if the user is traveling through a particularly dangerous area known for previous attacks, the security protection should be adjusted to use mechanisms that are resilient to these attacks. We propose the use of a security policy that allows for various security options commensurate with UPL, in conjunction with a context-aware security policy agent that notifies the service provider to activate new security appropriate to a change in UPL.	e-commerce;e-services;mobile operating system;web service	George Yee;Larry Korba	2005		10.1007/0-387-32015-6_23	the internet;mobile web;security information and event management;security association;internet security;business;services computing;internet privacy;network security policy;computer security;computer network	Security	-48.98411665854761	64.11272848067782	57868

When using thin clients or low-bandwidth networks it is best to perform most of the work at the server. In this paper we present a method, inspired by secure multi-party computation, to search efficiently in encrypted data. XML elements are translated to polynomials. A polynomial is split into two parts: a random polynomial for the client and the difference between the original polynomial and the client polynomial for the server. Since the client polynomials are generated by a random sequence generator only the seed has to be stored on the client. In a combined effort of both the server and the client a query can be evaluated without traversing the whole tree and without the server learning anything about the data or the query.	database server;encryption;hash function;outsourcing;plaintext;polynomial;secret sharing;secure multi-party computation;server (computing);thin client;xml tree	Richard Brinkman;Jeroen Doumen;Willem Jonker	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30073-1_2	computer science;cryptography;artificial intelligence;random sequence;operating system;database;distributed computing;secret sharing;world wide web;computer security;bandwidth;algorithm;statistics;outsourcing;remote evaluation	Security	-43.377795918973	78.4070575540366	57961

In this paper, we capture the lattice model of security for mobility in a distributed setup using the formalism of Mobile Ambient calculus (MA) that has been widely used to model mobility and concurrency. Our model, referred to as Labelled Mobile Ambients (LMA), assigns labels to ambients for tracking information flow in the system, and provides semantics for preserving the distributed information flow policy specified by the labels. While there exist variants of the mobile ambient calculus for modelling application specific aspects of mandatory access control like confidentiality and integrity in the literature, our LMA model subsumes these models by capturing confidentiality and integrity as special cases of information flow properties. Thus, the LMA model enables a wide range of applications with complex security requirements, and permits a simple static analysis to establish whether the system violates information flow policy. A relative comparison to other prominent works is provided highlighting the merits of our LMA.	ambient calculus;concurrency (computer science);confidentiality;data security;distributed computing;existential quantification;information flow;lattice model (physics);mandatory access control;requirement;semantics (computer science);static program analysis	N.

To mitigate this problem, the notion of Accountable Authority Identity-Based Encryption (A-IBE) was recently introduced by Goyal. Goyal provided constructions to realize the notion of A-IBE only in the white box and weak black box models. However, the security guarantees provided by these models fall short of those required in practice.  In this paper, we resolve the main open question left in Goyal's work by providing a construction of a (fully) black box A-IBE system.

The distribution of a shared key can be performed by any sensor node and does not always require that it is performed by the base station. Each node can be selected by one of its neighbor nodes in order to distribute a pair-wise key for a communication between two nodes. The selection is based on the local computation of a trust value granted by the requesting nodes. This paper also describes a dynamic trust-based route selection mechanism that each node performs to route data to any destination.	computation;encryption;key distribution;sensor node;symmetric-key algorithm	Nathan Lewis;Noria Foukia;Donovan G.

These mechanisms are widely used in distributed computer networks. This investigation proposes an efficient and secure single-sign-on authentication scheme that uses extended chaotic maps, exhibits operations that satisfy the semigroup property and commutative under composition, and has a higher efficiency than modular exponential computations and scalar multiplications on the elliptic curve. The session key security of the proposed scheme is based on Chebyshev chaotic-map-based assumptions, and the scheme is proven to be secure using the real-or-random model. The proposed authentication scheme retains the security properties of earlier schemes, requires fewer transmissions, has a lower computational cost, and uses fewer variables; it is therefore efficient in computation and communication.	algorithmic efficiency;authentication;chaos theory;computation;digital light processing;elliptic curve cryptography;information system;internet of things;list of chaotic maps;provable security;session key;time complexity	Tian-Fu Lee	2018	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2015.2471095	cryptography;computer network;challenge–response authentication;single sign-on;session key;security token;computer science;theoretical computer science;authentication protocol;commutative property;distributed computing;authentication	Security	-40.77628049541695	77.10186267487543	58195

Therefore, it is easy to generate data multi-replica, which is able to improve data availability and users' experience. However, when the management of data is poor, the sensitive information will be disclosed more easily. This may bring serious security and privacy challenges for both user's data and its multi-replica in cloud environment. In order to tackle the above issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-replica associated deleting scheme (MADS) in cloud environment. We first introduce a replica associated model to organize all of data replicas among different cloud servers. Furthermore, we propose the MADS scheme which is consists of data storage algorithm, replica generation algorithm, replica deletion and feedback algorithm. Finally, we employ Amazon S3 to implement MADS and the results indicate that the proposed scheme is available and effective.	algorithm;amazon simple storage service;cloud storage;computer data storage;information sensitivity;outsourcing;server (computing);spectral leakage;upwind scheme	Yuanyuan Zhang;Jinbo Xiong;Xuan Li;Biao Jin;Suping Li;Xu An Wang	2016	2016 10th International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems (CISIS)	10.1109/CISIS.2016.68	cloud computing security;computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web	DB	-41.808304813961485	67.20450693950241	58204

Our approach is designed to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on wireless communications, particularly against multi-path communication in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). CapMan offers a mechanism for a per flow, distributed bandwidth control by all the participating nodes along multiple communication paths. By exchanging summary capability messages, each node can maintain a global view of the overall throughput of flows in the network, and then dynamically adjust local constraints to prevent potential DoS attacks against a specific node or the network. Our approach is capable of scalably curtailing sophisticated DoS attacks that target multi-path routing protocols, even in the case that both the initiator and the responder of a network flow are malicious insiders and collude to deprive the network of valuable resources. We provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithms and also evaluate the protection and overhead of our prototype using AOMDV for routing.	algorithm;bandwidth management;capability-based security;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;flow network;hoc (programming language);malware;multipath routing;overhead (computing);prototype;rate limiting;scsi initiator and target;simulation;throughput	Quan Jia;Kun Sun;Angelos Stavrou	2011	2011 Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005808	mobile ad hoc network;computer science;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-54.20916853175722	76.19147286716105	58233

The correct execution of viruses and worms throughout the Internet is accomplished by self-relocation. Self-relocation is a built-in mechanism in most malicious codes, allowing them to get the base address of the host program to correctly infect it. Since most legitimate computer programs do not need self-relocate themselves, the detection of malicious codes could be reduced to the detection of the various mutations of the self-relocation gene. This study presents such a detection mechanism based on finite state machine theory for both known and previously unknown malicious executable codes. It does not rely on signature-screening of known viruses, but instead it detects self-relocation attempt of the suspicious executable code. The experiments were conducted and the results indicate that the proposed approach has better ability to detect known and previously unknown malicious executable codes than other methods.	intrusion detection system;relocation (computing);self-relocation	Yu Zhang;Tao Li;Jia Sun;Renchao Qin	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87442-3_46	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;finite-state machine;computer security	ML	-59.14377111481164	60.517930875912064	58306

On the other hand, critics point out that attackers may game the profiler by manipulating their attributes and behavior, making the profiler ineffective. We examine how passenger profiling impacts airport security operations when the profiler is vulnerable to gaming by attackers. We consider the no-profiling setup and two profiling setups. In the no-profiling setup, all passengers are sent through a screening device, and those that raise an alarm are physically inspected. In the first profiling setup, all classified attackers are physically inspected and classified normal passengers are sent through a screening device, and those that raise an alarm are physically inspected. In the second profiling setup, every passenger, regardless of the profiler's classification, is sent through a screening device and those that raise an alarm are inspected, but the screening devices are configured differently for classified attackers and classified normal passengers. We find that, regardless of the profiling setup, the optimal profiling setup performs at least as good as the no-profiling setup on key performance measures such as total expected security cost, inspection rate of normal passengers, and attacker detection rate even when the profiler is vulnerable to attackers' gaming. The benefit from profiling increases if the profiler becomes less vulnerable. Although neither profiling setup dominates the other on these performance measures, we find that each setup has different desirable properties.

Fingerprinting consists of uniquely marking and registering each copy of the data. This marking allows a distributor to detect any unauthorized copy and trace it back to the user. This threat of detection will hopefully deter users from releasing unauthorized copies. A problem arises when users collude: For digital data, two di erent ngerprinted objects can be compared and the di erences between them detected. Hence, a set of users can collude to detect the location of the ngerprint. They can then alter the ngerprint to mask their identities. We present a general ngerprinting solution which is secure in the context of collusion. In addition, we discuss methods for distributing ngerprinted data.	authorization;code word;digital data;fingerprint;item unique identification	Dan Boneh;James Shaw	1998	IEEE Trans.

The introduction of commercial wireless communications and networks, and the recognition by industry of the need for security has provided the opportunity for development and trials of a wireless, secure e-mail service. The Center for Systems Engineering at the Defense Information Systems Agency has developed this capability and conducted trials with a small community of DOD users who have requirements for mobility in the workplace. These trials have introduced DOD approved security into commercial wireless data networks, and have inserted advanced technology into the hands of DOD users. The objective of these trials was to validate the system design, evaluate performance and utilization, and obtain user feedback. To realize a broad-based trial, the authors selected multiple wireless services, e-mail packages, security packages, and mobile computers, which were integrated in various combinations to meet user needs and allow a thorough trial. Both packet radio (RAM and ARDIS) and cellular digital packet data (CDPD) services were employed for the wireless connection of the mobile unit to a mail server on the user's local area network (LAN). Two commercial e-mail packages (LOTUS CC:Mail and Microsoft Mail) were integrated with the wireless service and with the security packages. Two security packages were used, one based on commercial software (SecretAgent) and the other based on a PCMCIA card (FORTEZZA) developed by the National Security Agency. >	email	David R.

22d1cd060866ac8f0ac0404b71659452bf266ca7	security analysis of bloom filter based multicast forwarding		Bloom filter (BF) based forwarding is an effective approach to implement scalable multicasting. The forwarding BF carried by each packet can encode either multicast tree or destination IP addresses, which are termed as tree oriented approach (TOA) and destination oriented approach (DOA), respectively. Studies have indicated that TOA based protocols have serious vulnerabilities under some distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and raised doubt about deployability of BF based multicasting. However, security analysis for DOA based protocols is still unavailable, and the fundamental effect of in-packet routing information on security performance of BF based multicast protocols is yet to be revealed. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of security performance of BF based multicasting. Important DDoS attacks and the corresponding defending mechanisms are studied in the context of DOA. We have positive findings that DOA, with convenient enhancement, has a robust performance in resisting a variety of DDoS attacks that can deny service of TOA based protocols. Moreover, we reveal that TOA based protocols are prone to flow duplication attack when applied in the data center network (DCN). We propose a dynamic-sized BF mechanism to defend against flow duplication attack for TOA based protocols in the DCN. Simulation results are presented to validate our theoretical analysis.	attack model;bloom filter;brainfuck;code injection;data center;denial-of-service attack;direction of arrival;dynamic circuit network;encode;multicast;network packet;routing;scalability;simulation;time of arrival	Xiaohua Tian;Jiaqi Liu;Wei Liu;Yu Cheng;Lijun Ou;Zilong Zhao	2017		10.1145/3063955.3063994	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Security	-54.776365806188345	74.70522404855501	58529

Recent Denial of Service (DoS) attack on Independence Day weekend, on July 4th, 2009 launched to debilitate the US and South Korean governments’ websites is indicative of the fact that the security systems may not have been adequately deployed to counteract such attacks. IPS is a vital security device which is commonly used as a front line defense mechanism to defend against such DoS attacks. Before deploying a firewall or an IPS device for network protection, in many deployments, the performance of firewalls is seldom evaluated for their effectiveness. Many times, these IPS’s can become bottleneck to the network performance and they may not be effective in stopping DoS attacks. In this paper, we intend to drive the point that deploying IPS may not always be effective in stopping harmful effects of DoS attacks. It is important to evaluate the capability of IPS before they are deployed to protect a network or a server against DoS attacks. In this paper, we evaluate performance of a commercial grade IPS Cisco ASA-5510 IPS to measure its effectiveness in stopping a DoS attacks namely TCP-SYN, UDP Flood, Ping Flood and ICMP Land Attacks. This IPS comes with features to counteract and provide security against these attacks. Performance of the IPS is measured under these attacks protection and compared with its performance when these protection features were not available (i.e. disabled). It was found that the IPS was unable to provide satisfactory protection despite the availability of the protection features against these flooding attacks. It is important for the network managers to measure the actual capabilities of an IPS system before its deployment to protect critical information infrastructure.	cisco pix;data rate units;denial-of-service attack;experiment;firewall (computing);intrusion detection system;land;microsoft windows;network performance;network security;overhead (computing);ping flood;syn flood;server (computing);shift jis;software deployment;synergy;udp flood attack;web server;web service;world wide web	Sanjeev Kumar;Raja Sekhar Reddy Gade	2012	J.

Such networks will have the essential property of cognitive selforganization, which can be achieved using machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning). Despite the potential of these techniques, these techniques in their current form are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can cause cascaded damages with detrimental consequences for the whole network. In this paper, we explore the effect of adversarial attacks on CSON. Our experiments highlight the level of threat that CSON have to deal with in order to meet the challenges of next-generation networks and point out promising directions for future work.	adversary (cryptography);deep learning;essence;experiment;machine learning;organizing (structure);self-organization;software deployment	Muhammad Usama;Junaid Qadir;Ala I.

ede8d602a652968f247ea6b3586e68aba6ff098e	one-time password based on hash chain without shared secret and re-registration		Abstract Lamport u0027s one-time password (OTP) was originally proposed to address the weaknesses of a simple password system. However, it has been widely used to design key management and authentication mechanisms. OTP is based on a hash chain constructed using only the cryptographic hash function, in which the hash chain is a main engine for OTP generation. Thus, the structural property of the hash chain determines the advantages and disadvantages of the OTP system that employs it. A main weakness of Lamport u0027s OTP is that the length of the hash chain is finite, meaning that OTP generation is also finite. In this paper, a new hash chain is designed and constructed for infinite OTP generation without a pre-shared secret between two parties (prover and verifier). Instead of a single long hash chain as in Lamport u0027s OTP, the hash chain in the proposed OTP consists of multiple short hash chains. This paper shows that the proposed OTP addresses the weaknesses of Lamport u0027s OTP while preserving its advantages.	hash chain;one-time password;shared secret	Chang-Seop Park	2018	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2018.02.010	key management;computer security;shared secret;cryptographic hash function;password;computer science;hash function;distributed computing;hash chain;authentication;one-time password	Crypto	-40.749903232822895	75.94868983228729	58679

In some cases, the collected data is misused, resulting on user privacy violation. The existing tools which aim at guaranteeing user privacy usually restrict access to personalized services. In this work, we propose the Web bug detector. Upon detecting and informing users about browsing tracking mechanisms which invisibly collect their personal information when visiting sites, it represents an alternative that provides a better control over privacy while allowing personalization. Through experimental results, we demonstrate the applicability of our strategy by applying the detector to a real workload. We found that about 5.37% of user's requests were being tracked by third-party sites.	personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy;sensor;world wide web	Fabiano A.

For example, deploying effective security for wireless networks is a difficult task, even for skilled systems administrators – a fact that is impeding the deployment of many mobile systems. In this paper we describe a system that lets typical users easily build a highly secure wireless network. Our main contribution is to show how gesture-based user interfaces can be applied to provide a complete solution for securing wireless networks. This allows users to intuitively manage the network security of their mobile devices, even those with limited user interfaces. We demonstrate through user studies that our secure implementation is considerably easier to use than typical commercially available options, even those that provide lower security. Our gesture-based approach is quite general, and can be used to design a wide variety of systems that are simultaneously secure and easy to administer.	gesture recognition;mobile device;network security;software deployment;usability testing;user interface	Dirk Balfanz;Glenn Durfee;Rebecca E.

In this contribution, we first present a categorization of privacy attacks and related defenses. Then, we consider the class of defense techniques that aim at providing privacy through anonymity and in particular algorithms achieving “historical k-anonymity” in the case of the adversary obtaining a trace of requests recognized as being issued by the same (anonymous) user. Finally, we investigate the issues involved in the experimental evaluation of anonymity based defense techniques; we show that user movement simulations based on mostly random movements can lead to overestimate the privacy protection in some cases and to overprotective techniques in other cases. The above results are obtained by comparison to a more realistic simulation with an agent-based simulator, considering a specific deployment scenario.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;agent-based model;algorithm;categorization;location-based service;performance evaluation;privacy;simulation;software deployment	Claudio Bettini;Sergio Mascetti;Xiaoyang Sean Wang;Dario Freni;Sushil Jajodia	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03511-1_1	privacy software;computer science;location-based service;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-49.50933502540001	74.04576739729433	58907
7d34da9b4be25169b644417c95b69173bb609e42	machine learning on merging static and dynamic features to identify malicious mobile apps		The amount of Android system-targeted malware has increased dramatically in recent years, and Android has been the focus of far more malware targeting than other mobile operating systems. In order to reduce the hazards of malware, this paper proposes a malware detection system with static and dynamic app features. In terms of the static features, the permissions, native-permissions, function and priority of an app are extracted as the base of analysis. In terms of the dynamic feature, the app is executed in a sandbox emulator, and then log files are analyzed to identify behaviors that help judgment, such as sending short messages without permission, modifying system files or reading personal data. This system extracts the static and dynamic features of an app, which are then merged before the weights are adjusted appropriately. Finally, Weka is used for training to obtain the detection module. According to the experiment, an unknown malicious act is evaluated using tenfold cross validation; the proposed system achieves a 97.4% accuracy.	android;cross-validation (statistics);data logger;emulator;machine learning;malware;mobile app;mobile operating system;norm (social);personally identifiable information;weka	Ming-Yang Su;Jer-Yuan Chang;Kek-Tung Fung	2017	2017 Ninth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2017.7993923	real-time computing;cross-validation;merge (version control);computer science;android (operating system);malware;distributed computing;operating system;sandbox (computer security);permission	SE	-56.98571618662793	60.77095246772068	58939

The technique, which shares a conceptual origin with the idea of a rank function, uses the notion of a message-template to determine whether a given value is generable by an intruder in a protocol model. Traditionally, the rich algebraic structure of Diffie-Hellman messages has made it difficult to reason about such protocols using formal, rather than complexity-theoretic, techniques. We describe the approach in the context of the MTI protocols, and derive conditions under which each protocol in the suite can be considered secure.	clique (graph theory);computation;computational diffie–hellman assumption;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman key exchange;dolev–yao model;existential quantification;hoc (programming language);key authentication;linear algebra;moving target indication;shared secret;strand (programming language);theory;yao graph	Rob Delicata;Steve A.

We examine the selective receipt problem and the generation of time evidence, analyse the current state of the ISO/IEC 13888 drafts on non-repudiation mechanisms, and present a fair non-repudiation protocol including time evidence to promote the development of these drafts. 1 Motivation Repudiation is one of the possible security threats existing in social and electronic environments. Consider rst some of the problems that can arise in the world of paper-based business transactions. Paper documents, such as contracts, quotations, bids, orders, invoices, and cheques play a critical role in the conduct of business between organizations. However, many problems can occur in their handling, such as { forged documents; { disputed ling time of a document; { documents accidentally corrupted or fraudulently modiied within an organization or while in transit between organizations; and { documents lost or delayed during mail delivery. There are two possibilities regarding each of these events. A document could be genuine or a forgery; it could have been sent to the recipient or never been mailed at all; it could reach the destination or get lost in delivery; it could be delivered intact or corrupted in delivery; it could be delivered in time or delayed. If two possibilities of an event cannot be distinguished, a party related to the event could make one of the following`denials': { denial of authorship of a document; { denial of sending a document; { denial of receiving a document; and { denial of sending or receiving a document at a given time.	document;global serializability;non-repudiation	Jianying Zhou;Dieter Gollmann	1996		10.1007/BFb0034842	computer security;theoretical computer science;communications security;non-repudiation;computer science;receipt	Web+IR	-44.447347999812116	72.02448368421709	59055
5a2dbf2dc248abfc6bfb3261d11542a1b80a9a78	automated penalization of data breaches using crypto-augmented smart contracts		This work studies the problem of automatically penalizing intentional or unintentional data breach (APDB) by a receiver/custodian receiving confidential data from a sender. We solve this problem by augmenting a blockchain on-chain smart contract between the sender and receiver with an off-chain cryptographic protocol, such that any significant data breach from the receiver is penalized through a monetary loss. Towards achieving the goal, we develop a natural extension of oblivious transfer called doubly oblivious transfer (DOT) which, when combined with robust watermarking and a claim-or-refund blockchain contract provides the necessary framework to realize the APDB protocol in a provably secure manner. In our APDB protocol, a public data breach by the receiver leads to her Bitcoin (or other blockchain) private signing key getting revealed to the sender, which allows him to penalize the receiver by claiming the deposit from the claim-or-refund contract. Interestingly, the protocol also ensures that the malicious sender cannot steal the deposit, even as he knows the original document or releases it in any form. We implement our APDB protocol, develop the required smart contract for Bitcoin and observe our system to be efficient and easy to deploy in practice. We analyze our DOT-based design against partial adversarial leakages and observe it to be robust against even small leakages of data.	bitcoin;confidentiality;cryptographic protocol;cryptography;data breach;information privacy;malware;oblivious transfer;provable security;smart contract	Easwar Vivek Mangipudi;K.

2284120076f5c0e3170b6fe3b3a9ec357cbe5a96	chaos-based detection of ldos attacks	duffing oscillator;chaos;detection;期刊论文;ldos	A low-rate denial of service (LDoS) attack behaves as a small signal in periodic pulses with low average rate, which hides in normal TCP traffic stealthily. LDoS attacks reduce link throughput and degrade QoS of a target. An approach of detecting LDoS attacks is proposed based on Duffing oscillator in chaos systems. The approach detects LDoS attacks by adopting the technology of digital signal processing (DSP), which takes an LDoS attack as a small signal and normal TCP traffic as background noise. Duffing oscillator is used to detect LDoS attacks in normal TCP traffic. Simulations show that the LDoS attacks can be detected through diagram of the chaotic state, and the period and pulse width of LDoS attacks can be estimated.

Such information can be critical to the mission of the sensor network, such as the location of a target object in a monitoring application, and it is often important to protect this information as well as message content. There have been several recent studies on providing location privacy in sensor networks. However, these existing approaches assume a weak adversary model where the adversary sees only local network traffic. We first argue that a strong adversary model, the global eavesdropper, is often realistic in practice and can defeat existing techniques. We then formalize the location privacy issues under this strong adversary model and show how much communication overhead is needed for achieving a given level of privacy. We also propose two techniques that prevent the leakage of location information: periodic collection and source simulation. Periodic collection provides a high level of location privacy, while source simulation provides trade-offs between privacy, communication cost, and latency. Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed techniques are efficient and effective in protecting location information from the attacker.	adversary (cryptography);adversary model;confidentiality;high-level programming language;network security;network traffic control;overhead (computing);privacy;simulation;spectral leakage	Kiran Mehta;Donggang Liu;Matthew K.

5b30380e75a0dfa37651dec6c6a4f0111ebb6966	securing the smart grid with hardware security modules		Security vendors have a major role to play in today’s smart grid ecosystem. Because the smart grid network includes intelligent endpoints and network devices that collect and relay information to a utility’s back office via an IP network, there are inherent security and risk concerns. Critical energy information flows through various interconnected networks like home network, public network, and utility network. Hence, it needs to be encrypted. Not only is it critical to encrypt the flow of information between the utility and devices on the grid, but it is also important to guarantee the integrity and the authenticity of each communication. Today’s cryptography guarantees the security of various data, so the way electronic transactions are processed completely meets demands for confidentiality, integrity, and identity (authenticity). However, the encrypted data are not protected effectively until the computer systems on which these electronic transactions get processed are also fully secured. Securing these computer systems clearly includes caring for the security of cryptographic keys being used to encrypt and sign respectively decrypt and verify transaction data. A solution to achieve this has been developed using Hardware Security Modules (HSM). This paper exposes some of the security features, requirements and best practices why utility industries should consider acquiring an HSM solution to better secure the smart grid.	hardware security module	Dieter Bong;Andreas Philipp	2012		10.1007/978-3-658-00333-3_13	embedded system;computer security	Crypto	-50.571160949621145	60.98284188341617	59164

Our first result is the discovery of statistical biases of the digraphs distribution of RC4/RC4A generated streams, where digraphs tend to repeat with short gaps between them. We show how an attacker can use these biased patterns to distinguish RC4 keystreams of 2 bytes and RC4A keystreams of 2 bytes from randomness with success rate of more than 2/3. Our second result is the discovery of a family of patterns in RC4 keystreams whose probabilities in RC4 keystreams are several times their probabilities in random streams. These patterns can be used to predict bits and words of RC4 with arbitrary advantage, e.g., after 2 output words a single bit can be predicted with probability of 85%, and after 2 output words a single byte can be predicted with probability of 82%, contradicting the unpredictability property of PRNGs.	byte;directed graph;rc4;randomness;sbcs;stream cipher	Itsik Mantin	2005		10.1007/11426639_29	computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;stream cipher;computer security;algorithm;statistics	Crypto	-40.10676243984881	83.39438093424435	59177

fd0fdd719cce7e7950e2900f6768dcfb0a074e25	authenticated encryption mode iapm using sha-3's public random permutation		We study instantiating the random permutation of the blockcipher mode of operation IAPM (Integrity-Aware Parallelizable Mode) with the public random permutation of Keccak, on which the draft standard SHA-3 is built. IAPM and the related mode OCB are single-pass highly parallelizable authenticated-encryption modes, and while they were originally proven secure in the private random permutation model, Kurosawa has shown that they are also secure in the public random permutation model assuming the whitening keys are uniformly chosen with double the usual entropy. In this paper, we show a general composability result that shows that the whitening key can be obtained from the usual entropy source by a key-derivation function which is itself built on Keccak. We stress that this does not follow directly from the usual indifferentiability of key-derivation function constructions from Random Oracles. We also show that a simple and general construction, again employing Keccak, can also be used to make the IAPM scheme keydependent-message secure. Finally, implementations on modern AMD-64 architecture supporting 128-bit SIMD instructions, and not supporting the native AES instructions, show that IAPM with Keccak runs three times faster than IAPM with AES.	128-bit;authenticated encryption;authentication;block cipher mode of operation;composability;key derivation function;merge sort;random permutation;sha-3;simd;whitening transformation;x86-64	Charanjit S.

439c524763227da08da49c9943599550fa404ad4	achieving ind-cca security for functional encryption for inner products		Functional encryption allows the authorised parties to reveal partial information of the plaintext hidden in a ciphertext while in conventional encryption decryption is all-or-nothing. Focusing on the functionality of inner product evaluation (i.e. given vectors (varvec{x}) and (varvec{y}), calculate (langle varvec{x} , varvec{y} rangle )), Abdalla et al. (PKC 2015) proposed a functional encryption scheme for inner product functionality (FE-IP) with s-IND-CPA security. In some recent works by Abdalla et al. (eprint: Report 2016/11) and Agrawal et al. (CRYPTO 2016), IND-CPA secure FE-IP schemes have also been proposed. In order to achieve Indistinguishable under Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (IND-CCA security) for FE-IP, in this paper, we propose a generic construction of FE-IP from hash proof systems. We prove the constructed FE-IP is IND-CCA secure, assuming the hardness of the subset membership problem. In addition, we give an instantiation of our generic construction from the DDH assumption.	ciphertext indistinguishability;functional encryption	Shiwei Zhang;Yi Mu;Guomin Yang	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-54705-3_8	h.235;internet privacy;computer security	Crypto	-39.90746241514962	75.4045233399561	59307
e460a6ed1e62d033e5ab2eddacf399f207fa9a5c	secure and energy efficient routing protocol in wireless sensor network: a survey		The exponentially demand of Quality of Service (QoS) communication has made wireless communication as an inevitable technologies. Amongst major at hand technologies, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been found an a potential solution to meet major real-world requirements, including monitoring and control, surveillance, healthcare, traffic surveillance and defence systems. Facilitating QoS demands, energy-efficiency and secure communication has always been an open research area for academia-industries. The lack of security not only forces network to undergo compromised situation but also makes it energy exhaustive. On the other hand, providing delay resilient, energy-efficient, higher throughout and secure communication makes WSN robust and efficient. Recently, the use of cryptographic techniques has played vital role towards energy efficient and secure communication. However, enabling robust solution with optimal security techniques in conjunction with improved routing model is an open research area. With this motivation, in this paper some of the key literatures discussing cryptographic techniques and routing approaches for energy efficient and secure communication for WSN. This study revealed that the use of a time and computation efficient cryptography system in conjunction with enhanced routing protocol can ensure secure and energy-efficient communication over WSNs.	authentication;computation;computational complexity theory;cryptography;cryptosystem;data security;digital signature;ecc memory;open research;processing delay;quality of service;rsa (cryptosystem);requirement;routing;secure communication;throughput	Notom Ajaykumar;Mrinal Sarvagya	2017	2017 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2017.8126192	control engineering;computer science;wireless sensor network;cryptography;quality of service;encryption;open research;routing protocol;secure communication;wireless;computer network	Mobile	-50.97885595883861	75.17104584621707	59308

2ca36cfea0aba89e19b3551c325e999e0fb6607c	attribute-based encryption for circuits	lattices;fine grained access control;attribute based encryption;cryptography;learning with errors	In an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, a ciphertext is associated with an ℓ-bit public index ind and a message m, and a secret key is associated with a Boolean predicate P. The secret key allows decrypting the ciphertext and learning m if and only if P(ind) = 1. Moreover, the scheme should be secure against collusions of users, namely, given secret keys for polynomially many predicates, an adversary learns nothing about the message if none of the secret keys can individually decrypt the ciphertext.  We present attribute-based encryption schemes for circuits of any arbitrary polynomial size, where the public parameters and the ciphertext grow linearly with the depth of the circuit. Our construction is secure under the standard learning with errors (LWE) assumption. Previous constructions of attribute-based encryption were for Boolean formulas, captured by the complexity class NC1.  In the course of our construction, we present a new framework for constructing ABE schemes. As a by-product of our framework, we obtain ABE schemes for polynomial-size branching programs, corresponding to the complexity class LOGSPACE, under quantitatively better assumptions.	adversary (cryptography);attribute-based encryption;ciphertext;complexity class;cryptography;key (cryptography);l (complexity);learning with errors;nc (complexity);polynomial;predicate (mathematical logic)	Sergey Gorbunov;Vinod Vaikuntanathan;Hoeteck Wee	2013	J.

Although the recent theft involved a laptop, consideration should be given to the fact that data mobility is not just a laptop problem, PDA's and smartphones and removable media must be considered as well. Market research was performed evaluating technologies in the various encryption product classes including full-disk encryption, hardware-based disk encryption, virtual disk encryption, and file encryption. Based on this analysis it was determined a full-disk encryption solution is most appropriate. Before performing a more in-depth review of the full-disk encryption technologies available, criteria were formulated with the critical criteria being industry standard encryption, minimal impact on users and operations staff, and strong key management and recovery capabilities as well as other criteria. Based on those criteria two product suites are deemed to be the best fit. These suites of products are from SafeBoot Corporation and from PointSec Mobile Technology. The next steps should be to perform a detailed technical evaluation of these two products including a limited trial to determine the suitability of these products in our environment. Further details are in the Project Planning section.	confidentiality;curve fitting;disk encryption hardware;disk image;encryption software;key management;laptop;microsoft windows;mobile device;personal digital assistant;personally identifiable information;removable media;smartphone;strong key;technical standard	Vartika Singh;D.

Designers of such systems want them used in open networks, where an adversary can perform a sybil attack by introducing a large number of corrupt nodes in the network, considerably degrading its performance. We introduce a routing strategy that alleviates some of the effects of such an attack by making sure that lookups are performed using a diverse set of nodes. This ensures that at least some of the nodes queried are good, and hence the search makes forward progress. This strategy makes use of latent social information present in the introduction graph of the network.	adversary (cryptography);distributed computing;distributed hash table;routing;sybil attack	George Danezis;Chris Lesniewski-Laas;M.

We demonstrate and measure the effectiveness of our method by running a series of tests in an emulated network. We analyze our test results in terms of reducing the overall detection interval for a SDN with multiple controllers. Our testing indicates that inter-controller communication allows pre-emptive mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) vectors.	denial-of-service attack;emulator;software-defined networking	J.

Nowadays, data collection is ubiquitous in social and business areas. Many companies and organizations want to do the collaborative association rules mining to get the joint benefits. However, the sensitive information leakage is a problem we have to solve and privacy-preserving techniques are strongly needed. In this paper, we focus on the privacy issue of the association rules mining and propose a secure frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) based scheme to preserve private information while doing the collaborative association rules mining. We show that our scheme is secure and collusion-resistant for  n parties, which means that even if  n − 1 dishonest parties collude with a dishonest data miner in an attempt to learn the associations rules between honest respondents and their responses, they will be unable to success.

For maximum effectiveness, such networks publish public reports without disclosing sensor locations, so that the Internet community can take steps to counteract the malicious traffic. Maintaining sensor anonymity is critical because if the set of sensors is known, a malicious attacker could avoid the sensors entirely or could overwhelm the sensors with errant data. Motivated by the growing use of Internet sensors as a tool to monitor Internet traffic, we show that networks that publicly report statistics are vulnerable to intelligent probing to determine the location of sensors. In particular, we develop a new “probe response” attack technique with a number of optimizations for locating the sensors in currently deployed Internet sensor networks and illustrate the technique for a specific case study that shows how the attack would locate the sensors of the SANS Internet Storm Center using the published data from those sensors. Simulation results show that the attack can determine the identity of the sensors in this and other sensor networks in less than a week, even under a limited adversarial model. We detail critical vulnerabilities in several current anonymization schemes and demonstrate that we can quickly and efficiently discover the sensors even in the presence of sophisticated anonymity preserving methods such as prefix-preserving permutations or Bloom filters. Finally, we consider the characteristics of an Internet sensor which make it vulnerable to probe response attacks and discuss potential countermeasures.	adversary model;bloom filter;data anonymization;dolev–yao model;honeypot (computing);internet storm center;log analysis;malware;sensor;simulation	John Bethencourt;Jason Franklin;Mary K.

However, in order to enjoy such services, the user must precisely disclose his/her exact location to the LBS. So, it is a key challenge to efficiently preserve user's privacy while accessing LBS. For this, the existing method employs a 2PASS cloaking framework that not only hides the actual user location but also reduces bandwidth consumption. However, it suffers from privacy attack. Therefore, we aim to provide the solutions which can preserve user privacy by utilizing k-anonymity mechanism. In this paper, we propose a weighted adjacency graph based k-anonymous cloaking technique that can provide protection to user and also reduce bandwidth usages. Our cloaking approach efficiently supports k-nearest neighbor queries without revealing private information of the query initiator. We demonstrate via experimental results that our algorithm yields much better performance than the existing one.	data access;experiment;geographic coordinate system;global positioning system;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;location-based service;personally identifiable information;privacy;response time (technology);scsi initiator and target;server (computing);software propagation;warez	Amina Hossain;Al-Amin Hossain;Sung-Jae Jang;Young-Sung Shin;Jae-Woo Chang	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.193	privacy software;geography;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	DB	-39.55769547694565	60.54937968400991	59707

In these situations an access policy (consisting of attributes as road situation and vehicle type) is built into the vehicle and messages are encrypted using these access policies. Only valid vehicles possessing these attributes are able to decrypt the message. Huang and Verma [16] had proposed such an access control framework. The scheme assumed that the road-side units (RSU) are not compromised and had a very restricted access structure. We propose a new access control structure which eliminates the drawbacks of their schemes, by providing access control in presence of compromised RSU. Our technique permits a more general boolean access structure. Communication is possible between two vehicles which are monitored by two RSU, which was not permitted in [16]. The costs are comparable to that of [16].	access control;access structure;control flow;encryption;freedom of information laws by country;overhead (computing)	Sushmita Ruj;Amiya Nayak;Ivan Stojmenovic	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22450-8_15	vehicular ad hoc network;computer access control;physical access;discretionary access control;computer science;access control;distributed computing;computer security;computer network;network access point	Security	-44.56047319894441	67.43130335355146	59767

Strong secrecy means that an adversary cannot see any difference when the value of the secret changes. Our technique relies on an automatic translation of the protocol into Horn clauses, and a resolution algorithm on the clauses. It requires important extensions with respect to previous work for the proof of (standard) secrecy and authenticity. This technique can handle a wide range of cryptographic primitives, and yields proofs valid for an unbounded number of sessions and an unbounded message space; it is also flexible and efficient. We have proved its correctness, implemented it, and tested it on several examples of protocols including JFK by W. Aiello et al.

To address this problem, inspired by the two notions of the ring signature and the authenticated encryption signature, we propose a new type of authenticated encryption scheme, which we call the ring authenticated encryption scheme, which can enable any member of a group of persons to provide a clue to some designated recipient wisely. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is fully automated and computationally sound symbolic analysis. Furthermore, Canetti and Gajek have analyzed Diffie-Hellman based key exchange protocols as an extension of their work. It deals with forward secrecy in case of fully adaptive party corruptions. However, their work only addresses two-party protocols that use public key encryptions, digital signatures and Diffie-Hellman exchange. We make the following contributions. First, we extend UCSA approach to analyze group key exchange protocols that use bilinear pairings exchange and digital signatures to resist insider attack under fully adaptive party corruptions with respect to forward secrecy. Specifically, we propose an formal algebra, and property of bilinear pairings in the execution of group key exchange protocol among arbitrary number of participants. This provides computationally sound and fully automated analysis. Second, we reduce the security of multiple group key exchange sessions among arbitrary number of participants to the security of a single group key exchange session among three participants. This improves the efficiency of security analysis.	antivirus software;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;diffie–hellman key exchange;digital signature;forward secrecy;group key;key-agreement protocol;mutual authentication;provable security;public-key cryptography;universal composability	Zijian Zhang;Liehuang Zhu;Lejian Liao	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.029	computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;algorithm	Security	-41.715253191112325	75.20852926180392	59994

The traditional authentication system of using text-based passwords has many flaws in the aspects of usability and security issues. Hence, graphical passwords, which consist of clicking or dragging activities on the pictures rather than typing textual characters, were introduced to overcome this problem. However, it is found that these graphical passwords are susceptible to brute force and dictionary attack methods. To overcome this drawback, images can be used as password replacing alphanumeric and graphical passwords. The challenge lies in encrypting the image password and storing it in the database. An image edge password encryption (IEPE) algorithm is proposed to encrypt the image passwords based on its edge values. Experimental results are shown to prove that encrypted image passwords using IEPE algorithm requires a less internal storage space when compared with the existing password encryption techniques. It is also shown that IEPE algorithm scales better when compared with the existing text-based and graphical password authentication methods. Also, IEPE algorithm is shown to resist various password cryptanalytic attacks. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.	encryption;password	N. K. Sreelaja;N. K.

N-Cloud provides availability by dividing/splitting a file into many chunks, and replicating in a non-overlapping manner these chunks into many cloud storages, based on security and reliability consideration. In this scheme, the chunks of a file can be encrypted concurrently while the encrypted chunks can be uploaded to geographical separated cloud storages in parallel. Same benefit can be achieved for the downloading and decrypting process. It greatly speeds up the processing and transfer. N-Cloud provides confidentiality by dividing/splitting a file into many chunks, encrypting all chunks, and distributing these chunks to many clouds. N-Cloud ensures that no one cloud has the whole file; the scheme will not be compromised unless an attacker breaks into all cloud storage. A preliminary results show significant performance improvement over existing schemes.	cloud computing;cloud storage;confidentiality;cryptography;download;encryption;parallel computing	Fahad Alsolami;C.

This increased use of web services has meant that more and more personal information of consumers is being shared with web service providers, leading to the need to guarantee that the private data of consumers are not illegitimate collected, used and disclosed in services collaboration. This paper studies how to realize the minimal privacy authorization while achieving the functional goals. Initially, this paper uses authorization policies to specify the privacy privileges of the services collaboration, and utilizes the trust relationships among services to make authorization decision. Next, it models the interface behaviors of services by extending the interface automata to support privacy semantics. Furthermore, it quantitatively analyzes the minimum set of privacy privileges which are required by the services to achieve the functional goals, and presents the minimal authorization algorithm, which helps us to automatically derive optimal authorization policies for a services collaboration. Finally, it verifies the correctness and efficiency of the approach proposed by this paper through a case study.	authorization;web service	LinYuan Liu;Haibin Zhu;Zhiqiu Huang;Dongqing Xie	2011	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2010.09.001	web service;computer science;ws-policy;database;services computing;internet privacy;law;world wide web;computer security	Security	-44.129345019527676	61.09397778913323	60122

Biometrics systems and mainly multi-biometric systems provide tools to enforce reliable logs of system transactions and protect an individual's right to privacy. Passwords and user ids are often passed, written down for convenience or reused multiple times in different networks. Biometric logins would make it unfeasible for anyone, other than the intended person to login to the network or system but at the same time no need to remember passwords and user ids. Governments, law enforcement agencies, military and industrial companies are already making partial use of this technology. Researchers and practitioners are integrating identifying technologies into robotics, human computer interfaces, gaming systems, mobile devices, door locks, automobiles, and so on. Government of India is introducing biometric based authentication system for all Indian citizens.

The question arises if with the increasing downscale in process technology and the larger role of static leakage or other harder to model leakages, the pure theoretical proof of a countermeasure’s security is still good practice. As a case study we take a new large ROM-based masking countermeasure recently presented at CT-RSA 2012. We evaluate the security of the scheme both under the leakage assumptions given in the original article and using a more realworld approach utilizing collision attacks. We can demonstrate that while the new construction methods of the schemes provide a higher security given the assumed leakage model, the security gain in practice is only marginal compared to the conventional large ROM scheme. This highlights the needs for a closer collaboration of the different disciplines when proposing new countermeasures to provide better security statements covering both the theoretical reasoning and the practical evaluations.	collision attack;combinational logic;downscaling;field-programmable gate array;glitch;hamming code;hamming distance;hamming weight;linear function;lookup table;marginal model;rsa (cryptosystem);rsa conference;read-only memory;s-box;spectral leakage;windows update	Amir Moradi;Oliver Mischke	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33027-8_6	computer science;theoretical computer science;computer security;algorithm	Security	-35.62028074968332	80.1537315635079	60202
07233a36f45518e62b83d1fbddff35479810ce5c	socialimpact: systematic analysis of underground social dynamics		Existing research on net-centric attacks has focused on the detection of attack events on network side and the removal of rogue programs from client side. However, such approaches largely overlook the way on how attack tools and unwanted programs are developed and distributed. Recent studies in underground economy reveal that suspicious attackers heavily utilize online social networks to form special interest groups and distribute malicious code. Consequently, examining social dynamics, as a novel way to complement existing research efforts, is imperative to systematically identify attackers and tactically cope with net-centric threats. In this paper, we seek a way to understand and analyze social dynamics relevant to net-centric attacks and propose a suite of measures called SocialImpact for systematically discovering and mining adversarial evidence. We also demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of our approach by implementing a proof-of-concept prototype Cassandra with a case study on real-world data archived from the Internet.	apache cassandra;archive;client-side;imperative programming;malware;net-centric;prototype;rogue;social dynamics;social network;subject matter expert turing test;underground;usability	Ziming Zhao;Gail-Joon Ahn;Hongxin Hu;Deepinder Mahi	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33167-1_50	internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Security	-58.85808940177266	62.55746226571968	60212

Also, using a modification of known techniques the algorithm can be made immune against differential power attacks. The algorithm uses Montgomery's trick and a precomputed table consisting of multiples of the base point. Consequently, the algorithm is useful in a scenario where the base point is fixed, like Elgamal encryption or signature generation. Under such circumstances, for hyperelliptic curves, the algorithm compares favourably with other known algorithms over all fields. For elliptic curves, under similar circumstances, the algorithm performs better than other algorithms over prime fields. The increase in speed is due to a proper application of Montgomery's trick to efficiently perform the simultaneous inversion of several field elements.	montgomery modular multiplication;scalar processor	Pradeep Kumar Mishra;Palash Sarkar	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24632-9_4	inversion;arithmetic;cryptanalysis;discrete mathematics;hyperelliptic curve cryptography;scalar multiplication;mathematics;public-key cryptography;elliptic curve;hyperelliptic curve;elliptic curve point multiplication;computer security;multiplication;encryption;algebra	Crypto	-40.056201869837665	81.40959235472307	60228

In this paper, we introduce a novel low processing time ECG anonymisation method employing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. The proposed framework is suitable for sensor node platforms due to its low processing time. It was developed to address two major inherent limitations in the Internet of Medical Thing (IMedT) environment including most current requirement for securing ECG signal and urgent need for efficient methods to overcome physical limitation of sensor nodes. Ramifications from computer simulation showed that the proposed model was able to obscure both fiducial and non-fiducial features of the ECG signals. Performance evaluation between the original and the reconstructed ECG signals revealed strong cross-correlation implying lossless reconstruction of the original ECG signal. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a lower processing time security algorithm as compared with the recently proposed wavelet based anonymisation methods. Finally, the proposed framework offered advantages in terms of flexibility in determining the secret key length makes it suitable for various applications.

In this paper, we introduce the constrained MQ problem, which is a new mathematical problem derived from the MQ problem. We also propose an encryption scheme construction method in MPKC, the pq-method, whose security is mainly based on the difficulty of solving the constrained MQ problem. We analyze the difficulty level of solving the constrained MQ problem, including different approach from the usual for solving the MQ problem. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the constrained MQ problem, we present secure parameters for the pq-method, and implement the practical schemes.	encryption	Takanori Yasuda	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-01446-9_8	theoretical computer science;mathematical problem;encryption;public-key cryptography;multivariate statistics;post-quantum cryptography;computer science	Crypto	-39.60529560505425	80.07986034308095	60287
528aeda26908fc00a7ad89316b990d9fbfe1b8d3	detection of impersonation attack in manet using polynomial reduction algorithm		Secure routing among multiple routers become a complex process in Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) due to the presence of adversary nodes. An adversary node which compromises the honest node as well as it will use all secrets of compromised node. By these capabilities, the attacker launches impersonation attacks against secure transmission. Strengthening the personal key and monitoring the behavior of each node is crucial avoid impersonation attack. This paper proposed the Enhancing Polynomial reduction algorithm for Secure routing against Impersonation in Clustered MANET to tackle above secure routing issues. To provide the personal key with less key storage overhead, the clusters network based on the flexible weight clustering algorithm. To avert impersonation, the polynomial reduction algorithm which initially exploits the strong key authentication via two separate transactions which forward the set of primitive polynomial with key function and the same with anyone random number in a successive manner. Also, the polynomial reduction algorithm considers the acknowledgments with attached hop-counts from the intermediate routers to identify the impersonation when the attacker acts as an intermediate router resulting in high control overhead. Therefore, the proposed introduces the Energy Efficient Polynomial Reduction (EPR) algorithm that reduces the overhead by sending the consolidated acknowledgment for same cluster nodes.	acknowledgment index;adversary (cryptography);algorithm;cluster analysis;cylinder-head-sector;epr paradox;hoc (programming language);key authentication;network partition;operand forwarding;overhead (computing);primitive polynomial (field theory);random number generation;router (computing);routing;secure transmission;semiconductor consolidation;simulation;strong key	P.

550923dde2c45859a24269055123fbe92d9de110	empirical evaluation of ambient sensors as proximity detection mechanism for mobile payments		According to the UK Cards Association, 74.5 million contactless cards were issued and a total of 103.2 million contactless transactions were carried out in September 2015. Beside financial applications, contactless cards are used increasingly in transport and access control-related applications. Technologies such as Near Field Communications (NFC) have enabled mobile phones to emulate contactless smart cards, making them a potentially feature rich substitute – highlighted by the recent deployment of Apple Pay and Android Pay. Contactless smart cards, however, are susceptible to relay attack, and to avoid them, techniques such as distance bounding protocols have been proposed. To avoid such attacks on mobile-based contactless transactions, a number of methods have been proposed that rely primarily on ambient sensors as a proximity detection mechanism (also known as an anti-relay mechanism). In this paper, we, for the first time in academic literature, empirically evaluate a comprehensive set of ambient sensors for their effectiveness as a proximity detection mechanism – translating into their application as an anti-relay mechanism for mobile contactless transactions. We select a total of 17 sensors available through the Google Android platform and evaluate 15 of these. The remaining sensors were either unavailable or failed to measure any data within an acceptable timeframe for real-world deployment. In existing academic literature, only 5 sensors have been investigated as a potential anti-relay mechanism. Each sensor, where feasible, was used to record the measurements of 1000 transactions – each transaction comprising a terminal and mobile phone measurement pair, 2000 measurements in total per sensor – at four different physical locations. A total of 252 random users were involved during the collection of measurements. The analysis of these transactions in this paper provides an empirical foundation to answer the question: “Which ambient sensors can be used an anti-relay countermeasure and what are their associated risks?”. After collecting measurement data from the implemented sensors and carefully evaluating them, we find that no single mobile ambient sensor is suitable as a proximity detection mechanism for critical applications like banking, transport and (sensitive sites) access control. Providing an evidence for their ineffectiveness as an anti-relay mechanism in their current state as claimed in existing literature. Lastly, we identify a number of potential avenues that may lead their application as an anti-relay mechanism.	access control;android;bluetooth;contactless smart card;enhanced entity–relationship model;geographic coordinate system;global positioning system;internet relay chat;location (geography);mobile device;mobile payment;mobile phone;near field communication;relay attack;sfiaplus;sensor;smartphone;software deployment;testbed;velocity (software development)	Raja Naeem Akram;Iakovos Gurulian;Carlton Shepherd;Konstantinos Markantonakis;Keith Mayes	2016	CoRR		simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	-50.80688302433174	71.14426859864285	60301

In this paper we propose a flexible credential verification mechanism, which improves the likelihood that participants in an ad-hoc network can verify each other's credentials despite the lack of access to certification and attribute authorities. Users maintain Credential Assertion Statements (CASs), which are formed through extraction of X.509 and attribute certificates into an interoperable XML form. Trusted entities that can verify the credentials listed in the CAS can then issue signed Assertion Signature Statements (ASSs) to other participants in the ad-hoc network. In addition, each user maintains a key ring, which comprises the list of public-keys trusted to sign credential assertion statements. All public-keys in the ring are assigned a trustworthiness level. When a user presents his/her CAS together with matching ASSs to a verifier, the verifier checks the signatures in the ASSs against its key ring to determine whether credentials in the CAS are authentic and acceptable. Transitivity of trust is generally not allowed, but there are exceptional cases in which it is permitted.	antivirus software;assertion (software development);computational resource;credential;display resolution;entity;hoc (programming language);interoperability;mobile device;online and offline;public key infrastructure;trust (emotion);verification and validation;vertex-transitive graph;x.509;xml	Sye Loong Keoh;Emil C.

Defending against sybil attacks is often quite challenging, and the nature of recommendation systems makes it even harder. This paper presents {\em DSybil}, a novel defense for diminishing the influence of sybil identities in recommendation systems. DSybil provides strong provable guarantees that hold even under the worst-case attack and are optimal. DSybil can defend against an unlimited number of sybil identities over time. DSybil achieves its strong guarantees by i) exploiting the heavy-tail distribution of the typical voting behavior of the honest identities, and ii) carefully identifying whether the system is already getting ``enough help'' from the (weighted) voters already taken into account or whether more ``help'' is needed. Our evaluation shows that DSybil would continue to provide high-quality recommendations even when a million-node botnet uses an optimal strategy to launch a sybil attack.	best, worst and average case;botnet;provable security;recommender system;sybil attack	Haifeng Yu;Chenwei Shi;Michael Kaminsky;Phillip B.

At Eurocrypt '03, Szydlo proposed a potential attack by showing that the leakage reduces the key-recovery problem to that of distinguishing integral quadratic forms. He proposed a heuristic method to solve the latter problem, but it was unclear whether his method could attack real-life parameters of GGH and NTRU Cryptosystemssign. Here, we propose an alternative method to attack signature schemes a la GGH, by studying the following learning problem: given many random points uniformly distributed over an unknown n-dimensional parallelepiped, recover the parallelepiped or an approximation thereof. We transform this problem into a multivariate optimization problem that can be solved by a gradient descent. Our approach is very effective in practice: we present the first succesful key-recovery experiments on NTRU Cryptosystemssign-251 without perturbation, as proposed in half of the parameter choices in NTRU standards under consideration by IEEE P1363.1. Experimentally, 90,000 signatures are sufficient to recover the NTRU Cryptosystemssign-251 secret key. We are also able to recover the secret key in the signature analogue of all the GGH encryption challenges, using a number of signatures which is roughly quadratic in the lattice dimension.	cryptanalysis;electronic signature;ntru	Phong Q.

However, in these two systems, the state-of-art authentication protocols based on traditional number theory cannot defeat a quantum computer attack. In order to protect user privacy and guarantee trustworthy of big data, we propose a new identity-based blind signature scheme based on number theorem research unit lattice, this scheme mainly uses a rejection sampling theorem instead of constructing a trapdoor. Meanwhile, this scheme does not depend on complex public key infrastructure and can resist quantum computer attack. Then we design an e-payment protocol using the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we prove our scheme is secure in the random oracle, and satisfies confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the other traditional existing identity-based blind signature schemes in signing speed and verification speed, outperforms the other lattice-based blind signature in signing speed, verification speed, and signing secret key size.	authentication protocol;big data;bioinformatics workflow management system;blind signature;computer;confidentiality;conflict (psychology);data curation;deny (action);digital curation;digital signature;identity creation;key (cryptography);key size;lattice model (finance);lattice-based cryptography;ntru;natural science disciplines;non-repudiation;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;online banking epayments;privacy;protocols documentation;public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;quantum computing;random oracle;rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing);smart city;verification and validation;verification of theories;verifying specimen;visually impaired persons	Hongfei Zhu;Yu-an Tan;Liehuang Zhu;Xianmin Wang;Quan-Xin Zhang;Yuanzhang Li	2018		10.3390/s18051663	wireless sensor network;engineering;electronic engineering;random oracle;public key infrastructure;key size;blind signature;quantum computer;authentication protocol;authentication;distributed computing	Security	-41.69430516086833	77.76171081529466	60477
5498eab58c519efef7a6a88a79dbdee953d8bf26	leakage-resilient signatures	provable security;security properties;signature scheme;side channel attacks;digital signature scheme	The strongest standard security notion for digital signature schemes is unforgeability under chosen message attacks. In practice, however, this notion can be insufficient due to “side-channel attacks” which exploit leakage of information about the secret internal state of the scheme’s hardware implementation. In this work we put forward the notion of “leakage-resilient signatures,” which strengthens the standard security notion by giving the adversary the additional power to learn a bounded amount of arbitrary information about the secret state that was accessed during every signature generation. This notion naturally implies security against all possible side-channel attacks as long as the amount of information leaked on each invocation is bounded and “only computation leaks information.” The main result of this paper is a construction which gives a (tree-based, stateful) leakage-resilient signature scheme based on any 3-time signature scheme. The amount of information that our scheme can safely leak per signature generation is 1/3 of the information the underlying 3-time signature scheme can leak in total. Based on recent works by Alwen, Dodis, Wichs and by Katz we give several efficient instantiations of 3-time signature schemes with the required security properties, hence yielding the first constructions of provably secure leakage-resilient signature schemes.	adversary (cryptography);antivirus software;computation;digital signature;electronic signature;provable security;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;state (computer science)	Sebastian Faust;Eike Kiltz;Krzysztof Pietrzak;Guy N.

In the past there was little tolerance for the problems experienced remembering passwords, and many users still remember, with embarrassment, having to go hat-in-hand to request a password change and being treated with disdain by a lofty administrator. Latterly there is more understanding of the problems experienced by users, especially since the """"password conundrum"""" has reached epidemic proportions for Web users, who are asked for passwords with unrelenting predictability.  The problems with passwords are clear -- users cannot remember numbers of meaningless alphanumeric strings with ease. Hence, they react by choosing simple and predictable words or numbers related to their everyday life, and engaging in insecure practices, such as writing passwords down or sharing them. These practices cause a breach affecting even the most secure and protected network system. Hence the user is often called the weakest link of the security chain, with system administrators despairing of trying to maintain security with the weak link so often reaching breaking point. Users forgetting passwords has serious economical consequences for organizations.  Both academia and industry have been investigating alternatives to passwords, with varying degrees of success. One of the most well-known solutions is the biometric -- measurement of either behavioral or physiological characteristics of the end-user. This is obviously superior to the password because it removes the burden on the user's memory. So why don't we just switch to biometrics and give the poor user a break? There are some valid and hard-to-overcome reasons for the slow uptake of biometrics, but before we can discuss them we need to consider the mechanics of authentication."""	authentication;biometrics;computer;password;system administrator	Karen Renaud;Antonella De Angeli	2009	Commun.

The application of the proposed model includes organizations, business groups, and establishments where the data are highly confidential and need to be kept in a very secure manner among a number of users. The paper recommends a model to enhance the security measure and a model to increase the fault tolerance capability. To increase the overall security, the security measure needs to be followed at the user side. The work is carried out on a multi-cloud environment where the data are encrypted, split, and stored. The storage details are held by the owner in a file that is encrypted and the key is retained by a set of owners using secret sharing scheme. The model would work continuously when one of the Cloud Service Providers goes in for a failure and another model has been proposed which would work when two Cloud Service Providers go down. The method increases the security and provides improved fault tolerance.	cloud storage	S. Srisakthi;A. P.

The findings are then used to produce recommendations that present the most appropriate countermeasures to the threats found.	denial-of-service attack;encryption;floor and ceiling functions;timeline;wireless security	Lu Liu;Thomas Stimpson;Nick Antonopoulos;Zhijun Ding;Yongzhao Zhan	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1386-3	wardriving;telecommunications;computer science;information security;operating system;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	HCI	-55.07189738668627	65.96151729785893	60629

In this paper, we continue this line of endeavors and report our success in identifying a very efficient public key encryption scheme whose formal security proof does not require a random oracle. Specifically, we show how to modify a universal hash based public key encryption scheme proposed by Zheng and Seberry at Crypto'92, in such a way that the resultant scheme not only preserves efficiency but also admits provable security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack without a random oracle. We also compare the modified Zheng-Seberry scheme with related encryption schemes in terms of efficiency and underlying assumptions, supporting our conclusion that the modified Zheng-Seberry scheme is preferable to its competitors.	encryption;public-key cryptography;random oracle	Puwen Wei;Xiaoyun Wang;Yuliang Zheng	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11145-7_10	random oracle;chosen-ciphertext attack;40-bit encryption;plaintext-aware encryption;computer science;theoretical computer science;pseudorandom function family;provable security;ciphertext indistinguishability;optimal asymmetric encryption padding;mathematics;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;deterministic encryption;computer security;cramer–shoup cryptosystem;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption;attribute-based encryption	Crypto	-39.816138851047086	77.40081870784616	60738
59ff8fb2f407a473fe813d40ba20d48d4a841a4e	low-computation certificateless hybrid signcryption scheme		Hybrid signcryption is an important technique signcrypting bulk data using symmetric encryption. In this paper, we apply the technique of certificateless hybrid signcryption to an elliptic-curve cryptosystem, and construct a low-computation certificateless hybrid signcryption scheme. In the random oracle model, this scheme is proven to have indistinguishability against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) under the elliptic-curve computation Diffie-Hellman assumption. Also, it has a strong existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks (sUF-CMA) under the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm assumption. Analysis shows that the cryptographic algorithm does not rely on pairing operations and is much more efficient than other algorithms. In addition, it suits well to applications in environments where resources are constrained, such as wireless sensor networks and ad hoc networks.	cma-es;chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext indistinguishability;computation;cryptosystem;decisional diffie–hellman assumption;diffie–hellman problem;discrete logarithm;encryption;european conference on digital libraries;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;random oracle;signcryption;symmetric-key algorithm	Hui-fang Yu;Bo Yang	2017	Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering	10.1631/FITEE.1601054	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;cryptography;cryptosystem;symmetric-key algorithm;random oracle;computer network;provable security;signcryption;discrete logarithm;wireless ad hoc network;mathematics	Security	-40.889545416100546	77.0887634503858	60748
c3b046ae02236747d98119161806d6b1aeb970d9	resource allocation in optical networks secured by quantum key distribution		Optical network security is attracting increasing research attention, as loss of confidentiality of data transferred through an optical network could impact a huge number of users and services. Data encryption is an effective way to enhance optical network security. In particular, QKD is being investigated as a secure mechanism to provide keys for data encryption at the endpoints of an optical network. In a QKD-enabled optical network, apart from TDChs, two additional channels, called QSChs and PIChs, are required to support secure key synchronization. How to allocate network resources to QSChs, PIChs, and TDChs is emerging as a novel problem for the design of a security-guaranteed optical network. This article addresses the resource allocation problem in optical networks secured by QKD. We first discuss a possible architecture for a QKD-enabled optical network, where an SDN controller is in charge of allocating the three types of channels (TDCh, QSCh, and PICh) over different wavelengths exploiting WDM. To save wavelength resources, we propose to adopt OTDM to allocate multiple QSChs and PIChs over the same wavelength. An RWTA algorithm is designed to allocate wavelength and time slot resources for the three types of channels. Different security levels are included in the RWTA algorithm by considering different key updating periods (i.e., the period after which the secure key between two endpoints has to be updated). Illustrative simulation results show the effects of different security-level configuration schemes on resource allocation.	algorithm;confidentiality;encryption;network security;quantum key distribution;simulation;software-defined networking;wavelength-division multiplexing	Yongli Zhao;Yuan Cao;Wei Wang;Hua Wang;Xiaosong Yu;Jie Zhang;Massimo Tornatore;Yu Wu;Biswanath Mukherjee	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700656	architecture;resource management;computer network;network security;encryption;distributed computing;computer science;resource allocation;wavelength-division multiplexing;quantum key distribution;communication channel	Metrics	-48.154762336331025	80.41654866258544	60753
20697b2d5d5cb3972099319d8ec561f351c4b880	promiscuous mode detection platform		Among various types of attacks on an Ethernet network, “sniffing attack” is probably one of the most difficult attacks to handle. Sniffers are programs that allow a host to capture any packets in an Ethernet network, by putting the host’s Network Interface Card (NIC) into the promiscuous mode. When a host’s NIC is in the normal mode, it captures only the packets sent to the host. Since many basic services, such as FTP, Telnet and SMTP, send passwords and data in clear text in the packets, sniffers can be used by hackers to capture passwords and confidential data. A number of anti-sniffers have been developed, such as PMD [18], PromiScan [17] and L0pht AntiSniff [19]. An anti-sniffer is a program that tries to detect the hosts running sniffers, in a Local Area Network (LAN). Current anti-sniffers are mainly based on three detection techniques, namely: the ARP detection, the DNS detection, and the RTT (Round Trip Time) detection techniques [13 and 16]. However, sniffers are becoming very advanced so that anti-sniffers are unable to detect them. The main drawback of these detection techniques is that they rely on the ARP, ICMP and/or DNS reply messages generated by the sniffing hosts. Therefore, in order to stay undetectable by anti-sniffers, advanced sniffers do not generate such reply messages while sniffing. This paper discusses an anti-sniffer based on a new detection technique. The technique uses mainly ARP cache poisoning attack to detect sniffing hosts in an Ethernet network. The technique is implemented in a tool, called SupCom anti-sniffer, which automatically gives system administrator a better helping hand regarding the detection of sniffers. Four anti-sniffers, PMD [18], PromiScan [17], L0pht AntiSniff [19] and SupCom anti-sniffer, are tested and the evaluation results show that SupCom anti-sniffer succeeded to detect more sniffing hosts than the other anti-sniffers.	48-bit;arp spoofing;communications protocol;confidentiality;dns spoofing;datagram;download;ibm research;information science;internet protocol suite;mac address;network interface controller;network packet;normal mode;pmd;packet analyzer;password;plaintext;promiscuous mode;system administrator	Zouheir Trabelsi;Hamza Rahmani	2004			internet privacy;computer security;promiscuous mode;computer science	Security	-56.87236310452099	67.6213336464305	60759

An extremely useful approach to profile traffic is to extract and display to a network administrator the multi-dimensional hierarchical heavy hitters (HHHs) of a dataset. However, existing schemes for computing HHHs have several limitations: 1) they require significant computational overhead; 2) they do not scale to high dimensional data; and 3) they are not easily extensible. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally new approach for extracting HHHs based on generalized frequent item-set mining (FIM), which allows to process traffic data much more efficiently and scales to much higher dimensional data than present schemes. Based on generalized FIM, we build and evaluate a traffic profiling system we call FaRNet. Our comparison with AutoFocus, which is the most related tool of similar nature, shows that FaRNet is up to three orders of magnitude faster.	foremost;network traffic control;overhead (computing);traffic classification	Ignasi Paredes-Oliva;Pere Barlet-Ros;Xenofontas A.

e79f66525f923afafc004043575f84ebe1a2b6a6	iot goes nuclear: creating a zigbee chain reaction		Within the next few years, billions of IoT devices will densely populate our cities. In this paper we describe a new type of threat in which adjacent IoT devices will infect each other with a worm that will rapidly spread over large areas, provided that the density of compatible IoT devices exceeds a certain critical mass. In particular, we developed and verified such an infection using the popular Philips Hue smart lamps as a platform. The worm spreads by jumping directly from one lamp to its neighbors, using only their built-in ZigBee wireless connectivity and their physical proximity. The attack can start by plugging in a single infected bulb anywhere in the city, and then catastrophically spread everywhere within minutes. It enables the attacker to turn all the city lights on or off, to permanently brick them, or to exploit them in a massive DDOS attack. To demonstrate the risks involved, we use results from percolation theory to estimate the critical mass of installed devices for a typical city such as Paris whose area is about 105 square kilometers: The chain reaction will fizzle if there are fewer than about 15,000 randomly located smart lamps in the whole city, but will spread everywhere when the number exceeds this critical mass (which had almost certainly been surpassed already). To make such an attack possible, we had to find a way to remotely yank already installed lamps from their current networks, and to perform over-the-air firmware updates. We overcame the first problem by discovering and exploiting a major bug in the implementation of the Touchlink part of the ZigBee Light Link protocol, which is supposed to stop such attempts with a proximity test. To solve the second problem, we developed a new version of a side channel attack to extract the global AES-CCM key (for each device type) that Philips uses to encrypt and authenticate new firmware. We used only readily available equipment costing a few hundred dollars, and managed to find this key without seeing any actual updates. This demonstrates once again how difficult it is to get security right even for a large company that uses standard cryptographic techniques to protect a major product.	authentication;cryptography;denial-of-service attack;encryption;firmware;percolation theory;population;randomness;side-channel attack	Eyal Ronen;Adi Shamir;Achi-Or Weingarten;Colin O'Flynn	2017	2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	10.1109/MSP.2018.1331033	computer science;computer security;critical mass (software engineering);firmware;encryption;side channel attack;cryptography;exploit;denial-of-service attack;authentication	Security	-51.095228318355645	61.82735649595617	60869

To solve those problems, the interactive protocol among participants is introduced, an extirpation-based key derivation algorithm (EKDA) is designed to manage the keys, a double hashed and weighted Bloom Filter (DWBF) is proposed to retrieve the encrypted keywords, which are combined with lazy revocation, multi-tree structure, asymmetric and symmetric encryptions, to form a privacy-preserving, efficient and secure framework for cloud storage. The experiment and security analysis show that EKDA can reduce the communication and storage overheads efficiently, DWBF supports ciphertext retrieval and can reduce communication, storage and computation overhead as well, and the proposed framework is privacy-preserving while supporting data access efficiently.	algorithm;bloom filter;ciphertext;cloud storage;computation;computer data storage;data access;data retrieval;encryption;interaction;key derivation function;key management;lazy evaluation;multi-user;overhead (computing);privacy;tree structure;virtual machine	Ruwei Huang;Xiaolin Gui;Si Yu;Wei Zhuang	2011	Comput.

Traditional information security has focussed upon threats from the outside rather than employees. A wide range of research has been undertaken to develop approaches to detect the insider - often referred to as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools. Unfortunately, the fundamental limitation of these tools is that they provide information resolved to IP addresses rather than people. This assumes the IP is static and linkable to an individual, which is often not the case. IPs are increasingly unreliable due to the mobile natural of devices and the dynamic allocation of IP addresses. This paper builds upon prior work to propose and investigate a biometric-based behavioural profile created from a novel feature extraction process that identifies user's application-level interactions (e.g. not simply that they are accessing Facebook but whether they are posting, reading or watching a video) from raw network traffic metadata. It also proceeds to describe various types of user's interactions that can be derived from applications. Validation of the model was conducted by collecting 62 GBs of metadata over a 2 months period from 27 participants. The average results of identifying users at first rank in the top three applications Skype, Hotmail and BBC are scored 98.1%, 96.2% and 81.8% respectively.	biometrics;data loss prevention software;digital light processing;feature extraction;information security;interaction;laptop;mathematical optimization;memory management;nearest neighbour algorithm;network traffic control;outlook.com;smartphone;support vector machine;tablet computer	Gaseb Alotibi;Nathan L.

776b68051d494adddca8d4902f90e324a83d97bb	cloud cryptography: theory, practice and future research directions		Cloud computing, a convenient way of accessing services, resources and applications over the Internet, shifts the focus of industries and organizations away from the deployment and dayto-day running of their IT facilities by providing an on-demand, self-service, and pay-as-you-go business model. It is, therefore, unsurprising that cloud computing has continued to increase in popularity in recent times. While cloud computing provides various benefits to users, there are underlying security and privacy risks. For example, multi-tenancy, resource pooling and shareability features can be exploited by cybercriminals and anyonewith amalicious intent, to the detriment of both cloud users and cloud service providers. It is unsurprising, then, that cloud computing has emerged as a salient area of inquiry for security researchers. For example, when user data (e.g. documents, videos and photos) are uploaded or stored in a cloud computing service, the data owners are unlikely to know the path of the transmitted data or whether the data are being collected and analyzed by a third party, including a government agency (see the revelations by Edward Snowden [8]). As posited by Choo and Sarre [6], it is important to strike a balance between privacy, legitimate surveillance and lawful data access, in order to ensure that the privacy of innocent individuals will not be compromised (e.g. that fine-grained aspects of an individual’s life cannot be derived or inferred from the intelligence collection and analysis). A particularly promising approach to achieve security and privacy in this new computing paradigm is through cryptography [19,21]. For example, as noted by Yang et al. [25], to ensure the security and privacy of user data, specifically against an untrusted cloud service provider, one could encrypt the data prior to uploading and storing the data in the cloud. This special issue is dedicated to providing both scientists and practitioners with a forum to present their recent research on the use of novel cryptographic techniques to improve the security and privacy of the underlying cloud architecture or ecosystem, particularly research that integrates both theory and practice. For example, how do we design an efficient cloud cryptography system that offers enhanced security and/or privacy without compromising on usability and performance? In the sequel, we briefly survey the content of papers in this special issue.	cloud computing;cryptography;cybercrime;data access;download;ecosystem;encryption;internet;multitenancy;privacy;programming paradigm;snowden;software deployment;upload;usability;yang	Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo;Josep Domingo-Ferrer	2016	Future Generation Comp.

Only recently, Vaidya, Rodrigues and Park proposed two low-cost authentication schemes with user privacy for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, this paper shows Vaidya et al.'s schemes cannot provide privacy in the presence of an adversary as they claim. Also, Vaidya et al.'s schemes are vulnerable to offline password guessing attack. To overcome these weaknesses, this paper improves their profound authentication schemes. The security of the improved scheme is analysed which reveals that the improved scheme can overcome such weaknesses. The performance of the improved scheme is the same as Vaidya et al.'s schemes with the same simplicity as well as being still suitable for WSNs.	authentication	Hoda Jannati;Abolfazl Falahati	2012	IJESDF	10.1504/IJESDF.2012.049735	man-in-the-middle attack;wireless sensor network;computer science;authentication;internet privacy;computer security;denial-of-service attack;computer network	Mobile	-46.51024144907838	74.54063132015476	60994

To fulfil this need, recent advances in security have considered the design of storage-based intrusion detection system, which detect intrusions by looking at the low-level disk requests patterns. However, these systems neither tolerate intrusions, nor do they distinguish whether the disk requests are generated by legitimate or malicious processes; and consequently, they generate a lot of false negative and positive alerts. In this paper, we present a Cooperative Intrusion Detection and Tolerance System, called CIDTS, which takes advantage of the information that are available at the network, host operating system, and storage level to better detect intrusion attempts in their early stages, even when the host is compromised. To allow cooperation, the disk communication interface that transports requests between the storage level and the host level is extended to forward information about the processes that generate the request. The paper also provides intrusion tolerance capabilities and provides techniques to support investigation activities.

However, in this paper we find the previous improvement is not suitable implemented in some typical AQS protocols in the sense that the receiver, Bob, can forge a valid signature under known message attack. We describe the forgery strategy and present some corresponding improved strategies to stand against the forgery attack by modifying the encryption algorithm, an important part of AQS. These works preserve the merits of AQS and lead some potential improvements of the security in quantum signature or other cryptography problems.	algorithm;alice and bob;cryptanalysis;cryptography;digital signature forgery;encryption;forge;message authentication;novena (computing platform)	Ke-Jia Zhang;Wei-Wei Zhang;Dan Li	2013	Quantum Information Processing	10.1007/s11128-013-0554-4	theoretical computer science;encryption;cryptography;quantum mechanics;cryptanalysis;physics;quantum	Crypto	-40.102653938905995	76.49524984122402	61025

Before setting up an SSL connection, web browsers have to validate the SSL certificate of the web server in order to ensure that users access the expected web site. We have tested the handling of the main fields in SSL certificates and found that web browsers do not process them in a homogenous way. An SSL certificate can be accepted by some web browsers whereas a message reporting an error can be delivered to users by other web browsers for the same certificate. This diversity of behavior might cause users to believe that SSL certificates are unreliable or error prone, which might lead them to consider that SSL certificates are useless. In this paper, we highlight these different behaviors and we explain the reasons for them which can be either a violation of the standards or ambiguity in the standards themselves. We give our opinion of which it is in our analysis.	acceptance testing;cognitive dimensions of notations;conformity;experiment;institute for operations research and the management sciences;public key certificate;server (computing);software bug;transport layer security;web server;x.509	Ahmad Samer Wazan;Romain Laborde;David W.

We describe a novel method that protects electronic records from intruders and even the most powerful of insiders, the system administrators. Confidential data are partitioned and dis­ tributed after asymmetric encryption for management over multiple databases. Data splitting and distributed management prevent unauthorized and covert ac­ cess by any single party. Confidential systems using this design can work syn­ ergistically with existing security measures and are suitable for health, genomic, and financial records.	confidentiality;secret sharing	Andrew Po-Jung Ho	1999			engineering;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	Logic	-43.67514271287692	63.978262829119835	61078

In this paper, we show that the security of LAC depends greatly on the parameter of the maximum message length and the order of padding the last message block, by cryptanalysing its variants that differ from the original LAC only in the above-mentioned two points. For the LAC variants, we present a structural state recovery attack in the nonce-respecting scenario, which is independent from the underlying block cipher, which requires only chosen queries to their encryption and tag generation oracles and can recover an internal state of the initialization phase for one of some used Public Message Numbers PMNs more advantageously than exhaustive key search; and the recovered internal state can be used to make an existential forgery attack under this PMN. Besides, slightly inferior to exhaustive key search, the state recovery attack can apply to the LAC variant that differs from LAC only in the order of padding the last message block. Although the state recovery attack does not apply to the original LAC, it sheds some light on this type of interesting structures, and shows that an authenticated encryption algorithm with a such or similar structure may be weakened when it is misused deliberately or accidentally with the reverse message padding order and a different maximum message length, and users should be careful about the two points when employing such a structure in reality.	algorithm;authenticated encryption;authentication	Jiqiang Lu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-40367-0_25	lakh;watermarking attack;40-bit encryption;computer science;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;authenticated encryption;world wide web;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;56-bit encryption	EDA	-36.9585391535479	79.83928805750308	61114

However, these new technologies pose several challenges in terms of confidentiality of the conversations and anonymity of the conversing parties. Call authentication and encryption techniques provide a way to protect confidentiality, while anonymity is typically preserved by an anonymizing service (anonymous call). This work studies the feasibility of revealing pairs of anonymous and encrypted conversing parties (caller/callee pair of streams) by exploiting the vulnerabilities inherent to VoIP systems. In particular, by exploiting the aperiodic inter-departure time of VoIP packets, we can trivialize each VoIP stream into a binary time-series. We first define a simple yet intuitive metric to gauge the correlation between two VoIP binary streams. Then we propose an effective technique that progressively pairs conversing parties with high accuracy and in a limited amount of time. Our metric and method are justified analytically and validated by experiments on a very large standard corpus of conversational speech.

In recent years, some schemes of encryption and authentication based on hierarchical identity-based key management systems have been developed. However, these schemes did not consider the case when PKG (Private Key Generator) went down. In this paper, we proposed an identity-based key management scheme for configurable hierarchical cloud computing environment. The proposed scheme requires fewer computations on encryption, and authentication, and it also provides efficient key reconstruction in case of PKG failures. As a result, the scheme proposed in this paper can reduce the key reconstructing cost efficiently on cloud computing data center.	authentication;cloud computing;computation;data center;encryption;id-based cryptography;key management	Jyun-Yao Huang;I-En Liao;Cheng-Kang Chiang	2011	2011 IEEE 17th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/ICPADS.2011.56	cloud computing security;data center;parallel computing;h.235;40-bit encryption;cloud computing;disk encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;cryptography;operating system;key management;distributed computing;internet privacy;key distribution;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;identity management;56-bit encryption;cost efficiency	DB	-41.92999185678475	68.11457615692488	61127

86a14ae7eeecc1b7f8166f4e4fb64b41a277ea92	struggling against selfishness and black hole attacks in manets	ad hoc networks;security;selfish misbehavior;black hole attack	Since mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are infrastructureless and multi-hop by nature, transmitting packets from any node to another usually relies on services provided by intermediate nodes. This reliance introduces a new vulnerability; one node could launch a Black Hole DoS attack by participating in the routing protocol and including itself in routes, then simply dropping packets it receives to forward. Another motivation for dropping packets in self-organized MANETs is resource preservation. Some solutions for detecting and isolating packet droppers have been recently proposed, but almost all of them employ the promiscuous mode monitoring approach (watchdog (WD)) which suffers from many problems, especially when employing the power control technique. In this paper we propose a novel monitoring approach that overcomes some WD’s shortcomings, and improves the efficiency in detection. To overcome false detections due to nodes mobility and channel conditions we propose a Bayesian technique for the judgment, allowing node redemption before judgment. Finally, we suggest a social-based approach for the detection approval and isolation of guilty nodes. We analyze our solution and asses its performance by simulation. The results illustrate a large improvement of our monitoring solution in detection versus the WD, and an efficiency through our judgment and isolation techniques as well.

With Tor, the users are able to compromise the non-repudiation principle of computer security. Also, the potentially hackers may launch attacks such as DDoS or identity theft behind Tor. For this reason, there are needed new systems and models to detect the intrusion in Tor networks. In this paper, we present the application of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNNs) for prediction of user behavior in Tor networks. We constructed a Tor server and a Deep Web browser (Tor client) in our laboratory. Then, the client sends the data browsing to the Tor server using the Tor network. We used Wireshark Network Analyzer to get the data and thenused the DRNNs to make the prediction. The simulation results show that our simulation system has a good prediction of user behavior in Tor networks.	computer security;deep web;denial-of-service attack;neural networks;non-repudiation;recurrent neural network;server (computing);simulation;tor messenger;wireshark	Taro Ishitaki;Ryoichiro Obukata;Tetsuya Oda;Leonard Barolli	2017	2017 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops (WAINA)	10.1109/WAINA.2017.63	intrusion detection system;computer science;recurrent neural network;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;artificial neural network	Security	-59.28472625964935	66.52557131662418	61295

This new architecture presents several novel concepts including tree-based bandwidth allocation and long-term static paths with guaranteed bandwidth. In concert, these mechanisms provide domain-based bandwidth guarantees within a trust domain - administrative domains grouped within a legal jurisdiction with enforceable accountability; each administrative domain in the trust domain can then internally split such guarantees among its endhosts to provide (1) connection establishment with high probability, and (2) precise bandwidth guarantees for established flows, regardless of the size or distribution of the botnet outside the source and the destination domains. Moreover, STRIDE maintains no per-flow state on backbone routers and requires no key establishment across administrative domains. We demonstrate that STRIDE achieves these DDoS defense properties through formal analysis and simulation. We also show that STRIDE mitigates emerging DDoS threats such as Denial-of-Capability (DoC) [6] and N2 attacks [22] based on these properties that none of the existing DDoS defense mechanisms can achieve.	administrative domain;botnet;crowding;denial-of-service attack;internet backbone;key exchange;simulation;stride scheduling;with high probability	Hsu-Chun Hsiao;Tiffany Hyun-Jin Kim;Sangjae Yoo;Xin Zhang;Soo Bum Lee;Virgil D.

084de8570ae0d9d7c6d3ddec453d7e4e64d75ca4	a comprehensive evaluation of mutual information analysis using a fair evaluation framework	side channel analysis;mutual information	The resistance of cryptographic implementations to side channel analysis is matter of considerable interest to those concerned with information security. It is particularly desirable to identify the attack methodology (e.g. di erential power analysis using correlation or distance-of-means as the distinguisher) able to produce the best results. Attempts to answer this question are complicated by the many and varied factors contributing to attack success: the device power consumption characteristics, an attacker's power model, the distinguisher by which measurements and model predictions are compared, the quality of the estimations, and so on. Previous work has delivered partial answers for certain restricted scenarios. In this paper we assess the e ectiveness of mutual information analysis within a generic and comprehensive evaluation framework. Complementary to existing work, we present several notions/characterisations of attack success, as well as a means of indicating the amount of data required by an attack. We are thus able to identify scenarios in which mutual information o ers performance advantages over other distinguishers. Furthermore we observe an interesting feature unique to the mutual information based distinguisher resembling a type of stochastic resonance, which could potentially enhance the e ectiveness of such attacks over other methods in certain noisy scenarios.	cryptography;cubic function;data dependency;expect;hamming distance;information leakage;information security;interaction;mutual information;nonlinear system;preprocessor;route distinguisher;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;stochastic resonance;strongly correlated material;table (information);theory;tracing (software);unique name assumption;while	Carolyn Whitnall;Elisabeth Oswald	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-642-22792-9_18	simulation;computer science;multivariate mutual information;data mining;mathematics;mutual information;computer security;interaction information;statistics	Crypto	-33.69784338865366	73.88238828169818	61444

A new multivariate signature scheme is then constructed by applying the two new methods together to the well-known Matsumoto-Imai cryptosystem. This new signature scheme has a specially designed structure making it have several competitive advantages: 1) the public map remains surjective (this property is important for a signature scheme), 2) it is almost as efficient as the original scheme and 3) it can resist all current known structure-based attacks to MPKC and behave like a random system against direct attacks. A new efficient and effective modification method is thus provided for multivariate signature schemes.	cryptosystem;digital signature;perturbation theory (quantum mechanics);stochastic process;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wenbin Zhang;Chik How Tan	2014		10.1145/2600694.2600698	ring signature;digital signature;discrete mathematics;merkle signature scheme;eddsa;elliptic curve digital signature algorithm;computer science;theoretical computer science;threshold cryptosystem;post-quantum cryptography;mathematics;blind signature;schnorr signature;elgamal signature scheme;computer security	Crypto	-39.88995532326456	79.87634444720226	61500

Such distribution hardens their detection as the centralized approaches require to centralize network data for their analysis, which is indeed not possible in regard to the legacy and business constraints applied to network operators. In this paper, we propose a collaborative and inter-domain botnet detection system which conciliates the requirements of privacy and business preservation, while enabling realtime analysis for large scale networks. The different probes of our collaborative detection system exchange anonymised information in order to synchronize the network analysis of the members of botnets and to identify the malicious servers controlling them. We evaluated our system using anonymised traffic captured on an operator's network, and the results showed an improvement of 31% of malicious servers detected resulting from the collaboration, and this without significant performance impact and bandwidth overhead (respectively 4% and 11kb/s).	botnet;centralisation;centralized computing;inter-domain;malware;network traffic control;overhead (computing);requirement	Hachem Guerid;Karel Mittig;Ahmed Serhrouchni	2013	9th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing		information privacy;computer science;bloom filter;network security;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;collaborative software;computer network	HPC	-60.05525960265802	64.81101978017291	61537

Sun et al. proposed a new ( t ,  n ) threshold proxy signature scheme based on Zhang's threshold proxy signature scheme. Recently, Hsu et al. pointed out that Sun's scheme suffered from a drawback and proposed an improvement to counter it. However, the author of this paper shows that both Sun's scheme and Hsu's improvement are not secure against coalition attack. Some  t  or more malicious proxy signers can conspire together against the original signer. Finally, we propose a new improvement to counter this attack, the proxy generation and the signature computation of which is more efficient than those of Sun's scheme and Hsu's improvement. The main advantage of the new improvement is traceability, by which the original signer can identify the actual signers that are anonymous to outsiders.	digital signature	Zuhua Shao	2004	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2004.03.005	computer science;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;verifiable secret sharing	Security	-42.65317863447058	74.5531581127063	61539

In this paper we propose several novel currency-based methods for stimulating cooperation among nodes of a MANET. In particular, the proposed protocols allow improving different aspects of previous schemes based on virtual currency thanks to the incorporation of the concept of credit that will allow broke nodes to use the network while they have not a selfish behaviour. A complete analysis of simulations leads to several conclusions that establish the improvement of the proposal with respect to previous schemes.	hoc (programming language)	Pino Caballero-Gil;Candelaria Hernández-Goya	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88011-0_42	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;adaptive quality of service multi-hop routing;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;information security;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-52.84904830341335	78.21833309707974	61656

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), the core component of CNS/ATM, broadcasts important monitoring information, such as the location, altitude, and direction of aircraft, to the ground. However, ADS-B data are transmitted in an unencrypted (or unprotected) communication channel between ADS-B sensors and Air Traffic Control (ATC). Consequently, these data are vulnerable to security threats, such as spoofing, eavesdropping, and data modification. In this paper, we propose a method that protects the ADS-B data transmitted between ADS-B sensors and ATC using Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates and symmetric cryptography. The SPKI certificates are used to grant transmission authorization to the ADS-B sensors, while symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt/decrypt the ADS-B data transmitted between the ADS-B sensors and ATC. The proposed security framework comprises an ADS-B sensor authentication module, an encrypted data processing module, and an ADS-B sensor information management module. We believe that application of the OPEN ACCESS Information 2014, 5 623 proposed security framework to CNS/ATM will enable it to effectively obviate security threats, such as ground station flood denial, ground station target ghost injection, and ADS-B data modification.	atm turbo;advanced tactical center;advanced transportation controller;authentication;authorization;automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast;cns;channel (communications);cryptography;encryption;global air-traffic management;information management;plaintext;public key infrastructure;seamless3d;sensor;simple public-key infrastructure;spoofing attack;symmetric-key algorithm	Seoung-Hyeon Lee;Yong-Kyun Kim;Jong Wook Han;Deok-Gyu Lee	2014	Information	10.3390/info5040622	telecommunications;computer science;information security;symmetric-key algorithm;automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast;computer security;computer network	Security	-50.40421865901618	69.66790569505645	61700
f8cb868374b17dc0a1718df3e4982a66af1a23b8	a self-protecting agents based model for high-performance mobile-cloud computing		Abstract Mobile-cloud computing (MCC) allows devices with resource and battery limitations to achieve computation-intensive tasks in real-time. While this new paradigm of computing seems beneficial for real-time mobile computing, existing MCC models mainly rely on keeping full clones of program code at remote sites and unstandardized/uninteroperable environments, hampering wider adoption. Moreover, the security risks arising from offloading data and code to an untrusted platform and the computational overhead introduced by complex security mechanisms stand as deterrents for adoption of MCC at large. In this paper, we present a context-dependent computation-offloading model for MCC, which is based on application segments packed into autonomous agents. This approach only requires isolated execution containers in the cloud to provide a runtime environment for the agents, and minimal involvement of the mobile platform during the computation process. The agents in the proposed model are able to protect themselves from tampering using integrity-checkpointing and an authenticated encryption-based communication mechanism. Experiments with two mobile applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for high-performance, secure MCC.	mobile cloud computing	Pelin Angin;Bharat K.

There are number of ownership transfer protocol proposed to achieve secure ownership transfer. However, most of them are impractical or insecure to implement on current passive RFID tags. We are presenting an ownership transfer protocol using timer based shared secret for closed loop RFID systems. The protocol will ensure security and privacy of involved parties in the idle circumstances. Our comparison shows that the proposed protocol is more secure and practical than existing similar ones.	ccir system a;privacy;radio-frequency identification;shared secret;timer	Gaith K. D.

Firstly, the authentication entities which do not rely on the concrete heterogeneous network are abstracted by analyzing 3G-WLAN multi-kind heterogeneous network model. And then a common authentication model is established and a novel access authentication and key agreement scheme combined elliptic curve cryptographic techniques with public key infrastructure is proposed. In this scheme, encryption data uses the shortest key length ECC with the same security coefficient, and authentication information is signed. In addition, the encryption/decryption and signature algorithm are carefully chosen and improved. Therefore mobile terminal computation overhead is reduced. Finally, the security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the security properties such as mutual authentication, key control, key confirmation, confidentiality of the sensitive data, non-repudiation, data integrity, resistance to replay attack. And the performance analysis also shows that the proposed scheme is efficient in regard to computation and communication overheads.	algorithm;authentication and key agreement (protocol);coefficient;computation;confidentiality;data integrity;digital signature;encryption;entity;key (cryptography);key size;mobile phone;mutual authentication;network model;non-repudiation;overhead (computing);profiling (computer programming);public key infrastructure;public-key cryptography;replay attack	Hou Huifang;Ji Xinshen;Liu Guangqiang	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.327	data authentication algorithm;h.235;computer access control;challenge–response authentication;computer science;information security;authentication protocol;lightweight extensible authentication protocol;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;network access control;computer security;computer network	Security	-46.917837138996056	72.3459119845326	61748
c0cd2c6e7fb7b7784bc5536568481ad6f8a28fc4	energy-based efficient authenticated routing protocol for manets for ddos attacks with minimised power consumption		In MANET, reliable and secure communication is the most challenging task. Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is characterised by mobile hosts, dynamic topology, multi-hop wireless connectivity and infrastructure less ad hoc environment. Limited resource availability such as battery power and security are the major issues to be handled with mobile ad hoc networks. An attacker can easily disrupt the functioning of the network by attacking the underlying routing protocol. Hence, security in ad hoc networks is still a debatable area. In this paper, we have proposed energy-based efficient authenticated routing protocol (EBEARP) for mobile ad hoc networks. Our protocol provides efficient security against route discovery attacks using hop-by-hop signatures. It quickly detects the malicious nodes, thus assisting the nodes to drop the invalid packets, earlier. It also uses an efficient node selection mechanism, which maximises network life time and minimises power consumption. With the help of detailed simulation studies, we show that EBEARP provides better packet delivery ratio with minimised energy.	authentication;denial-of-service attack;routing	M. Savithri;M.

For general security and privacy concerns, users prefer storing encrypted data to pure ones so that servers do not learn anything about privacy. However, there is a natural issue that servers have worked some analyses (i.e. statistics) or routines for encrypted data without losing privacy. In this paper, we address the basic functionality, equality test, over encrypted data, which at least can be applied to specific analyses like private information retrieval. We introduce a new system, called filtered equality test, which is an additional functionality for existing public key encryption schemes. It satisfies the following scenario: a ciphertext-receiver selects several messages as a set and produces its related warrant; then, on receiving this warrant, an user is able to perform equality test on the receiver's ciphertext without decryption when the hidden message belongs to that message set. Similar to the attribute based encryption, ABE. In ABE schemes, those ones who match the settled conditions could get the privilege of decryption. In FET schemes, those ‘messages inside selected set’ can be equality tested. Combining PKE schemes and filtered equality test, we propose a framework of public key encryption scheme with filtered equality test, abbreviated as PKE-FET. Then, taking ElGamal for example, we propose a concrete PKE-FET scheme based on secret sharing and bilinear map. Finally, we prove our proposition with semantic security in the standard model.	attribute-based encryption;bilinear filtering;ciphertext;cloud storage;cryptographic protocol;file server;outsourcing;personally identifiable information;private information retrieval;public-key cryptography;relational operator;requirement;scheme;secret sharing;semantic security;server (computing);thin-film transistor;universal instantiation	Kaibin Huang;Yu-Chi Chen;Raylin Tso	2015	2015 12th International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications (ICETE)	10.5220/0005550303270334	semantic security;40-bit encryption;client-side encryption;computer science;theoretical computer science;filesystem-level encryption;on-the-fly encryption;internet privacy;public-key cryptography;secret sharing;key distribution;computer security;encryption;probabilistic encryption;attribute-based encryption	Security	-41.267473200529274	70.91812978181986	61901

The measure guarantees that commitment protocols behave like an “ideal commitment service,” even when concurrently composed with an arbitrary set of protocols. This is a strong guarantee: it implies that security is maintained even when an unbounded number of copies of the scheme are running concurrently, it implies non-malleability (not only with respect to other copies of the same protocol but even with respect to other protocols), it provides resilience to selective decommitment, and more. Unfortunately two-party uc commitment protocols do not exist in the plain model. However, we construct two-party uc commitment protocols, based on general complexity assumptions, in the common reference string model where all parties have access to a common string taken from a predetermined distribution. The protocols are non-interactive, in the sense that both the commitment and the opening phases consist of a single message from the committer to the receiver.	commitment ordering;committer;common reference string model;computational complexity theory;concurrency (computer science);interactivity;uc browser;universal composability	Ran Canetti;Marc Fischlin	2001		10.1007/3-540-44647-8_2	real-time computing;commitment scheme;mathematics;distributed computing;security analysis;computer security	Crypto	-38.90291684973965	74.60731670153118	61998
5e1b269efd81091773d9519f3ecb8703145a2102	direct constructions of bidirectional proxy re-encryption with alleviated trust in proxy		In this work, we study (the direct constructions of) bidirectional proxy re-encryption (PRE) with alleviated trust in the proxy, specifically the master secret security (MSS) and the nontransitivity (NT) security, in the standard model, and achieve the following: • A multi-hop MSS-secure bidirectional PRE scheme with security against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA) in the standard model, where the ciphertext remains constant size regardless how many times it has been re-encrypted. To the best of our knowledge, there exists previously no MSS-secure multi-hop bidirectional PRE scheme with constant size of ciphertexts (whether in the random oracle model or not). • A single-hop MSS-secure and non-transitive bidirectional PRE scheme with security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) in the standard model. The CCA-secure scheme is based on the CPA-secure scheme, and particularly employs a new re-encryption key (REK) generation mechanism to which each user makes equal contributions, where a single REK is used in both directions with the same computation so that the proxy needs not to distinguish the transform direction when it re-encrypts ciphertexts. Besides alleviated trust in proxy, single-hop non-transitive bidirectional PRE schemes also enjoy better fine-grained delegate right control (against malicious proxy). The security analysis uses Coron’s technique [Coron, Crypto 2000], which particularly allows adaptive secret-key corruption. Along the way, we also refine and clarify the security models for bidirectional PRE.	chosen-ciphertext attack;ciphertext;computation;encryption;key (cryptography);plaintext;proxy re-encryption;public-key cryptography;random oracle	Jian Weng;Yunlei Zhao	2011	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer security;delegate;computer security model;ciphertext;random oracle;security analysis;proxy re-encryption;proxy (climate);computer science;plaintext	Security	-39.75802514500342	75.14714365640549	62020
61e23a461d3b3c981e8a7892aa184718c7993c62	privacy settings recommender for online social network	social network services;recommender system;data privacy	In recent years Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC) has become the reference paradigm for controlled information sharing in Online Social Network (OSN) scenarios. Nevertheless, many of the most popular OSN providers do not implement in their platforms an access control model fully compliant with ReBAC. This fact, thus, limits the capability of OSN users to define customized and fine-grained access control policies. Moreover, average users might have difficulties in properly setting, potentially, complex access control policies. As results, many users give up in defining proper privacy setting, simply accepting the default setting proposed by OSN provider. To cope with this problem, we see the need of tools in support of policy specification. At this aim, in this paper we presenta recommendation system that, exploiting an association rules mining process, learns OSN users' habits in releasing resources in online social networks, and exploit them to suggest customized access control policies. We also prove the feasibility of the presented techniques by illustrating an experiment which has been conducted on 30 human users by building customized access control policies from the data learnt from each of them.	access control;algorithm;association rule learning;cold start;data mining;experiment;game demo;programming paradigm;real life;recommender system;social network	Davide Alberto Albertini;Barbara Carminati;Elena Ferrari	2016	2016 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)	10.1109/CIC.2016.079	computer science;data mining;world wide web;computer security;recommender system	DB	-44.29157796487911	60.7592444168235	62059

e70c4a2dfb8633fe82e29d25ea942cf60fb8da57	introduction to the special issue on secure solutions for network in scalable computing		This special issue aimed at incarceration of new insights, dimensions, visionaries and accomplishments achievable for security. Security is a foremost concern in scalable computing. With the progression in ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), secure solutions are the need, as the number and kinds of attacks too are progressive. Keeping this in mind, the papers selected for this issue talks about all our visualizations from the same.nnIn todays Internet-connected world, the advance cyber-attacks are being launched on the critical infrastructure. It has shifted the pursuit of financial profit and political gains, which lead to cyber warfare on various scales.The first paper points that malware is one of the most alarming security threats being faced by the Internet today. They have the capability to circumvent the earlier developed methods of detection and mitigation which clearly shows the need of shifting from traditional cyber security to cyber threat intelligence. Authors have proposed the design of a framework for generating malware threat intelligence which has the capability to detect, analyze, and predict the malware threats and can act as an Early Warning System (EWS). nnThe second paper talks about the current status of sentiment analysis and opinion mining focusing on the problem of sarcasm identification and detection. The article discusses the present scenario and the problem faced by the community due to the usage of sarcasm. Authors have tried a technique based on the deep convolution neural networks where they are using a single layer convolution before the classification task and claim to have higher accuracy in the classification of sarcasm as compared to existing methods.nnThe third paper talks about Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that are widely used in various fields such as health monitoring, medical line, intrusion detection, and are often placed in open environment, thus vulnerable to different attacks. Various techniques were introduced to deal with security related issues of WSNs; among them trust management has been proved as an effective measure. A new protocol called Energy Efficient and Trust Aware framework for secure routing in LEACH (EETA-LEACH) has been proposed. A trust management system for WSNs has been presented to monitor the sensor nodes behaviors and evaluate their trust values based upon remaining energy, packet delivery ratio and distance. This approach is a combination of trust-based routing module and trust management module that works together to select trusted Cluster Head (CH). Simulation results have proved that proposed algorithm consumes less energy and improves packet delivery ratio.nnAlmost all the important services are available in the application market of Android. Unfortunately, at the same time, the prosperity of these applications also attracts abusers and malicious attackers to perform different types of attacks. The fourth paper is an exploration and all-inclusive study about various approaches to perform Android applications analysis. This gives improved identification of the problem, accessible elucidation space and possible research scope to evaluate Android devices against the possible attacks. nnThe fifth paper focused on the dynamics of worm propagation in the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Authors proposed a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered-Susceptible (SIQRS) model based on epidemic theory and demonstrated the effect of quarantined state on worm propagation. This paper also describes the Stability of the worm free equilibrium and Endemic equilibrium, as well as, studies the effect of communication radius and node density.

In this paper, we propose a session-based analysis and minimum vertex cover mining detecting model for core nodes of P2P botnets. This model is focused on solving the core nodes of botnet and has a good performance when the characteristics of botnet are changed to avoid detecting. The simulation experiments reveal that when the session detection rate is at 50% and session falsepositive rate is at 29%, the core node detection rate still remains 98.9%, and the false-positive rate of core node is only 4.87%.	algorithm;botnet;experiment;internet security;peer-to-peer;sensor;simulation;vertex cover	Lei Xu;XiaoLong Xu;Yue Zhuo	2012	JNW	10.4304/jnw.7.8.1176-1181	computer science;network security;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Security	-60.743359769561124	66.66204022369459	62121

Especially protocols that rely on public key cryptography and perform expensive authentication handshakes may be an easy target. A well-known countermeasure against resource depletion attacks are client puzzles. The victimized server demands from the clients to commit computing resources before it processes their requests. To get service, a client must solve a cryptographic puzzle and submit the right solution. Existing client puzzle schemes have some drawbacks. They are either parallelizable, coarse-grained or can be used only interactively. In case of interactive client puzzles where the server poses the challenge an attacker might mount a counterattack on the clients by injecting faked packets with bogus puzzle parameters bearing the server’s sender address. In this paper we introduce a novel scheme for client puzzles which relies on the computation of square roots modulo a prime. Modular square root puzzles are non-parallelizable, i.e., the solution cannot be obtained faster than scheduled by distributing the puzzle to multiple machines or CPU cores, and they can be employed both interactively and non-interactively. Our puzzles provide polynomial granularity and compact solution and verification functions. Benchmark results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to mitigate DoS attacks on hosts in 1 or even 10 Gbit networks. In addition, we show how to raise the efficiency of our puzzle scheme by introducing a bandwidth-based cost factor for the client. Furthermore, we also investigate the construction of client puzzles from modular cube roots. a 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Following a secure initialization process, a secret sharing scheme normally has a fixed access policy (specified by an access structure). However in dynamic environments it is likely that access policies will be subject to change: for example entities may wish to join the scheme, entitles may be expelled from the scheme or security thresholds may change. Rather than undergo a costly re-initialization process, there have been several different proposals for designing secret sharing schemes that permit dynamic access policies.
