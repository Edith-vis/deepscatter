bab1a13e1e86b6548319a3d33a03afa2da09b11e	computing as a discipline: preliminary report of the acm task force on the core of computer science	programming language;computational science and engineering;efficient implementation;hardware design	It is ACM's 40th year and an old debate continues. Is computer science a science? An engineering discipline? Or merely a technology, an inventor and purveyor of computing commodities? What is the intellectual substance of the discipline? Is it lasting, or will it fade within a generation? Do core curricula in computer science and engineering accurately reflect the field? How can theory and lab work be integrated in a computing curriculum? We project an image of a technology-oriented discipline whose fundamentals are in mathematics and engineering — for example, we represent algorithms as the most basic objects of concern and programming and hardware design as the primary activities. The view that “computer science equals programming” is especially strong in our curricula: the introductory course is programming, the technology is in our core courses, and the science is in our electives. This view blocks progress in reorganizing the curriculum and turns away the best students, who want a greater challenge. It denies a coherent approach to making experimental and theoretical computer science integral and harmonious parts of a curriculum. Those in the discipline know that computer science encompasses far more than programming. The emphasis on programming arises from our long-standing belief that programming languages are excellent vehicles for gaining access to the rest of the field — but this belief limits out ability to speak about the discipline in terms that reveal its full breadth and richness. The field has matured enough that it is now possible to describe its intellectual substance in a new and compelling way. In the spring of 1986, ACM President Adele Goldberg and ACM Education Board Chairman Robert Aiken appointed this task force with the enthusiastic cooperation of the IEEE Computer Society. At the same time, the Computer Society formed a task force on computing laboratories with the enthusiastic cooperation of the ACM. The charter of the task force has three components:Present a description of computer science that emphasizes fundamental questions and significant accomplishments. Propose a new teaching paradigm for computer science that conforms to traditional scientific standards and harmoniously integrates theory and experimentation. Give at least one detailed example of a three-semester introductory course sequence in computer science based on the curriculum model and the disciplinary description.  We immediately extended our task to encompass computer science and computer engineering, for we came to the conclusion that in the core material there is no fundamental difference between the two fields. We use the phrase “discipline of computing” to embrace all of computer science and engineering. The rest of this paper is a summary of the recommendation. The description of the discipline is presented in a series of passes, starting from a short definition and culminating with a matrix as shown in the figure. The short definition: Computer science and engineering is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, implementation, and application. The fundamental question underlying all of computing is, “What can be (efficiently) automated?” The detailed description of the field fills in each of the 27 cells in the matrix with significant issues and accomplishments. (That description occupies about 16 pages of the report.) For the curriculum model, we recommend that the introductory course consist of regular lectures and a closely coordinated weekly laboratory. The lectures emphasize fundamentals; the laboratories emphasize technology and know-how. The pattern of closely coordinated lectures and labs can be repeated where appropriate in other courses. The recommended model is traditional in the physical sciences and in engineering: lectures emphasize enduring principles and concepts while laboratories emphasize the transient material and skills relating to the current technology.	algorithm;coherence (physics);programming language;programming paradigm;regular expression;robert;the matrix;theoretical computer science	Peter J.

Traditionally, the descriptions of such workflows focus on their data flow. Nevertheless, control-flow-oriented workflow languages are increasingly adapted to the needs of data-intensive workflows. This provides a common level of abstraction for both data-intensive workflows and classical orchestration workflows, e.g., business workflows, which then enables a comprehensive optimization across all workflows. However, the problem still remains that workflows described in control-flow-oriented languages tend to be less ecient for data-intensive processes compared to specialized data-flow-oriented approaches. In this article, we propose a new kind of optimization targeted at data-intensive workflows that are described in control-flow-oriented languages. We show how to improve eciency of such workflows by introducing various techniques that partition the local data processing tasks to be performed during workflow execution in an improved way. These data processing tasks are either assigned to the workflow engine or to the tightly integrated local database engine. We evaluate the eectiveness of these techniques via various test scenarios.

The main idea of this model is that various components of the workplace interact to increase and decrease workplace safety and health risk, and that careful `balancing' of the components can produce reduced risk and improved employee safety and health. In this paper we discuss how the `balance model' can be used to promote occupational safety and health.		Michael J.

Based on lightweight mobile equipment, mobile GIS has the feature of flexibility and convenience, and is suitable for field operations, but it is also low memory, low CPU, has limited display range and storage. Taking the particularity in mobile GIS into account, this paper presents a scheme for vector data organization and correction in mobile GIS. The paper consists of two parts: a file organization form for vector data in mobile GIS, and a local real-time correction method of data based on the affine transformation. At last, the paper test the efficiency of the mixed form in file organization and the accuracy of the correction scheme, and prove that both methods have certain feasibility.	central processing unit;geographic information system;real-time clock;world wide web	Feixiang Chen;Xiao Ma;Shaoliang Ni	2013	JNW	10.4304/jnw.8.7.1514-1520	distributed gis;embedded system;enterprise gis;simulation;gis file format;data mining;am/fm/gis;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	SE	-37.39487720995754	-3.7592163741295708	14653

7ed3642a70bf3287e4798261bfead7234004132e	the flows of concepts		A scientific citation is usually presented as a relation between two publications without any precise meaning and inner structure. In fact, the structure of a citation, which is usually not represented explicitly, can be quite complex. Expanded citations, which link scientific papers and concepts from them, allow to represent the structure in a machine-readable way. In this paper, we use expanded citations to introduce the notion of concept flow. We briefly explore the notion and show that it opens interesting possibilities as far as concepts and their importance in scientific domains are considered.	human-readable medium;relation (database);scientific citation;scientific literature	Marcin Skulimowski	2015		10.5220/0005648402920298	knowledge management;data mining;data science;digital library;citation;scientific citation;flow (psychology);semantic publishing;computer science	DB	-43.428746850620094	2.577060368589563	14920

Moreover, contemporary environmental data is heterogenous, encompassing also data about people, environmentalyrelated projects, and documents. Also geographicaland time-related information are vital for any environmental data and should be supported. To satisfy these requirements, “semantic wikis” represent suitable tools but usually requiring knowledge management skills. In this paper, we present a semantic extension to project-management tool Trac, enabling advanced but user-friendly querying in semantic data stored in the system and its visualization. As it builds upon the general concept of RDF-based semantic data, it can be freely extended into other contexts and deployed in various environmental management applications. We also discuss automatic formal visualization of semantic data. Such process significantly lowers the requirements on users in preparing the visualization in domains like environmental studies – and also helps to build Linked Data-aware and better human-readable interfaces of semantic data repositories.	environmental resource management;human-readable medium;knowledge management;linked data;prototype;requirement;resource description framework;trac;usability;user-centered design;wiki	Jakub Talas;Tomás Gregar;Tomás Pitner	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22285-6_47	semantic data model;project management;semantic interoperability;semantic computing;semantic integration;semantic grid;computer science;engineering;semantic web;social semantic web;linked data;data mining;semantic web stack;database;semantic technology;management;world wide web;semantic analytics	DB	-42.132792811754854	3.280390012336215	15422

The authors describe a Web interface for a clinical data repository (CDR) that was moved from concept to production status in less than six months using a rapid prototyping approach, multi-disciplinary development team, and off-the-shelf hardware and software. The system has since been expanded to provide an integrated display of clinical data from nearly 20 disparate information systems.		Raymond G. Duncan;Dinah Saperia;Ronda Dulbandzhyan;M.

c8f506c1eae950a738bf8e6794fb64b152056c12	using machine learning to support qualitative coding in social science: shifting the focus to ambiguity		Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly influential to human society, yet the primary advancements and applications of ML are driven by research in only a few computational disciplines. Even applications that affect or analyze human behaviors and social structures are often developed with limited input from experts outside of computational fields. Social scientists—experts trained to examine and explain the complexity of human behavior and interactions in the world—have considerable expertise to contribute to the development of ML applications for human-generated data, and their analytic practices could benefit from more human-centered ML methods. Although a few researchers have highlighted some gaps between ML and social sciences [51, 57, 70], most discussions only focus on quantitative methods. Yet many social science disciplines rely heavily on qualitative methods to distill patterns that are challenging to discover through quantitative data. One common analysis method for qualitative data is qualitative coding. In this article, we highlight three challenges of applying ML to qualitative coding. Additionally, we utilize our experience of designing a visual analytics tool for collaborative qualitative coding to demonstrate the potential in using ML to support qualitative coding by shifting the focus to identifying ambiguity. We illustrate dimensions of ambiguity and discuss the relationship between disagreement and ambiguity. Finally, we propose three research directions to ground ML applications for social science as part of the progression toward human-centered machine learning.	addendum;cobham's thesis;color gradient;computation;digital library;humans;interaction;machine learning;social structure	Nan-Chen Chen;Margaret Drouhard;Rafal Kocielnik;Jina Suh;Cecilia R.

Yet, agent developers proceed largely under the optimistic assumption that agent s will be error-free. Errors may arise in agents for numerous reasons — agents may share a workspace wi th other agents or humans and updates made by these other entities may cause an agent to fac e a situation that it was not explicitly programmed to deal with. Likewise, errors in coding agents m ay lead to inconsistent situations where it is unclear how the agent should act. In this paper, we define an agent execution model that allows agents to continuing acting “reasonably” even when s ome errors of the above types occur. More importantly, in our framework, agents take “repair” ac tions automatically when confronted with such situations, but while taking such repair actions, they can often continue to engage in work and/or interactions with other agents that are unaffected b y repairs. 1Institut und Ludwig Wittgenstein Labor für Informationss ysteme, Technische Universität Wien, Favoritenstraße 9-11, A-1040 Wien, Austria.

However, existing keyword based search engines, language or topic model based mining systems cannot provide customized queries according to various user requirements. Hence, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel TAIL (Time-Author- Institute-Literature) model to capture the relationships among litera- ture, authors, institutes and time stamps. Based on the TAIL model, we implement the Massive Scientific Paper Mining (MSPM) system and set up a B/S (Browser/Server) structure for web services. The evaluation results on large real data show that our MSPM system could deliver desirable mining results, providing valuable data supports for scientific research cooperations.

6f4d92605c1323c7ec896db76ed98b1b294d8a56	(artificial) mind over matter: integrating humans and algorithms in solving matching problems		"""1 PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION Schema matching is a data integration task that provides correspondences between concepts describing the meaning of data in various heterogeneous, distributed data sources (e.g., attributes in database schemata). The research of data integration and schema matching spans over multiple decades, holds both theoretical and practical appeal, and enjoys a continued interest by researchers and practitioners (See surveys [7] and books [6, 18] for an overview). In recent years, there has been an evolution of data accumulation, management, analytics, and visualization (also known as big data). Big data is primarily about collecting volumes of data in an increased velocity from various sources and varying veracity. Big data is characterized by technological advancements such as Internet of things (accumulation), cloud computing (management), and deep learning (analytics). Putting it all together provides us with a new, exciting, and challenging research agenda. Schema matching problems have been historically defined as a semi-automated task in which correspondences are generated by matching algorithms and subsequently validated by a single human expert. The reason for that is the inherent assumption that humans “do it better,"""" which is not necessarily the case [28]. This research is devoted to the investigation of respective roles of humans and machines in achieving cognitive tasks. We focus on matching as a concrete task where the traditional roles of humans and machines are subject to change due to the availability of data and advances in machine learning. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Preliminaries are given in Section 2 followed the model and approach (Section 3). We conclude in 4 with our main contributions and results."""	algorithm;big data;book;cloud computing;deep learning;humans;internet of things;machine learning;semiconductor industry;tree accumulation;velocity (software development);veracity	Roee Shraga	2018		10.1145/3183713.3183716	mind over matter;data integration;data mining;computer science;machine learning;artificial intelligence;schema matching	DB	-36.6997136128298	-8.052628931307147	16397

The seventh edition took place March 24--29, 2002, and while traditions are often associated with graying hairs, the Copper Mountain keywords are still fresh, young, dynamic, and inspiring. It is the successful formula developed by Tom Manteuffel and Steve McCormick that keeps the event going strong. In publishing, one has to be prudent with traditions, but the formula led again in 2002 to an attractive mix of new, valuable material, and it was readily decided by the Program Committee to collect the best contributions as papers to form the kernel of a special issue. As in foregoing years, the committee members accepted the invitation to act as guest editors. SIAM accepted our proposal and offered us space in SISC. This special issue was well announced, even in advance of the conference, to offer those not attending the opportunity to contribute. In...	iterative method	Henk A. van der Vorst	2003	SIAM J.

5ad8dc35ce375a744f94d2fcc059a89e745262aa	towards analytics aware ontology based access to static and streaming data		Real-time analytics that requires integration and aggregation of heterogeneous and distributed streaming and static data is a typical task in many industrial scenarios such as diagnostics of turbines in Siemens. OBDA approach has a great potential to facilitate such tasks; however, it has a number of limitations in dealing with analytics that restrict its use in important industrial applications. Based on our experience with Siemens, we argue that in order to overcome those limitations OBDA should be extended and become analytics, source, and cost aware. In this work we propose such an extension. In particular, we propose an ontology, mapping, and query language for OBDA, where aggregate and other analytical functions are first class citizens. Moreover, we develop query optimisation techniques that allow to efficiently process analytical tasks over static and streaming data. We implement our approach in a system and evaluate our system with Siemens turbine data.	aggregate data;first-class function;mathematical optimization;ontology (information science);query language;query optimization;real-time transcription;semantic integration;stream (computing)	Evgeny Kharlamov;Yannis Kotidis;Theofilos Mailis;Christian Neuenstadt;Charalampos Nikolaou;Özgür L.

We have continued to intensify our collaboration with the MODELS conference by presenting the annual SoSyM Awards at MODELS and strengthening the SoSyM “Journal-First” arrangement with MODELS. The first issue of this new year’s volume summarizes the status of SoSyM in terms of recent statistics and milestone events over the past year. As an additional testament to the interest and growth in our field, recent full professorship positions have been offered in the area of software and systems modeling, which means the area has now advanced from a subdomain of software engineering, data modeling, formal methods, and related areas to its own sustainable research domain. Unfortunately, in 2017 we also lost one of our best friends who was one of the early members of our community. Bernhard Schätz passed away from cancer in July, 2017. As a memorial toBernhard, this editorial is also accompaniedwith a scientific appreciation of his life.	amiga reflections;bernhard schölkopf;data modeling;formal methods;software and systems modeling;software engineering;testament	Geri Georg;Jeffrey G.

One of them is the ingenious application of queueing theory to the performance evaluation of communication networks. Queueing theory is still useful in contemporary service systems having human customers and servers as precious resources. However, some new theoretical development is needed to cope with human service systems. In this article, the potential of queueing theory is discussed in the scope of emerging service science. We begin with a snapshot of Professor Kleinrock’s laboratory in the early 1980s. We then review the performance metric called power worked out by Kleinrock as it determines the optimal input rate in a service system. As an example of service science for healthcare, we show modeling of obstetric patient flow in a hospital by means of Little’s law and a network of M/M/m and M/G/1 queues. 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. 1. Personal retrospective and view of queueing theory I spent a great time with Professor Kleinrock’s students My career as a researcher of computer and communication science started when I received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in May 1983 [23]. My dissertation was supervised by Professor Leonard Kleinrock, who was then the principal investigator (PI) of the Contract MDA 903-82-C-0064 from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the Department of Defense. My doctoral committee consisted of Professors Mario Gerla, James R. Jackson, Steven A. Lippman, Richard R. Muntz, and Leonard Kleinrock (Committee Chair). Two volumes of Queueing Systems [13,14] were textbooks in Professor Kleinrock’s classes ‘‘CS212A Queueing Systems: Theory and Applications’’ and ‘‘CS212C Computer Communications Network’’. Later the solutions manuals were published coauthored by Kleinrock and Gail [18–20]. during that period including Mart Molle, Randy Nelson, Richard Gail, Ken Kung, Hanoch Levy, Yehuda Afek, Fathi Belgith, and Joe Green. I also talked a lot with other professors’ students like Mike Molloy, Bruce Walker, Paul Hurley, Edmundo de Souza e Silva, Mary Vernon, Kin Leung, Frank Schaffa, and Luis Filipe de Moraes. All of them later became outstanding figures in academia and industry across the world. Several ex-students such as Ed Coffman, Simon Lam, Fouad Tobagi, Farouk Kamoun, Parviz Kermani, John Silvester, and Yechiam Yemini occasionally dropped by at the weekly students meeting in Professor Kleinrock’s office and talked to younger academic brothers in a very friendly fashion. I sat in classes of Professors Richard R. Muntz, Mario Gerla, Walter J. Karplus, Wesley W. Chu, and Izhak Rubin (Systems Science) and met many distinguished visitors such as Vinton Cerf, Wim Cohen, Bob Kahn, Hisashi Kobayashi, Alan Konheim, and Steve Lavenberg. Cheerful support staff members Lillian Larijani, George Ann Hornor, Brenda Ramsey, Verra Morgan, Ruth Pordy, and Terry Peters helped students in administration as well H. Takagi / Computer Networks 66 (2014) 102–111 103 as in preparation for research papers, because typewriting and figure drawing were done manually at that time. On June 9 and 10, 1994, a two-day symposium entitled Experts on Networks was held at the Sequoia room of the UCLA Faculty Center in order to honor Professor Leonard Kleinrock and his contributions to computer science on his 60th birthday and over 30 years at UCLA. On that occasion, a genealogical tree of his students, students of his students, and so on, was compiled by Bob Felderman. According to the tree, I am the 21st student amongst those 35 students (at that time) who received doctoral degrees under the supervision of Professor Kleinrock, the first of whom being Ed Coffman. On June 11, participants in the workshop were invited by Mrs. Stella Schuler Kleinrock to the party at Professor Kleinrock’s house in the Brentwood area of western Los Angeles. With such background, I worked on the application of queueing theory to computers and communication networks during my most active research life. However, the use of analytic studies has soon become less important in these fields. I think there are two reasons for this decline. First, the rapid technological development, referred to as Moore’s law, has brought powerful CPU and abundant memory for computers as well as virtually unlimited bandwidth of optical fiber for telecommunication networks so cheaply that we do not have to concern ourselves with the wise (and stingy) use of these resources any longer. Second, the protocol and control of the operation in these systems have become so complicated and interdependent that theoretical treatment, often based on simplifying fictitious assumptions such as independence of events and exponential distribution, cannot cope with the operation of real systems. Thus it is no wonder that analytic methods based individually on the human brain power have been replaced by algorithmic and event-driven simulation methods which can capitalize on the ever-growing computer power. My recent interest is the mathematical and statistical treatment of service systems with human customers and servers, for example, queues in airports, call centers, hospitals, etc., in the context of an emerging discipline called service science. Notice that human beings still remain to be a precious resource that may not be abused in service systems. In most countries, whether developed or under development, the service sector of industry now takes a predominant portion of the national economy in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) as well as the population share of labor force. Unlike manufacturing, however, not much scientific approach has been exploited so far for the increase of productivity and promotion of innovation in the service industry. The services science was advocated as a new academic discipline in the so-called Palmisano Report from the Council on Competitiveness in the United States published in December 2004 [2]. According to my view, the study of service systems with human customers and servers is one of a few fields in which the queueing theory can still make prominent impacts on the practical side (another potential field may be the radio communication technology where the channel bandwidth continues to be a physically limited resource [26]). Application of queueing theory to human service systems is not new at all. It was only that the exclusively driving application was computers and communication networks from the 1960s to the 1980s. Science of service is the field of study in the 21st century on top of operations research, data science and computer science. I hope that the basis of our knowledge which was cultivated under the leadership of Professor Kleinrock enables us to pave the way for this new affluent area of research. Some books address the queueing theory for service systems [3,11,24]. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we characterize service systems involving human customers and servers by highlighting the difference from those systems in which the service is provided by tireless machines. In Section 3, we review the performance metric named power which I think Professor Kleinrock favored, and we confirm one of his conjectures numerically. In Section 4, as an example of queueing theory application to service science, we show a preliminary piece of work on the modeling of obstetric patient flow in a hospital by means of Little’s law and a network of M/M/m and M/G/1 queues. We conclude in Section 5 by discussing several features of queueing models for human service systems that challenge the queueing theorists. 2. Service systems with human servers and facilities Service can be defined as the activity to bring value (satisfaction) to not only the recipients (customers) but also the providers (employees) by optimal management of a set of available resources. The service industry is so diverse. Thus the challenge of service science is to create the principles and architecture of service operation and to implement it in the system just as the computer science has developed the architecture of computer operation and implemented it in the system since the 1950s. Some service systems do not involve human servers in real time such as reservation of a hotel room, purchase of goods and money transfer over the Internet and the automatic checkin processing in the airport. However, there are still many service systems in which human servers play a major and indispensable role. Fig. 1 shows a generic service system involving human servers and facilities. In a service organization, employees provide service by using some physical facilities as enablers. One of the characteristic features of service that differentiate ‘‘service’’ from ‘‘goods’’ is said to be the intangibility, meaning that the service is action or performance that cannot be touched physically in the same manner as goods can be sensed as objects [4, p.20]. However, our experience tells us that a comfortable physical facility and environment are essential for the customer satisfaction. Employees and facilities are the operational resources that are not free but require sizable investment to keep them available for customers. Therefore, the manager of service organization holds a finite number of employees and facilities in the pool to supply them when needed to administer the service. Customers come to the service organization to get service. A certain set of resources (employees and facilities) must be allocated to each service for a certain duration of Fig. 1. Generic service system involving human servers and facilities. 104 H. Takagi / Computer Networks 66 (2014) 102–111 time.

"""" seeking clarification , i came to understand that he Was Wondering Why a computer scientist such as myself would want to be on the editorial board of a publication that isn't necessarily focused on the """" tradition """" of computer science. then and there, i realized that a computer sci-entist's role is something worth explaining and understanding. much has been made recently of computational thinking, a term coined by Jeanette Wing at the us national science foundation. 1 While i have my doubts about the term's longevity, 2 it struck me as an excellent starting point for explaining what a computer scientist is and does, especially in the CiSE context. computer scientists are an increasingly important part of interdisciplinary—or multidisciplinary, a term i prefer—problem solving. We help others understand the merits of bringing the right methods (algorithms), architecture/design (software engineering), and programming tools (languages and systems) and techniques (visualization) to science and engineering applications. so, as i see it, computer scientists bring a panoply of options to the table that enhance multi disciplinary research. if you will, we're about computational doing—and doing it right. as the former chez thiruvathukal in scientific programming , i like to view computer science's various ideas as the masala found in my (and possibly your) favorite curries. this brings me back to why i'm here. i've always had an eye to applying computer science to other disciplines, scientific and otherwise. in the past few months, i've begun working on two new (funded) projects—one addresses healthcare (modeling health issues in social networks using agent-based simulation) and the other addresses digital humanities (developing collaborative tools for tex-tual studies). in both cases, computer science plays a critical role in that both projects have expected software and experimental outcomes. i don't always write about my other disciplinary interests in CiSE, but given my emphasis on programming and emerging technologies , it's comforting to know that i've joined a group of people committed to exploring the intersections with and showing respect for other disciplines. for the sake of scholarship and meaningful discourse, we need more places like CiSE, and we must keep the content fresh and exciting—even during these challenging times when all publications face …"""	agent-based model;agent-based social simulation;algorithm;collaborative software;computation;computational thinking;computer science;computer scientist;digital humanities;i'm here;problem solving;programming tool;social network;software engineering	George K.

6ee3efd0c8f55249631280ba5b19944e5c262c74	user profile modelling for digital resource management systems		In this paper, we focus on user assistance in an interactive and adaptive system. The increase in production of digital data, these last two years has raised several issues regarding the management of heterogeneous and multiple source data in the user’s environment. One distinctive feature of user assistance is the user model that represents essential information about each user. We propose a modeling of a scientific user, who is a researcher, in a personal resource management system. Our methodology is based on the IMS-LIP standard extension and the user’s trace management. Our work can assist users in the consolidated management of their resources and their environment, based on the user’s profile. Experimental results obtained by the emperical evaluation in our laboratory are presented.	adaptive system;digital data;management system;relevance;source data;tf–idf;user modeling;user profile	Daouda Sawadogo;Ronan Champagnat;Pascal Estraillier	2014			data mining;user modeling;user interface design;computer user satisfaction;user experience design;user requirements document;knowledge management;user assistance;user profile;computer science;user interface	AI	-45.50085857078557	-23.511776807968275	17038

These include data from political history, history of arts and sciences, archaeology or observational data from natural history or geosciences. Therefore IFLA and ICOM are merging their core ontologies, an important step towards semantic interoperability of metadata schemata across all archives, libraries and museums. It opens new prospects for advanced global information integration services.

However, due to the growing amount of digital information as well as improved technical possibilities, other organization schemes such as faceted classification schemes or so-called folksonomies, the result of social tagging activity, recently gained popularity. While these approaches address particular shortcomings of purely hierarchical organization of information, they exhibit certain characteristics limiting their general applicability. In this paper, we first give an overview of the particular strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to knowledge organization. Subsequently, we present a formal model of TACKO, a novel organization scheme that is inspired by the flexibility of tagging systems, i.e., the assignment of keywords to information resources, and incorporates elements of hierarchical and faceted organization schemes, so it can be considered a synthesis of the aforementioned schemes. We illustrate TACKO using a small example scenario. Additionally, we present a user interface for our approach, that we implemented in a modern web-based collaboration software.	context-sensitive language;digital data;faceted classification;folksonomy;information system;knowledge organization;list of collaborative software;mathematical model;user interface;web application	Florian Matthes;Christian Neubert;Alexander Steinhoff	2012		10.1145/2362456.2362468	computer science;knowledge management;data science;data mining	Web+IR	-43.807022828242836	-19.5480176767804	17321

MPEG-7, despite providing a comprehensive set of tools for the standardised description of audiovisual content, is largely compromised by the use of XML that leaves the largest part of the intended semantics implicit. Aspiring to formalise MPEG-7 descriptions and enhance multimedia metadata interoperability, a number of multimedia ontologies have been proposed. Though sharing a common vision, the developed ontologies are characterised by substantial conceptual differences, reflected both in the modelling of MPEG-7 description tools as well as in the linking with domain ontologies. Delving into the principles underlying their engineering, we present a systematic survey of the state of the art MPEG-7 based multimedia ontologies, and highlight issues that hinder interoperability as well as possible directions towards their harmonisation.	description logic;interoperability;mpeg-7;ontology (information science);programming paradigm;requirement;scalability;semantic web;world wide web;xml	Stamatia Dasiopoulou;Vassilis Tzouvaras;Yiannis Kompatsiaris;Michael G.

In the afternoon of November 6, the GNSS.asia Project and the ECCT Technology Committee also held a workshop entitled “2012 GNSS.ASIA Taiwan Workshop.” In this workshop, Justyna Redelkiewicz Musial of the European GNSS Agency; Giuseppe Izzo, General Manager of STMicroelectronics Taiwan; Tamas Maczak, Deputy Head of Office of EETO; Wen-Hsin Chan, Adviser to the DoIT of MOEA; Dr. Frank Tsai, Director of the Smart Network Systems Institute, Intelligent Telematics and Networked Systems Integration Center, III; Max Lai; Tom Tom; Miss Shu Min Chuang, Advisor Engineer of the Smart Network Systems Inst itute, III; and Michael Lee, Department Manager of the Connected Vehicle Department, Division for Telematics and Vehicular Control Systems, Information and Communications Research Laboratory, ITRI, delivered a series of talks regarding (1) The latest trends in the global GNSS market, (2) Best practices and business opportunities in the GNSS downstream sector, (3) Joint EU-Taiwan industry partnership, and (4) Cluster-to-cluster opportunities. A f ter wa rds , on November 7 Wednesday, ITST-2012 continued with tutorial courses and panel discussions. Professor T. Russell Hsing held a panel entitled “Cognitive Radio and Networks in Intelligent Vehicle Systems (IVS) and High Speed Rail (HSR) Applications: Challenges and Opportunities.” Professor Hsiao-Chun Wu taught a tutorial course entitled “Game Theories for Wireless Networking Applications.” Professor Neil Y. Yen delivered his tutorial course entitled “An Integrated Approach toward HumanCentered Search Support.” In the afternoon of November 7, ITST-2012 arranged a city tour of the National Palace Museum. The collection of cultural artifacts held inside the National Palace Museum consists of an enormous treasure trove of objects from the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties. The development of the Museum is closely connected to the social changes of modern Chinese civilization and culture. That evening, more than 200 participants and colleagues gathered for the Gala Dinner at the SILKS PALACE at the National Palace Museum. The Gala Dinner attendees visited the National Palace Museum for the entire afternoon and then spent the entire evening enjoying a special cuisine that reflected the artifacts seen inside the National Palace Museum in the afternoon and banquet entertainments, including a Taiwanese Puppet Show, which originated locally and thus is unique in the world. Thursday, November 8 marked the final day of the event, which was highlighted by as many technical sessions as on November 6 and 7. It is somewhat surprising for me that there was still a full number of attendees participating in the technical sessions that day. Finally, ITST-2012 successfully completed its 2012 event by offering communications and ITS professionals worldwide with the opportunity to not only network with global colleagues but also address the most important technical and business issues in ITS, Telecommunications and Green ICT technology.

We provide a comprehensive survey, in database perspective, on the data mining techniques developed recently. Several major kinds of data mining methods, including generalization, characterization, classification, clustering, association, evolution, pattern matching, data visualization, and meta-rule guided mining, will be reviewed. Techniques for mining knowledge in different kinds of databases, including relational, transaction, object-oriented, spatial, and active databases, as well as global information systems, will be examined. Potential data mining applications and some research issues will also be discussed.	active database;cluster analysis;data mining;data visualization;database transaction;global information system;pattern matching;statistical classification	Jiawei Han	1996		10.1145/233269.280351	concept mining;web mining;text mining;global information system;intelligent database;computer science;data science;data administration;database model;pattern matching;user-defined function;data mining;database;knowledge extraction;data stream mining;programming language;object-oriented programming;data visualization;database design	ML	-34.25655821646053	-3.9206366685138354	17455

Provenance is critical information in scientific applications to verify experiment process, validate data quality and associate trust values with scientific results. Current industrial scale eScience projects require an end-to-end provenance management infrastructure. This infrastructure needs to be underpinned by formal semantics to enable analysis of large scale provenance information by software applications. Further, effective analysis of provenance information requires well-defined query mechanisms to support complex queries over large datasets. This paper introduces an ontology-driven provenance management infrastructure for biology experiment data, as part of the Semantic Problem Solving Environment (SPSE) for Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi). This provenance infrastructure, called T.cruzi Provenance Management System (PMS), is underpinned by (a) a domain-specific provenance ontology called Parasite Experiment ontology, (b) specialized query operators for provenance analysis, and (c) a provenance query engine. The query engine uses a novel optimization technique based on materialized views called materialized provenance views (MPV) to scale with increasing data size and query complexity. This comprehensive ontology-driven provenance infrastructure not only allows effective tracking and management of ongoing experiments in the Tarleton Research Group at the Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases (CTEGD), but also enables researchers to retrieve the complete provenance information of scientific results for publication in literature.	data quality;decision tree model;e-science;emoticon;end-to-end principle;experiment;lineage (evolution);management system;materialized view;mathematical optimization;problem solving environment;semantics (computer science);mpv	Satya Sanket Sahoo;D.

The simulator is hosted in a local area network of personal computers and has Windows XP as its operating system. The Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) for the operator and the instructor are based on a multi-window system; therefore, they have access to a lot of information inside their respective action field at any moment during the simulation session. In particular, the operator HMI has been designed for being suitable for training power plants operators with modern HMIs, where the operation is based on computer screens. The simulator has been installed in an operators training centre where a group of acceptance tests has been successfully carried out. Currently, the simulator is being used as part of the training courses for fossil-fuel power plant operators.	fossil;user interface	José Tavira-Mondragón;Luis Jiménez-Fraustro;Guillermo Romero-Jiménez	2008	IJCAET	10.1504/IJCAET.2010.029594	human–machine interface;control engineering;power station;simulation;fossil fuel;computer science;engineering;power system simulator for engineering;user interface;mechanical engineering	EDA	-35.09996174317426	-21.741850847236737	17462

afc2de5c092976e183f9d7c0eeebc0c7502e3212	mathematics: a fractal life	history	Highlights from this season’s releases At the start of The Fractalist is a photograph dated June 1930. In a Jewish family’s apartment in Warsaw, four Polish mathematicians are hosting a meal for an honoured guest — French mathematician Jacques Hadamard. Somewhere in the same house, although not pictured, would have been a six-year-old named Benoît. The family’s surname was Mandelbrot. A hugely productive theorist of geometry and roughness, and the “father of fractals”, Benoît Mandelbrot died aged 85 on 14 October 2010. The Fractalist is his posthumously published autobiography, polished with help from his former assistant and colleagues. A collection of poignant vignettes, the memoir paints Mandelbrot as an intellectual individualist who created his own field. He was reputedly a prickly character, self-important and quick to take offence. Traces of his strong opinions come through, but they are overwhelmed by warm and delightful reminiscences of family and colleagues. Mandelbrot explains that in that 1930 photo are several of the most important people in his life. Key among them is his mathematician uncle, Szolem. The first in the family to attend university, Szolem Mandelbrot had travelled to Paris to study mathematics under Hadamard, and went on to hold the same chair at the Collège de France as Henri Poincaré. He was Mandelbrot’s informal mentor, and linked the family to international science. In 1936, as European civilization began to dissolve, Mandelbrot’s “lucid and decisive” parents took the family to Paris to join Szolem. Benoît recalls learning about the history and architecture of the city during long walks. When the war started, the family fled occupied Paris for rural Tulle in the unoccupied Limousin region. Danger was never far away, and in 1943, the family went into hiding and the parents and children split up. Posing as apprentice tool-makers, Benoît and his cousin Leon aroused suspicion and were arrested by the police, who were seeking the culprits of a bombing. Days of anguish followed before a helpful official intervened on their behalf. Through such kindnesses, and the determination of his parents, Mandelbrot survived the war. Back in Paris, his mathematical skill gained him entrance to the prestigious École Polytechnique. This would have guaranteed him a comfortable career in France, but Mandelbrot never settled for the safe option. In one vignette, Mandelbrot recalls a “lifealtering verbal lashing from Szolem”. It was 1952 and Mandelbrot, aged 28, was back in Paris after studying fluid dynamics and aircraft design at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He hadn’t chosen a topic for his PhD, and Szolem berated him for excessive book learning and preparation to be a “well-trained monkey”. Szolem suggested pursuing quadratic dynamics, the sometimes complex behaviour of mathematical functions when iterated — plug in a number, take the result and plug that back in again, endlessly. Mandelbrot looked into the topic, then dropped it. But the lashing had an effect. Soon, Szolem pointed Mandelbrot to the linguist George Zipf, who had found a scaling law in the relative frequency of word use that seemed to be universal across languages. “Silly stuff only you can like” was Szolem’s view. Benoît, to the alarm of his professors, chose it as his thesis topic — and so set a course to revolutionize science. Mandelbrot’s insight that the apparently random might harbour hidden order broadened over his postdoc positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge; Princeton University in New	fractal;image scaling;iteration;leon;lucid;mandelbrot set;theory;tracing (software);zipf's law	Mark Buchanan	2012	Nature	10.1038/490476a	pure mathematics;mandelbrot set;memoir;fractal;mathematics	ML	-59.521768966211134	-23.012479318354455	17825

Today, major parts of scholarly Open Access (OA) publications and the self-archiving area are not well covered in the traditional citation and indexing databases. The growing share and importance of freely accessible research output demands new approaches/metrics for measuring and for evaluating of these new types of scientific publications. In this paper we propose a simple quantitative method which establishes indicators by measuring the access/download pattern of OA documents and other web entities of a single web server. The experimental indicators (search engine, backlink and direct access indicator) are constructed based on standard local web usage data. This new type of web-based indicator is developed to model the specific demand for better study/evaluation of the accessibility, visibility and interlinking of open accessible documents. We conclude that e-science will need new stable e-indicators.	accessibility;archive;backlink;database;design rationale;digital data;download;e-science;entity;norm (social);programming paradigm;random access;scientific literature;server (computing);usage analysis;usage data;web application;web search engine;web server	Philipp Mayr	2006	CoRR	10.3152/147154406781775940	quantitative research;computer science;data mining;database;sociology;world wide web;search engine	Web+IR	-46.40254831283376	-21.35561065091242	18387

dfb2e9f2f763e954614d4055b1e9f8563b0954a5	is web-site management a database problem?	web-site management;database problem	Several recent events have heatedly discussed the applicability of database technology to the Internet and the World-Wide Web (e.g., Dewitt’s VLDB-95 talk, a 1996 DIMACS Web/DB workshop, ICDE-98 panel). One of the areas that has emerged from these discussions as a candidate for impact of the database community is that of of Web site construction and management. In parallel, several research projects have been started with the goal of addressing this problem (e.g., Strudel (AT&T Research), Araneus (University of Rome), YAT (INRIA, France) and WebOQL (University of Toronto)). The common theme of these projects is the declarative management of the content and structure of web sites. These projects feed off previous relevant work on management of semistructed data and on data integration. In addition to the research activity, there has been a flurry of activity among database vendors to develop tools for serving data that is stored in databases. Other web site management tools are being developed by non-database companies (e.g., products such as FrontPage, NetObjects, and many others). These products are starting to provide more and more features to incorporate data from multiple external sources and for managing the structure of Web sites. The purpose of this panel is to discuss whether Web site managment is a database problem (in whole, or at least in part). The panel will put forward several contradictory opinions on the topic. In particular, we expect some of the following opinions to be represented:	database;microsoft frontpage;webmaster;world wide web	Daniela Florescu;Alon Y.

757905c6bd18c903331f3254d75ff3ca9b5d8a97	collaborative modeling in neuroscience: time to go open model?		Computational modeling in neuroscience has traditionally followed the ‘single researcher’s project’ approach. Building a model and using it to investigate a scientific question is often the work of one scientist or, at most, of a few people working closely together in one research group. This is quite similar to how most experiments are still being done in neuroscience, where, typically, each student or postdoc have their ‘own’ project. But the rest of biology has been evolving away from this modus operandi. Especially since the success of Human Genome Project the consortium-based research approach is commonly used to tackle complex problems. Slowly such large-scale ‘anonymous’ research projects are also finding their way into neuroscience and into computational neuroscience. The most famous and controversial example of the latter is the Blue Brain Project, which uses a supercomputer infrastructure to simulate the cortical column. But while the Blue Brain Project and other similar initiatives involve consortia of collaborating researchers, the projects have been closed to outsiders. Several new initiatives promote a different approach to model building, similar to the open source development of computer code. While open source software is often mainly seen as ‘free’, more importantly in the context of this editorial, it is usually also understood to be developed in a public, collaborative manner. A first example of open source code development in computational neuroscience was the GENESIS simulator and a more recent example is the NEST simulator. A full comparison of these two simulators and how they are being developed is beyond the scope of this editorial, but the different ways in which they organize collaborative development reflects global trends in the open source movement (e.g. the need to policeWikipedia). Where GENESIS code development was unstructured, both at the human and at the IT end, NEST development is controlled by an association, the NEST Initiative, and uses modern IT tools like version control and continuous integration-based workflows. But despite these differences, the underlying philosophy is identical: code development for large software products is labor intensive and beyond the scope of one laboratory. This can be overcome by collaborative development, with many research groups contributing, and because the list of candidate developers is not known a priori a public, open model promotes the widest involvement.

Analysis of social media data has the potential to provide useful insights in a wide range of domains including social science, advertising and policing. Social media information is produced in real-time, and so analysis that can give insights into events as they occur can be particularly valuable. Similarly, analytics platforms providing low latency query responses can improve the user experience for ad-hoc data exploration on historic data sets. However, the rate at which new data is generated makes it a real challenge to design a system that can meet both of these challenges. This paper describes the design and evaluation of such a system. Firstly, it describes how a meta-analysis of the types of questions that were being asked of Twitter data led to the identification of a small set of queries that could be used to answer the majority of them. Secondly, it describes the design of a scalable platform for answering these and other queries. The architecture is described: it is cloud-based, and combines both continuous query, and noSQL database technology. Evaluation results are presented which show that the system can scale to process queries on streaming data arriving at the rate of the full Twitter firehose. Experiments show that queries on large repositories of stored historic data can also be answered with low latency. Finally, we present the results of queries that combine both streaming and historic data.	cloud computing;hoc (programming language);nosql;real-time locating system;scalability;social media;software repository;streaming media;user experience	Rebecca Simmonds;Paul Watson;Jonathan Halliday;Paolo Missier	2014	2014 IEEE World Congress on Services	10.1109/SERVICES.2014.40	computer science;data mining;database;view;world wide web	DB	-35.82460179720865	-5.756535770351156	18887

An alternative approach to our traditional method of soil fertility management in decision making processes using GIS Cloud (Geographic Information System) is a novel idea for e-governance and m-governance. In recent years, many researchers have studied the importance of cloud-computing in various sectors for storing large amount of data and GIS as a separate concept in viewing the spatial maps. The main objective of this study is to suggest a complete Decision Support System (DSS) using GIS enabled cloud technologies to administer agricultural related data required for soil fertility management based on different criteria's like crop, season, soil type, seed varieties, etc. The proposed DSS includes development of geo-referenced soil fertility maps showing distributions of soil nutrients and their spatial variability to provide fertilizer recommendations using Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) equations for targeted yield approach for different crops in India.	cloud computing;cloud storage;decision support system;digital data;e-governance;embedded system;geographic information system;map;server (computing);simulation;spatial variability;virtual private server	H.

In the era of big data, it brings great opportunities and challenges to meteorology and hydrology services. Because isolated information resources and industry data barriers bring incomplete data parameters, which makes the hydrological model simulate inaccurately. This paper mainly discusses the application of big data technology in Hydro-Meteorological industry. Firstly, it introduces the background and principal of hydrological SWAT model. Secondly, this paper proceeds the SWAT simulation and estimates runoff prediction of WangMo river in GuiZhou province, and analyzes simulation results. Finally, it proposes a big data platform architecture design combines with SWAT hydrological model as future research direction. Big data platform will provide libraries of integrated model, method, component, knowledge database for Hydro-Meteorological resources management. It also offers decision-making for flood control, water shortage, water pollution incidents.	big data;swat	Xi Guo;Biao Wang;Wei Xiong;Shisheng Jin	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-72823-0_9	swat model;architecture;hydrology;resource management;knowledge base;big data;water pollution;water scarcity;surface runoff;environmental science	DB	-39.77149443356259	-3.254007936686084	19115

ebbc3dd0e68ec7a36cbf8cfdee4f65833a25ace7	promoting further developments of neural networks		The last few years have seen a phenomenal surge in the interests and new developments in neural networks. For example, a review article on deep learning published by Schmidhuber (2015) in our journal has been cited more than 800 times according to Google Scholar. Neural Networks continues to support such exciting developments through high-quality peer reviewing, prompt publication, and wide circulation. This volume begins the thirtieth year of publication of Neural Networks, the world’s first journal dedicated to the interdisciplinary and vibrant field of neural networks. As the official journal of the International Neural Network Society (INNS), the European Neural Network Society (ENNS), and the Japanese Neural Network Society (JNNS), Neural Networks publishes the full range of research in neural networks, including modeling in cognitive science and neuroscience, learning systems, mathematical and computational analysis, and engineering and applications. The past year continued to an excellent year for our journal. First, we continued to receive a large number of submissions, reflecting the trust our authors place in Neural Networks. Second, thanks in part to themeasures implemented in recent years (Doya, Taylor, & Wang, 2012; Doya & Wang, 2014, 2015), the review and publication time has been further shortened. As documented on the journal website (http://journalinsights.elsevier.com/journals/ 0893-6080/review_speed), it now takes on average 7.7 weeks to reach the first decision after submission, and 11.8 weeks to reach the final decision. Even compared to the already good review speed in 2015 (Doya & Wang, 2016), this represents a reduction of more than one week in each of these two metrics. Finally, the impact factor has increased considerably in themost recent year, to 3.216. We are pleased to announce the introduction of the Best Paper Award to recognize annually a single outstanding paper published in Neural Networks, with a prize of $1000. The first round of competitionwill take place this year and the awardwill be selected from the papers published in 2015. More details about the Best Paper Award are posted on the journal website.

Existing works have mainly focused on the geometric properties of trajectories, while the semantics and the background geographic information has rarely been addressed. We claim that meaningful patterns can only be extracted from trajectories if the geographic space where trajectories are located is considered. In this paper we propose a reverse engineering framework for mining and modeling semantic trajectory patterns. Since trajectory patterns are data dependent, they may not be modeled in conceptual geographic database schemas before they are known. Therefore, we apply data mining to extract general trajectory patterns, and through a new kind of relationships, we model these patterns in the geographic database schema. A case study shows the power of the framework for modeling semantic trajectory patterns in the geographic space.	conceptual schema;data mining;database schema;reverse engineering;spatial database	Luis Otávio Alvares;Vania Bogorny;José Antônio Fernandes de Macêdo;Bart Moelans;Stefano Spaccapietra	2007			data model;computer science;data science;data mining;database;reverse engineering	DB	-35.58358957353062	-3.0305989652928345	19348

New strategies and systems are needed to help these scientists to efficiently gather, organize, analyze, annotate, and share data about potential new drug molecules of interest to their project teams. Herein we describe a suite of integrated services and end-user applications that facilitate these activities throughout the medicinal chemistry design cycle. The Automated Data Presentation (ADP) and Virtual Compound Profiler (VCP) processes automate the gathering, organization, and storage of real and virtual molecules, respectively, and associated data. The Project-Focused Activity and Knowledge Tracker (PFAKT) provides a unified data analysis and collaboration environment, enhancing decision-making, improving team communication, and increasing efficiency.	decision making;drug discovery;integrated services;medicinal chemistry;usb on-the-go;teams	Marian D.

5e8ef203109211bedecf23d56543d0f59da91707	editor's note/chairs' welcome		Welcome to this issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, which will focus on contributions from the research community Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW). This diverse research community explores how different types of social groups affect, and are affected by, information and communication technology. The topics explored by this community can include social media use, crowdsourcing and micro-work, societal effects of computing, and much more. Like many other HCI communities, CSCW approaches these topics with a broad range of scientific techniques, theoretical perspectives and technology platforms.  The call for papers for this issue on CSCW attracted 385 submissions, from Asia, Canada, Australia, Europe, Africa, and the United States. After the first round of reviewing, 207 (54%) papers were invited to the Revise and Resubmit phase. The editorial committee worked hard over August 2017 to arrive at final decisions, with a Virtual Committee meeting held to discuss those papers that needed collective deliberation. In the end, 105 papers (27%) were accepted.  This issue exists because of the dedicated volunteer effort of 101 senior editors who served as Associate Chairs (ACs), and 885 expert reviewers to ensure high quality and insightful reviews for all papers in both rounds. Reviewers and committee members were kept constant for papers that submitted to both rounds. Senior members of the editorial group also helped shepherd some papers, reflecting the deep commitment of this research community.  We are excited by the compelling and thought-provoking work that resulted in this PACMHCI CSCW issue and look forward to equally high quality submissions for the next submission cycle from this research community in the Spring of 2018. For those interested in this area, this group holds their next annual conference November 3-7, 2018 in New York City's Hudson River (Jersey City). That conference will provide many opportunities to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.	computer-supported cooperative work;crowdsourcing;display resolution;hudson;human–computer interaction;social computing;social media	Karrie Karahalios;Geraldine Fitzpatrick;Andrés Monroy-Hernández	2017	PACMHCI	10.1145/3134651	scientific technique;political science;public relations;social computing;computer-supported cooperative work;deliberation;social media;social group;crowdsourcing;information and communications technology	Visualization	-62.18749228254095	-17.31192898256474	19668

This tool was developed in response to the tremendous growth of the TAMU campus network over the last ten years. ND is designed to provide high-level application functionality while retaining the power and flexibility of a low level tool. It integrates remote network device analysis (via SNMP) with network defining databases (via SQL). ND is written in Python [1] and contains custom modules for interaction with SNMP and MySQL [2].	database;high- and low-level;mysql;networking hardware;norsk data;programming tool;python;sql;simple network management protocol	Ellen L.

77e26242f9eb97d75f7634f60a8a058034aa2a5d	open problems column		There have been two polls asking theorists (and others) what they thought of P vs NP (and other questions) [4, 5]. Both were written by William Gasarch and appeared in the Complexity Column of SIGACT News, edited by Lane A. Hemaspaandra. They were in 2002 and 2012. Since William Gasarch is fond of Van der Waerden's theorem, you would think the next poll would be 2022; however, Lane asked if it could be a bit earlier so as to be the 100th issue of his column. So here we are. In the past the questions for the poll appeared in Lane's column. This time they appear here in the Open Problems Column, which makes sense since, well, P vs NP is indeed an open problem.	acm sigact;appear here;p versus np problem	William Gasarch	2018	SIGACT News	10.1145/3232679.3232686		Theory	-60.144292199863216	-19.94710219294029	19776

A traditional packet-based Network IDS (NIDS) is time-intensive as it inspects all packets. A flow-based anomaly detector addresses scalability issues by monitoring only packet headers. This method is capable of detecting unknown attacks in high speed networks. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed in this research to detect anomalies in flow-based traffic. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have the potential to achieve global optimal solution. In this paper, two metaheuristic algorithms, Cuckoo and PSOGSA, are examined to optimize the interconnection weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This optimized MLP is evaluated with two different flow-based data sets. We then compare the performance of these algorithms. The results show that Cuckoo and PSOGSA algorithms enable high accuracy in classifying benign and malicious flows. However, the Cuckoo has lower training time.	algorithm;anomaly detection;artificial neural network;experiment;interconnection;intrusion detection system;mathematical optimization;memory-level parallelism;metaheuristic;multilayer perceptron;network packet;real-time transcription;scalability;sensor;throughput	Zahra Jadidi;Vallipuram Muthukkumarasamy;Elankayer Sithirasenan	2013	2013 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2013.6766043	parallel metaheuristic;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning	Mobile	-40.047439005421325	-15.40824526081356	19941
56cd42350c3542c22ecc69f50ccc7bab241e6687	soft approaches to information retrieval and information access on the web: an introduction to the special topic section	settore inf 01 informatica;information retrieval;information access	World Wide Web is a popular and interactive medium used to collect, disseminate, and access an increasingly huge amount of information, which constitutes the mainstay of the so-called information and knowledge society. Because of its spectacular growth, related to both Web resources (pages, sites, and services) and number of users, the Web is nowadays the main information repository and provides some automatic systems for locating, accessing, and retrieving information. However, an open and crucial question remains: how to provide fast and effective retrieval of the information relevant to specific users' needs. This is a very hard and complex task, since it is pervaded with subjectivity, vagueness, and uncertainty. The expression soft computing refers to techniques and methodologies that work synergistically with the aim of providing flexible information processing tolerant of imprecision, vagueness, partial truth, and approximation. So, soft computing represents a good candidate to design effective systems for information access and retrieval on the Web. One of the most representative tools of soft computing is fuzzy set theory. This special topic section collects research articles witnessing some recent advances in improving the processes of information access and retrieval on the Web by using soft computing tools, and in particular, by using fuzzy sets and/or integrating them with other soft computing tools. In this introductory article, we first review the problem of Web retrieval and the concept of soft computing technology. We then briefly introduce the articles in this section and conclude by highlighting some future research directions that could benefit from the use of soft computing technologies. The explosive growth of the World Wide Web stimulates the development of fast and effective automated systems that support an easy and effective access to the information relevant to specific users' needs (Lawrence & Giles, 1998). Analysis of some characteristics of the Web can help us better understand the problem of information retrieval and information access on the Web, and reasons why its use offers so many opportunities for research: • The Web is an extremely dynamic information source because the information it holds receives constant updates and because it is constantly growing although in a disorganized and uncontrolled way. • The Web presents much redundant and noisy information, and only a small portion of it contains truly relevant or useful information. These are some of the reasons activity aimed at locating information relevant to specific information needs is extremely difficult.

This method employs graph mining and outlier detection. The data has been obtained from a web-based system for input of logic proofs built at FI MU. The data contains a tree structure of the proof and also temporal information about all actions that a student performed, e.g. a node insertion into a proof, or its deletion, drawing or deletion of an edge, or text manipulations. We introduce a new method for multi-level generalization of subgraphs that is useful for characterization of logic proofs. We use this method for feature construction and perform class-based outlier detection on logic proofs represented by these new features. We show that this method helps to find unusual students’ solutions and to improve semi-automatic evaluation of the solutions.	anomaly detection;feature vector;semiconductor industry;structure mining;tree structure;web application	Karel Vaculík;Leona Nezvalová;Lubos Popelínský	2014			theoretical computer science;data mining;mathematics;algorithm	ML	-40.070209987586416	-15.401798066853345	19943

Currently, many 6-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) isotropic parallel manipulators can be developed by numerical or analytical methods. At an isotropic configuration, a manipulator is equidistant from its neighboring singular points. The distance, however, can be very small, so an isotropic design might have relatively smaller singularity-free workspace. This paper presents methods to develop traditional 6-DOF parallel manipulators with better dexterity and larger singularity-free workspace. Some fully symmetric nontraditional designs are then proposed. The evaluation of kinematic properties shows that the fully symmetric designs have very good global dexterity, better rotatability, and relatively larger singularity-free workspace. The manipulators are suitable for some special tasks requiring higher precision, better rotatability, or larger workspace.	workspace	K. Y. Tsai;T. K.

The general, total energy-shaping, formulation of the control technique is considered, which yields a port-Hamiltonian closed-loop system with non-fixed symplectic structure. To construct the proposed Lyapunov function a new systematic mathematical machinery is introduced. The resulting Lyapunov function contains, as particular cases, previous functions obtained for robot manipulators controlled by potential energy-shaping (plus damping injection) schemes. An additional contribution of our work is that, in contrast with most of the existing literature on this topic that is restricted to robot manipulators with only revolute joints, our analysis is applicable to robots with both revolute and prismatic joints. As an illustration example, practical bounds for a two-link direct drive robot manipulator are computed.	hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);interconnection;lyapunov fractal;noise shaping;periodic boundary conditions;robot;symplectic integrator;whole earth 'lectronic link	José Ángel Acosta;Elena Panteley;Romeo Ortega	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5280704	control engineering;electronic engineering;control-lyapunov function;engineering;control theory;lyapunov redesign	Robotics	-40.04222629379514	-15.404893023005748	19945

Usually, a large project is necessary to be divided into various subtasks, as different designers in the colla-borative team have diverse abilities for those separated subtasks. It is very important to allocate specific tasks to those who are good at them. However, the present prior task scheduling method cannot meet the requirements. Enlightened by the animal collectives, we think internal coordination can be an effective scheduling method for a large project. We presented a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate the scheduling of complicated project scheduling, defined some basic mathematical definitions by the CA method, developed the coordination rules, and presented a CA algorithm. Practical scheduling simulations of two design projects are presented. The results show that the internal coordination is possible to achieve the global scheduling. Although the oscillations exist during the coordination, the makespan could be converged quickly. After some evaluations, we found that different rules can lead to distinct scheduling results; also the proposed method is suitable for large-scale project scheduling.	algorithm;automata theory;cellular automaton;logic programming;makespan;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;synergy	Jinghua Wu;Liyi Zhu;Hongxiang Xu	2014	J.

In this paper, we present an automatic cropping technique that accounts for the two primary considerations of people when they crop: removal of distracting content, and enhancement of overall composition. Our approach utilizes a large training set consisting of photos before and after cropping by expert photographers to learn how to evaluate these two factors in a crop. In contrast to the many methods that exist for general assessment of image quality, ours specifically examines differences between the original and cropped photo in solving for the crop parameters. To this end, several novel image features are proposed to model the changes in image content and composition when a crop is applied. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of our method over recent cropping algorithms on a broad range of images.	algorithm;experiment;image quality;test set	Jianzhou Yan;Stephen Lin;Sing Bing Kang;Xiaoou Tang	2013	2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPR.2013.130	computer vision;simulation;image processing;computer science;cropping;multimedia	Vision	-40.089884684301246	-15.373589501375818	19948
83d01ef014122930e861ad22ed10a722e265bf5e	intra- and inter-organizational process mining: discovering processes within and between organizations	process mining	Due to the availability of more and more event data and mature process mining techniques, it has become possible to discover the actual processes within an organization. Process mining techniques use event logs to automatically construct process models that explain the behavior observed. Existing process models can be validated using conformance checking techniques. Moreover, the link between real-life events and model elements allows for the projection of additional information onto process models (e.g., showing bottlenecks and the flow of work within an organization). Although process mining has been mainly used within individual organizations, this new technology can also be applied in cross-organizational settings. In this paper, we identify such settings and highlight some of the challenges and opportunities. In particular, we show that cross-organizational processes can be partitioned along two orthogonal dimensions. This helps us to identify relevant process mining challenges involving multiple organizations.	bottleneck (software);conformance testing;real life	Wil M.

ebc7c9094580858dc5fc6db76e607fc4a90fc800	proceedings second workshop on developments in implicit computational complexity, saarbrücken, dice 2011, germany, april 2nd and 3rd, 2011		This volume contains the proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Developments in Implicit Computational complExity (DICE 2011), which took place on April 2-3 2011 in Saarbruecken, Germany, as a satellite event of the Joint European Conference on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2011. Implicit Computational Complexity aims at studying computational complexity without referring to external measuring conditions or particular machine models, but instead by considering restrictions on programming languages or logical principles implying complexity properties. The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers working on implicit computational complexity, from its logical and semantics aspects to those related to the static analysis of programs, so as to foster their interaction and to give newcomers an overview of the current trends in this area. The first DICE workshop was held in 2010 at ETAPS and published in EPTCS, volume 23 (http://eptcs.org/content.cgi?DICE2010).	computation;computational complexity theory;electronic proceedings in theoretical computer science;european joint conferences on theory and practice of software;programming language;static program analysis	Jean-Yves Marion	2011		10.4204/EPTCS.75	computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;operations research;algorithm	Vision	-40.051011805129605	-15.419584295010287	19950

Therefore, testing is one of the most critical and time-consuming phases of the software development life cycle, which accounts for 50 percent of the total cost of development (Brooks 1995). The testing phase should be planned carefully in order to save time and effort while detecting as many defects as possible. Different verification, validation, and testing strategies have been proposed so far to optimize the time and effort utilized during the testing phase: code reviews (Adrian, Branstad, and Cherniavsky 1982; Shull et al. 2002), inspections (Fagan 1976), and automated tools (Menzies, Greenwald, and Frank 2007; Nagappan, Ball, and Murphy 2006; Ostrand, Weyuker, and Bell 2005). Defect predictors improve the efficiency of the testing phase in addition to helping developers assess the quality and defectproneness of their software product (Fenton and Neil 1999). They also help managers in allocating resources. Most defect prediction models combine well-known methodologies and algorithms such as statistical techniques (Nagappan, Ball, and Murphy 2006; Ostrand, Weyuker, and Bell 2005; Zimmermann et al. 2004) and machine learning (Munson and Khoshgoftaar 1992; Fenton and Neil 1999; Lessmann et al. 2008; Moser, Pedrycz, and Succi 2008). They require historical data in terms of software metrics and actual defect rates, and combine these metrics and defect information as training data to learn which modules seem to be defect prone. Based on the knowledge from training data and software metrics acquired from a recently completed project, such tools can estimate defect-prone modules of that project.

db38ce8f07f8c58265143e553ef499e072d0e5c2	limits of near-coloring of sparse graphs	maximum average degree;improper colorings;colorings	Let a, b, d be non-negative integers. A graph G is (d, a, b)-colorable if its vertex set can be partitioned into a + b sets D1, . . . , Da, O1, . . . , Ob such that the graph G[Di] induced by Di has maximum degree at most d for 1 ≤ i ≤ a, while the graph G[Oj ] induced by Oj is an edgeless graph for 1 ≤ j ≤ b. In this paper, we give two real-valued functions f and g such that any graph with maximum average degree at most f(d, a, b) is (d, a, b)-colorable, and there exist non-(d, a, b)-colorable graphs with average degree at most g(d, a, b). Both these functions converge (from below) to 2a+ b when d tends to infinity. This implies that allowing a color to be d-improper (i.e. of type Di) even for a large degree d increases the maximum average degree that guarantees the existence of a valid coloring only by 1. Using a color of type Di (even with a very large degree d) is somehow less powerful than using two colors of type Oj (two stable sets).	color;converge;degree (graph theory);emoticon;existential quantification;graph coloring;sparse;vertex (graph theory)	Paul Dorbec;Tomás Kaiser;Mickaël Montassier;André Raspaud	2014	Journal of Graph Theory	10.1002/jgt.21731	degeneracy;graph power;strongly regular graph;split graph;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;topology;bipartite graph;perfect graph;degree;regular graph;frequency partition of a graph;edge coloring;cubic graph;graph coloring;mathematics;vertex-transitive graph;biregular graph;quartic graph;complement graph;greedy coloring;line graph;circulant graph	Theory	-40.07205841231005	-15.403784046730712	19952

The new architecture discussed is based on modularity concept and consideration of the shortcomings of traditional kernel, and the operating system kernel is divided into three independent modules - executing module, policy module and monitoring module. Policy module determines the policy of process scheduling separated from traditional kernel. Monitoring module is responsible for monitoring processes, handling system error and detecting of important data. These three modules work independently and communicate with each other by interrupts to ensure the safety of CPU time, important system data structures and user data. As a result, these three independent modules improve the expandability and simplify maintenance of the operating system kernel and enhance the robustness of the system. In this paper, techniques' implementation is given and important data structures are defined. Finally, potential problems of this architecture are also discussed.

In the late 80s and early 90s, Herlihy and Wing proposed linearizability as a correctness condition for concurrent objects, which, once proven, allows us to reason about concurrent objects using pre- and postconditions only. A concurrent object is linearizable if all of its operations appear to take effect instantaneously some time between their invocation and return.  In this article we define simulation-based proof conditions for linearizability and apply them to two concurrent implementations, a lock-free stack and a set with lock-coupling. Similar to other approaches, we employ a theorem prover (here, KIV) to mechanize our proofs. Contrary to other approaches, we also use the prover to mechanically check that our proof obligations actually guarantee linearizability. This check employs the original ideas of Herlihy and Wing of verifying linearizability via possibilities.	automated proof checking;automated theorem proving;correctness (computer science);linearizability;maurice herlihy;non-blocking algorithm;postcondition;simulation;verification and validation	John Derrick;Gerhard Schellhorn;Heike Wehrheim	2011	ACM Trans.

The method includes graphic design (Codes), and an execution platform based on parallel automata (Arts). The design method and the execution platform cooperate, so to win clarity in design and robustness in execution. We place our emphasize on the design stage. We introduce new ideas in graphic design to create a framework for the developer in order to arrange his/her thought. The graphic design was influenced by diagrammatic reasoning researches, and their conclusions. The design is component oriented; it is hierarchically homothetic and uses a minimum number of elements in order to minimize cognitive efforts. It unifies in one sort of diagram, the architectural view and the behavioral view of the system to build. A case study is presented in order to picture the method, and to compare the Arts'Codes method to other related ones.	automata theory;automaton;diagram;real-time computing;real-time locating system	Aryeh Teitelbaum;H.

As with two-point Body-Braille (BB), we now extend one-point BB by introducing a fourth vibration pattern, i.e., a short-duration vibration (referred to as “none”), which yielded a correct answer rate (CAR) of 67%. To improve one-point BB’s CAR, we then consider four sets of vibration patterns. The introduction of vibrations that alternated between 150 and 40 Hz for the “both” vibration enabled our experiment’s participants to identify that pattern more clearly, thereby improving the CAR to 87%, which is equal to that of two-point BB. Based on the experimental findings, we successfully realized one-point BB.		Satoshi Ohtsuka;M.

However, since samples are non-i.i.d., statistical learning results based on the i.i.d. scenarios cannot be utilized to study the risk bounds for Lévy processes. In this paper, we present risk bounds for non-i.i.d. samples drawn from Lévy processes in the PAC-learning framework. In particular, by using a concentration inequality for infinitely divisible distributions, we first prove that the function of risk error is Lipschitz continuous with a high probability, and then by using a specific concentration inequality for Lévy processes, we obtain the risk bounds for non-i.i.d. samples drawn from Lévy processes without Gaussian components. Based on the resulted risk bounds, we analyze the factors that affect the convergence of the risk bounds and then prove the convergence.	infinite divisibility;machine learning;probably approximately correct learning;social inequality;stochastic process	Chao Zhang;Dacheng Tao	2010			mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;lévy process;mathematics;probably approximately correct learning;statistics	ML	-40.04847250270427	-15.408037429198334	19958
3c03844e02cc53a580f474adf0c8828235ca4156	a framework for transformation from conceptual to logical workflow models	conceptual model;workflow pattern;validation;transformation;logical model;business process	Both conceptual and logical workflow models are needed to support business process automation via workflow systems. Conceptual models are normally used to document the generic business process requirements in the company. Logical models are generally used for defining technology specific requirements, where software modules as well as their behavioral patterns should be clearly specified. However, the transformation from conceptual models to logical models can be a tedious task, often causing errors in the resulting logical model. In this paper, we propose a formal approach that can be used to support efficient and accurate model transformation. First, we develop a procedure for transforming a conceptual workflow model into its corresponding logical workflow model. Business requirement analysis, dependency mapping, and workflow pattern-based model transformation are the major components of this transformation procedure. Second, we create a validation procedure that can validate whether the derived logical model is consistent with its original conceptual model. Business process ontologies are employed in our approach to describe both conceptual and logical models. We also implement a prototype system and conduct a demonstrative case study to show the feasibility of our approach.		Shaokun Fan;J.

This method employs three modules: a feature extraction module, a classification module and an optimization module. Feature extraction module extracts electrocardiogram’s spectral and three timing interval features. Non-parametric power spectral density (PSD) estimation methods are used to extract spectral features. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed as a VM enetic algorithm arameter optimization on-parametric PSD estimation methods ultitaper method classifier to recognize the ECG beats. We investigate and compare two such classification approaches. First they are specified experimentally by the trial and error method. In the second technique the approach optimizes the relevant parameters through an intelligent algorithm. These parameters are: Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) kernel parameter and C penalty parameter of SVM classifier. Then their performances in classification of ECG signals are evaluated for eight files obtained from the MIT–BIH arrhythmia database. Classification accuracy of the SVMGA approach proves superior to that of the SVM which has constant and manually extracted parameter.	bounding interval hierarchy;experiment;feature extraction;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;memetic algorithm;performance;radial (radio);radial basis function;spectral density;support vector machine	Ali Khazaee;Ataollah Ebrahimzadeh	2010	Biomed.

While this increases DTW's runway capacity, the airport is served by an airspace (routes, procedures, and controller assignments) that was designed only for a three-runway airport. To increase the airport's effective capacity, the Detroit-area Terminal Radar Approach Control facility (D21 TRACON) and nearby Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) are redesigning their airspace. This paper describes the simulation modeling effort to estimate delay and cost benefits of the ARTCC redesign for arrival traffic. The model, written in the SLX simulation language, represents miles-in-trail (MIT) restrictions, as well as air traffic controllers' ability to direct flights to different paths dynamically, based on predicted demand downstream. The redesign work is part of the Federal Aviation Administration's Midwest Airspace Capacity Enhancement (MACE) project.	delay calculation;downstream (software development);simulation language;wayne ratliff	Justin Boesel;David J.

A method is described in which a simple stochastic cellular automaton is used to produce fictitious fractal data at arbitrarily many spatial points such that the resulting pattern mimics the morphological features of the actual pattern. The method is simple to implement, preserves all the existing data, has no adjustable parameters, and can be used to fill in regions of arbitrary size and shape, even outside the region for which data are available. Furthermore, it reduces to more conventional interpolation methods when only a few isolated data points are missing. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

a95df1b64d818d4e346fead06cfe3f4161f35ec2	phonological features, auditory objects, and illusions	edge enhancement;speech perception;visual perception	It is argued that speech perception, just like visual perception, relies on a good match between memorized experience and current sensation: when sensation meshes with expectations, listeners believe they perceive ‘real’ linguistic objects in spite of possibly severe variation and degradation in the acoustic signal. Reviews of the acoustic and perceptual correlates of the features [nasal] and [voice] in various speech styles illustrate how multiple perceptual cues to a simple phonological distinction may be dispersed across syllables, and how absence of one or several such cues may be compensated by the presence of others, or by recovery processes that rely on listeners’ knowledge and expectations. Visual illusions are discussed which have apparent parallels with auditory illusions and with well-known aspects of speech perception. These include particular types of physical structure (e.g. abrupt changes, edges), enhancement of properties of a given object by juxtaposed information which either changes the percept of those properties, or else provides a context that changes the percept of what the object is, and influences of familiarity and probability which can be profound enough to fly in the face of contrary sensory evidence. These data are used to support the hypothesis that perceived linguistic units, including distinctive features, are ephemeral (and illusory) ‘auditory objects’, which are created by the listening brain using domain-general processes that underpin meaningful behaviour. r 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2010.08.115 ⇑ Corresponding author at: Department of Informa Brunel University, UK. Tel.: +44 1895 266023; fax: +4 E-mail address: Sherry.Chen@brunel.ac.uk (S.Y. Ch Wrapper feature selection approaches are widely used to choose a small subset of relevant features from a dataset. However, Wrappers suffer from the fact that they only use a single classifier. The downside to this is that each classifier will have its own biases and will therefore select very different features. To overcome the biases of individual classifiers, we propose a new data mining method called Wrapperbased Decision Trees (WDT). The WDT method uses multiple classifiers for selecting relevant features and decision trees to visualize relationships among the selected features. We use the WDT to investigate the influences of the levels of computer experience on users’ preferences for the design of search engines. The benefit of using WDT lies within the fact that it can uncover the most accurate set of relevant features to help differentiate the preferences of users with diverse levels of computer experience. The results indicate that the users with varied levels of computer experiences have different preferences regarding the following features: the number of icons, the arrangement of search results, and the presentation of error messages. Such findings can be used to develop personalized search engines to accommodate users’ different levels of computer experience. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Facing with patients symptoms, experienced caregivers make right medical decisions based on their professional knowledge that accurately grasps relationships between symptoms, diagnosis and corresponding treatments. In this paper, we aim to capture these relationships by constructing a big and high-quality heterogenous graph linking patients, diseases, and drugs (PDD) in EMRs. Specifically, we propose a novel framework to extract important medical entities from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) and automatically link them with the existing biomedical knowledge graphs, including ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank. The PDD graph presented in this paper is accessible on the Web via the SPARQL endpoint, and provides a pathway for medical discovery and applications, such as effective treatment recommendations.	bridging (networking);cloud computing;communication endpoint;data access;data mart;drugbank;entity linking;environmental niche modelling;gene regulatory network;knowledge graph;linked data;mimic;personalization;sparql;world wide web	Meng Wang;Jiaheng Zhang;Jun Liu;Wei Hu;Sen Wang;Xue Li;Wenqiang Liu	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68204-4_23	medical record;database;data mining;linked data;computer science;sparql;entity linking;bridging (networking);drugbank;graph	ML	-40.671889891975056	2.4581382956483693	20008

To the reviewer's knowledge, this is the first book covering the subject of barcode technology usage for mobile devices, although there was a growing interest of research and development community for these topics from the mid 1990's till today. The book is organized as follows: the introductory chapter provides an overview of barcode technology, while the next one describes the technology evolution, with history outlines, given barcode systems, and emerging technologies that affected the development of barcodes. Chapter 3 presents two-dimensional barcode symbologies used on mobile phones, like QR Code, Data Matrix, etc. Chapter 3 provides a driver for evolution of barcode applications, presenting 2D barcode as a tool for ubiquitous computing, while chapter 4 describes the mechanisms for providing barcode robustness, like error detection and/or correction techniques, data arrangement and symbol structuring techniques. Chapters 6 and 7 provide the development and evaluation of a prototype color 2D barcode, based on Mobile Multi-Color Composite (MMCC) encoding algorithm. Finally, there is also a color plate section that can be found between pp. 182 and 183, necessary for showing and analyzing the colored barcodes. This is practically a """" cookbook """" for developers of new and improved barcodes, providing a step-by-step lessons how to shape a 2D symbology, design a finder pattern, come-up with an algorithm for encoding data, and how to evaluate the whole design, by measuring the first-read rates (FRR), peak-to-signal ration (PTSR), etc. It provides a necessary in-depth on signal processing and image analysis, while leading the reader towards the final goal – the development of a new or improved 2D barcode. What every system developer, telecom software engineer and computer scientist dealing with barcodes for mobile devices may also find useful in this book is its appendices. Along with the barcode applications and history timeline given, the appendices provide data capacity and error correction capability values for"""	algorithm;ampersand;barcode system;computer scientist;error detection and correction;image analysis;mobile device;mobile multi-coloured composite;mobile phone;os-tan;prototype;qr code;signal processing;software engineer;timeline;ubiquitous computing	Hrvoje Belani	2011	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/1968587.1968593	unified modeling language;embedded system;simple api for xml;computer science;operating system;class diagram;mobile device;database;programming language;software metric	HCI	-51.59740170926561	1.3645552648320927	20235

Workshop attendees included representatives from the visual analytics research community across government, industry and academia. The goal of the workshop, and the resulting papers, was to reflect on the first 5 years of the visual analytics enterprise and propose research challenges for the next 5 years. The paper incorporates input from workshop attendees as well as from its authors. Abstract The authors provide a description of the transition process for visual analytic tools and contrast this with the transition process for more traditional software tools. This paper takes this difference into account and describes a user-oriented approach to technology transition including a discussion of key factors that should be considered and adapted to each situation. The progress made in transitioning visual analytic tools in the past 5 years is described and challenges that remain are enumerated.	visual analytics	Jean Scholtz;Kristin A. Cook;Mark A.

82cb9db490b821370112d5123c9de5fefed15cf2	towards cross-domain data analytics in tourism: a linked data based approach	visual dashboard;statistical data;linked data;information integration;data analytics	The complexity of the social, political and economical settings in which tourism enterprises operate, increasingly require them to perform data analytics tasks that rely on data from various domains (e.g., economy, environmental sustainability). A survey of tourism practitioners performed in this study showed that although such cross-domain analytics are important, they are primarily performed by relying on manual data collection and aggregation, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. This paper investigates the suitability of Linked Data technologies to support data aggregation tasks needed for establishing such complex analytics systems. To that end, a prototypical implementation is developed that relies on Linked Data as a technological platform for integrating data from three major tourism data sources: TourMIS, World Bank and Eurostat. Enabled by this integrated data, the ETIHQ Dashboard for data analytics was implemented, the first visual data analytics system that supports cross-domain analytics over tourism, economic and sustainability indicators. An exploratory evaluation performed with practitioners shows that this Linked Data enabled system could potentially bring important improvements in terms of execution times and answer quality when compared to current manual approaches typically used by tourism practitioners in daily practice.	algorithm;asynchronous array of simple processors;big data;cognitive dimensions of notations;dashboard;data aggregation;hoc (programming language);linked data;molecular dynamics;prototype;scalability;unstructured grid;usability;visual analytics	Marta Sabou;Irem Onder;Adrian M.

It is a user-driven web-based applicationtool. Currently, CSEO provides an integratedenvironment for multi-scale modeling of complex reactingsystems. A unique feature of CSEO is in its frameworkthat allows data to flow from one application to anotherin a transparent manner. A particular example isdemonstrated to show how results from fundamentalquantum chemistry simulations are used to calculatethermodynamic and kinetic properties of a chemicalreaction, which subsequently are used in the simulation ofa combustion reactor. Advantages, disadvantages, andfuture prospects of a web-based simulation approach arethen discussed.

It applies to a system described in a previous paper [1]. We continue to update the hardware and the software for this system because it is has proven to be a very successful platform on which we base the laboratory experience for our students. The mechanical and electromechanical hardware for the lab has remained nearly the same for well over a decade, but is still a reflection of modern hardware used in industry. It utilizes a brushless servo motor, a transmission element with mechanical compliance, high resolution optical encoders, and a motor controller with a current control loop. The latest update is mainly comprised of changing the controller to a micro-controller based system and a graphical user interface (GUI) written in MATLAB. The microcontroller is a 32 bit ARM based system with a floating point coprocessor and all the peripherals needed to implement the controller, including a full speed USB interface. This latest generation of the system is the least expensive, the most efficiently connected to MATLAB, the easiest to use and the most reliable in terms of both hardware and of software.	32-bit;arm architecture;color gradient;computer-aided design;control system;coprocessor;encoder;experience;experiment;graphical user interface;matlab;mit engineering systems division;microcontroller;peripheral;robustness (computer science);servo;usb;wiring diagram	Dale Schinstock;Sydney Schinstock;Warren N.

On April 1971, a workshop on System Performance Evaluation was held at Harvard University. Richard Muntz was the chairman of the session """"Queueing Theoretic Models"""". In that session, Jeffrey Buzen presented """"Analysis of system bottlenecks using a queueing network model"""". In the 70s, some groups were founded to work on the computer performance modeling. The National Bureau of Standards organized several task groups and the Computer Performance Evaluation Users Group collected people """"from many United States Governmental agencies involved in various phases of this field -- a number of academicians as well as analysts from business and industry working in this area, and this gave rise to the formation within the ACM of SIGME [Special Interest Group in Measurement and Evaluation] which is currently known as SIGMETRICS."""" In 1973 the International Federation for Information Processing founded the Working Group 7.3 Computer System Modelling and its International Symposium on Computer Performance Modeling, Measurement, and Evaluation started to take place. More difficult is to go back to the first courses in general Performance modeling and prediction. Definitely, in the 80s the PM area reached its peak and relative courses were taught in some universities for some decades. In the first years of 2000, some of these general PM courses started to disappear while specific contents still remained in courses relative to applications as """"tools"""" for that particular area. A question naturally arises: is it no more time to teach the modelling principles and basic methodologies? Is it time to just use the techniques in specific domains? The author has not sure answers, but some doubts. Starting from a close examination of the state of the art of PM courses in the main Universities, we try to give some food for thought about the role of the education, the meaning of knowledge and information, their difference and the importance of criticism to face with incoming changing challenges."""	bottleneck (software);computer performance;international federation for information processing;linc;network model;performance evaluation;performance prediction;profiling (computer programming);queueing theory	Vittoria de Nitto Persone	2017		10.1145/3053600.3053641	simulation;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;object-modeling technique;operations research	Arch	-58.68107877402029	-18.460882001591393	21038

As a consequence, it is of utmost importance to carefully monitor the driving forces enforced by applications and services to forecast some possible futures for the current Internet. We support, with some examples, the claim that the network is going to provide a service similar as the one provided by a (Distributed) Database, thus, enabling an efficient """"Publish and Subscribe"""" (PubSub) service model. The search activity will provide a mean for competition and architecture for participation where various types of content can be disseminated at different scales. In this paper, we first support our claim with a simple review of the relevant state of the art illustrated from areas such as Information Retrieval (IR), Information Filtering (IF) and Content-based Networking (CBN), to highlight similar concerns and contributions. The problem space being very broad, we then formalize the problem in order to emphasize the main challenges to be addressed and provide a preliminary insight into potential solutions. One original contribution of this work is to take advantage of the large information en route in the network to support the PubSub service.

In near future, all of medical data will be stored to database server, and complete paper-less and film-less system in hospitals will become reality. These stored data, however, is not used effectively for analysis because of the great deal of data and its variety image, numerical, text data and so on. Previously, knowledge discovery methods from numerical medical database were studied widely. Text mining method for medical data, however, has not been enough discussed. This study discusses knowledge discovery method from Electronic Medical Records using SOM and its possibility. As the first step of this research, this paper describes the outline of keyword extraction method using morphological analysis and generation of keyword map from Incident Report.	database server;keyword extraction;numerical analysis;organizing (structure);server (computing);text corpus;text mining	Yoshihiro Otani;Hiroharu Kawanaka;Tomohiro Yoshikawa;Koji Yamamoto;Tsuyoshi Shinogi;Shinji Tsuruoka	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571281	text mining;database server;self-organizing map;morphological analysis;computer science;data science;data mining;information technology;information retrieval;medical record	Robotics	-40.088969388552634	-5.872308044521443	21181

It contains 20 papers co-authored by 69 international researchers, developers, and users of cytogenetic automation. Topics covered include automatic chromosome aberration scoring, karyotyping systems, flow cytogenetics, automatic preparation of cytogenetic specimens, automatic chromosome segmentation, and chromosome classification. Only one paper by J. Piper et al., entitled ‘Towards a knowledge-based chromosome analysis system’, may be considered in the spirit of medical AI. The authors review the problems of chromosome analysis built in the conventional pattern recognition and image processing paradigm, and point to the knowledge-based system approach. They propose such a system in some detail in the context of a black-board system shell, written in POP-11 in the PROLOG environment which also allows easy access to C and any other compilable code. In addition, the book contains an extensive bibliography (about 250 entries) on the topics listed above, covering publications from 1975 to 1988. It is an excellent demonstration of how the computing and knowledge-based machinery is entering the cytogenetic laboratory and can be recommended to all lab researchers interested in the subiect.

This improved topology rule system is built over the spatial extension Jaspa. Both projects are open source, freely available software developed by the corresponding author of this paper.#R##N##R##N#Currently, there is no spatial DBMS that implements a rule-based topology engine (considering that the topology rules are designed and performed in the spatial backend). If the topology rules are applied in the frontend (as in many GIS desktop programs), ArcGIS is the most advanced solution. The system presented in this paper has several major advantages over the ArcGIS approach: it can be extended with new topology rules, it has a much wider set of rules, and it can mix feature attributes with topology rules as filters. In addition, the topology rule system can work with various DBMSs, including PostgreSQL, H2 or Oracle, and the logic is performed in the spatial backend.#R##N##R##N#The proposed topology system allows users to check the complex spatial relationships among features (from one or several spatial layers) that require some complex cartographic datasets, such as the data specifications proposed by INSPIRE in Europe and the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) for Cadastral data.	spatial database	Jose Martinez-Llario;Eloina Coll;M.

Recent studies have shown an increase in collaborative data generation and reuse. However, further improvements require a deeper understanding of the social and technological circumstances under which they emerge. To that effect we conduct in-situ observation study of a Nano-photonics Research Centre. We consider the artifact ecology that evolved from the Centre's common experimentation and data platform, the scientific practices, and the intricate interactions with digital artifacts that arise from the researchers' activities. We uncover the use of progress summaries for collaborative data interpretation and knowledge sharing. By studying this reputable collaborative scientific environment we (1) identified the factors that led to its functional and effective artifact ecology and (2) propose expansions of tools and services to improve it further. The latter include effective support for contextual search, browsing, and flexible viewing of information artifacts based on relevant parameters and properties.	artifact (software development);data access;digital artifact;ecology;gnu nano;interaction;linker (computing);scientific literature;software documentation	Gerard Oleksik;Natasa Milic-Frayling;Rachel M Jones	2012		10.1145/2145204.2145376	data access;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;data science;data mining;information management;data analysis;world wide web;observational study;statistics	HCI	-44.58808482858087	-1.0650568897969799	21394

Two principles are presented as paramount in the provision of information services: (1) easy accessibility to the information files by users unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value of service exceeding user costs. These principles serve as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. The main features of the information system are direct user access via online teletypewriter console, direct user access to all details of the system organization, unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, user access through many facets of document indexing, and stochastic search through linked index terms and other file relationships. The first contribution to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, relating primarily to early research on compilers. These documents have been cataloged and indexed and the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews. The indexing system is described in detail. The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents, and inverted lists are provided by the Repository system for retrieval by concept coordination.	accessibility;compiler;information system;stochastic optimization;vocabulary	Morris Rubinoff;John F.

(Due to the importance of this book as a source for readings in Computers and Society issues, we have included two reviews.-Ed.) In this collection of reprinted essays the editors seek to introduce and popularize some controversial social implications of computer technologies. They bring into one book the major writings on the points addressed and include extensive references and bibliographies for fimher reading. While not light reading, the spirit of the book is reflected in the editors' statement, """"We see computer systems not only as powerful technology, but also as a powerful factor in social change."""" General purpose readers of this sort are difficult to edit, and they are also difficult to review. This is because of several factors. First, there is the evaluation of the coverage. What topics are included, and which are overlooked? Can such a book, in fact, cover every important topic? Second, there are some four or five dozen authors represented in this collection. Clearly the writing style of each cannot be the same as the others. How do they work together? The content coverage of a reader is important. Dunlop and Kling admit in their preface that they could not cover every topic. For example, they kindly defer to Computers in Battle: Will They Work? (edited by D. Brace, Jovanovich) for a discussion of how high technology affects modem warfare. But what are the topics they do address? In order of quantity of coverage, they are: Computerization and the transformation of work (140 pages); Security and reliability (130 pages); Social control and privacy (114 pages); Economic and organizational dimensions of computerization (98 pages); Ethical perspectives and processional responsibilities (89 pages); Social relationships in electronic communities (88 pages); The dreams of technological utopianism (70 pages). Each topic is introduced by a short essay from the editors, suggestions for further reading, and, often, references and bibliography. Each reprint properly includes its full footnoting and references as well. The index is 15 pages long and is thorough and well designed. And what a collection of articles we have.

With the changes of people's needs, only some old GIS software could not meet the needs of the market[1]. To meet the growing needs, the GIS secondary development came into being. A large number of experts and scholars began to study it by using computer technology. Many kinds of GIS secondary developed software have emerged in an endless stream. Most of them used component development techniques for efficient seamless system integration and plug-in development techniques for improving maintainability of code. But these two developed mechanisms have some problems[2-6]. This paper introduces the design and the implementation of a Soil Potentialities Assessment System that is compatible with GIS, which uses the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) library to solve some of the shortcomings of the old GIS software development methods and to build up an extensible structure to adapt to the changes of system requirements.	computer;geographic information system;managed extensibility framework;plug-in (computing);requirement;seamless3d;software development;system integration;system requirements	Linwei Li;Jiaying Chen;Haitao Zhang;Xuefei Li;Peihong Fu	2013	2013 21st International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626126	distributed gis;enterprise gis;simulation;systems engineering;engineering;gis and public health;am/fm/gis	SE	-39.790366013050146	-2.2603874002358593	21583

To achieve this goal, many sources of data are processed in one coherent vector space: the advertisers’ and publisher’s web site content, sessions of former users from the past, the history of clicks on banners and the current user behavior as well as the advertising policy promoting certain campaigns. The multi-agent system running mostly on the publisher site is introduced to organize personalized advertising. Each cooperating agent is responsible for a separate, specific task: web content and usage mining, click-through data exploration, user monitoring, advertisement recommendation and management.	agent architecture;coherence (physics);data mining;display advertising;e-commerce;hyperlink;multi-agent system;online advertising;personalization;prototype;scalability;scheduling (computing);web content	Przemyslaw Kazienko	2005		10.1007/11552451_68	online advertising;web analytics;native advertising;engineering;advertising;internet privacy;world wide web;contextual advertising	ML	-41.63998660801937	-23.63237399610528	22118

f7fd62cdcbfbca1e48f257a21f64d4038f4de3a0	large databases for remote sensing and gis	remote sensing	The utilization of remotely sensed data from aircraft and satellites have evolved over the years. Broadly, the steps involve image analysis. mapping. co-registration with other spatial and aspatial data sources and information extraction for decision support systems. InitialIy, each of these steps were independent activities. involving manual manipulation of analog data. However, with the advent of electronic imaging sensors, digital data has become available and the analysis. mapping, registration and information extraction can be done on computers. Computerization has been given a fillip by the complex demands of decision support system which need the handling of a wide variety of spatial and aspatial data sowces. For example, the current demands of sustainable development requires the analysis of imagery, maps, demographic data, anecdotal information, etc. using complex models. To meet these requirements, we need versatile data bases which can efficiently handle a plethora of data types with varying formats. The problem can be subdivided into two major areas. The first relates to remotely sensed data itself and the second to all other data such as maps, statistics, text, images etc.	computer;database;decision support system;digital data;geographic information system;image analysis;information extraction;map;requirement;sensor	A.

Introduction Recently, the 50th anniversary of the birth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been celebrated worldwide [1–4], and about 65 years ago (1943) its foundational works on Biocybernetics and Bionics were published due to movements led by McCulloch and Pitts [5] and Wiener [6]. Since then, a part of the scientific community has been interested in looking to Biology from Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Computation with a double proposal. On the one hand, there has been search for inspiration on new concepts and mechanisms of interest in Engineering and Computation giving rise to Bionics in first place, and currently to the ''bio-inspired'' movement. On the other hand, the concepts and techniques proper of Physics, Engineering and Calculus are used to help neuroscientists to understand the functioning of biological systems, giving rise to Biocybernetics first and more recently to Computational Neuroscience, which includes Neurodynamics for the neuronal level, and to the techniques of representation and knowledge usage, proper of AI, for the cognitive level. This ''50 Years of Artificial Intelligence: Campus Multidisciplinary in Perception and Intelligence'' special issue collects a subset of the best papers in the fields of Neurocomputing, presented at the Campus Multidisciplin-resulted in a forum for scientists in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of Artificial Intelligence, which successfully reported recent research advances of AI and where the participants exchanged knowledge in close relation to the state-of-the-art of Perception and Intelligence. We want to highlight the multidisciplinar character of the CMPI-2006 encounter. Multidisciplinarity is a non-integrative mixture of disciplines in which each discipline retains its methodologies and assumptions without change or development from other disciplines within the multidisciplinary relationship. Precisely, neural computing is a multidisciplinary field that attracts psychologists, physicists , computer scientists, neuroscientists, and AI investigators , among others. The success of the conference is directly related to the excellent results of AI research in Spain and other Spanish speaking countries. In this special issue revised and extended versions of works previously presented at CMPI-2006 and essentially related to the sensorial functions (of the visual and auditory pathway) and the tasks of character recognition and selective visual attention (SVA) are included. 2.

The Spider Map is a particular schematic representation to illustrate all travel possibilities from a given geographical location. Recently the Spider Map interaction and generation process automation have been studied, although there are yet different possibilities to explore in the technological approach and interactive solution fields. This research proposes the Cobweb solution, dissecting the components of an Interactive Spider Map, focusing on the interactive dynamic potential, the ways to represent information, challenging the existing standard. An implementation of this solution is evaluated using carefully designed user tests to validate the design decisions, taking into consideration different interaction alternatives for each phase of the map generation. The results show improvements regarding the traditional alternative, with positive user response, valuing highly context awareness and information features.	baseline (configuration management);context awareness;interactivity;location (geography);map;point of interest;schematic	Francisco Maciel;Teresa Galvão	2016	2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795551	simulation;engineering;operations management;operations research	Robotics	-37.48104315806537	-23.3756023071893	22465

This special issue deals with the intersection of big media data and it needs for exploiting elastic cloud computing services for efficiently processing and analysing such big data to support emerging media-optimised applications. Big data and cloud computing are big news around the world. For example, studies by CISCO [1] and IBM [2] foundwe now generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. According to IDC [3], the data universe is set to explode to 40 yottabytes by 2020— 5,200 gigabytes for every person on earth. Together with the rapidly increasing volume of data being generated, opportunities for analysing such data to distil knowledge that can help solve problems that benefit individuals, the industry and government, and our entire society presents a monumental technical challenge. This special issue focuses on a major and less exploited segment of big data: multimedia content.

The vendor’s documentation of the log format is an important part of the specification for any log consumer. As a specification, it is subject to improvement using formal specification techniques. This work presents a methodology for formalizing and refining the description of an audit log to improve robustness and semantic accuracy of programs that use the log. Ideally applied during design of a new format, the methodology is also profitably applied to existing log formats. Its application to Solaris BSM (an existing, commercial format) demonstrated utility by detecting ambiguities or errors of several types in the documentation or implementation of BSM logging, and identifying opportunities to improve the content of the logs. The products of this work are the methodology itself for use in refining other log formats and their consumers, and an annotated, machine-readable grammar for Solaris BSM that can be used by the community to quickly construct applications that consume BSM logs.	documentation;formal specification;human-readable medium;intrusion detection system;openbsm;sensor	Joachim Biskup	2000		10.1007/3-540-39945-3	information theory;theoretical computer science;data mining;information system;intrusion detection system;data structure;computer science	SE	-35.15172600281147	-8.102160628711868	22650

9483c889487700c4694372d9bc341272cefdb450	the origins of traffic theory	decision analysis driver behavior in traffic flow organizational studies performance and improvement of traffic systems professional comments on	W this biblical beginning, I started a paper in 1974 reviewing the development of traffic control theories. I think it is appropriate to start the present paper the same way. Traffic problems existed, to some extent, even before the Ford, which ushered the age of universal automobile transportation. But the problems were relatively small and isolated, and did not provoke much thought for their solution. The automobile changed all that in a big way, and by the middle of the 20th century traffic problems were big and commanding much attention. By 1950, scientists from many walks of life came forward with attempts to model the movement of traffic, with the ultimate goal of finding amelioration to traffic problems. Some of the early contributions to traffic modeling were those of Reuschel (1950) and Pipes (1953), on one hand, and Lighthill and Whitham (1955), on the other. Reuschel and Pipes proposed a traffic model describing the detailed movement of cars proceeding close together in a single lane, a “microscopic” model of traffic. Lighthill, a world renowned fluid mechanics theorist, together with Whitham, proposed a “macroscopic” model of traffic, modeling traffic as a continuum akin to a fluid. The Lighthill-Whitham (L-W) model is based on two premises, the conservation of the number of cars and the existence of an equation of state describing a relationship between traffic flow, measured in cars per hour, and traffic density, measured in cars per mile. The conservation of cars is, of course, a rational assumption. The existence of an equation of state is partially verified by measurements, with much scatter observed in the data, particularly at high traffic densities. Nevertheless, the L-W model provides a pretty good description of some basic phenomena in traffic, such as the propagation of “shock waves” which are generated when traffic shifts from one steady-state pattern to another associated with different density and flow. The shock wave theory of L-W is, however, only good in describing density changes that are separated relatively widely in time, i.e., transitions from one steady-state traffic flow situation to another. Attempts to use the L-W wave theory to describe detailed movement of traffic around intersections have been badly misguided, because the time of the generation of one shock wave is of the same order as the time of transition to the next, and the inherent approximation of the shock wave produces large errors in the modeling of the movement of traffic. The Reuschel and Pipes models described the movement of a car following another one in front. They were based on the assumption that the speed of the following car was a linear function of the distance between the lead car and the following car. The models were reasonable in concept, but no experimental verification of their conclusions was pursued for many years. By the mid-1950s, traffic models had attracted the attention of such notable scientists as Elliott Montroll. Then, in 1956, a confluence of events spurred a rapid development of traffic theory. General Motors hired a new executive in charge of its Research Laboratories. He was Larry Hafstad, a nuclear physicist by background, who had the ambition of making the General Motors Research Labs a leader in “basic science” and not just a development lab as it had been for years. One of the persons hired to bring about this change was Robert Herman. Herman teamed up with Montroll and pursued some basic investigations of carfollowing which have stood the test of time to this day. I was hired into the Basic Science department of GM Research in 1957 by Bob Herman. My original assignment had nothing to do with traffic. Herman, in his unrivaled spirit of pursuit of knowledge in every meaningful direction, turned me loose around the Lab to see how I could apply my knowledge of applied mechanics to the modeling and improvement of devices and processes useful to the automobile industry, such as the production of better ball bearings through better understanding of contact stresses between the balls and their casing. However, it was not long before I was attracted to the traffic modeling activities, which ended up keeping me busy for a good part of my life for years to come. Let me take a moment to stress the influence of corporate management on the research output of an organization. I joined GM Research at the advice and recommendation of my Columbia University Ph.D. mentor, Professor Ray Mindlin.

To support users in the hard task of deciding which Big Data solution is the most appropriate according to their specific requirements, we propose a generic architecture to classify analytical approaches. We also establish a classification of the existing query languages, based on the facilities provided to access the Big Data architectures. Moreover, to evaluate different solutions, we propose a set of criteria of comparison, such as OLAP support, scalability, and fault tolerance support. We classify different existing Big Data analytics solutions according to our proposed generic architecture and qualitatively evaluate them in terms of the criteria of comparison. We illustrate how our proposed generic architecture can be used to decide which Big Data analytic approach is suitable in the context of several use cases.	apache hadoop;apache hive;apache kylin;big data;bigquery;business requirements;cloud computing;computer data storage;data model;database;decision support system;declarative programming;druid;fault tolerance;graph database;hoc (programming language);in-memory database;json;mapreduce;mesa;meteor;microsoft azure;nosql;online analytical processing;platform as a service;programming language;query language;redshift;requirement;sap hana;sql;scalability	Yudith Cardinale;Sonia Guehis;Marta Rukoz	2017		10.5220/0006437801510162	data mining;computer science;big data	DB	-34.032556370166475	0.38395998875022697	22752

The decentralized and agent oriented architecture mirrors emerging trends such as upcoming mobile and decentralized social networking as a new paradigm in social computing and is targetted to satisfy broader and more subtly interlinked information demands beyond immediate information needs which can be readily satisfied with current IR services. We briefly discuss why using spatio-temporal references as primary information criterion implicitly conserves other relations and is thus suitable for such an architecture. We finally shortly point to results from a large evaluation study using Wikipedia articles.	distributed social network;information needs;information retrieval;programming paradigm;semantic similarity;social computing;wikipedia	Georg Groh;Florian Straub;Andreas Donaubauer;Benjamin Koster	2011	CoRR		information needs;semantic similarity;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;social computing;social network;satisfiability	Web+IR	-46.79588083011493	2.309595871302656	22863

Difficulties frequently arise in sharing data because each community, and sometimes each scientist, has their own conventions for structuring the data. This results in a data schema that is incompatible with the other scientific communities working on the investigation. The paper presents VANILLA, a generalized data schema developed to address these issues, whose prototype shares data among the varied communities of forest canopy science. VANILLA uses techniques from semantic and dimensional databases in a federated approach to manage the sociological and technological issues in scientific data integration. All data is organized according to a thesaurus so that new data schemas can be rapidly built incorporating terminology and semantics of new scientific domains or methods. This data schema has been successfully used to store and analyze micro meteorological forest data and stem map data.	data model;dynamic data	Karla Massey;Larry Kerschberg;George Michaels	1997		10.1109/SSDM.1997.621163	data modeling;tree canopy;dynamic data;data structure;computer science;technology management;data warehouse;data mining;database;atmosphere;prototype;federated architecture;database schema;information retrieval;data	DB	-37.53933608333669	-1.7627670749928634	23041

It is pointed out that, to achieve fully integrated systems which are seamless and have a uniform occurrence of data and ways to process the data, it is essential that the semantics of components be identified and captured in advance. The semantics of a VIPS are identified in terms of data, processes, and knowledge. The system should have the features of handling large and heterogeneous knowledge bases, the ability to integrate knowledge and data, and a generic knowledge representation scheme. The basic system architecture to meet these features is discussed. u003e	image processing	Ching-Yi Wang;Dongwoo Lee	1990			integrable system;computer vision;knowledge base;productivity;data processing;machine vision;image processing;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;computer-integrated manufacturing;information management	Robotics	-33.847522905241114	-4.6406908200421695	23048

For that, Agent Technology can provide better healthcare than the traditional medical system. In the hospital, several types of medical problems can be solved by agents. As examples of problems, which emerge in the hospital, we mention: collaboration between hospital wards, elaborations of diagnostics, the collection of information about patients etc. The adaptation of cooperative Multi Agent System (MAS) can solve these problems.

d9106c85b18c5ee2d97dcfb688335d4091a14b8c	on the use of information and infrastructure technologies for the smart city research in europe: a survey		The Smart City paradigm has become one of the most important research topics around the globe. Particularly in Europe, it is considered as a solution for the unstoppable increase of high density urban environments and the European Commission has included the Smart City research as one of the key objectives for the FP7 (Seventh Framework Program) and H2020 (Horizon 2020) research initiatives. As a result, a considerable amount of quality research, with particular emphasis on information and communication technologies, has been produced. In this paper, we review the current efforts dedicated in Europe to this research topic. Particular attention is paid in the review to the platforms and infrastructure technologies adopted to introduce the Internet of Things into the city, taking into account the constraints and harshness of urban environments. Furthermore, this paper also considers the efforts in the experimental perspective, which includes the review of existing Smart City testbeds, part of wider European initiatives such as FIRE (Future Internet Research and Experimentation) and FIWARE. Last but not least, the main efforts in providing interoperability between the different experimental facilities are also presented. key words: Internet of things, Smart City, Horizon 2020, 7th Framework Program, FIWARE, FIRE	future internet;internet of things;internet research;interoperability;programming paradigm;smart city	Juan Ramón Santana;Martino Maggio;Roberto Di Bernardo;Pablo Sotres;Luis Sánchez;Luis Muñoz	2018	IEICE Transactions		smart city;computer network;telecommunications;interoperability;computer security;european union;computer science;information and communications technology;internet of things	HCI	-62.05960626545874	2.1325697549400147	23238

With the fast growth of Internet applications such as online social networks, more user information becomes available to the attackers, which allows them to construct new contextual information. This gives rise to new challenges for user privacy protection and often requires improvements on the existing privacypreserving methods. In this paper, we classify contextual information related to LBS query privacy and focus on two types of contexts—user prof iles and query dependency: user profiles have not been deeply studied in LBS query privacy protection, while we are the first to show the impact of query dependency on users’ query privacy. More specifically, we present a general framework to enable the attackers to compute a distribution on users with respect to issuing an observed request. The framework can model attackers with different contextual information. We take user profiles and query dependency as examples to illustrate the implementation of the framework and their impact on users’ query privacy. Our framework subsequently allows us to show the insufficiency of existing query privacy metrics, e.g., k-anonymity, and propose several new metrics. In the end, we develop new generalisation algorithms to compute regions satisfying users’ privacy requirements This article is a revised and extended version of our two conference papers [7, 8].

8219605329da87f3d68a6d182ff64082e88408c6	um estudo comparativo entre algoritmos de proteção da privacidade aplicado à bases de dados na área de saúde		The growing increase in the volume of data which is collected, stored and shared by health institutions creates benefits for the process of decision making based on the knowledge obtained from applying data analysis and data mining techniques, aiming to achieve relevant information. Despite the obtained benefits, sharing this specific kind of data in its original raw format may compromise patients’ privacy. In an attempt to validate solutions for this problem, this article considers and compares data anonymization and perturbation techniques, assessing their efficiency in providing privacy and safety of shared data, more specifically, when applied to databases of the health field. Resumo. O crescente aumento no volume de dados coletados, armazenados e compartilhados por instituições da área de saúde gera benefı́cios para o processo de tomada de decisão com base no conhecimento adquirido a partir da aplicação de técnicas de análise e mineração de dados na extração de informações úteis. A despeito dos benefı́cios propiciados, o compartilhamento desses dados em seu formato original pode pôr em risco a privacidade dos pacientes. Na tentativa de validar soluções para este problema, este artigo compara algumas técnicas de anonimização e perturbação de dados, avaliando a eficácia dessas técnicas na garantia da privacidade e segurança de dados compartilhados, em particular, quando aplicadas a bases de dados na área de saúde. 1. Introdução Há uma crescente adoção de práticas de Tecnologia da Informação em pesquisas na área de saúde, o que resulta na coleta, armazenamento e compartilhamento de grandes volumes de dados, nos quais, a aplicação de técnicas de mineração de dados pode possibilitar a descoberta de informações potencialmente úteis. Entretanto, algumas instituições que realizam pesquisas na área de saúde e que necessitam fazer uso de várias fontes de dados, podem hesitar em compartilhar os dados entre si, pois seus registros normalmente possuem dados altamente sensı́veis que não podem ser expostos, como por exemplo, informações pessoais dos pacientes [Kumari et al. 2012]. Por isso, nesses casos é importante compartilhar os dados, porém protegendo a privacidade dos registros. 2018 SBC 33rd Brazilian Symposium on Databases (SBBD) August 25-26, 2018 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil	data anonymization;data mining;database;em intermediate language;lo que tú quieras oír;numerical aperture;point of interest;power-on reset;privacy;registered jack;unified model;winsock	Francimaria Nascimento;Karliane O.

A specific focus of this database is to support macro-evolutionary studies of science and to communicate findings via knowledge-domain visualizations. Currently, the database provides access to about 18 million publications, patents, and grants. About 90% of the publications are available in full text. Except for some datasets with restricted access conditions, the data can be retrieved in raw or pre-processed formats using either a web-based or a relational database client. This paper motivates the need for the database from the perspective of bibliometric/scientometric research. It explains the database design, setup, etc., and reports the temporal, geographical, and topic coverage of data sets currently served via the database. Planned work and the potential for this database to become a global testbed for information science research are discussed at the end of the paper.	bibliometrics;database design;information science;relational database;scientometrics;testbed;web application	Gavin LaRowe;Sumeet Ambre;John Burgoon;Weimao Ke;Katy Börner	2009	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-009-0414-2	database theory;intelligent database;relational database;computer science;data administration;data integrity;data mining;database;database catalog;world wide web;database schema;physical data model;information retrieval;database testing;database design;testbed	DB	-42.74811398963298	0.1828367118201788	23401

In most online mapping systems, Web Mercator has become the dominant projection. While the Mercator projection has a long history of discussion about its inappropriateness for general-purpose mapping, particularly at the global scale, and seems to have been virtually phased out for general-purpose global-scale print maps, it has seen a resurgence in popularity in Web Mercator form. This article theorizes on how Web Mercator came to be widely used for online maps and what this might mean in terms of data display, technical aspects of map generation and distribution, design, and cognition of spatial patterns. The authors emphasize details of where the projection excels and where it does not, as well as some of its advantages and disadvantages for cartographic communication, and conclude with some research directions that may help to develop better solutions to the problem of projections for general-purpose, multi-scale Web mapping.	arcgis;cartography;cognition;cognitive map;data infrastructure;distortion;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;geographic information science;independence day: resurgence;interoperability;köppen climate classification;map projection;mashup (web application hybrid);requirement;seamless3d;web mercator;web mapping;world wide web	Sarah E.

To improve this situation, we propose an SQL extension---called SQL/S---for approximate query answering using random samples, and present a prototypical implementation within the engine of the open-source database system Derby---called Derby/S. Our approach significantly reduces the required expert knowledge by enabling the definition of samples in a declarative way; the choice of the specific sampling scheme and its parametrization is left to the system. SQL/S introduces new DDL commands to easily define and administrate random samples subject to a given set of optimization criteria. Derby/S automatically takes care of sample maintenance if the underlying dataset changes. Finally, samples are transparently used during query processing, and error bounds are provided. Our extensions do not affect traditional queries and provide the means to integrate sampling as a first-class citizen into a DBMS.	approximation algorithm;care-of address;database;declarative programming;first-class citizen;mathematical optimization;open-source software;requirement;sql;sampling (signal processing)	Anja Klein;Rainer Gemulla;Philipp Rösch;Wolfgang Lehner	2006		10.1145/1142473.1142579	online aggregation;sampling;sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;boolean conjunctive query;computer science;query by example;data mining;database;web search query;view;range query;information retrieval;query language;spatial query	DB	-34.14723192700211	1.1692354392483653	23967

To get an overview of the field, a systematic mapping of the literature has been done, covering over 3000 papers. It revealed a field massively dominated by US researchers, with an emphasis on military and space systems. A large number of people are involved, but few researchers focus on the area, and citations are fairly low compared to other fields. Important research topics include architecture, modeling and simulation, integration and interoperability, communication, sustainability, and safety and security. There are signs of immaturity within the research area, and it is recommended that existing venues are complemented with an international scientific event with very high standards for submissions.	apple sos;colocation centre;computer architecture;interoperability;scientific literature;simulation;system of systems engineering	Jakob Axelsson	2015	2015 10th System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSE)	10.1109/SYSOSE.2015.7151918	systems modeling;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;software engineering;data mining;database;systematics;management science;measurement	DB	-48.460436636401	-0.19722883222310028	24049

33e00e13bcb32531d2b639e0149c140b7d6a62ea	historical collaborative geocoding		The latest developments in the field of digital humanities have increasingly enabled the construction of large data sets which can be easily accessed and used. These data sets often contain indirect spatial information, such as historical addresses. Historical geocoding is the process of transforming indirect spatial information into direct locations which can be placed on a map, thus allowing for spatial analysis and cross-referencing. There are many geocoders that work efficiently for current addresses. However, these do not tackle temporal information, and usually follow a strict hierarchy (country, city, street, house number, etc.) which is difficult—if not impossible—to use with historical data. Historical data is filled with uncertainty (pertaining to temporal, textual, and positional accuracy, as well as to the reliability of historical sources) which can neither be ignored nor entirely resolved. Our open source, open data, and extensible solution for geocoding is based on extracting a large number of simple gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects, from historical maps. Geocoding a historical address becomes the process of finding one or several geohistorical objects in the gazetteers which best match the historical address searched by the user. The matching criteria are customisable, weighted, and include several dimensions (fuzzy string, fuzzy temporal, level of detail, positional accuracy). Since our goal is to facilitate historical work, we also put forward web-based user interfaces which help geocode (one address or batch mode) and display results over current or historical maps. Geocoded results can then be checked and edited collaboratively (no source is modified). The system was tested on the city of Paris, France, for the 19th and 20th centuries. It showed high response rates and worked quickly enough to be used interactively.	apple maps;batch processing;cross-reference;digital humanities;geocoding;house numbering;interactivity;level of detail;open-source software;spatial analysis;topography;user interface;web application	Rémi Cura;Bertrand Dumenieu;Nathalie Abadie;Benoit Costes;Julien Perret;Maurizio Gribaudi	2018	ISPRS Int.

2150fe09f1d5cc67a55b17254ce981ef03244198	booming undergraduate enrollments: a wave or a sea change?		2015 December • Vol. 6 • No. 4 acm Inroads 105 In many colleges and universities across the country, computer science classes are bursting at the seams! According to Computing Research Association (CRA)’s Taulbee Survey, the number of newly declared computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) majors at more than 100 research universities surveyed reached an all-time high two years ago (the most recent data available), and has undoubtedly increased further since then. The Taulbee Survey and ACM’s annual Survey of Non-Doctoral-Granting Departments in Computing both indicate an anticipated growth in enrollment of between 15 and 20 percent annually. At my own university—the University of Massachusetts Amherst—the number of computer science majors is now approaching twice its previous high. We’ve read in the popular press that introductory computing has become the most popular course on a number of campuses. At the CRA’s Snowbird conference last year, CS leaders debated whether this dramatic increase of interest is a wave that will crest and recede, or a “sea change” representing a new norm. The answer to this important question involves at least three important converging trends. Certainly, the job market for newly minted CS/CE majors appears excellent. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that more than half of the new jobs in 2012 through 2022, across all of STEM, will be in computer occupations. And starting salaries for those with CS/CE bachelor’s degrees have consistently been among the highest across all majors. There’s also a tangible sense of excitement and opportunity among our majors about their careers and the impact of their work. But I think that the bright prospects for students in our traditional computer science programs are a piece of the picture, and why I believe we’ll be seeing a “sea change” rather than a wave. To this point, a second trend we’re seeing is that, increasingly, computing has infused myriad industry sectors and academic disciplines far beyond the tech sector. Jeanette Wing, a predecessor of mine as Assistant Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), spoke eloquently about the need for “computational thinking” in many disciplines. On campuses today, that notion has taken root and is growing and blossoming into new interdisciplinary “CS+X” undergraduate programs for students seeking By James Kurose Booming Undergraduate Enrollments: A Wave or a Sea Change?	cs games;computation;computational thinking;computer engineering;credit bureau;ibm notes;information and computer science;information science;jim kurose;job stream;wing commander iii: heart of the tiger	James F.

Such Internet-scale deep web data integration tasks are becoming increasingly more common.   In Internet-scale deep web data integration tasks, a primary     challenge is to determine in which web database to   be   include  d   in the     integration system. This paper presents a utility maximization model     for resources selection of deep web data integration. This new model     shows an efficient and effective way to estimate the approximate     utility of the web database bringing to a given status of an     integration system by integrating it. The utility of the web     databases is synthesized by positive and negative utility. With the     estimated utility information, web database selection can be made by     explicitly optimizing the goal of high-utility(include as m  uch   and     important data as possible in the selected databases, and the query     cost of   which   as low as possible) in an iterative manner, where web     databases are integrated incrementally. We experimentally     demonstrate that our approach is efficient and finding high-utility     data integration solutions.

81ec6f9f6c21af7235f903c55e036b543facbbe9	implicit media frames: automated analysis of public debate on artificial sweeteners	public understanding of science;information retrieval;mass media	The framing of issues in the mass media plays a crucial role in the public understanding of science and technology. This article contributes to research concerned with the analysis of media frames over time by making an analytical distinction between implicit and explicit media frames, and by introducing an automated method for the analysis of implicit frames. In particular, we apply a semantic maps method to a case study on the newspaper debate about artificial sweeteners, published in the New York Times between 1980 and 2006. Our results show that the analysis of semantic changes enables us to filter out the dynamics of implicit frames, and to detect emerging metaphors in public debates. Theoretically, we discuss the relation between implicit frames in public debates and the codification of meaning and information in scientific discourses, and suggest further avenues for research interested in the automated analysis of frame changes and trends in public debates.	artificial sweeteners;aspartame;bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis;communications of the acm;complex dynamics;database;emergence;first-order predicate;flow;frame (physical object);framing (world wide web);information processing;loet leydesdorff;map;mass media;natural language;scientific publication;semantic mapper;sweetening agents;the new york times;top-down and bottom-up design	Iina Hellsten;James Dawson;Loet Leydesdorff	2010	Public understanding of science		automation;public awareness of science;semantic mapping;framing (construction);social science;mass media;newspaper;public debate;computer science	NLP	-50.108826316839306	-19.99227046950738	24434

Being a generic modeling framework, the M3O aims at integrating the existing metadata standards and metadata formats rather than replacing them. This is in particular useful as today's multimedia applications often need to combine and use more than one existing metadata standard or metadata format at the same time. However, applying and specializing the abstract and powerful M3O modeling framework in concrete application domains and integrating it with existing metadata formats and metadata standards is not always straightforward. Thus, we have developed a step-by-step alignment method that describes how to integrate existing multimedia metadata standards and metadata formats with the M3O in order to use them in a concrete application. We demonstrate our alignment method by integrating seven different existing metadata standards and metadata formats with the M3O and describe the experiences made during the integration process.

In our approach to realize this goal, a new modular architecture  for designing and implementation of cooperative labyrinth discovery robots (CLDRs) is devised. Both hardware and software  aspects are considered in detail. Robot and agent ontology aspects are treated in detail with examples. Likewise, labyrinth  data structure (Maze Set) is represented in Notation 3 and OWL standard formats useful for purposes of semantic logic data  processing in scientific software environments such as Prolog, Protégé, and MATLAB. Concepts of Semantic Web technology are  introduced leading to a working understanding of semantic Web services (SWS). A CLDR acts as an agent offering SWS. Each agent  is an autonomous complex system, which acts based on its sensory input, information retrieved from other agents, and ontology  files for agent and domain. CLDR decision making was introduced based on either of the principles of open/closed World assumptions.  Messaging and coordination aspects are addressed. The approach is to create semantic robotic agents based on SWS to implement  autonomous semantic agents (ASAs). Several applications can be built based on ASA architecture, where semantic robotics can  play a vital part: traffic management, interactive traffic information dissemination, creating intelligent environment through  intelligent intersections, dispatching vehicular services, and homeland security.

c03fddb82b0c0309bc798d7c998b94f70865b76d	preface to selected papers from the 6th international conference on computational systems-biology and bioinformatics (csbio2015)		"""The rapid advancement in high-throughput technologies has shifted life science research into a \big data"""" paradigm. To unlock the full potential of the vast amount of data and translate it into bene ̄ts for society (e.g. better medicine and healthcare), novel and advanced computational tools are needed for data analysis. This issue is a follow-up to the 6th International Conference on Computational Systems-Biology and Bioinformatics (CSBio2015) that was held in Bangkok, Thailand, during 22–25 November 2015. The conference was co-organized by King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Kasetsart University (KU), and the National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC). Notably for KMUTT, this event was a celebration of many milestones including the 55th anniversary of the university, the 20th anniversary of the School of Information Technology, and the 12th anniversary of her Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program. More than 100 participants from 19 di®erent countries attended the conference, making it truly international in scope. Among the 84 submissions received, the program committee members recommended the top-quality papers for this special issue. After a rigorous peer-review process, three papers were selected as outlined below. The ̄rst paper, by Lu and Leong, entitled \GI-SVM: A sensitive method for predicting genomic islands based on unannotated sequence of a single genome"""" presents an approach based on one-class support vector machine (SVM) to identify bacterial genomic islands without relying on gene annotation information or comparisons with other closely related genomes. This makes it possible to quickly scan for genomic islands on newly unannotated genome sequences. Comprehensive performance evaluations and comparisons with other well-known methods were carried out and presented. The second paper, by Yu et al., entitled \An O(n) algorithm for sorting signed genomes by reversals, transpositions, transreversals, and block-interchanges"""" describes a method for ̄nding the fewest reversals, transpositions, transreversals, and block-interchanges to convert one genome into another assuming that they Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Vol. 14, No. 1 (2016) 1602001 (2 pages) #.c Imperial College Press DOI: 10.1142/S0219720016020017"""	academic medical centers;algorithm;biological science disciplines;biotechnology;computation;digital object identifier;evaluation;gene annotation;genome;genomic islands;hereditary diseases;high-throughput computing;journal of bioinformatics and computational biology;lu decomposition;list of information schools;mall gene;modelling biological systems;page (document);paper;peer-to-patent;programming paradigm;radiology information systems;sim lock;signature;sorting;support vector machine;systems biology;throughput	Weerayuth Kittichotirat;Worrawat Engchuan;Wanwipa Vongsangnak;Asawin Meechai	2016	Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology	10.1142/S0219720016020017	genomics;molecular sequence annotation;bioinformatics;modelling biological systems;biology;systems biology	Visualization	-47.89023915242026	-12.781682229790476	24692

From its origins in scientific workflow systems and database theory, and with concurrent interest from the ecological informatics community, a standard data model (PROV) and extensions for DataONE (ProvONE) have led to initial implementations in several tools commonly used by scientists (R, MATLAB) and in a global federation of scientific data repositories (DataONE). DataONE's support for ingest, storage, indexing and retrieval of provenance data is presented. Implications for libraries are identified. A research agenda for exploring the applicability of the PROV model to cultural heritage institutions — archives and museums — and their digital asset management systems is presented.	archive;computation;computer scientist;database theory;digital asset;ecoinformatics;informatics;library (computing);matlab;standard data model;trustworthy computing	Robert J.

This paper describes the key information extraction (IE) challenges that we have run into, and sketches our solutions. We discuss in particular developing a declarative IE language, optimizing for this language, generating IE provenance, incorporating user feedback into the IE process, developing a novel wiki-based user interface for feedback, best-effort IE, pushing IE into RDBMSs, and more. Our work suggests that IE in managing unstructured data can open up many interesting research challenges, and that these challenges can greatly benefit from the wealth of work on managing structured data that has been carried out by the database community.	best-effort delivery;end system;end-to-end encryption;information extraction;relational database management system;user interface;wiki	AnHai Doan;Jeffrey F.

Problems of lacking coherence among experts hinder the wide use of ontology in sharing the electronic medical records generated by different hospital information systems. In this paper, an ontology construction method is proposed from the viewpoints of both top-down and bottom-up. Ontology segments are firstly extracted bottom-up from the database schema of operational clinical information systems. Then, experts from different disciplines work together to merge the ontology segments top-down, and to build a global ontology system. Finally, this approach is demonstrated in a clinic data analysis project. The result shows that the method is efficient in ontology engineering.	database schema;information system;ontology engineering;table (database);top-down and bottom-up design	Boyi Xu;Hongming Cai;Lihong Jiang	2013	2013 10th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2013.6816283	upper ontology;open biomedical ontologies;ontology alignment;erbium;bibliographic ontology;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;data mining;database;ontology-based data integration;data analysis;process ontology;suggested upper merged ontology	DB	-37.94301390975996	0.07114059686722765	24852

As research centres websites are usually quite static, external documents are generated by managers, resulting in data redundancy and out-of-date records. In this paper, we show our efforts to manage all these data using Labman, a web framework that deals with all the data, links entities and publishes them as Linked Open Data, allowing to get insightful information about the group’s productivity using visual analytics and interactive charts.	chart;computer performance;data redundancy;entity;interactive media;linked data;visual analytics;web framework	Oscar Peña;Jon Lázaro;Aitor Almeida;Pablo Orduña;Unai Aguilera;Diego López-de-Ipiña	2014			linked data;data science;data mining;web application framework;impression;visual analytics;data redundancy;computer science	DB	-44.729830004526875	-18.992970923752083	24854

02d96741f9c501257db219b0414a20ff2a4d0b97	guest editors’ introduction: special issue of the ecml/pkdd 2014 journal track		This special issue is a collection of papers submitted to the ECML/PKDD 2013 and 2014 journal tracks and accepted for publication in “Machine Learning”. The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML/PKDD, launched its journal track in 2013. In order to cover the full scope of the conference, which is a merger of the formerly independent conferences ECML and PKDD, two journals were involved: “Machine Learning” and “Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery”. In addition to being published in the respective journal, papers accepted in the journal track are also presented at the conference, just like the contributions to the regular conference proceedings. Thus, all papers of this special issue are also presented by their authors at the ECML/PKDD 2014 conference in Nancy, France, from September 15th to 19th. Given the special nature of the ECML/PKDD journal track, submissions are supposed to meet specific criteria. First and foremost, like any other submission, they are of course expected to comply with the high scientific standards of the two journals. Not less importantly, however, they should naturally lend themselves to conference presentations. In other words, they are supposed to be conference and journal papers at the same time: as novel and intriguing	data mining and knowledge discovery;ecml pkdd;foremost;machine learning	Toon Calders;Floriana Esposito;Eyke Hüllermeier;Rosa Meo	2014	Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery	10.1007/s10618-014-0374-x		HPC	-61.527593270409646	-17.82467372113117	24903

7289c949809cdff13a8ad0ee2050a540d00a4c28	evaluating the impact of deploying unrestricted unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace		Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can be used for scientific, emergency management, and defense missions, among others. The existing federal air regulations, procedures, and technologies do not allow routine UAS access to the National Airspace System (NAS), with the UAS being flown primarily within restricted airspaces. The current Certificate of Waiver of Authorization (COA) process requirement for UAS operations in the NAS are extremely resource intensive, lengthy, and often lacks the flexibility to meet the full mission needs. As the number of UAS operations increases, new methodologies will be needed to enable their safe and routine access to both restricted and unrestricted airspace in the NAS. This paper focuses on gaining a better understanding of growth of NAS usage in near-term NAS UAS demand in that airspace, and an assessment of the impact of unrestricted UAS deployment in the NAS that may facilitate the development of enabling methodologies. Using software simulations for demand growth generation and NAS operations the impact of UAS integration into the NextGen NAS is simulated to analyze its impact on the delay, congestion, loss of separation conflicts, fuel burn, and noise level. Our analyses show that while there is a slight increase in these factors due to additional UAS flight, this increase is minimal compared to the levels caused by the increase of commercial traffic alone.	authorization;network congestion;noise (electronics);simulation;software deployment;usb attached scsi;unmanned aerial vehicle	Abhinav Saxena;Indranil Roychoudhury;Christian Neukom;Greg Pisanich;Alex Huang;Duc Tran	2012		10.2514/6.2012-2436	simulation;engineering;transport engineering;computer security	HPC	-54.45163969270081	2.1252913150149	24978

8ddc6c8d9e6b73badd70e88384e6c594bbed84af	a data-driven methodology for motivating a set of coherence relations	thesis or dissertation;coherence relations;linguistics	The notion that a text is coherent in virtue of the `relations' that hold between its component spans currently forms the basis for an active research programme in discourse linguistics. Coherence relations feature prominently in many theories of discourse structure, and have recently been used with considerable success in text generation systems. However, while the concept of coherence relations is now common currency for discourse theorists, there remains much confusion about them, and no standard set of relations has yet emerged. The aim of this thesis is to contribute towards the development of a standard set of relations. We begin from an explicitly empirical conception of relations: they are taken to model a collection of psychological mechanisms operative during the tasks of reading and writing. This conception is eshed out with reference to psychological theories of skilled task performance, and to Rosch's notion of the basic level of categorisation. A methodology for investigating these mechanisms is then presented, which takes as its starting point a study of cue phrases|the sentence/clause connectives by which they are signalled. Although it is conventional to investigate psychological mechanisms by studying human behaviour, it is argued here that evidence for the constructs modelled by relations can be sought in an analysis of the linguistic resources available for marking them explicitly in text. The methodology is based on two simple linguistic tests: the test for cue phrases and the test for substitutability. Both tests are functional in inspiration: the former test identi es a heterogenous class of phrases used for linking one portion of text to another; and the latter test is used to discover when a writer is willing to substitute one of these phrases for another. The tests are designed to capture the judgements of ordinary readers and writers, rather than the theoretical intuitions of specialised discourse analysts. The test for cue phrases is used to analyse around 200 pages of naturally occurring text, from which a corpus of over 200 cue phrases is assembled. The substitutability test is then used to organise this corpus into a hierarchical taxonomy, representing the substitutability relationship between every pair of phrases. The taxonomy of cue phrases lends itself neatly to a model of relations as featurebased constructs. Many cue phrases can be interpreted as signalling just some features of relations, rather than whole relations. Small extracts from the taxonomy can be used systematically to determine the alternative values of single features; complex relation de nitions can then be formed by combining the values of many features. The thesis delivers results on two levels. Firstly, it sets out a methodology for motivating a set of relation de nitions, which rests on a systematic analysis of concrete linguistic data, and demands a minimum of theoretical assumptions. Also provided are the relation de nitions which result from applying the methodology. The new de nitions give an interesting picture of the variation that exists amongst cue phrases, and o er a number of innovative insights into text coherence. ii Acknowledgements I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest thanks to my supervisors, Chris Mellish, Robert Dale and Steve Isard, for their immense help and encouragement over the last four years. Robert rst prompted me to think about the theoretical status of coherence relations; he led me to appreciate the need for a rm foundation for these constructs, as well as overseeing the assembly of the taxonomy of cue phrases. Chris was a huge help in guiding me through the theoretical interpretation of the taxonomy, in all its details. Steve provided a valuable perspective on the thesis as a whole. I would also like to thank my examiners, Donia Scott, Graeme Ritchie and Alex Lascarides, for their detailed comments and suggestions on the manuscript, and for a very interesting discussion during the viva. Many other people have been in uential in the development of the ideas presented here. A big thank you to all of the following, whose feedback and suggestions were much appreciated: Jean Carletta, Ed Hovy, Elisabeth Maier, Kathy McCoy, Johanna Moore, Megan Moser, Jon Oberlander, C ecile Paris, Orin Percus, Ted Sanders, Karen Sp arck Jones, Wilbert Spooren, Manfred Stede, and Keith Vander Linden. Special thanks to Ted, for long discussions in several countries, over many glasses of Belgian beer. It seems to be easier to start a PhD than to nish one. This thesis would certainly not have been nished without the concerted e orts of a large and ruthless team of people, and I would like to say thank you to all of them for managing to force me into submission. Firstly to Chris, for the diverse rhetorical strategies he has employed to encourage me to nish, ranging from rational arguments and encouragements, through thinly veiled warnings, to direct threats and emotive appeals; and nally for eliciting from me a solemn oath to stop my research and start writing. Next, to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), for their generous support over three years; and also for their Faustian `four year deadline', which I have watched approaching with increasing horror but which has nally|I think|had its intended e ect on me. And lastly, to the assorted PhD students and denizens of the AI department, who have made my life on E oor most pleasant. Thanks are due to Alberto, Chris, Ed, Elena, Ian, Ion, Janet, Jean, Jeremy, Kim, Nam Seog, Ste an, and Wamberto, who have all been a great in uence on me during the past few years. Needless to say, any defects that remain in my character are solely my own responsibility. I would like to give special thanks to my family. Their constant support, particularly during the past year when I was running on empty, has been very important to me. Thank you Mum, Dad, Beck, Har, Jule. Thanks also to my wider family, in Britain, in New Zealand and in Tonga. Above all I would like to thank Mele, who has had to put up with a lot of ranting and raving on the subject of discourse structure just recently. Thank you for your love, and cheerfulness, and steadfastness. And especially for the notice pinned above my bed, reminding me of the important fact that No-One Reads PhD Theses. iii Declaration I hereby declare that I composed this thesis entirely myself and that it describes my own research.

SEJP allows editors, reviewers, authors, and readers to explore and analyze (meta)data published by a journal. Besides Linked Data created from the journal’s internal data, SEJP also links out to other sources and includes them to develop more powerful modules. These modules range from simple descriptive statistics, over the spatial analysis of visitors and authors, to topic trending modules. While SEJP will be available for multiple journals, this paper shows its deployment to the Semantic Web journal by IOS Press. Due to its open & transparent review process, SWJ offers a wide variety of additional information, e.g., about reviewers, editors, paper decisions, and so forth.	linked data;scientometrics;semantic web;software deployment;spatial analysis	Grant McKenzie;Krzysztof Janowicz;Yingjie Hu;Kunal Sengupta;Pascal Hitzler	2013			computer science;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-43.04133705646763	1.3162640989624177	25323

Despite this broad adoption, the potential of SRB and Data Grids is not fully utilized by the general research community. The reason for this under utilisation comes in part from the complexity of the Data Grid model and the lack of quality interfaces to SRB, making it difficult to use and configure. YourSRB, is a system developed in the course of our research which provides an intuitive interface to SRB and aims to enable a broader community to benefit from SRB. The system also simplifies the use of SRB’s awkward-to-initiate federation schemes, making SRB more suitable for use as the core of an organisational level research repository. In addition, our approach to federation makes the YourSRB system suitable for field workers who can off-line curate and annotate data, and subsequently federate their data with a primary store when network connectivity is available. YourSRB also implements data description and retrieval capabilities, enabling the effective management of massive data sets over multiple storage resources.	biomedical informatics research network;climate model;data mining;digital library;dublin core;e-science;federated identity;graph toughness;grid computing;information explosion;jargon;large hadron collider;load testing;next-generation network;online and offline;parallel computing;peer-to-peer;petabyte;prototype;requirement;scalability;shibboleth;simulation;software release life cycle;software testing;thermal spraying	Mathew J.

The applicable use cases span across a wide range of application domains, from maritime and sea border surveillance to agricultural and environmental monitoring. This paper presents the design and development of a multi-mission service platform based on a generic core, able to aggregate data collected from multiple sensors and route monitoring information among processing modules and decision support systems. As the central point of a modular architecture, this service platform can be easily and quickly customized to serve multiple heterogeneous application domains. Its application for maritime surveillance is presented as an indicative use case.	aggregate data;algorithm;application domain;decision support system;sensor;software deployment;terrestrial television	Stratis Konakas;Spyros Pantazis;Georgios Gardikis;Socrates Costicoglou;Ilias Andrikopoulos;Javier Mulero Chaves;Cristina Parraga Niebla	2014	2014 International Conference on Telecommunications and Multimedia (TEMU)	10.1109/TEMU.2014.6917729	embedded system;computer security;remote sensing	Mobile	-39.404445433357076	-1.8832452140261724	25994

There are two fundamental requirements in engineering: formal modeling and quantitative modeling. We must emphasize that metrics for software engineering is insufficient in quantification now. In order to improve software and software processing, the factors that affect schedule, cost and quality of software development should be measured. Metrics produces adjustable and iterative motions in software processing. Based on Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, this paper establishes a model to quantify the factors and introduces distance to compare the metric indicators. The authors propose that the metric estimation tree can be used and the nodes that stand for the software attributes in the tree can be marked with their corresponding evaluation values. Dynamic feedback in the software processing will be combined with AHP (analytic hierarchy process), and the project and process of development will be learned and analyzed entirely, concentratedly and dynamically.	analytical hierarchy;iterative method;mathematical model;principle of maximum entropy;requirement;software development;software engineering	Yong Cao;Zhu Qin-xin	2007	Second International Multi-Symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences (IMSCCS 2007)	10.1109/IMSCCS.2007.45	web mapping;geography;data science;data mining;world wide web;web coverage service	SE	-38.81818964473	-21.89164444061481	26209

(optimization methods for large-scale distributed query processing on linked data)		Optimization methods for large-scale distributed query processing on linked data Linked Data is a term to define a set of best practices for publishing and interlinking structured data on the Web. As the number of data providers of Linked Data increases, the Web becomes a huge global data space. Query federation is one of the approaches for efficiently querying this distributed data space. It is employed via a federated query engine which aims to minimize the response time and the completion time. Response time is the time to generate the first result tuple, whereas completion time refers to the time to provide all result tuples. There are three basic steps in a federated query engine which are data source selection, query optimization, and query execution. This thesis contributes to the subject of query optimization for query federation. Most of the studies focus on static query optimization which generates the query plans before the execution and needs statistics. However, the environment of Linked Data has several difficulties such as unpredictable data arrival rates and unreliable statistics. As a consequence, static query optimization can cause inefficient execution plans. These constraints show that adaptive query optimization should be used for federated query processing on Linked Data.		Damla Oguz	2017				DB	-34.51393026945844	1.179987555822385	26538

No such cases are readily apparent for the current generation of geobrowsers, though the text of the 1998 Gore speech refers to several. An analysis of the use cases of GIS reveals similarities with the functionality of geobrowsers, inviting the view that the two forms of geographic information technology will eventually converge. However experience suggests that users are finding very different ways of exploiting geobrowsers, and two examples are discussed in detail. These uses can be interpreted within a broad framework of spatial concepts, and the paper concludes that this framework provides a better guide to the future of geobrowsers and Digital Earth than current GIS technology.	converge;enumerated type;geographic information system;geospatial analysis;google earth;gore (segment);inferential theory of learning;next-generation network;patchwork;systems design;usability;virtual globe;volume rendering	Michael F.

We have conducted research on data practices and participated in developing data management services for the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing since its founding in 2002 as a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. Over the course of eight years, our digital library strategy has shifted dramatically in response to changing technologies, practices, and policies. We report on the development of several DL systems and on the lessons learned, which include the difficulty of anticipating data requirements from nascent technologies, building systems for highly diverse work practices and data types, the need to bind together multiple single-purpose systems, the lack of incentives to manage and share data, the complementary nature of research and development in understanding practices, and sustainability.	digital library;embedded system;information explosion;library (computing);requirement	Jillian C.

62a65a9386d5e5145c661c911112fb6965f5fa4b	the 2016 visualization career award		John Dill is a Professor Emeritus in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology and in the School of Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC. He received a B.A.Sc. (1962) in Engineering Physics from UBC, a MS (1965) in Biomathematics from North Carolina State University and a Ph.D. (1970) in Engineering Science from the California Institute of Technology. He discovered computer graphics working with the LINC computer—perhaps the world’s first true personal computer—at NC State, working on the mechanics of breathing, and went on to develop graphics software for the IBM 2250 to help study the neurophysiology of insect vision at Caltech for his PhD. Professor Dill’s early research career was at the General Motors Research Laboratories, where he developed computer graphics approaches for computer-aided design, business analytics and human-computer interaction. One example was showing how to visualize the aesthetics of shape using surface curvature. Subsequent to GMR he moved to Cornell, where, with Don Greenberg, he established the College of Engineering’s Computer Aided Design Instructional Facility. He later returned to Vancouver to become a manager at MPR Teltech Ltd. Finding management wasn’t as rewarding as he’d hoped, Dill returned to academia, joining Simon Fraser University’s School of Engineering Science where he focussed on information visualization and HCI. Dill’s industrial experience, contacts and background helped him establish and lead several successful joint industry-academia research efforts. The first was a project with colleagues at MPR and SFU to improve user interfaces for managing large complex real-time systems such as telecommunications networks. One of the results was a detail-incontext method to visualize large hierarchical networks, called Continuous Zoom. With colleagues Brian Fisher, Chris Jones, and Gerald Collaud and several students, it was further developed into a system for organizing information from the Web and became the basis for a start-up. Dill later took advantage of an invitation from the Pacific Northwest National Labs’ Jim Thomas, an ex-GMR colleague, to participate in the US National Visual Analytics Center Research Agenda panel that founded visual analytics. With Thomas’ encouragement and help, he worked with colleagues Fisher, Rensink, and Pennant to introduce visual analytics to Canada. Again building on long-term industrial relationships, Dill and colleagues obtained a grant from The Boeing Company to develop visual analytics in Canada, and to study applications of VA to aerospace. The work, performed with Boeing’s Dave Kasik, resulted in several new VA-related research projects as well as establishment of a joint SFU-UBC Visual Analytics Institute in Vancouver. Collaborators included Brian Fisher, Ron Rensink, Fred Popowich, Chris Shaw, Rob Woodbury, and Dave Darvill. One project, CZSaw, generated several publications and received VAST Contest Awards. The Institute, VIVA, has since developed several industry-oriented VA courses, established a national center, and an industrial consortium, to further Canadian visual analytics adoption. Professor Dill has a long history of service to organizations and conferences in CAD, graphics and visualization. He is a member of the IEEE Computer Society, a former member of ACM and ACM SIGGRAPH and has served on many program committees (ACM SIGGRAPH, IEEE InfoVis, IEEE VAST, ACM UIST, and Graphics Interface, among others). He was Papers Chair for ACM SIGGRAPH 88, ACM SIGGRAPH 95 Exhibits Chair, Program Co-chair for IEEE InfoVis in 1997 and 1998, General Symposium Chair for IEEE InfoVis 2002, Co-chair of IEEE VAST 2007 and has served on the Steering Committees for both IEEE InfoVis and IEEE VAST. He served for many years on the Editorial Board of IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, including four years as Editor-in-Chief, and is currently on the Board’s Advisory Committee. Most importantly, much of Professor Dill’s success in— and enjoyment from—these fields has come from being able to work with outstanding colleagues and students, and to be able to work on joint university-industry projects where new problems generate interesting research that has an impact.

b5cfd660d6671cec494b70a3d60a1b1d19dc7b91	keynote speaker: visualization analysis and design	computer based visualization system visualization analysis visualization design;design data analysis data visualisation	Computer-based visualization (vis) systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively. Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods. The design space of possible vis idioms is huge, and includes the considerations of both how to create and how to interact with visual representations. Vis design is full of trade-offs, and most possibilities in the design space are ineffective for a particular task, so validating the effectiveness of a design is both necessary and difficult. Vis designers must take into account three very different kinds of resource limitations: those of computers, of humans, and of displays. Vis usage can be analyzed in terms of why the user needs it, what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed. I will discuss this framework for analyzing the design of visualization systems. Bio Tamara Munzner is a professor at the University of British Columbia Department of Computer Science, and holds a PhD from Stanford. She has been active in visualization research since 1991 and has published over 65 papers and book chapters. Her book Visualization Analysis and Design appeared in 2014. She co-chaired InfoVis in 2003 and 2004, co-chaired EuroVis in 2009 and 2010, and is chair of the VIS Executive Committee.

419316305353a9205d660e1e95f8f7f0ad939246	practical aspects of declarative languages		We present an architecture for data semantics discovery capable of extracting semantically-rich content from human-readable files without prior specification of the file format. The architecture, based on work at the intersection of knowledge representation and machine learning, includes machine learning modules for automatic file format identification, tokenization, and entity identification. The process is driven by an ontology of domain-specific concepts. The ontology also provides an abstraction layer for querying the extracted data. We provide a general description of the architecture as well as details of the current implementation. Although the architecture can be applied in a variety of domains, we focus on cyber-forensics applications, aiming to allow one to parse data sources, such as log files, for which there are no readily-available parsing and analysis tools, and to aggregate and query data from multiple, diverse systems across large networks. The key contributions of our work are: the development of an architecture that constitutes a substantial step toward solving a highly-practical open problem; the creation of one of the first comprehensive ontologies of cyber assets; the development and demonstration of an innovative, non-trivial combination of declarative knowledge specification and machine learning.	abstraction layer;aggregate data;data logger;domain-specific language;human-readable medium;knowledge representation and reasoning;machine learning;ontology (information science);parsing;semantic data model;tokenization (data security)	Enrico Pontelli;Tran Cao Son	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19686-2		AI	-38.10016354851183	2.362237256550127	27454
7b406ca9422d043c7b34c6de024a3bd1cc503ab9	an open, scalable and distributed platform for public discourse	indexation	A proposal for overcoming scalability, motivational and other limitations of using a single server as a participation platform is presented. The proposed solution is a distributed platform that makes use of existing publication channels and aggregates and indexes content using the XML-based RSS protocol. 1. Problem Statement One of the main issues in the field of e-democracy is how to best use information and communications technology to facilitate public consultation, deliberation, participation or “engagement” in policy-making processes such as urban planning. A variety of discourse systems for the World Wide Web have been developed for this purpose, such as GeoMed [Sch98], Zeno [GR02], and DEMOS [Lü01]. Typically, these are client-server systems with a three-tier architecture. On the server side there is a web application that stores articles and other information in a database. On the client side, participants in the process access the system using a web browser. There are a number of problems with this approach: Scalability. It is difficult to scale up to thousands of participants using replication and caching mechanisms, since many web pages need to be generated dynamically to provide personalized views and support the transactions needed for interaction and participation. Motivation. For several reasons, a centralized architecture inhibits large-scale participation. Participants need to access, learn and use a special purpose application, rather than being able to make contributions using some general purpose, familiar medium, comparable to a daily newspaper. Articles in a general-purpose publication are likely to reach a wider audience and typically have the advantage of being archived in public libraries for a long time. Finally, the marketing potential of publishers is not mobilized for the participation process when the articles are published only on a centralized participation server, rather as part of their own publications. Moderation Overhead. Since the articles are stored and published on the participation server, the providers of the server must take full responsibility for the published content. In addition to the tasks of managing the participation process, moderators must take responsibility for checking and possibility editing every submission. The costs of moderation are by far the largest problem to overcome when trying to scale up to thousands of participants.	archive;cache (computing);centralized computing;client-side;client–server model;database;game demo;general-purpose modeling;library (computing);multitier architecture;personalization;public library;rss;replication (computing);scalability;server (computing);server-side;web application;web page;world wide web;xml	Thomas F.

RSA builds on early work by the philosopher David Lewis and others on signaling systems as well as more recent developments in Bayesian cognitive modeling. Over the last five years, RSA has been shown to provide a unified account of numerous core phenomena in pragmatics, including metaphor, hyperbole, sarcasm, politeness, and a wide range of conversational implicatures. Its precise, quantitative nature has also facilitated an outpouring of new experimental work on these phenomena. However, applications of RSA to large-scale problems in NLP and AI have so far been limited, because the exact version of the model is intractable along several dimensions. In this talk, I’ll report on recent progress in approximating RSA in ways that retains its core properties while enabling application to large datasets and complex environments in which language and action are brought together.

In many large engineering enterprises, searching for files is a high-volume routine activity. Visualization-assisted search facilities can significantly reduce the cost of such activities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Search Provenance Graph (SPG), and present a technique for mapping out the search results and externalizing the provenance of a search process. This enables users to be aware of collaborative search activities within a project, and to be able to reason about potential missing files (i.e., false negatives) more effectively. We describe multiple ontologies that enable the computation of SPGs while supporting an enterprise search engine. We demonstrate the novelty and application of this technique through an industrial case study, where a large engineering enterprise needs to make a long-term technological plan for large-scale document search, and has found the visualization-assisted approach to be more cost-effective than alternative approaches being studied.

The current user interface offers direct access to single documents through different form-based search facilities, as well as through a catalogue that directly reflects the structure of the regestae volumes as they have been created in this long-term project. In order to further improve access to this large data volume, we suggest an additional approach based on coordinated views. The usage of coordinated view approaches is very common in many domains (Stasko et al, 2008, Vuillemot et al, 2009, Koch et al, 2011). However, there is no publicly system available, which would provide a suitable access to this historical dataset. The motivation for this new approach is twofold. On the one hand, we improve the support for search and exploration tasks in this historical data set that are based on imprecise information needs or on a less deep understanding of the available information. In practice, such imprecise queries can quickly lead to an overwhelmingly large number of search results. Allowing users to create and refine queries in a visual way, while offering immediate feedback on the number of entries requested, can help to cope with underspecified queries and help refining them iteratively (Jänicke et al, 2012). On the other hand, we offer a powerful means for visually analyzing the available information and understanding complex relationships by providing different linked perspectives on subsets of the collections. These perspectives include views on historic persons and entities as well as temporal and spatial information contained in the regestae. A usage scenario shows successful application of the approach.	academy;entity;information needs;koch snowflake;random access;regesta;user interface;word lists by frequency	Markus John;Christian Richter;Steffen Koch;Andreas Kuczera;Thomas Ertl	2017				HCI	-41.995696431141816	-22.473188716151636	27564

(Phys.-Math.) Professor Rimma Ivanovna Podlovchenko. For many years (since 1989), Dr. Podlovchenko has been a member of the editorial board of our journal, responsible for the direction related to fundamental issues of programming theory. A former student of A.A. Lyapunov, who was her scientific adviser at the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow State University, Dr. Podlovchenko is one of the most famous specialists in the theory of algebraic models of programs, which relies on the synthesis of the theory of program schemas and mathematical cybernetics. The theory of equivalent transformations of program schemas based on their formalization, which Dr. Podlovchenko has been successfully developing, has found a practical application in solving computer security and program masking problems.	computer security;cybernetics;dr. web;linear algebra;lyapunov fractal	Rimma I.

00a1831fa4f8a05de18c84c12310119f825cdd25	pux: patterns of user experience	qa 76 software;computer programming;user experience;pattern language	"""Alexander's pattern language provided a way of raising the level of discourse about buildings from a concrete to a new abstract level of description [1]. Rises in abstraction level happen regularly in all fields, but the key difference in Alexander's work was that his abstract descriptions were founded in user experience, not in abstract descriptions of building construction (engineering) or of ornament (style). This is in contrast to recent developments in software patterns, as noted by Molly Steenson in her recent Interactions article[2]. In talking about software, it is easy to get confused about the distinctions between abstract and concrete, because so much about software seems abstract. As a result, the adaptation of pattern languages to software has lost the key contribution of Alexander's work, which was to throw attention onto the users. Software patterns, despite being inspired by Alexander's work, emphasise abstract descriptions of construction and of ornament, not abstract descriptions of user experience. It's time to change that. This article tracks down the history of where we took a wrong turning, and proposes an alternative way forward. """" Traditional """" software patterns are concerned with user experience, but mostly with the user experience of programmers. That perspective may sound strange in an HCI context, but it helps explain the popularity of pattern languages in the programming community. If we move from the object world of technical software features to the human experience of structured information – we refocus attention on ways of working, not widgets. Our aim is a pattern language in the sense intended by Christopher Alexander, but a pattern language of user experience design rather than a pattern language of user interface design. This lets us escape shallow understanding of user experience in terms of affect and passive consumption (architects describe this as ornament [3]), to the ways that users perceive and build information structures. Before the publication of the 'Gang of Four' book that popularised software patterns [4], Richard Gabriel described Christopher Alexander's patterns in 1993 as a basis for reusable object‐oriented software in the following way: Habitability is the characteristic of source code that enables programmers, coders, bug­fixers, and people coming to the code later in its life to understand its construction and intentions and to change it comfortably and confidently."""	abstraction layer;human–computer interaction;pattern language;programmer;software design pattern;user experience design;user interface design	Alan F.

(cf. the Three Jewels, the Four Noble Truths, the Eight-Fold Path containing the Five Elementary Precepts, the Six Virtues, the 84,000 Teachings and so on). Specifically, it is my intention to remind you of an invited talk at ILP 2000 by David Page, in which five areas were proposed as pressing issues for Inductive Logic Programming to address. For those who came in late, these were#R##N##R##N#– Incorporating probabilities.#R##N##R##N#– Novel search methods.#R##N##R##N#– Techniques for parallel ILP.#R##N##R##N#– Using special-purpose reasoners.#R##N##R##N#– Enhancing human-computer interaction.#R##N##R##N#Five years is a reasonable length of time to take stock and ask: has progress been made on each of these fronts? We know di.erent approaches have been proposed for incorporating probabilities, some unusual search methods have been developed and a few techniques for concurrent processing have been investigated. But can we do things now that we could not five years ago (or at least, could do so only with great di.culty then)? The principal hindrances to a direct answer are that there are no yardsticks established for measuring progress, nor has the same ILP system been used in all cases. As a result, we can do little more that list out who has done what and how over the past five years.

Digital computation is a highly ambiguous concept, as there is no common core definition for it in cognitive science. Since this concept plays a central role in cognitive theory, an adequate cognitive explanation requires an explicit account of digital computation. More specifically, it requires an account of how digital computation is implemented in physical systems. The main challenge is to deliver an account encompassing the multiple types of existing models of computation without ending up in pancomputationalism, that is, the view that every physical system is a digital computing system. This book shows that only two accounts, among the ones examined by the author, are adequate for explaining physical computation. One of them is the instructional information processing account, which is developed here for the first time.""""This book provides a thorough and timely analysis of differing accounts of computation while advancing the important role that information plays in understanding computation.

d26605ff93f72fbbacdf454efd660fe5f33d1ba3	punttable: a flexible repository system for digital library	digital library;repository system;storage service;architecture	Digital libraries (DLs) provide various contents and services which become increasingly comprehensive and customizable. This has placed growing pressure on the repository systems of DLs. Common repository tools, such as Fedora and DSpace, have been widely deployed in DL systems. However, those repository tools often use traditional relational database management systems plus file systems as the storage layer, which cannot provide additional functionality. Complex services, such as user-generated content, recommendations, social networks services, etc. generate complex and heavy workloads on structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Those common repositories are not designed to handle such workloads, so the pressures are transferred to upper application layers. In this paper, we analyze the data structures and workloads of services provided by modern DLs and propose a data-storage strategy model. Based on this model, we describe the development of PuntTable, a flexible repository system for DLs. By integrating various data stores and making it extensible and flexible, PuntTable can easily support complex content and services. We deploy PuntTable to the Digital Library on History of Science & Technology in China, and evaluate the data-storage strategy and PuntTable.

It is kept at a sufficiently general level to be widely applicable as well as compatible with a broad range of existing and evolving sensor and measurement standards. Its primary purpose is to serve as an extensible backbone for standards in the emerging semantic sensor web. It also provides a foundation for semantic reference systems by grounding the semantics of observations, as generators of data. In its current state, it does not yet deal with resolution and uncertainty, nor does it specify the notion of a semantic datum formally, but it establishes the ontological basis for these as well as other extensions.	geodetic datum;internet backbone;semantic sensor web	Werner Kuhn	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10436-7_3	computer science;data mining;database;information retrieval	Security	-38.97932153864749	1.0256923913335774	28785

It is said that if “raw data” is openly available on the Web, it will be used by other people to do wonderful things. But, it would be better to show a use case together with that data, especially in the dawn of LOD. Therefore, we are proceeding with both of LOD content generation and its application for a specific domain. The application addresses an issue of information retrieval in the field, and the mechanism of LOD generation from the Web might be applied to the other domain. Firstly, we demonstrate the use of our mobile application, which searches a plant fitting the environmental conditions obtained by the smartphone’s sensors. Then, we introduce our approach of the LOD generation, and present an evaluation showing its practical effectiveness.	built-in self-test;collective intelligence;ecosystem;field research;global positioning system;information retrieval;mashup (web application hybrid);mobile app;sensor;smartphone;world wide web	Takahiro Kawamura;Akihiko Ohsuga	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-35173-0_7	plant;sensor;field;level of detail;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-46.21539342743017	1.650348529284548	28842

Since habitats are essentially associated with lives and behaviour of animals and plants the framework incorporates an abstract model of an organism. This enables the spatial extensions of habitats to be characterised in terms of the possible ‘life trajectories’ of organisms constrained by the physical properties of a geographic region and by the biological requirements for their survival.	habitat;ontology (information science);requirement;semiconductor industry	Brandon Bennett	2010		10.3233/978-1-60750-535-8-31	knowledge management;semantics;computer science;ontology;habitat	Vision	-39.28185614902322	0.16171773313314963	28869

Now we know where we are, we have stars, we know that atoms are rather like stars. We know how the universe grows and shrinks. We know the big bang and everything about the universe. However, the question, of course, is, Who are we? What is inside us? What makes us work? I don’t mean the physiology, the bones and the muscles. What I mean is who we are, how we think, how we feel, how we talk to each other. What makes a civilization of us? Here we are; now that we know the atoms and the stars, we have to know ourselves. All of us here in this hall are really joining in that great search, and to it many of us have dedicated our careers and lives. Here is what I am going to talk about. It’s not even an overview. It’s really how I feel about where we started, how we’ve been going, and where we are going to—all of us now.	bang file	Oliver G.

Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is the format used to display geospatial points in Google Earth, Google Maps, and Google Maps for Mobile. Some tags are optional for programming with KML. Because this is a mark-up language, key words or tags are used to generate geographic features and map elements. In each element, the tags must be in a specific order within the KML. When Google Maps is generating a map within the KML the features and elements are drawn within a linear progression through the coded file. Utilization of this KML data for real-time mapping activities on land surveying and engineering projects is investigated in this research. This research will show how producing database files in the office or field and making the data available to users in real-time.	color gradient;delimiter;geographic information system;google earth;keyhole markup language;land information system;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;real-time web;server (computing)	Stacey D.

Fujitsu has been researching magneto-optic recording technologies for rewritable optical disk, and has developed a disk sub-system with initiative of the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) in Tokyo. The drive has a large storage capacity of 8.9 GB/spindle with a few seconds of access time. It can store data economically in a small floor space, and it can be used as a supplement or partial alternative to magnetic disk drives or tape library units. The sub-system will be used from the beginning of 1989. This paper explains the drive technologies, support software as well as the application of this new sub-system at NAL.	access time;disk storage;floppy disk;hard disk drive;magnetic storage;network abstraction layer;read-only memory;tape drive;tape library;write once, run anywhere	Y.

Unless you've been trapped in a professional meeting with me recently you probably haven't heard of the scicomm community. That's short for Science Communication and it's full of people from all sorts of fields—except computer science. I first found out about scicomm from civil and environmental engineers. Last year, while working as an external evaluator, I became involved with a group of researchers at Arizona State University who were inspired by the Alda Center's work on training scientists to communicate their science more effectively using techniques such as improvisational theater [1]. (And yes, that is the Alan Alda.) The folks at ASU invited me to join them for an immersive team building experience at a ranch in the Sonoran desert in July. I found myself thrown in with a group of engineers, artists, a political I ENLISTED TWITTER TO HELP ME WRITE THIS issue's Percolations column. It was part of a spontaneous experiment to overcome writer's block. I was having trouble thinking about how to tell all of you that you should take part in #sci-comm. Banging my head on the wall I was going around in circles trying to figure out how to convey just how important it is for as many of us as possible to start talking beyond our usual academic circles about what we do and why it matters. It all came to head a few days ago when someone in the computing education field said they saw me as having expertise in social media and branding. What? Me? Evaluator, researcher, educator, entrepreneur , yes. But social media and branding expert? As I absorbed the seeming absurdity of this idea, my memory jogged to recent conversations. This was not the first time someone had asked me for advice on developing a social media strategy. What led the conversation in this direction? For years I've been interested in policy issues and how to communicate effectively to a diverse audience. I am concerned we aren't getting the word out to the right people that computing can and should make a positive difference in the world. As a result, I've explored a variety of routes to deliver the message above and beyond traditional conference and journal pubs.

The most important types are moving point and moving region. Key Points Amoving point represents an entity for which only the time dependent position is of interest. Amoving region describes an entity for which the time dependent location as well as the shape and extent are relevant. For example, moving points could represent people, vehicles such as cars, trucks, ships or planes, or animals; moving regions could be hurricanes, forest fires, spread of epidemic diseases etc. Moving point data may be captured by GPS devices or RFID tags; moving region data may result from processing sequences of satellite images, for example. Geometrically, moving points or moving regions exist in a 3D (2D + time) space, if the movement is modeled within the 2D plane; for moving points this can be easily extended to 4D (3D + time). Beyond the most relevant types of moving point and moving region, to obtain a closed system there are related time dependent data types, such as real-valued functions or time dependent boolean values. To have a uniform terminology these types are also calledmoving real and moving bool, respectively. Static spatial data types such as point, line or region, and standard data Spatio-Temporal Data Warehouses S 2731 types are also needed. The data types include suitable operations such as: trajectory: mpoint ! line Projection of a moving point into the plane inside: mpoint mregion ! mbool When is a moving point inside a moving region distance: mpoint point ! mreal Distance between a moving and a static point Cross-references ▶Moving Objects Databases and Tracking	closed system;dvd region code;data mining;database;global positioning system;radio-frequency identification	Nikos Mamoulis	2009		10.1007/978-0-387-39940-9_361	temporal database;usable;electrical impedance;acoustics;ferrite (magnet);signal-to-noise ratio;physics	ML	-34.04959831634134	-3.148959451905686	29360

The aim is to achieve reduction of cost and carbon emissions in the built environment by up to 20% simply by properly managing digital information and 3D models. Even though previous works in the field concentrated mainly on defining novel WebGL frameworks and later on the efficiency of 3D data delivery over the Internet, there is still the emerging need for a practical solution that would provide ubiquitous access to 3D assets, whether it is for large international enterprises or individual members of the general public. We have, therefore, developed a novel platform leveraging the latest open web-based technologies such as AngularJS and X3DOM in order to define an industrial-strength collaborative cloud hosting service 3drepo.io. Firstly, we introduce the work and outline the high-level system architecture as well as improvements in relation to previous work. Next, we describe database and front-end considerations with emphasis on scalability and enhanced security. Finally, we present several performance measurement experiments and a selection of real-life industrial use cases. We conclude that jQuery provides performance benefits over AngularJS when manipulating large scene graphs in web browsers.	3d modeling;angularjs;cloud computing;control system;digital data;experiment;high- and low-level;open web;open-source software;real life;scalability;scene graph;systems architecture;version control;web application;web3d;webgl;world wide web;x3d;jquery	Timothy Scully;Jozef Dobos;Timo Sturm;Yvonne Jung	2015		10.1145/2775292.2775312	simulation;engineering;operations management;world wide web	Web+IR	-62.05769755747855	2.2611055497041463	29454

e9da89e47a35181b4a8fb0b96fb01f4953f48158	wikihyperglossary (whg): an information literacy technology for chemistry documents	biological patents;biomedical journals;text mining;europe pubmed central;citation search;computer applications in chemistry;citation networks;theoretical and computational chemistry;computational biology bioinformatics;research articles;abstracts;open access;life sciences;clinical guidelines;full text;rest apis;orcids;europe pmc;documentation and information in chemistry;biomedical research;bioinformatics;literature search	BACKGROUND The WikiHyperGlossary is an information literacy technology that was created to enhance reading comprehension of documents by connecting them to socially generated multimedia definitions as well as semantically relevant data. The WikiHyperGlossary enhances reading comprehension by using the lexicon of a discipline to generate dynamic links in a document to external resources that can provide implicit information the document did not explicitly provide. Currently, the most common method to acquire additional information when reading a document is to access a search engine and browse the web. This may lead to skimming of multiple documents with the novice actually never returning to the original document of interest. The WikiHyperGlossary automatically brings information to the user within the current document they are reading, enhancing the potential for deeper document understanding.   RESULTS The WikiHyperGlossary allows users to submit a web URL or text to be processed against a chosen lexicon, returning the document with tagged terms. The selection of a tagged term results in the appearance of the WikiHyperGlossary Portlet containing a definition, and depending on the type of word, tabs to additional information and resources. Current types of content include multimedia enhanced definitions, ChemSpider query results, 3D molecular structures, and 2D editable structures connected to ChemSpider queries. Existing glossaries can be bulk uploaded, locked for editing and associated with multiple social generated definitions.   CONCLUSION The WikiHyperGlossary leverages both social and semantic web technologies to bring relevant information to a document. This can not only aid reading comprehension, but increases the users' ability to obtain additional information within the document. We have demonstrated a molecular editor enabled knowledge framework that can result in a semantic web inductive reasoning process, and integration of the WikiHyperGlossary into other software technologies, like the Jikitou Biomedical Question and Answer system. Although this work was developed in the chemical sciences and took advantage of open science resources and initiatives, the technology is extensible to other knowledge domains. Through the DeepLit (Deeper Literacy: Connecting Documents to Data and Discourse) startup, we seek to extend WikiHyperGlossary technologies to other knowledge domains, and integrate them into other knowledge acquisition workflows.	browsing;chemspider;glossary;inductive reasoning;information literacy;knowledge acquisition;lexicon;list comprehension;molecular structure;molecule editor;multimedia;open reading frame;portlet;question (inquiry);science;semantic web;tracer;uniform resource locator;web search engine;search a word	Michael Anthony Bauer;Daniel Berleant;Andrew P.

Retelab Data Grid was deployed as a portlet in the Retelab web portal, adding new functionalities to the project. Such a system allows the users to search and manage the geoscientific data stored in the Retelab datasets through data attributes. Thus, the users do not need to know where or how data are stored. Retelab users can upload their own data and label them with metadata, which is a way of sharing information through the Ocean research community. We developed some procedures to use data as parameters in running jobs in the Grid system using a comfortable and visual interface. The Data Grid also provides different means for analyzing and visualizing data stored in Retelab.		David Mera;José Manuel Cotos;Joaquín A.

bef263cefaba6ebc2143f718768d708940b204ff	guest editorial special section on advances in discrete-event systems for automation	special issues and sections;special issues and sections discrete event systems;discrete event systems	I N RECENT years, the tremendous growth of computer technology has led to the proliferation of a class of highly complex dynamical systems, with the distinct attribute that their behavior is determined by the asynchronous occurrence of certain event types; because of this attribute these systems are termed Discrete Event Systems (DES). Examples of DES are encountered in many traditional application areas, such as automated manufacturing, computer networks, transportation, air traffic control, as well as in emerging areas like healthcare, communication and information processing, and the allocation and management of technical, human and financial resources. Furthermore, in the recent past, a large number of researchers and practitioners have devoted their attention to this class of dynamical systems in order to address a series of difficult problems, often combinatorial in nature, that concern their analysis, optimization and control. The goal of this Special Section is to bring together researchers and practitioners from, both, academia and industry to highlight the state-of-the-art of the DES-related research endeavor and its applications. The selected papers present efficient scientific and engineering solutions to a series of problems related to DES, including their supervisory control, fault diagnosis, resource allocation, state estimation, and deadlock prevention and avoidance. They also provide a vision for future research and development. Even though a considerable effort has been devoted to the aforementioned topics in the last decades, many theoretical problems in this framework are still open, or their solution is only limited to small case studies, while the scaling of these solutions to problems of industrial relevance remains a challenge. A more detailed description of the research activity that is currently taking place within the DES-focused research community , can be epitomized as follows: 1) As mentioned above, a major requirement for the field is the effective transfer of its current theoretical developments to the applications that motivated these developments in the first place. A particular challenge along these lines is the very high complexity of the addressed DES problems and their derived solutions. This complexity manifests itself in the computational effort that is involved in the development of the target solutions, but also in the structure and the size of the formal representations of the DES dynamics that are employed by, and result from, the performed computation. The DES community has tried to circumvent these challenges by pursuing the following strategies: a) The development of decomposing or approximate solution strategies, based …	approximation algorithm;automation;complex dynamics;computation;computer;deadlock;detached eddy simulation;dynamical system;image scaling;information processing;mathematical optimization;relevance	Christos G.

Balmin K. Beyer V. Ercegovac J. McPherson F. Özcan H. Pirahesh E. Shekita Y. Sismanis S. Tata Y. Tian With the rapid increase in the volume of data that enterprises are producing, enterprises are adopting large-scale data processing platforms such as HadoopA to store, manage, and run deep analytics to gain actionable insights from their Bbig data.[ At IBM Research Almaden, we have been helping enterprise customers build solutions exploiting data-intensive analytics. Our deep experience with actual users has led to an extensive understanding of the platform requirements needed to support these solutions, and our goal is to provide a powerful analytics platform, which we call eXtreme Analytics Platform (XAP), that can be used to create solutions for customer problems that have not been economically feasible to solve until now. XAP provides Jaql [i.e., JavaScriptA Object Notation (JSON) query language, a scripting language to specify data flows, tools, and techniques to optimize the runtime execution of these flows], an improved task scheduler, connectors to data warehouses, and libraries for advanced analytics. Many of these technologies have been transferred to the IBM InfoSphere BigInsightsi product. In this paper, we describe the overall design principles and technology of XAP.	2.5d;apache hadoop;apache xap;collocation;column-oriented dbms;data-intensive computing;electronic data processing;heterogeneous system architecture;ibm research;infosphere;json;jaql;job stream;library (computing);query language;relational database;requirement;scheduling (computing);scripting language;the open group;windows task scheduler	Andrey Balmin;Kevin S.

One potential application relates to the process of urban planning in which applications are required to be made readily available for public comment. Relevant information is typically presented in the form of site plans and a limited number of architectural drawings that can be difficult for the general public to fully comprehend. Web3D models of proposals in the context of the site and viewed from different directions have the potential to provide the general public and the planning authority with a better understanding of the visual impact of the proposals. This paper, through a case study of a proposed residential development, demonstrates the use of standard Web browser as a GUI (graphical user interface) to control the display of a 3D model.

This article discusses the needs of ontology development for data mining. Based on a domain analysis of knowledge representations in data mining, it proposes a generic structure of ontologies for data mining. Furthermore, this article specifies the unique ontology resources of the subdomain of innovative data mining with incomplete data. A project on an ontology-based data mining system for discovering knowledge from incomplete data demonstrates the effectiveness of ontology in knowledge management.		Hai Wang;Shouhong Wang	2008	J.

5504ab1bbf7439b834a7da7adc0ac609d5070590	modelling and analysing dynamic linked data using rdf and sparql		Analyses of dynamic Linked Data are inherently dependent on changes in RDF graphs (logical level) and what happens on the HTTP and networking level (physical level). However, these dependencies have been reflected in previous works only to a limited extent, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions about the dynamics of the data. To overcome this limitation, we tackle the problem of modelling dynamic Linked Data to capture changes both at the logical and physical level of Linked Data. We present our work in progress in this paper. We propose an RDF model of descriptions of both the HTTP requests/responses/networking errors made when downloading, and the RDF data thus obtained. The model allows for carrying out more comprehensive analyses of dynamic Linked Data in a declarative fashion. We present a processing pipeline to distil such modelled RDF data from datasets created using LDspider, such as the Dynamic Linked Data Observatory. We show the usefulness of our model by repeating three analyses of a previous paper on the Dynamic Linked Data Observatory using SPARQL queries, which we executed on data that follows our proposed model on three SPARQL engines.	declarative programming;download;hypertext transfer protocol;linked data;local information systems;resource description framework;sparql;time series	Tobias Käfer;Alexandra Wins;Maribel Acosta	2017			rdf;linked data;sparql;database;computer science	Web+IR	-38.1078032924956	0.8769298178529187	30376

Handling properties associated to objects not because of the objects' nature but because of the objects' position, calls for dealing -at the semantic modeling level-with space, location and dimensionality of objects, spatial relationships, space-depending attributes, and scale and generalization of representations. In order to accomplish this in the framework of ER and its derivatives, we introduce special entity sets, relationships, and add new constructs. The rationale as well as examples of usage of the Geo-ER model from actual projects are presented.	design rationale;enhanced entity–relationship model;geo (microformat)	Thanasis Hadzilacos;Nectaria Tryfona	1997	SIGMOD Record	10.1145/262762.262766	semantic data model;spatial relation;conceptual model;entity–relationship model;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;conceptual model;data mining;database	DB	-36.538360831989856	-2.2335807722681507	30430
89245ca2e7ed402d04d31f344be6d8112c95ff80	an integrated biomedical ontology mapping strategy based on multiple mapping methods		In investigating relevant ontology mapping methods, this study focuses on the integration method of ontology mapping. Many resources such as PubMed and UMLS are used for designing the multi-dimensional calculation parameters of ontology mapping, with consideration for morphology, semantics, attributes, and background knowledge. Furthermore, we develop a study on biomedical ontology mapping methods based on multiple strategies, as well as experimentally validate the proposed ontology mapping framework. similar factors. These heterogeneous resources should be mapped and integrated because biomedicine is characterized by a knowledge hierarchy of close internal relations. Ontology mapping is the basis of semantic interoperability, and the mapping relation between ontologies facilitates across-dataset inquiry submission, data conversion, and knowledge inference for multiple heterogeneous resources. Focusing on the characteristics and status quo of ontological resources in the biomedical field, this paper consolidates ontology mapping concepts and methods, and puts forward an approach that is suitable for the biomedical field. The proposed method can support most biomedically related ontology mapping tasks and serves as basis for the integration of biochemical resources, the semantic interoperability of heterogeneous resources, and the sharing and application of distributed resources. The method also serves as technical support for large-scale biochemical knowledge sharing, integration, release, and semantic research on knowledge organization systems and other upper-level biomedical applications. These requirements reflect the considerable significance of studying biomedical ontology mapping.	semantic integration	An Fang;Na Hong;Sizhu Wu;Jianli Zheng;Qing Qian	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-54370-8_32	upper ontology;open biomedical ontologies;ontology alignment;bibliographic ontology;computer science;bioinformatics;knowledge management;ontology;data mining;ontology-based data integration;process ontology;suggested upper merged ontology	NLP	-41.35067933492019	2.230037212639156	30486

This example allows us to illustrate some of the formal choices that have to be made by those who seek network solutions to natural language processing (NLP) problems. We provide some pointers into the extensive body of Al knowledge representation publications that have been concerned with the theory of inheritance over the last dozen years or so. We go on to identify the three rather separate traditions that have led to the current work in NLP. We then provide a fairly comprehensive literature survey of the use that computational linguists have made of inheritance networks over the last two decades, organized by reference to levels of linguistic description. In the course of this survey, we draw the reader's attention to each of the papers in these issues of Computational Linguistics and set them in the context of related work.	computation;computational linguistics;knowledge representation and reasoning;natural language processing	Walter Daelemans;Koenraad De Smedt;Gerald Gazdar	1992	Computational Linguistics		natural language processing;knowledge representation and reasoning;computer science;artificial intelligence;linguistics	NLP	-56.94289262593844	-21.31420859129878	30589

There are two parts to the paper. In the first part I tell my story of the early day of the origins of the Irish School of the VDM (VDM), beginning with pre-history in 1978 up until the radical decisions of 1995 which led to the Irish School of Constructive Mathematics (M c ). In 1995 the School committed itself to the development of the modelling of (computing) systems in full generality. This was achieved by embracing Category Theory and by exploring a geometry of formal methods using techniques of fiber bundles. From fiber bundles to sheaves was a natural step. Concurrently, the School moved from the algebra of monoids to categories, and from categories to topoi ( alt. toposes). The second part of the paper illustrates, with simple examples, how I introduce topos logic into modelling in 2001.	category theory;control-alt-delete;formal methods;vienna development method	Mícheál Mac an Airchinnigh	2001	J.

f627487ebb30317471c3e97a17242ac17bc9d442	second indo-u.s. workshop on mathematical chemistry may 30-june 3, 2000 duluth, minnesota		The Second Indo -U.S. Workshop on Mathematical Chemistry with Applications to Drug Discovery, Cheminformatics, and Bioinformatics was held between May 30 and June 3, 2000 at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD), U.S.A., under the joint sponsorship of the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI) of UMD and Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, West Bengal, India. This issue of the Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences contains papers presented at the Workshop. The idea for this international Indo -U.S. Workshop on Mathematical Chemistry Series originated with Dr. Subhash C. Basak, a Senior Scientist at NRRI/UMD, and received the enthusiastic support of Professor Dilip K. Sinha, Vice Chancellor, Visva Bharati University, India. Dr. Basak is the Co-Chairperson of the Workshop Series from U.S.A., and Dr. Sinha is the Co-Chair from India. The First Workshop of the series was held at Visva Bharati University, India, from January 9 to January 13, 1998. Over 100 scientists from four continents participated in the First Workshop, and its success indicated that such workshops should be held at regular intervals. Following that spirit the Second Indo U.S. Workshop was held in the U.S.A. in the Spring of 2000. The scope of the Second Workshop was broadened as compared to the First Workshop by including within its theme emerging fields such as combinatorial chemistry, genomics, bioinformatics and proteomics, toxicoinformatics, and computational toxicology. Over 125 scientists from four continents participated in the deliberations of this workshop. The 28 papers of this volume comprise part of the presentations from the Second Indo -U.S. Workshop. This Workshop was made possible by the generous support and understanding of NRRI and the University of Minnesota Duluth. In particular, we would like to thank Drs. Michael J.

9608a920c413cad8abb125046e39d71b4d37dbbd	phillip kaye, raymond laflamme and michele mosca, an introduction to quantum computing, oxford university press (2007) isbn 019857049x	quantum computer	Since the last decade of the 20th century, quantum computing and quantum information have been increasingly fascinating researchers in physics, computer science, and mathematics. It may be illustrative to look at the references of the book being reviewed to discover that out of more than 110 references to articles on quantum computing or quantum information theory, less than 5 were published before 1990. Quantum computing is a cross-disciplinary area in the intersection of theoretical computer science and quantum physics. The education on quantum computing therefore involves studies in both areas at least to some extent, and this is probably one of the reasons why a regular quantum computing course seems to be an exception rather than a rule in universities everywhere. As a new research area, quantum computing, as well as quantum information theory, includes a wide range of open research problems varying from practical matters to highly theoretical questions, from engineering to Hilbert spaces. As a new research area, quantum computing also suffers from an unestablished and very unstable education tradition. To educate a new generation of scientists familiar with quantum computing, accessible books on the topic are needed. Maybe they are not needed inevitably, but anyway they make education substantially easier.	control theory;hilbert space;information theory;international standard book number;michele mosca;open research;quantum computing;quantum information;quantum mechanics;theoretical computer science	Mika Hirvensalo	2007	Computer Science Review	10.1016/j.cosrev.2007.06.002	distributed computing;computer science;fuel tank;quantum computer;mechanical engineering	Theory	-58.55198504005787	-21.372865202502616	30873

66aca6532d9dd5abed5a1a4d4d1c91efcabf8506	gérer les informations temporelles dans et par les modèles informatiques		Temporal information proves to be prominent in many scientific problems. As regards Geography, temporal concerns are often in long or mean term interaction with spatial aspects and calendar issues. Practical and theoretical approaches necessarily crossreference various viewpoints from several scientific communities. The use of formal models is a means to make languages and practices more accurate and efficient, hence leading to more efficiency (consistency, correction, reusability...). The will to access larger, more and more complex and heterogeneous pieces of information, leads to master the way to populate and query data warehouses and knowledge bases. With several paradigms, computer science, provides models which can express and help solving many current and forthcoming problems. This paper gives an overview of the state of art in the matter of temporal modelling, accompanied with some meta-model instances and some insight into practical applications.

It discusses the nature of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) and how KOS can support digital library users. It projects a vision for designers to make and for users to demand better digital libraries. What is a digital library? The term “Digital Library” (DL) is used to refer to a range of systems, from digital object and metadata repositories, reference-linking systems, archives, and content management systems to complex systems that integrate advanced digital library services and support for research and practice communities. A DL may offer many technology-enabled functions and services that support users, both as information producers and as information users. Many of these functions appear in information systems that would not normally be considered digital libraries, making boundaries even more blurry. Instead of pursuing the hopeless quest of coming up with the definition of digital library, we present a framework that allows a clear and somewhat standardized description of any information system so that users can select the system(s) that best meet their requirements. Section 2 gives a broad outline; for more detail see the DELOS DL Reference Model [?].	archive;complex systems;content management system;digital library;information system;knowledge organization system;kolibrios;library (computing);model checking;reference model;requirement;virtual artifact	Dagobert Soergel	2009		10.1007/978-3-540-85434-0_2	library science;digital transformation;digital library;knowledge management	HCI	-44.82928911946372	2.077567842472622	31131

The capabilities to pass along knowledge, not only geographically but also generationally, have formed the bedrock of our civilizations. We are in the midst of a silent revolution driven by the technological advancements: no longer are computers just a fixture of our physical world but have they been so deeply woven into our daily routines that they are now occupying the center of our lives. No where are the phenomena more prominent than our reliance on the World Wide Web. More and more often, the web has become the primary source of fresh information and knowledge. In addition to general consumption, the availability of large amount of contents and behavioral data has also instigated new interdisciplinary research activities in the areas of information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning, behavioral studies, social computing and data mining. This talk will use web search as an example to demonstrate how these new research activities and technologies have help the web evolve from a collection of documents to becoming the largest knowledge base in our history. During this evolution, the web is transformed from merely reacting to our needs to a living entity that can anticipate and push timely information to wherever and whenever we need it. How the scholarly activities and communications can be impacted will also be illustrated and elaborated, and some observations derived from a web scale data set, newly release to the public, will also be shared.	computer;data mining;information retrieval;knowledge base;machine learning;natural language processing;primary source;printing;scalability;social computing;test fixture;web search engine;world wide web	Kuansan Wang	2015		10.1145/2740908.2741739	web development;web modeling;web analytics;web mapping;web design;web accessibility initiative;web standards;computer science;data science;semantic web;web navigation;social semantic web;data mining;knowledge extraction;web intelligence;web engineering;web 2.0;world wide web;mashup	Web+IR	-46.65716019446305	-18.618399812983125	31305

These sources often use different identifiers for data that describe the same real-word entity (for example an artist, a conference, an organization). In this paper we propose a new probabilistic Entity Linkage algorithm for identifying and linking data that refer to the same real-world entity. Our approach focuses on managing entity linkage information in heterogeneous information spaces using probabilistic methods. We use a Bayesian network to model evidences which support the possible object matches along with the interdependencies between them. This enables us to flexibly update the network when new information becomes available, and to cope with the different requirements imposed by applications build on top of information spaces.	algorithm;bayesian network;identifier;interdependence;linkage (software);requirement;spaces	Ekaterini Ioannou;Claudia Niederée;Wolfgang Nejdl	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69534-9_41	computer science;probabilistic method;information integration;data integration;bayesian network;linked data;data integrity;data mining;database;information retrieval	DB	-36.31446213385001	3.0032627253786717	31429
d36ee88b737116b28e1a1b195ed6ad5a9753bbc5	applying discrete global grid systems to sensor networks and the internet of things		The rapid growth in global sensor networks is leading to an explosion in the volume, velocity and variety of geospatial and geoscientific data. This coupled with the increasing integration of geospatial data into our everyday lives is also driving an increasing expectation of spatial information on-demand, and with minimal delay. The challenge we face in meeting these expectations is how to convert the vast and increasing volume of data being delivered from an increasingly diverse network of sensor things into meaningful information in a timely fashion. A key factor in meeting these challenges is the development and implementation of international standards (through the Open Geospatial Consortium [OGC®] and other international standards bodies) focused on establishing common methods and protocols that enable machine-to-machine transfer of data from sensors to people via the internet. However, until recently there has been a gap in the standardization of the spatial data architectures and technologies used to manage the geospatial data at the server-side and this has led to numerous ad-hoc and bespoke spatial data infrastructures being constructed which are potentially incompatible with each other and the wider ecosystem of the Internet of Things. Over the past 3 years the OGC has been working at filling this gap through the development the first international standard for Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), with this new standard expected to be published in 2017. DGGS are a form of Earth reference system that represents the Earth using a hierarchical equal-area tessellation of the surface of the Earth and are designed to ensure a repeatable representation of measurements that is better suited to today's requirements and technologies. A DGGS presents a common framework that is capable of linking very large multi-resolution and multi-domain datasets together to enable the next generation of analytic processes to be applied. To date, DGGS haven't been used directly in the context of sensor networks. This paper proposes to demonstrate the application of DGGS to the Internet of Things and to highlight the immense benefit and value of using standards to enable interoperability in the era of Big Data.	bespoke;big data;consortium;ecosystem;grid (spatial index);hoc (programming language);internet of things;interoperability;lithosphere;machine to machine;requirement;sensor;server (computing);server-side;velocity (software development)	Matthew B.

Totally 550 papers about the semantic information retrieval papers were collected from CNKI academic data base. Bibliometric analysis method and social network analysis software were employed. We drew the annual numbers of table, the paper sources distribu tion table, the authors distribution table, the themes distribution table and co-occurrence network of high-frequency keywords. Though these tables and graphics, the main conclusion is that semantic information retrieval re search are relatively weak force in China.

The fact that research can be fun is something unusual, even slightly difficult to understand for an outsider: science in general, and computer science in particular, gets definitely a bad press and has little charm. Computer science scholars are popularly identified with a bunch of bored, competitive nerds that work hard and rarely have fun. We all know this is far from true: most of us started to do research for fun, and fun is still often the spring of our talent. Although we like to keep this secret, sometimes applications come afterwards, whereas curiosity, amusement and enjoyment come first. In this issue, we allowed recreation to come into the limelight and phantasy to gain its long-due praise. Entertainment has been declined in various forms, according to different tastes and backgrounds, but we believe that all readers will be able to seize and share part of the authors’ pleasure.

500dc190da5d152a013780388fec9ab3fde5f286	text as a real population in a. a. cuprov's sense		"""Texts are characterised by collective categories (notion, set), dictionaries by distributive ones. In A.A. Čuprov's sense, stochastic sets correspond to real populations (collective notions), artificial aggregates (distributive notions), ideographic generalisation (sets uncertain in time), and relative historical notion (not certain in space). All four types of set exist in linguostatistical studies. The interpretation of the results of statistical applications in linguistics and philology requires clear understanding of the logical status of the instruments used, primarily that of the material analysed itself. This report deals with one aspect of the logical nature of the subject of linguostatistical studies, namely the logical nature of the population under study. In logic, discrimination between collective and distributive sets is quite fundamental. The formal definition of the above is that for distributive notions any predicate true for a notion will be equally true for any referent representing the notion. For example, """"table"""" as a notion has a working surface and something to fix it, and any concrete table has the same. On the contrary, for collective notions, a predicate true for the notion will not have sense in relation to the referents that represent it. Taking """"table"""" as a collective notion, it will be an aggregate of a working surface and a way of fixing it. In this case, however, working surface in its turn will not be composed of working surface and a way of fixing it, and the way of fixing will not be represented by working surface and a way of fixing it: components representing collective notions are heterogeneous. Briefly, a class of referents representing a distributive notion is an aggregate of similar elements, while a class of referents representing a collective notion is a set of heterogeneous elements of its design. This fundamental distinction between distributive and collective notions is stated in the beginning of any manual of logic, but further text always deals only with distributive notions, and the statements are formulated in relation of those that are declared to be fundamental laws of logic. One such is the law of inverse relation between a notion's volume and its content. However, in such areas as geographical division into districts or in so-called bibliographical classifications, the relation between volume and content of notions becomes direct, not inverse. This is an apparently confusing discovery, but further analysis shows that all is right: after all, the notions under consideration are collective, not distributive. No manual of logic mentions such a situation. But some papers from the early 20th century (see e.g. the famous Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovev, 1986) pointed out that a notion's volume and content can be in direct relation. From this point of view, it is now generally accepted to think of concrete text as a collective notion. On the contrary, lexicon, in particular that of a given text, is thought to be a distributive notion. This interpretation is now a commonplace, the more so as it is in accordance with the distinction between collective and distributive sets by Russell. Confusing these two types of aggregates leads to the so-called paradoxes of naive set theory. One of the paradoxes was found by Russell. * Address correspondence to: Sergeij Čebanov, 31 Moika emb., kv. 12, St. Petersburg 191186, Russia. E-mail: chebanov@sc2747.spb.edu.

MARTYNENKO Let us take two discourses, in the first of which a set includes (but not equals) another, and in the second vice versa (note that the numbers are transfinite), as if we took all possible books and all possible pages in those books as a single set. In this case we have the subset of all the pages including the subset of all the books, or vice versa. Russell concludes as follows: always distinguish between different types of sets and never construct the sets from heterogeneous elements. As to our example, this means that there should not be sets composed of both books and pages, and the books should not be constructed from the pages, nor divided into separate pages. An alternative approach is developed in Lesnievskij's (1929) mereology as collective set theory, as opposed to """"naive"""" set theory as distributive set theory. This way, we deal with never overlapping logics and only need to not confuse those to be correct in our proceeding. In developing the ideas above of the stratigrapher, palaeontologist and theoretical biologist Mejen (1974, 1975,1977, 1989), the opposition of meronomy and taxonomy was proposed (which was necessary for the creation of a general theory of stratigraphy, and also explained many things in biological and other typology). Meronomy divides the representants of collective notions into heterogeneous components, while taxonomy divides the classes of similar elements into even more homogeneous groups or combines them into larger groups. Such anopposition became fundamental in the description of all kinds of classification and typology. And meronomy was found to be simply identical with what is called morphology in typology. New nuances of sense in the opposition under discussion were revealed in the system approach. Thus Malinovskij (1970) (son of A.A. Bogdanov, the originator of tectology) distinguishes between hard (with a fixed number of elements and constant relations between them) and soft (with a non-fixed or undetermined number of elements and relations between them) systems. Šrejder (1978), substantiating the opposition of set theory and system theory, discriminates between internal and external systems, the latter being sets rather than systems (distributive sets). As noted by Šrejder, """"external system"""" appears here as a class of states or an aggregate of components of an internal one. This opposition turned out to be useful in the presentation of taxonomical and meronomical problems (Čebanov, 1980). The resulting tree of notions may be represented as in Table 1. When this structure of categories was built, the question arose as to whether there might be more classes of equally fundamental notions. Then, in the late 1970's, the question was not Table 1.

EDGAR is the SEC’s (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) means of automating the collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions. Some entities are regulated by the SEC (e.g. publicly traded firms) and are required, by law, to file with the SEC. Our focus is on making use of EDGAR to get information about company offers to purchase stock, known as tender offers. These offers are filed with companies, using their Central Index Key (CIK). The CIK is used on the SEC’s computer system to identify corporations and individual people who have filed a disclosure with the SEC. We show how to map a stock ticker symbol into a CIK and how to extract tender offer data. Our example show how we extract the number of shares tendered, the price range for the auction, the honoring of “odd lots” and the initial termination date for the auction. The methodology for converting the web data source into internal data structures is based on using HTML as input into a parser-call-back facility that builds up a data structure using a context sensitive table data. Screen scraping is a popular means of data entry, but the unstructured nature of HTML pages makes this a challenge.	computer security;data mining;data structure;data validation;entity;html;ksd-64;procurement	Douglas Lyon	2008	Journal of Object Technology	10.5381/jot.2008.7.7.c2	data structure;computer science;engineering;software engineering;data mining;programming language;data collection	DB	-34.98426450742835	-8.239258417318974	31960
174d330b2c22aa4eaf53a7861e4d999f3d7cf3a8	editorial: the future of power law research	power law	I argue that power law research must move from focusing on observation, interpretation, and modeling of power law behavior to instead considering the challenging problems of validation of models and control of systems. 1. The Problem with Power Law Research To begin, I would like to recall a humorous insight from the paper of Fabrikant, Koutsoupias, and Papadimitriou [Fabrikant et al. 01], consisting of this quote and the following footnote. “Power laws ... have been termed ‘the signature of human activity’...” The study of power laws, especially in networks, has clearly exploded over the last decade, with seemingly innumerable papers and even popular books, such as Barabási’s Linked [Barabási 02] and Watts’ Six Degrees [Watts 03]. Power laws are, indeed, everywhere. Despite this remarkable success, I believe that research into power laws in computer networks (and networks more generally) suffers from glaring deficiencies that need to be addressed by the community. Coping with these deficiencies should lead to another great burst of exciting and compelling research. To explain the problem, I would like to make an analogy to the area of string theory. String theory is incredibly rich and beautiful mathematically, with a simple and compelling basic starting assumption: the universe’s building blocks do not really correspond to (zero-dimensional) points, but to small 1“They are certainly the product of one particular kind of human activity: looking for power laws...” [Fabrikant et al. 01] © A K Peters, Ltd. 1542-7951/05 $0.50 per page 525 526 Internet Mathematics (one-dimensional) strings. Many different versions and variations of string theory exist. String theory is an incredibly popular area of physics, both with researchers and with the general populace. The mathematical richness, simple starting points, large number of variations, and popularity are all characteristics also shared by current research in power laws. There is, however, an unpleasant problem with string theory: it has not been experimentally validated, and it is not currently clear what will be required to validate it. There has not been an actual experiment that shows that string theory successfully predicts something that is not also explained by other existing theories, and current suggestions for potential experiments to pass this hurdle appear well outside the realm of what is possible in the foreseeable future. In an era where evolution and intelligent design have set the stage for the question “What is science?”, the issue that there is apparently no adequate way to verify or falsify string theory is rightly seen as a major flaw. This problem may be corrected in time, and I do not wish to suggest that string theory is not a valuable scientific contribution. The current state, however, creates a litany of challenging questions about the fruitfulness of this line of research. I would argue that we are now facing a similar problem in research on power laws in computer networks, and this signals that we must actively change the research agenda. Specifically, while numerous models that yield power law behavior have been suggested and, in fact, the number of such models continues to grow rapidly, no general mechanisms or approaches have been suggested that allow one to validate that a suggested model is appropriate. Like the string theorists, we have beautiful frameworks, theory, and models—indeed, we have perhaps far too many models—but we have been hesitant in moving to the next steps, which could transform this promising beginning into a truly remarkable new area of science. To make my case, let me introduce a rough taxonomy of the types of results that one could aim for in studying power laws. (a) Observe: Gather data on the behavior of a system and demonstrate that a power law distribution appears to fit the relevant data. (b) Interpret: Explain the significance of the power law behavior to the system. (c) Model: Propose an underlying model that explains the power law behavior. (d) Validate: Find data to validate, and if necessary specialize or modify, the model. (e) Control: Use the understanding from the model to control, modify, and improve the system behavior. Mitzenmacher: Editorial: The Future of Power Law Research 527 My argument is that most research on power laws has focused on observing, interpreting, and modeling, with a current emphasis on modeling. As a community, we have done almost nothing on validation and control, and we must actively move towards this kind of research. Unlike string theory, where validation and control are hampered by nature and constrained by what is physically possible, I believe that in networks we can, in most cases, successfully validate our models and use them to control systems. As an example, consider a power law that has been the subject of significant research: the distribution of in-links and out-links on the directed graph corresponding to the pages of the World Wide Web (see, e.g., [Barabási et al. 99, Broder et al. 00, Kleinberg et al. 99]). Early work on the web graph discovered that these distributions followed a power law, and the significance for applications was clear. In-degree was used early on by search engines such as AltaVista to rank web pages, and the power law distribution ensured that this approach was reasonably useful, as only a small number of pages were likely to have a significantly larger number of in-links. A significant amount of historical and recent theoretical work has led to models for why power law behavior occurs, as detailed in various surveys [Mitzenmacher 04, Newman 05]. For the web graph, the primary model of study has been variations of preferential attachment: the more links a web page has, the more links it is likely to obtain in the future. But even for this specific problem, there has been little or no systemic or theoretical work covering validation or control. Validation is important, because there are numerous models that yield power laws, and in many cases more than one of these models can reasonably be used to explain an observed power law behavior. For example, models other than preferential attachment have been used to describe link behavior, and some evidence has been given that preferential attachment is not a suitable explanation (see, e.g., [Huberman and Adamic 99]). On the issue of control, it now seems clear that the presence of search engines (especially Google) has affected how people link to web pages. There is less need for people to explicitly put in links in their web pages when the links are easily found on Google; however, if people reduce how often they link to pages, this might affect the performance of Google’s algorithms. Could this impact and its effects have been modeled appropriately ahead of time? (A model for this situation was examined in [Chakrabarti et al. 05].) This path of observation, interpretation, and modeling has been repeated in many domains. I would argue, however, that without validating a model it is not clear that one understands the underlying behavior and therefore how the behavior might change over time. It is not enough to plot data and demonstrate a power law, allowing one to say things about current behavior; one wants to 528 Internet Mathematics ensure that one can accurately predict future behavior appropriately, and that requires understanding the correct underlying model. For example, barring major changes, will the degree distribution of web pages still look the same two years from now? Recent work suggests that the density of edges in various power law graphs, such as citation graphs and the Autonomous Systems graph, may be increasing over time [Leskovec et al. 05]. If the same holds in the graph of web pages, the answer may be no. At this point we do not know enough about the web graph to answer the question. Further, from the practical point of view, one would like to take the model and use it to control the system. Suppose that Google could somehow encourage people to create more high-quality links, and it wanted to determine if it could do so in a way that was worth the cost. This would require not only validating the underlying model but also understanding how the model would respond to control mechanisms, such as advertising, contests, or direct payments, that might increase links.	algorithm;andrei broder;attachments;autonomous system (internet);book;citation graph;control system;data validation;degree distribution;directed graph;emoticon;experiment;flaw hypothesis methodology;interpretation (logic);norm (social);point of view (computer hardware company);rough set;six degrees of separation;string (computer science);theory;watts humphrey;web page;web search engine;webgraph;word lists by frequency;world wide web	Michael Mitzenmacher	2005	Internet Mathematics	10.1080/15427951.2005.10129112	power law;artificial intelligence;scientific law;mathematics;management science;statistics	ECom	-56.35798411195957	-23.174830798202322	31998

91c40af29033d614ac4fceb0af04cc94e404d8b5	miscomputation in software: learning to live with errors		Computer programs do not always work as expected. In fact, ominouswarnings about the desperate state of the software industry continue to be released with almost ritualistic regularity. In this paper, we look at the 60 years history of programming and at the different practical methods that software community developed to live with programming errors. We do so by observing a class of students discussing different approaches to programming errors. While learning about the different methods for dealing with errors, we uncover basic assumptions that proponents of different paradigms follow. We learn about the mathematical attempt to eliminate errors through formal methods, scientific method based on testing, a way of building reliable systems through engineering methods, as well as an artistic approach to live coding that accepts errors as a creative inspiration. This way, we can explore the differences and similarities among the different paradigms. By inviting proponents of different methods into a single discussion, we hope to open potential for new thinking about errors. When should we use which of the approaches? And what can software development learn from mathematics, science, engineering and art? When programming or studying programming, we are often enclosed in small communities and we take our basic assumptions for granted. Through the discussion in this paper, we attempt to map the large and rich space of programming ideas and provide reference points for exploring, perhaps foreign, ideas that can challenge some of our assumptions.

e5460ba8790ad70334d8abc96714b04f9435a23b	landxml encoding of mixed 2d and 3d survey plans with multi-level topology		Cadastral spatial units around the world range from simple 2D parcels to complex 3D collections of spaces, defined at levels of sophistication from textural descriptions to complete, rigorous mathematical descriptions based on measurements and coordinates. The most common spatial unit in a cadastral database is the 2D land parcel—the basic unit subject to cadastral Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities (RRR). Built on this is a varying complexity of 3D subdivisions and secondary interests. Spatial units may also be subdivided into smaller units, with the remainder being kept as common property for the owners/tenants of the individual units. This has led to the adoption of hierarchical multi-level schemes. In this paper, we explore the encoding of spatial units in a way that highlights their 2D extent and topology, while fully defining their extent in the third dimension. Obviously, topological encoding itself is not new. However, having mixed a 2D and 3D topological structure is rather challenging. Therefore, despite the potential benefits of mixed 2D and 3D topology, it is currently not used in LandXML, one of the main and best documented formats when representing survey data. This paper presents a multi-level topological encoding for the purposes of survey plan representation in LandXML that is simple and efficient in space requirements, including the question of curved surfaces, (partly) unbounded spatial units, and grouping and division of 2D and 3D spatial units. No “off the shelf” software is available for validating newly lodged surveys and we present our prototype for this. It is further suggested that the conceptual model behind this encoding approach can be extend to the database schema itself.	database schema;prototype;requirement	Rodney James Thompson;Peter van Oosterom;Kean-Huat Soon	2017	ISPRS Int.

8ca91230c561f7b45ff863bc0ecd9d8cc4c7555c	etriks analytical environment: a modular high performance framework for medical data analysis	data analytics;data infrastructure;bioinformatics	Translational research is quickly becoming a science driven by big data. Improving patient care, developing personalized therapies and new drugs depend increasingly on an organization's ability to rapidly and intelligently leverage complex molecular and clinical data from a variety of large-scale partner and public sources. As analysing these large-scale datasets becomes computationally increasingly expensive, traditional analytical engines are struggling to provide a timely answer to the questions that biomedical scientists are asking. Designing such a framework is developing for a moving target as the very nature of biomedical research based on big data requires an environment capable of adapting quickly and efficiently in response to evolving questions. The resulting framework consequently must be scalable in face of large amounts of data, flexible, efficient and resilient to failure. In this paper we design the eTRIKS Analytical Environment (eAE), a scalable and modular framework for the efficient management and analysis of large scale medical data, in particular the massive amounts of data produced by high-throughput technologies. We particularly discuss how we design the eAE as a modular and efficient framework enabling us to add new components or replace old ones easily. We further elaborate on its use for a set of challenging big data use cases in medicine and drug discovery.	artificial intelligence;big data;high-throughput computing;personalization;scalability;throughput	Axel Oehmichen;Florian Guitton;Kai Sun;Jean Grizet;Thomas Heinis;Yike Guo	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	10.1109/BigData.2017.8257945	data mining;translational research;computer science;big data;scalability;use case;modular design	DB	-35.0011456707759	-2.2824895632958566	32426

6c8a6c4aedb54ba988cbe788a247015065ecee0d	letter from the special issue editors		"""The quality of data has always been important to businesses and intelligence, as policies and business decisions are often made based on analysis performed on data. This issue contains articles that explore different aspects of data quality that frequently arise in the context of multiple (Web) data sources providing overlapping, complementary, and sometimes contradictory information about the same concept or real world entity. It is therefore important to provide techniques for understanding the truthfulness and trustworthiness of data sources to the extent possible, and reconcile their differences in order to create a clean integrated view of the underlying data sources. Techniques for entity resolution, mapping, fusion, and data cleaning are important """" ingredients """" towards achieving such a clean unified view. The first three articles in this issue describe different approaches for understanding and improving data quality in terms of truthfulness, trustworthiness, and respectively, eliminating (unnecessary) nulls. In the article Truthfulness Analysis of Fact Statements Using the Web, Li, Meng, and Yu describe an approach for determining the truthfulness of fact statements obtained from the Web. Whether a fact statement is considered true depends in part on the degree of truth of alternatives to the fact statement. In the next article Corroborating Information from Web Sources, Marian and Wu describe how one can exploit corroboration (i.e., similar answers provided by different data sources) to provide a measure of trust in the answers obtained from different sources. In the article Eliminating NULLs with Subsumption and Complementation, Bleiholder, Herschel, and Naumann describe how data quality can be improved by data fusion operators, subsumption and complementation, that minimizes the number of nulls in data. In addition, the authors described a set of rewrite rules based on these two operators and other database primitives that can be used to optimize the process of eliminating nulls. The next two articles describe how constraints can be used to understand the quality of data and how different constraints that have been used for improving data quality can be captured uniformly in one language. In the article Efficient and Effective Analysis of Data Quality using Pattern Tableaux, Golab, Korn, and Srivastava describe the Data Auditor system, which can efficiently compute patterns of subsets of the underlying data that satisfy or violate a given constraint. The patterns derived are useful for understanding the semantics of the data.

5991f26b871c8fd8f675c11e44c445e3cebfbe7d	field studies with multimedia big data: opportunities and challenges (extended ver		Social multimedia users are increasingly sharing all kinds of data about the world. They do this for their own reasons, not to provide data for field studies—but the trend presents a great opportunity for scientists. The Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million (YFCC100M) dataset comprises 99 million images and nearly 800 thousand videos from Flickr, all shared under Creative Commons licenses. To enable scientists to leverage these media records for field studies, we propose a new framework that extracts targeted subcorpora from the YFCC100M, in a format usable by researchers who are not experts in big data retrieval and processing. This paper discusses a number of examples from the literature—as well as some entirely new ideas—of natural and social science field studies that could be piloted, supplemented, replicated, or conducted using YFCC100M data. These examples illustrate the need for a general new opensource framework for Multimedia Big Data Field Studies. There is currently a gap between the separate aspects of what multimedia researchers have shown to be possible with consumer-produced big data and the follow-through of creating a comprehensive field study framework that supports scientists across other disciplines. To bridge this gap, we must meet several challenges. For example, the framework must handle unlabeled and noisily labeled data to produce a filtered dataset for a scientist—who naturally wants it to be both as large and as clean as possible. This requires an iterative approach that provides access to statistical summaries and refines the search by constructing new classifiers. The first phase of our framework is available as Multimedia Commons Search (http://search. mmcommons.org, MMCS), an intuitive interface that enables complex search queries at a large scale. After outlining our proposal for the general framework and discussing the potential example studies, this paper describes and evaluates a practical application to the study of origami.	big data;data retrieval;field research;flickr;iteration;open-source software;ver (command);web search query	Mario Michael Krell;Julia Bernd;Yifan Li;Daniel Ma;Jaeyoung Choi;Michael Ellsworth;Damian Borth;Gerald Friedland	2017	CoRR		leverage (finance);labeled data;computer science;big data;multimedia;usable;commons	DB	-39.96307357529617	0.14764528650949768	32609

We show the architecture for data-intensive services and focus on the following fundamental functional properties: 1) enhancing search, 2) preprocessing, 3) and asynchronous transfer. We also developed a reference implementation of a framework for data-intensive services and applied it to a web archive that contains about 2 billion documents and greatly improved the access performance to the web archive at small development cost.	archive;data mining;data-intensive computing;preprocessor;prototype;reference implementation;remote desktop services;requirement;sensor;web archiving	Masahiro Tanaka;Yohei Murakami;Koji Zettsu	2012	2012 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Services Computing	10.1109/SCC.2012.75	computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	DB	-37.60989533790945	1.2225975824390225	32680

In an earlier work, we have proposed a semantic adaptation framework for multimedia documents. This framework captures the semantics of the document composition and transforms the relations between multimedia objects according to adaptation constraints. In this paper,we show that relying on document composition alone for adaptation restricts the set of relevant candidate solutions and may even divert the adaptation from the authors intent.Hence, we propose to introduce functional annotations to guide the adaptation process. Theses annotations allow to refine the role of multimedia objects in the document. We show that SMIL documents could embed functional annotations encoded in RDF. These multimedia documents are then adapted thanks to an interactive adaptation tool.	emergence;prototype;resource description framework;synchronized multimedia integration language	Sébastien Laborie;Jérôme Euzenat;Nabil Layaïda	2009	2009 Fourth International Workshop on Semantic Media Adaptation and Personalization	10.1109/SMAP.2009.19	computer science;database;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-40.46826720144277	-21.495933986682598	32870

This makes it difficult to find those data sources in the cloud which are relevant for a given information need. Existing search engines for the Semantic Web focus on instance-oriented information needs, i. e., searching for specific RDF instances or literals and exploring the search results. However, they do not address the question of finding linked data sources relevant to a schema-oriented information need, i. e., queries based on triple patterns relating to a specific combination of RDF types and/or properties. In this paper, we present the semantic search system LODatio leveraging a schema-level index for finding sources of Linked Data relevant to a schema-oriented information need. Beyond its capability to retrieve relevant data sources, LODatio actively supports the user in his schema-oriented search tasks. To this end, it provides ranked result lists of relevant data sources together with example snippets and an estimation of the result set size. Furthermore, LODatio provides support for novel features in semantic search such as recommending alternative queries in order to refine or broaden the result set.	cloud computing;information needs;linked data;result set;semantic web;semantic search;triplestore;web search engine	Thomas Gottron;Ansgar Scherp;Bastian Krayer;Arne Peters	2013		10.1145/2479832.2479841	database index;semantic search;computer science;linked data;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-35.68102380785486	4.103500015112429	32871

This longitudinal data is a potential gold mine for researchers like sociologists, politologists, media and market analysts, or experts on intellectual property. The LAWA project (Longitudinal Analytics of Web Archive data) is developing an Internet-based experimental testbed for large-scale data analytics on Web archive collections. Its emphasis is on scalable methods for this specific kind of big-data analytics, and software tools for aggregating, querying, mining, and analyzing Web contents over long epochs. In this paper, we highlight our research on {\em entity-level analytics} in Web archive data, which lifts Web analytics from plain text to the entity-level by detecting named entities, resolving ambiguous names, extracting temporal facts and visualizing entities over extended time periods. Our results provide key assets for tracking named entities in the evolving Web, news, and social media.	big data;digital recording;epoch (reference date);google analytics;named entity;scalability;sensor;social media;testbed;web archive;web analytics;world wide web;zeitgeist	Marc Spaniol;Gerhard Weikum	2012		10.1145/2187980.2188030	analytics;web modeling;web analytics;social media;computer science;data science;data mining;fire;web intelligence;cultural analytics;software analytics;law;world wide web;semantic analytics;intellectual property	ML	-41.555726603081865	-5.635550784762869	32892

7dc9eefb3cae07f30d37fb4c2f15abe7f2450fd7	software experience for an ontology-based approach for the definition of alarms in geographical sensor systems		This paper presents a system based on ontologies for the definition of alarms in sensor systems. Although we consider that the ontology and the system are interesting themselves, we have a special impact on their experience with the software tools used and the technology related to the Semantic Web. This approach is intended to illustrate the process for those readers not familiar with this field and who can consider the use of ontologies for their next developments. An ontology has been designed in the OWL language, complemented with Semantic Web Rule Language rules and search elements in the Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language. The set has offered satisfactory results in simulation. Other interesting contributions of this paper are: a survey of the available literature in the field of the use of Semantic Web technologies and ontologies for the detection of events from data obtained from sensors and a study on the tools and vocabularies to be used to create a system that interfaces with ontologies and an educational method—reporting our experience—to help university students understand this topic.	artificial intelligence;ontology (information science);semantic web rule language;semantic query;sensor;simulation;vocabulary;web ontology language	Nathan G.

1826810d084de6d7c256ccaf9a4521700e4c50ff	hla as an experimental backbone for autonomous system integration into operational field		A request for interdisciplinary project is a permanent call from all Panels working under NATO Science and Technology Organization such as System Analysis and Studies and Modelling and Simulation Group. Mu0026S as a scientific discipline has already proved its priceless role in Concept, Development and Experimentation throughout any domain. To investigate on potential integration of Autonomous System into operational field, the only low cost solution seems to be experimentation in synthetic distributed environment. Synthetic distributed environment is based on the cooperating entities employing a data interchange mechanism. The article is focused on the current data interchange mechanisms in synthetic distributed environment from the potential Autonomous Systems implementation into the operational field point of view. High Level Architecture (HLA) is selected as suitable candidate because of its maturity and widely acceptance in military projects. Firstly, the idea of an experimental framework is explained and drawbacks are identified. Secondly, the latest version of HLA Evolved is discussed, in particular the Federation Object Model that contains the common vocabulary for the proposed experimental framework. High level ontology of Autonomous Systems is depicted to define the minimum requested set of objects represented by attributes and transactions among these object represented by parameters.

The next afternoon, fresh from a nap, he checked his account, stared at the outcome, and tweeted to @upulieto, an associate, “I just woke up. What a mess” [49]. His tweet had spiraled virally: tens of thousands of likes, retweets, endless streams of commentary. Why? Well, lots of factors, of course. There is rarely a single factor to which one can point in rapid cultural propagation. But the pithiness of the tweet, its form/function iconicity, and its argumentative force are surely three of those factors – perhaps the three most important – and all of them are a direct consequence of the tweet’s rhetorical figures. Its figures notably capitalize on repetition, a stylistic move one might think is anathema to twitter. Repetitions are highly redundant, contributing very little new information. They should therefore be corrosive to the concision so necessary to effective tweets. Repetitions distend the ideational function, not condense it, making them very costly in twitter, which provides only a 140-character vehicle. And yet: the tweet was instantly and broadly recognized as a brilliant, incisive, necessarily brief and highly effective argument. Most notable among its figuration is the compound figure, symploce, in which the same word or words are repeated at the beginnings and endings of proximal clauses or phrases (Women in and wearing hijab). Symploce is a compound figure because it is a combination of epanaphora (phraseor clause-initial	computation;incisive;network access protection;software propagation	Randy Allen Harris;Chrysanne Di Marco	2017	Argument & Computation	10.3233/AAC-170030	mathematics;artificial intelligence;natural language processing;computation;rhetorical question	NLP	-61.30611479615656	-22.664621893075875	33209

However, this entails an enormous amount of computational and networking contextual complexity. Here, the proposed smart services framework in CPSS (called Dynamic Social Structure of Things, or DSSoT) boosts sociality and narrows down the contextual complexity based on situational awareness. DSSoT monitors spatiotemporal situations and, depending on users' individual goals and other social aspects, induces and structures relevant social objects and smart services in a temporal network of interactions. An application using DSSoT, called Airport Dynamic Social, provides a proof of concept.	emergence;interaction;location-based service;social objects;social reality;social structure;social system	Dina Hussein;Soochang Park;Son N.

2ae5778ea04cc498ad6e047ca9a6e09a98dc59d2	geoweb crawler: an extensible and scalable web crawling framework for discovering geospatial web resources	open geospatial consortium;geospatial web;resource discovery;web crawler	With the advance of the World-Wide Web (WWW) technology, people can easily share content on the Web, including geospatial data and web services. Thus, the “big geospatial data management” issues start attracting attention. Among the big geospatial data issues, this research focuses on discovering distributed geospatial resources. As resources are scattered on the WWW, users cannot find resources of their interests efficiently. While the WWW has Web search engines addressing web resource discovery issues, we envision that the geospatial Web (i.e., GeoWeb) also requires GeoWeb search engines. To realize a GeoWeb search engine, one of the first steps is to proactively discover GeoWeb resources on the WWW. Hence, in this study, we propose the GeoWeb Crawler, an extensible Web crawling framework that can find various types of GeoWeb resources, such as Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web services, Keyhole Markup Language (KML) and Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc (ESRI) Shapefiles. In addition, we apply the distributed computing concept to promote the performance of the GeoWeb Crawler. The result shows that for 10 targeted resources types, the GeoWeb Crawler discovered 7351 geospatial services and 194,003 datasets. As a result, the proposed GeoWeb Crawler framework is proven to be extensible and scalable to provide a comprehensive index of GeoWeb.	big data;consortium;distributed computing;geoweb;keyhole markup language;scalability;shapefile;www;web crawler;web resource;web search engine;web service;world wide web	Chih-Yuan Huang;Hao Chang	2016	ISPRS Int.

Our review and inquiry activities show that current portals suffer from two potential setbacks: inappropriate navigation tools and a lack of supports for users’ understanding. This article defines a new approach to portal development using the atlas as metaphor. This allows the atlas to be used not only to access assorted thematic maps but also to discover data sets. Within the atlas, an information structure plays an important role in organizing the content. Metadata published by providers are incorporated into this structure as metadata summaries. Based upon the topical relevancy of the data, each metadata summary is linked to a specific map within a particular topic. These summaries can be represented as symbols to support discovery tasks, either loosely or strictly defined. Browsing can be used to deal with the first via navigations and map interfaces. Searching can be used to deal with the second via explorer and search presentation interfaces. A working prototype to enable users to browse and search is built as a Flash-based ArcIMS client. Whether browsing or searching, users are offered interfaces to effectively assess data suitability.	ai winter;adobe flash;arcims;browsing;data infrastructure;graphics device interface;organizing (structure);portals;prototype;relevance;thematic map	Trias Aditya;Menno-Jan Kraak	2006	Cartographica	10.3138/P3P1-5327-X2QK-616M	geoportal;geography;computer science;geospatial analysis;atlas;data mining;mathematics;world wide web;information retrieval;cartography;metadata repository	Web+IR	-40.48151575386514	-22.682062228583295	33492

ba537d98cb04949806a7010fa431064b10fc0c2f	book review essay	book review essay	When I was a college student, I was not a serious intellectual, but I did have some interest in ideas. I took courses in religion and philosophy and discussed these subjects with my peers. Ultimately, I concluded that religion had no rational basis. I also concluded that philosophy, at least academic philosophy, was simply a game played with words that were divorced from reality and had no relevance to anyoneu0027s actual life. Politically and economically I was a pragmatist; I was for what worked. I was puzzled, however, by the hostility that intellectuals showed toward capitalism, when it seemed to work very well. Ethically, I believed that you should be honest (though I could not say why); otherwise, I assumed that ethics was concerned with issues such as why you should be nice to your grandmother and why you should give money to the poor. All of these views changed radically when, in my junior year, I read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I was so enthralled by the book, I read it almost nonstop during a twoto three-day period. Emotionally I was in shock for some time afterward. The book changed my whole outlook on life and philosophy. Ayn Rand was a novelist of the romantic school (Rand, 1975). She wanted to portray and project, not man as he (i.e., your next door neighbor), but man as he could be and ought to be (i.e., the ideal man). (Ayn Rand did not use gender-neutral language in her writings. As the only major female philosopher in history, as a novelist who had female as well as male heroes [e.g., Dagny Taggart], and as an advocate of careers for women long before it was fashionable, she can hardly be accused of viewing women as second-class citizens. Out of respect for her, I will use the terms he and man to refer to he or she and man or woman throughout this essay.) To do this she first had to develop a concept of what the ideal man was. This required that she develop an explicit philosophy. In her novels the heroes are the embodiments or concrete expressions of her philosophy in action, and her villains are the embodiments of its opposite. As a romanticist Ayn Rand presents her characters in stylized form, that is, in terms of their essential characteristics (e.g., she does not present them grocery shopping or engaging in small talk). Morally, her heroes and villains are presented in terms of black and white, not shades of grey. These sharp contrasts, in addition to her luminously clear style, her original and exciting plots, and her brilliant philosophical and psychological insights, give her novels enormous emotional impact. One of the most startingly original features of Atlas Shrugged is that the heroes are businessmen. From Charles Dickens to Upton Sinclair to the moderns, businessmen had almost universally been portrayed as evil. (For contemporary examples in the realm of art, see the movie Wall Street or almost any TV drama or soap.) Ayn Rand showed that businessmen, by using their		Coral Mitchell	2003	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1024566616583	social science;sociology	HCI	-60.73100336275641	-23.837701274871495	33543

In this chapter, we study a number of aspects that are based on big data produced by a largescale infrastructure deployed inside a fleet of educational buildings in Europe. We discuss how this infrastructure essentially enables a set of different applications, complemented by a detailed discussion regarding both performance aspects of the implementation of this IoT platform, as well as results that provide insights to its actual application in real life, both from an educational and business standpoint.	application domain;big data;business models for open-source software;feedback;real life;sensor;software deployment	Ioannis Chatzigiannakis;Georgios Mylonas;Irene Mavrommati;Dimitrios Amaxilatis	2018	CoRR		data mining;big data;computer science;internet of things	HCI	-37.31819566207427	-6.172076035351498	33645

c09734a18791937ad85c92ec263ef586c0b26224	cross-language semantic retrieval and linking of e-gov services	settore inf 01 informatica	Public administrations are aware of the advantages of sharing Open Government Data in terms of transparency, development of improved services, collaboration between stakeholders, and spurring new economic activities. Initiatives for the publication and interlinking of government service catalogs as Linked Open Data (lod) support the interoperability among European administrations and improve the capability of foreign citizens to access services across Europe. However, linking service catalogs to reference lod catalogs requires a significant effort from local administrations, preventing the uptake of interoperable solutions at a large scale. The web application presented in this paper is named CroSeR (Cross-language Service Retriever) and supports public bodies in the process of linking their own service catalogs to the lod cloud. CroSeR supports different European languages and adopts a semantic representation of e-gov services based on Wikipedia. CroSeR tries to overcome problems related to the short textual descriptions associated to a service by embodying a semantic annotation algorithm that enriches service labels with emerging Wikipedia concepts related to the service. An experimental evaluation carried-out on e-gov service catalogs in five different languages shows the effectiveness of our model.	e-government	Fedelucio Narducci;Matteo Palmonari;Giovanni Semeraro	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41338-4_9	computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-43.170749549798906	3.5505347788687693	33733

It was originally planned to be published in Discrete Applied Mathematics, however, the earthquake caused in the world of scientific research by the untimely death of the editor-in-chief of Discrete Applied Mathematics, Peter Hammer, brought about changes in our plans. As a result, we are publishing the collection in the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, as a special volume dedicated to the memory of Peter Hammer. Peter Hammer died in a tragic car accident on December 27, 2006. He was an extraordinary person. Originally from a family of Jewish refugees, plagued with polio, he became a leading researcher in the field of Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorial Optimization.

In the Retrieval Experiment—Virginia Tech OnLine Catalog (REVTOLC) study we carried out a large pilot test in 1987 and a larger, controlled investigation in 1990, with 216 users and roughly 500,000 MARC records. Results indicated that a forms-based interface coupled with vector and relevance feedback retrieval methods would be well received. Recent efforts developing the Multiple Access and Retrieval of Information with Annotations (MARIAN) system have involved used of a specially developed object-oriented DBMS, construction of a client running under NeXTSTEP, programming of a distributed server with a thread assigned to each user session to increase concurrency on a small network of NeXTs, refinement of algorithms to use objects and stopping rules for greater efficiency, usability testing and iterative interface refinement.	algorithm;concurrency (computer science);information retrieval;iterative method;nextstep;online public access catalog;refinement (computing);relevance feedback;server (computing);usability testing	Edward A.

117284af945ace8b5c2a0a942c7f49e60fe37292	editors' message		Welcome to the March issue of Inroads. We are pleased to welcome Josh Tenenberg (University of Washington, USA) who joins Lauri Malmi (Aalto University, Finland) to collaborate on the Computing Education Research Column. As a founding co-editor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE), this column is a perfect fit for Josh. This issue’s column, Computational Making, is authored by Josh. Continuing Inroads’ practice of broadly disseminating the best of the best ideas in computing education, this issue inaugurates inclusion of award-winning papers from the International Computing Education Research Conference (ICER) with two outstanding papers from ICER 2017. Receiving the 2017 Chairs’ Award is “An Instrument to Assess Self-Efficacy in Introductory Algorithms Courses” by Holger Danielsiek (Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster), Laura Toma (Bowdoin College), and Jan Vahrenhold (Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster). The second paper, the recipient of ICER’s 2017 John Henry Award, is “K-8 Learning Trajectories Derived from Research Literature: Sequence, Repetition, Conditionals” by Kathryn M. Rich, Carla Strickland, T. Andrew Binkowski, Cheryl Moran, and Diana Franklin (UChicago STEM Education, University of Chicago). Enjoy, and we look forward to the best SIGCSE papers coming in June. Thanks to Susan Lukesh (Inroads Editorial Associate), we have posted a book review template to help submissions of book reviews that conform to Inroads’ style requirements. Timely and insightful book reviews help readers find texts worth their attention. We are particularly interested in texts that are useful in courses, related to computing education, or related to the Inroads’ mission of sharing ideas in the theory and practice of computing education and fostering dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration with educators worldwide. Download the template from the instructions & forms menu on the Inroads Manuscript Central site and keep those book review submissions coming in! Effectively incorporating computing ethics into the curriculum is always a challenge. Laurie had excellent classroom results using ideas from Miller and Larson’s Action Ethics for a Software Development Class, an article that appeared in the March 2017 Inroads. A year later, this issue features a new article by Miller and Larson, Action Ethics Testing and Data Analysis. It offers new ways to naturally engage students with the ethics concerns arising in computing by using an adaptation of the 2015 “dieselgate” scandal in which Volkswagen and other auto manufacturers skirted diesel emissions tests. We thank all of you who participated in the Inroads Back Page computer science puzzle contest. We selected three winners from many excellent submissions. Our first winner, appearing in this issue, is a Programming Language Puzzle from Zack Butler, RIT. Congratulations Zack! The second winner, Evolutionary Decision Tree, submitted by Marie desJardins, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Michael Littman, Brown University, will appear in the June Inroads. Finally, a winning puzzle, Rook Jumping Maze, from Todd Neller, Gettysburg College, will appear in September.

In this process, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) has been introduced to collect, store and communicate patient’s medical information. The EMR systems enable efficient collection of meaningful, accurate and complete data to assist improved clinical administration through the development, implementation and optimisation of clinical pathways. While its cost and time savings are encouraging for transition, it does not come without inherent challenges. Inadequate policy development in the areas of data security and privacy of health information appear to be the major weakness. In this paper, we present a secure access control model for the EMR and Electronic Health Record (EHR) to provide acceptable protection for health sensitive data retained at healthcare organisations. We systematically analyse four existing access control mechanisms that have been proposed in the past, and present a combined more secure model for the EMR and EHR for healthcare provider organisations in Australia.	access control	Pasupathy Vimalachandran;Hua Wang;Yanchun Zhang	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-19156-0_3	medicine;data mining;internet privacy;computer security	DB	-49.22982080427538	4.032659005348416	34355

5912c98d4e8e77e8dbd766690874194f88a369f1	a lightweight approach to explore, enrich and use data with a geospatial dimension with semantic web technologies		"""The concept of """"location"""" provides one a useful dimension to explore, align, combine, and analyze data. Though one can rely on bespoke GIS systems to conduct their data analyses, we aim to investigate the feasibility of using Semantic Web technologies to leverage the exploration and enrichment of data in CSV files with the vast amount of geographic and geospatial data that are available on the Linked Data Web. In this paper, we propose a lightweight method and set of tools for: uplift - transforming non-RDF resources into RDF documents; creating links between RDF datasets; client-side processing of geospatial functions; and downlift - transforming (enriched) RDF documents back into a non-RDF format. With this approach, people who wish to avail of the spatial dimension in data can do so from their client (e.g., in a browser) without the need to rely on bespoke technology. This could be of great utility for decision makers and scholars, amongst others. We applied our approach on datasets that are hosted on the Irish open data portal, and combined it with authoritative geospatial data made available by Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi). Albeit aware that our approach cannot compete with specialist tools, we do demonstrate its feasibility. Though currently conducted for enriching datasets hosted on the Irish open data portal, future work will look into broader governance and provenance aspects of geospatial data enriched dataset management."""	align (company);bespoke;client-side;computer scientist;data web;experiment;gene ontology term enrichment;geographic information system;linkage (software);linked data;semantic web;traceability	Christophe Debruyne;Kris McGlinn;Lorraine McNerney;Declan O'Sullivan	2017		10.1145/3080546.3080548	computer science;social semantic web;data mining;semantic web stack;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-42.008104998579945	0.24885320165082822	34513

f89bdfeb739d8420ae37dcaca75f8f9696c1cb14	comparative evaluation of string similarity measures for automatic language classification		Historical linguistics, the oldest branch of modern linguistics, deals with language-relatedness and language change across space and time. Historical linguists apply the widely-tested comparative method [Durie and Ross, 1996] to establish relationships between languages to posit a language family and to reconstruct the proto-language for a language family. Although historical linguistics has parallel origins with biology [Atkinson and Gray, 2005], unlike the biologists, mainstream historical linguists have seldom been enthusiastic about using quantitative methods for the discovery of language relationships or investigating the structure of a language family, except for Kroeber and Chrétien [1937] and Ellegård [1959]. A short period of enthusiastic application of quantitative methods initiated by Swadesh [1950] ended with the heavy criticism levelled against it by Bergsland and Vogt [1962]. The field of computational historical linguistics did not receive much attention again until the beginning of the 1990s, with the exception of two noteworthy doctoral dissertations, by Sankoff [1969] and Embleton [1986].	computation;i. michael ross;string metric	Taraka Rama;Lars Borin	2015		10.1515/9783110362879-012	criticism;historical linguistics;natural language processing;language change;mainstream;comparative method;language family;string metric;artificial intelligence	NLP	-56.466145097115074	-23.40579576393489	34751

7af9d4de799dc49439e04d500796a5b31154697f	franz edelman award for management science achievement	professional--comments on	I t was my pleasure to serve as chairman of the 27th annual competition for the Franz Edelman Award for Management Science Achievement. The competition is sponsored jointly by INFORMS and its practice section, the College for the Practice of the Management Sciences (CPMS). The primary purpose of the competition is to recognize outstanding accomplishments in the practice of our profession. The prizes recognize verifiable results that had a major impact on the client organization. The awards are given to both the client organization, which receives the award citation, and the individuals producing the work, who receive the cash awards. This year, the prize money totaled $15,000 with $10,000 going to the first prize winner. More important, all prize winners have the honor of knowing their work has been recognized by their peers as the best in the business. This year's competition continues a tradition of spotlighting excellence in management science practice that goes back to the first award in 1972 when the winner received a grand total of $200. The seven finalists in this year's competition have all demonstrated their commitment to practice excellence. In addition to having their efforts described in this special issue of Interfaces, six finalists will have their presentations added to the Edelman Prize videotape collection. The award is named in honor of Franz Edelman. Dr. Edelman was responsible for management sciences at RCA, one of the earliest industrial OR/MS activities in North America. He worked for 30 years at RCA and is counted among the fathers of innovation in management science. The prize competition began with a call for nominations in mid-1997. Approximately 40 entries were submitted. These were reviewed by an award committee that selected the most noteworthy for careful verification. After a comprehensive review , the committee chose seven finalists to give presentations in an all-day session held in conjunction with the Montreal CORS-INFORMS joint meeting in May 1998. Each finalist had a coach to help with preparation. I would like to thank serving as coaches for the contestants. Immediately after the presentations, the judges began their deliberations, which went on until they determined the awards. I would like to recognize those who joined me as judges this year:	cross-origin resource sharing;formal verification;franz edelman award for achievement in operations research and the management sciences;franz lisp;institute for operations research and the management sciences;management science;money;total loss	Russell P.

7f4d0a78b0262025cac65c6251678d225bebba78	debunking unwarranted defenses of the status quo in the humanities and social sciences		A hot topic of research in scientometrics is whether there is a citation advantage for open access articles. A number of pieces addressing this question have been recently published, several of which in this journal (e.g., Sotudeh et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015). In this article I will comment on one recent contribution by philosopher Wray (2016), which reports no citation advantage for author-pays open access journals in the Humanities and Social Sciences (henceforth, HSS). What makes Wray’s paper particularly interesting is that, besides analyzing the nature and size of the alleged effect, he also goes on to draw some further normative conclusions. Specifically, he puts forth an argument to the effect that, in light of his reported findings, scholars in the HSS should avoid paying fees to publish open access. In his own words, ‘‘social scientists and scholars in the humanities should save their money and resist the temptation to buy into the Author-Pay Open Access Publishing model’’. Further, according to Wray, researchers ought to favor traditional publishing models, which might have become quite unsatisfactory in the natural, physical and health sciences, but which are still serviceable in the HSS. More precisely, as Wray puts it, ‘‘the traditional publishing model seems to serve social scientists and scholars in the humanities well’’. Notably, the argument has general relevance, as it bears on recent discussions on whether open access publishing could or should experience in the HSS the same success experienced in the life, health and natural sciences (cf. Eve 2014). First of all, I will briefly introduce Wray’s argument, which seems to run like this. It is quite clear that researchers aim at maximizing their research’s impact. Further, Wray reasons that scholars should then pay to publish open access only if so doing led to a clear advantage in terms of impact. Yet, there is evidence that in the HSS there is no advantage in terms of impact for research published in open access journals. Therefore, scholars in the	eve;high-speed serial interface;relevance;scientometrics;word lists by frequency	Andrea Polonioli	2016	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-016-1906-5	social science;socioeconomics;sociology	Web+IR	-62.360332188954395	-21.122197539800116	34946

Innovative research is conducted in a widely-distributed and dynamic environment, producing an ever-growing number of resources (data, services, and clients). As the resource providers become more diverse, the need and value of integrating and/or interoperating the resources increases. In order to support the 21st century science model, a more mature, fluid, integrated, and extensible cyber-infrastructure must emerge. A foundational part of that cyberinfrastructure is a well-coordinated use of web service technologies (XML, WSDL, SOAP, UDDI). ECHO, a solution developed by NASA, provides a set of web service-based interoperable registries that target this cyberinfrastructure. ECHO is comprised of a set of infrastructure services that enable publication, discovery, understanding of, and access to earth science resources. ECHO supports both data and service registries. These registries are interoperable and based on industry and community standards.

a9ec2a8fa0119f270ec08c9dfc4eab16625dd793	towards exploiting query history for adaptive ontology-based visual query formulation		Grounded on real industrial use cases, we recently proposed an ontology-based visual query system for SPARQL, named OptiqueVQS. Ontology-based visual query systems employ ontologies and visual representations to depict the domain of interest and queries, and are promising to enable end users without any technical background to access data on their own. However, even with considerably small ontologies, the number of ontology elements to choose from increases drastically, and hence hinders usability. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method using the log of past queries for ranking and suggesting query extensions as a user types a query, and identify emerging issues to be addressed.	ontology (information science);query language;sparql;scalability;semantic similarity;usability;utility	Ahmet Soylu;Martin Giese;Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz;Evgeny Kharlamov;Dmitriy Zheleznyakov;Ian Horrocks	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13674-5_11	natural language processing;data mining;information retrieval	HCI	-35.95704191329367	3.898140255685952	35023

This talk will view topic models as a technique within these paradigms. Some visualisations will be reviewed, as well as a variety of different topic models, and some of the natural language processing issues involved in working with the models. Finally, some of the non-parametric statistical methods underlying the analysis will be reviewed because they are fascinating as well.

RDM systems form the technical framework. The purpose of this paper is to present the design and implementation of a RDM system for an interdisciplinary, collaborative, long-term research project with focus on Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere data. Design/methodology/approach – The presented RDM system is based on a three-tier (client-server) architecture. This includes a file-based data storage, a database-based metadata storage, and a self-designed user-friendly web-interface. The system is designed in cooperation with the local computing centre, where it is also hosted. A self-designed interoperable, project-specific metadata schema ensures the accurate documentation of all data. Findings – A RDM system has to be designed and implemented according to requirements of the project participants. General challenges and problems of RDM should be considered. Thus, a close cooperation with the scientists obtains the acceptance and usage of the system. Originality/value – This paper provides evidence that the implementation of a RDM system in the provided and maintained infrastructure of a computing centre offers many advantages. Consequently, the designed system is independent of the project funding. In addition, access and re-use of all involved project data is ensured. A transferability of the presented approach to another interdisciplinary research project was already successful.

The challenge of deriving insights from the Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized as one of the most exciting and key opportunities for both academia and industry. Advanced analysis of big data streams from sensors and devices is bound to become a key area of data mining research as the number of applications requiring such processing increases. Dealing with the evolution over time of such data streams, i.e., with concepts that drift or change completely, is one of the core issues in stream mining. Dealing with this setting, MOA is a software framework with classification, regression, and frequent pattern methods, and the new APACHE SAMOA is a distributed streaming software for mining IoT data streams.	big data;data mining;internet of things;moa;sensor;software framework	Albert Bifet	2016			streams;world wide web;big data;internet privacy;business;internet of things	ML	-37.35545716903678	-6.438275747892147	35493

As the volume of business data to be analyzed increases and quick responses are more critical for business success, there are strong demands for scalable high-performance ETL processors. In this paper, we evaluate a distributed data stream processing engine called System S for those purposes. Based on the original motivation of building System S as a data stream processing engine, we first perform a qualitative study to see if the programming model of System S is suitable for representing an ETL workflow. Second we did performance studies with a representative ETL scenario. Through our series of experiments, we found that the SPADE programming model and its runtime environment naturally fits the requirements of handling massive amounts of ETL data in a highly scalable manner.	central processing unit;experiment;fits;programming model;requirement;runtime system;scalability;stream processing	Toyotaro Suzumura;Toshiaki Yasue;Tamiya Onodera	2010		10.1145/1815695.1815704	real-time computing;computer science;operating system;database	DB	-34.16583447124552	-1.3689567424298446	35621
7784a66adb171fc0db2f3e3bb5660fcc3afd392e	provds: uncertain provenance management over incomplete linked data streams		Data processing in distributed environments is often across heterogeneous systems, bearing the need to exchange provenance information, such as, how and when data was generated, combined, recombined, and processed. Distributed systems involve multiple participants and data sources which can produce unreliable, erroneous data. Besides, there maybe exists oceans amount of data to deal with, e.g., in fields such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities. Therefore, dynamic stream-based data processing mechanisms are more reasonable in these environments. Hence, we propose provenance and recovery-aware data management techniques that take dynamic, incomplete streams as inputs, and simultaneously recover the missing data and compute the provenance over the reconstructed streams. Unlike traditional provenance management techniques, which are applied on complete and static data, our research focuses on dynamic and incomplete heterogeneous data.	computer file;internet of things;linked data;missing data;smart city	Qian Liu	2017			streams;database;data mining;linked data;provenance;computer science	DB	-35.55714344788881	0.506917925961813	35631

The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset: the tags are ontological terms (classes and properties), the context is a set of tags that defines a subset of instances, and the font sizes reflect the number of instances that use each tag. It visualizes the patterns of instances specified by the context a user constructs. Given a request with a specific context, the system needs to quickly find what other tags the instances in the context use, and how many instances in the context use each tag. The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset with 1.4 billion triples and over 380,000 tags. This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic and/or domain/range axioms in the ontology. We combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a specially-constructed inverted index and use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations. We compare our system with a stateof-the-art triple store, examine how pruning rules interact with inference and analyze our design choices.	algorithm;association rule learning;bitcoin;computation;computational problem;experiment;field (computer science);inverted index;linked data;preprocessor;scalability;tag cloud;triplestore	Xingjian Zhang;Dezhao Song;Sambhawa Priya;Jeff Heflin	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-41335-3_43	scalability;computer science;linked data;data mining;database;world wide web;tag cloud;information retrieval	Web+IR	-35.82727994317838	3.7559293339387954	35866

Besides, rental advertisements are usually presented in the form of a list, which can hardly give users a straightforward big picture about the housing rental market of a particular interested area. In this demonstration, we introduce HouseIn, a novel HRP that expect to: 1) provide users a clear big picture in several aspects about the housing rental market of a particular interested area; and 2) detect those advertisements referring to the same property, such that to give users a price comparison between various platforms for the same apartment for rental. The core challenge in implementing HouseIn lies on the Record Matching problem between these advertisements, given that there is no exact Unit/Building Number of the apartment for the sake of privacy issue, and the detailed information about the house can be various given by different agencies. To handle the Record Matching (RM) problem between these advertisements, we employ several state-of-the-art RM methods plus Information Extraction (IE) techniques to use both structured and unstructured information in the advertisements. We show the advantages of HouseIn with several demonstration scenarios.

7622b6c393876a3653786ee67158d3e18fc184a3	development of the imo e-navigation concept - common maritime data structure		e-Navigation is a concept being developed under the auspices of the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) to bring about increased safety and security in commercial shipping through better organisation of data on ships and onshore, and better data exchange and communication between the two. The IHO is involved in the development of the e-Navigation concept to ensure that any underpinning hydrographic standards, products or services are in place from the beginning. In the paper the Author, a member of the IMO Expert Group on e-Navigation established in 2006, presents recent issues about e-Navigation concept, the common maritime data structure.	data structure	Adam Weintrit	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24660-9_18	engineering;operations management;operations research	Theory	-62.63010430097425	-0.5031705638913024	36300

1bd875ebea8762aec9c2417571bd691b1fa6a7e1	optical character recognition and parsing of typeset mathematics1	optical character recognition;computer algebra system;computer application	There is a wealth of mathematical knowledge that could be potentially very useful in many computational applications, but is not available in electronic form. This knowledge comes in the form of mechanically typeset books and journals going back more than one hundred years. Besides these older sources, there are a great many current publications, filled with useful mathematical information, which are difficult if not impossible to obtain in electronic form. Our work intends to encode, for use by computer algebra systems, integral tables and other documents currently available in hardcopy only. Our strategy is to extract character information from these documents, which is then passed to higher-level parsing routines for further extraction of mathematical content (or any other useful two-dimensional semantic content). This information can then be output as, for example, a Lisp or T EX expression. We have also developed routines for rapid access to this information, specifically for finding matches with formulas in a table of integrals. This paper reviews our current efforts, and summarizes our results and the problems we have encountered. This work was supported in part by NSF Grants numbers CCR-9214963 and IRI-9411334, and by NSF Infrastructure Grant number CDA-8722788.

e6ae58910d45dc27c32bd2f9a3d36e4284b335a5	building scholar e-communities using a semantically aware framework: archaia kypriaki grammateia digital corpus	content management systems;keywords;learning;e;semantic web;ontologies;intelligent data browsing	Web-based learning communities have developed into a very popular vehicle for sharing information amongst students, researchers and enthusiastic users and are slowly gaining importance in the humanities field. Unfortunately, as data organization and information exchange in such communities are usually unstructured and strongly geo-localized, they generate serious interoperability issues. At the same time, an increasing amount of knowledge based resources is made available on the Web and a lot of effort is put into creating reference ontologies for the Cultural Heritage, actively publishing controlled vocabularies and sharing data across different platforms by using RDF and RDFa. In this context and with the objective to consolidate these two independent efforts, we have developed a platform for advanced structured online collaboration as a framework for advanced e-learning, the Archaia Kypriaki Grammateia Digital Corpus (AKGDC). Our Digital Library supports exchange amongst researchers, educators and students, makes heterogeneous data resources available and easily reusable and suggests semantic relations within the resources. The AKGDC framework is based on a rather comprehensive corpus of the ancient Cypriot literature, the six-volume “Archaia Kypriaki Grammateia”, or Aρχαία Kυπριακή Γραμματεία authored by A. Voskos, K. Michaelides and I. G. Taifacos and published by the Leventis Foundation between 1995 and 2008. The corpus covers the ancient Cypriot literary production of approximately thirteen centuries (from 7th century BC to 5th-6th century AD), and is typically classified by literary genres. This paper describes how the Digital Library has been conceptualized, developed and enriched. We expect our DL to positively impact highly interdisciplinary areas, such as Classical philology, archaeology, epigraphics, history, religion, philosophy, as well as to provide a broad utility service across the scholarly community.	coherence (physics);controlled vocabulary;digital footprint;digital library;embedded system;geotagging;information exchange;interoperability;library (computing);norm (social);ontology (information science);perseus project;point of view (computer hardware company);rdfa;resource description framework;text corpus;thesaurus linguae graecae;upper ontology;women writers project;world wide web	Denis Pitzalis;Elina Christophorou;Niki Kyriakou;Aristoula Georgiadou;Franco Niccolucci	2012		10.2312/VAST/VAST12/089-095	e;computer science;ontology;semantic web;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-47.572305183444385	-22.667767927510422	36703

9bd79279f0bbaa9f7880e7fc4ebc169cb09b7456	editorial: building successful biological databases	biological database	In this issue, we are happy to present a collection of four articles that discuss the key factors in building a successful biological database. The bioinformatics community does many things, but we can roughly summarise most activities as either building algorithms or building databases. Successful algorithms are measured in terms of their time and space complexity, and there are well-known standards for communicating and validating new algorithms. Databases are much more difficult to validate. How do we know that a database is good? Do we judge it by the quality or quantity of its data, its usability and its ability to integrate with outside resources? Should we also consider the technical architecture and the user support mechanisms and documentation? What about the impact on science, the number of web hits, and total gigabytes of data that a database transfers? Of course, we probably should include all these factors in deciding if a database is a success. Anyone who builds and maintains biological databases also knows that it is very hard to publish traditional academic papers about databases. Familiar refrains include 'What's the hypothesis?', 'What's the evaluation scheme?', and 'This is not science, this is engineering'. In partial response to this difficulty, there is the annual special 'database issue' of Nucleic Acids Research, and the occasional Application Note in the back of the Bioinformatics journal, and other similar publications. But these articles are always severely limited in page length, and can sometimes read as database advertisements, written to attract potential users. We believe that Briefings in Bioinformatics has an opportunity to provide a forum for the maintainers of successful database projects to publish analyses of their approach, and to reveal the general lessons they have learned about the task of creating a successful biological database. Although many issues in creating a good database may transcend biology and be valid for all domains, there are special circumstances around biological databases that make them worth treating as a special group (eg the presumptions that they be freely available, that they be on the internet, that they keep up with a rapidly growing field and that they maintain high biological relevance). To assemble this special issue, we solicited manuscripts from the scientists associated with a shortlist of databases that the editors and their consultants felt could be called 'successful' with little controversy. These ranged over a variety of data types, but concentrated on databases …	algorithm;biological database;briefings in bioinformatics;dspace;datasheet;documentation;gigabyte;information technology architecture;lazy evaluation;relevance;usability;web analytics	Russ B.

He is perhaps best known for his pioneering work in combinator graph reduction and for the design and implementation of an influential series of pure, non-strict, functional programming languages: SASL, KRC and Miranda. David invented or co-invented many of the basic techniques of lazy functional programming and his ideas and notations have passed into later languages such as Haskell. The papers in this special issue are all dedicated D.A.Turner on his 70 birthday and relate to his many contributions to the field. All the papers have been refereed to J.UCS standard.

fea6df2a54733d247e5cca11805f29193743974b	database theory — icdt 2003		In a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) system, autonomous computers pool their resources (e.g., files, storage, compute cycles) in order to inexpensively handle tasks that would normally require large costly servers. The scale of these systems, their “open nature,” and the lack of centralized control pose difficult performance and security challenges. Much research has recently focused on tackling some of these challenges; in this paper, we propose future directions for research in P2P systems, and highlight problems that have not yet been studied in great depth. We focus on two particular aspects of P2P systems – search and security – and suggest several open and important research problems for the community to address.	autonomous robot;centralized computing;computer;database theory;peer-to-peer	Jan van Leeuwen;Diego Calvanese;Maurizio Lenzerini;Rajeev Motwani	2002		10.1007/3-540-36285-1	database;database theory;computer science	OS	-46.5572724838365	0.45303279178607897	37348

9314027784ce946947e330746275628843952661	are we ready to embrace the semantic web?	semantic web	The aim of the semantic web is to describe resources using metadata elements that can be processed or interpreted by machines. MPEG-7 [1] is the result of a standardisation effort to annotate multimedia documents. It offers a rich suite of metadata descriptors for describing these documents at various levels of abstraction from low level features to high level semantics. Owing to the proliferation of multimedia content in the internet, there is widespread interest in the semantic web community in multimedia metadata standards in general, and MPEG-7 in particular. Despite the fact that the semantic web initiatives could benefit a lot from MPEG-7 for the annotation of multimedia documents, recent studies have underlined the limitations of MPEG-7 in describing the semantics of highly structured domains like sports or medicine. One way to solve this problem is to adopt an integrated approach to the design of multimedia ontologies. The first step in bridging the gap between multimedia and semantic web is to map the MPEG-7 specification into a semantic web compliant metadata language like RDF Schema. Details of such a mapping can be found in the seminal work of Hunter [2]. In our work, we use MPEG-7 to model only the structural and the low level aspects of multimedia documents. The reason behind not using the semantic descriptors of MEPG-7 is due to their lack of expressiveness for modeling highly structured domains like sports or medicine. We are interested in MPEG-7 concepts that provide storage features of multimedia documents like format, encoding and location. We also focus on structural aspects like spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal concepts, and also on certain low level features like colour, shape, texture, timbre and melody for images, video and audio files. High level semantics are exclusively captured using domain-specific vocabularies. For example, one could use an ontology that provides descriptors for soccer domain. Integrating these two ontologies is basically a design issue. The reader is referred to our recent work [3] for details.	bridging (networking);high-level programming language;image;mpeg-7;ontology (information science);principle of abstraction;rdf schema;semantic web;semantic data model;video;vocabulary	Shankar Vembu;Stephan Baumann	2006				Web+IR	-43.63183930048391	2.6258188355026606	37439

Organizers of SIGIR 2004 workshops had reported that tight timelines for publicizing workshops and reviewing submissions had resulted in some workshop participants not being notified that a workshop paper had been accepted until the deadline for registration at regular prices had passed. The submission date for SIGIR 2005 workshop proposals was therefore advanced to occur one week after full papers were due. Expedited reviews of all workshop proposals were performed by a committee consisting of recent workshops chairs, augmented where necessary with additional reviewers to ensure that expertise in the topic of each workshop proposal was available. The review results were summarized in an email to the organizing committee and area chairs, and decisions were made by the PC chairs after an email discussion. Workshop organizers were notified of their selection shortly after the poster deadline, about 5 weeks earlier than in previous years. As a result, workshop organizers were generally able to solicit and review submissions sufficiently rapidly to permit workshop participants to qualify for discounted early registration rates.	email;organizing (structure);timeline	Douglas W.

However, user modeling in this context implies a constant processing and analysis of user interaction data during long-term learning activities, which produces huge amounts of valuable data stored typically in server log files. Due to the large or very large size of log files generated daily, the massive processing is a foremost step in extracting useful information. To this end, this work studies, first, the viability of processing large log data files of a real Virtual Campus using different distributed infrastructures. More precisely, we study the time performance of massive processing of daily log files implemented following the master-slave paradigm and evaluated using Cluster Computing and PlanetLab platforms. The study reveals the complexity and challenges of massive processing in the big data era, such as the need to carefully tune the log file processing in terms of chunk log data size to be processed at slave nodes as well as the bottleneck in processing in truly geographically distributed infrastructures due to the overhead caused by the communication time among the master and slave nodes. Then, an application of the massive processing approach resulting in log data processed and stored in a well-structured format is presented. We show how to extract knowledge from the log data analysis by using the WEKA framework for data mining purposes showing its usefulness to effectively build user models in terms of identifying interesting navigation patters of on-line learners. The study is motivated and conducted in the context of the actual data logs of the Virtual Campus of the Open University of Catalonia.	apache hadoop;apriori algorithm;big data;cluster analysis;computation;computer cluster;data logger;data mining;data pre-processing;distributed computing;foremost;high availability;k-means clustering;mapreduce;online and offline;open-source software;overhead (computing);planetlab;preprocessor;programming paradigm;scalability;server (computing);server log;universal product code;usability;user modeling;vii;weka	Santi Caballé;Fatos Xhafa	2013	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-013-0256-9	parallel computing;computer cluster;computer science;operating system;web log analysis software;data mining;database;world wide web	DB	-35.48090619432725	-5.181934100583678	37720

Data warehouses are filled with it. However, querying temporal data has only, in the past few years, become a realistic possibility.  Yet the SQL standard has not had significant updates in temporal data support since 1992. The demands of the modern world are no longer satisfied by decades-old solutions. MySQL, an open-source database extremely popular in the sciences, has still not yet fully implemented SQL-92. Its approach to temporal needs is lacking. Too many queries are not answerable, and those that are answerable are often answered inconsistently.	database theory;mysql;open-source software;sql;sql-92;temporal database	Chad Vicknair;Dawn Wilkins;Yixin Chen	2012		10.1145/2184512.2184554	computer science;data mining;database;information retrieval	DB	-34.454406666197265	0.31161057120416935	37847
1adafcc9710cc4c3e5994ecf53905edfa762a30d	romulus: the repository of ontologies for multiple uses populated with mediated foundational ontologies		A foundational ontology contributes to ontology-driven conceptual data modelling and is used to solve interoperability issues among domain ontologies. Multiple foundational ontologies have been developed in recent years, and most of them are available in several versions. This has re-introduced the interoperability problem, increased the need for a coordinated and structured comparison and elucidation of modelling decisions, and raised the requirement for software infrastructure to address this. We present here a basic step in that direction with the Repository of Ontologies for MULtiple USes, ROMULUS, which is the first online library of machine-processable, modularised, aligned, and logic-based merged foundational ontologies. In addition to the typical features of a model repository, it has a foundational ontology recommender covering features of six foundational ontologies, tailor-made modules for easier reuse, and a catalogue of mappable and non-mappable elements among the BFO, GFO and DOLCE foundational ontologies.	basic formal ontology;data modeling;general formal ontology;interoperability;library;list of facebook features;ontology (information science);population;recommender system	Zubeida Casmod Khan;C.

In this industry, handling a large amount of images is an important task in various phases, for example, the designing, sourcing, and merchandising phase. We develop an image database system called, Montage for managing and retrieving these visual information e ciently and e ectively. Montage is an image database supporting content-based retrieval by color histogram, sketch, texture, and shape. One important feature of Montage is the Open Architecture design which makes the system extensible, customizible, and exible. There are two aspects of this open architecture design: (1) Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) and (2) plug-in framework which we will discuss in more details. Moreover, we describe an experimental Java system enabling internet access to Montage. In the paper, we also present an experiment to evaluate the performance of several query methods.	color histogram;crowdsourcing;internet access;java;montagejs;open database connectivity;open architecture;plug-in (computing);texture mapping	Tak-Kan Lau;Irwin King	1998		10.1007/3-540-63930-6_148	color histogram;computer vision;simulation;textile industry;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;database;computer security;information system;systems architecture;computer graphics (images)	DB	-39.44278065094764	-23.27010035077424	37872

8069e497e765ac245762cf2f3ae420985d037230	the semantic web – iswc 2013		As collaborative, or network science spreads into more science, engineering and medical fields, both the participants and their funders have expressed a very strong desire for highly functional data and information capabilities that are a) easy to use, b) integrated in a variety of ways, c) leverage prior investments and keep pace with rapid technical change, and d) are not expensive or timeconsuming to build or maintain. In response, and based on our accummulated experience over the last decade and a maturing of several key semantic web approaches, we have adapted, extended, and integrated several open source applications and frameworks that handle major portions of functionality for these platforms. At minimum, these functions include: an object-type repository, collaboration tools, an ability to identify and manage all key entities in the platform, and an integrated portal to manage diverse content and applications, with varied access levels and privacy options. At the same time, there is increasing attention to how researchers present and explain results based on interpretation of increasingly diverse and heterogeneous data and information sources. With the renewed emphasis on good data practices, informatics practitioners have responded to this challenge with maturing informatics-based approaches. These approaches include, but are not limited to, use case development; information modeling and architectures; elaborating vocabularies; mediating interfaces to data and related services on the Web; and traceable provenance. The current era of data-intensive research presents numerous challenges to both individuals and research teams. In environmental science especially, sub-fields that were data-poor are becoming data-rich (volume, type and mode), while some that were largely model/ simulation driven are now dramatically shifting to data-driven or least to data-model assimilation approaches. These paradigm shifts make it very hard for researchers used to one mode to shift to another, let alone produce products of their work that are usable or understandable by non-specialists. However, it is exactly at these frontiers where much of the exciting environmental science needs to be performed and appreciated.	closed-circuit television;complex event processing;coupling (computer programming);data assimilation;data model;data-intensive computing;decorator pattern;denormalization;encode;emoticon;entity;esoteric programming language;graph (discrete mathematics);ground truth;hashtag;iswc;informatics;information model;mobile phone;network science;open-source software;privacy;programming paradigm;query language;reblogging;relational database;sld resolution;sparql;semantic web;sensor;sentiment analysis;simulation;stream processing;traceability;tweeter;venue (sound system);vocabulary;world wide web	Achille Fokoue;Paul T.

29c6de7fc8e046c36153f641d6df43797ff7db03	an introduction to question answering over linked data		While the amount of knowledge available as linked data grows, so does the need for providing end users with access to this knowledge. Especially question answering systems are receiving much interest, as they provide intuitive access to data via natural language and shield end users from technical aspects related to data modelling, vocabularies and query languages. This tutorial gives an introduction to the rapidly developing eld of question answering over linked data. It gives an overview of the main challenges involved in the interpretation of a user's information need expressed in natural language with respect to the data that is queried. The paper summarizes the main existing approaches and systems including available tools and resources, benchmarks and evaluation campaigns. Finally, it lists the open topics that will keep question answering over linked data an exciting area of research in the years to come.	ana (programming language);association for computers and the humanities;benchmark (computing);blog;ct scan;computation;computational linguistics;curry;data web;data mining;data modeling;database;empirical methods in natural language processing;enrico clementi;explicit semantic analysis;gerber format;hidden markov model;iswc;information systems;information needs;information system;intelligent user interface;intranet;journal of web semantics;klaus samelson;knowledge management;lecture notes in computer science;lexicon;linked data;natural language;natural language user interface;nico habermann;ontology (information science);ontology alignment;pythia;phil bernstein;prototype;query language;question answering;realms of the haunting;resource description framework;roberto busa;sigkdd;sparql;search algorithm;semantic web;semantic search;semantic similarity;springer (tank);statistical parsing;symposium on applied computing;systematized nomenclature of medicine;tom;text corpus;tree-adjoining grammar;victor basili;victoria (3d figure);vocabulary;www;watson (computer);web intelligence;wikipedia;world wide web	Christina Unger;André Freitas;Philipp Cimiano	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-10587-1_2	information retrieval	NLP	-45.51263123708662	-2.3874008638770103	38056

93cbed0a99eea51fa2ce1180f1a312d4ebe25315	a study on trends in information technologies using big data analytics		"""We are living in an information era from Twitter [1] to Fitocracy [2]; every episode of peoples' life is converted to numbers. That abundance of data is also available in information technologies. From Stackoverflow [3] to GitHub [4] many big data sources are available about trends in Information Technologies. The aim of this research is studying information technology trends and compiling useful information about those technologies using big data sources mentioned above. Those collected information might be helpful for decision makers or information technology professionals to decide where to invest their time and money. In this research we have mined and analyzed StackExchange and GitHub data for creating meaningful predictions about information technologies. Initially StackExchange and GitHub data were imported into local data repositories. After the data is imported, cleaning and preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming and dimensionality reduction are applied to data. After preprocessing and cleaning keywords, their relations are extracted from data. Using those keywords data, four main knowledge areas and their variations, i.e., 20 Programming Languages, 8 Database Applications, 4 Cloud Services and 3 Mobile Operating Systems, are selected for analysis of their trends. After the keywords are selected, extracted patterns are used for cluster analysis in Gephi [5]. Produced graphs are used for the exploratory analysis of the programming languages data. After exploratory analysis, time series of usage are created for selected keywords. Those times series are used as training and testing data for forecasts created using R's """" forecast """" library. After making forecasts, their accuracy are tested using Mean Magnitude of Relative Error and Median Magnitude of Relative Error."""	approximation error;big data;cluster analysis;compiler;dimensionality reduction;gephi;mean squared error;mined;plasma cleaning;platform as a service;preprocessor;programming language;stack exchange;stack overflow;stemming;time series;tokenization (data security)	Mahmut Ali Ozkuran	2015	CoRR		data mining;data science;tokenization (data security);software analytics;business intelligence;test data;big data;cloud computing;computer science;information technology;analytics	ML	-38.67143772200241	-6.718174275751743	38259

At least two types of training can be envisioned in order to produce meaningful results, quality publications and successful grant applications: (1) immediate short-term training workshops and (2) long-term graduate education or visiting scientist programs. We aimed to fill the former need by providing a comprehensive hands-on training course in genomics, proteomics and informatics in a coherent, experimentally-based framework. This was accomplished through a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored 10-day Genomics and Proteomics Hands-on Workshop held at National Jewish Health (NJH) and the University of Colorado School of Medicine (UCD). The course content included comprehensive lectures and laboratories in mass spectrometry and genomics technologies, extensive hands-on experience with instrumentation and software, video demonstrations, optional workshops, online sessions, invited keynote speakers, and local and national guest faculty. Here we describe the detailed curriculum and present the results of short- and long-term evaluations from course attendees.

2dc9912c7fae26b711bc613cad824f4826347d81	provenance support for medical research		This poster paper introduces a system known as CRISTAL [1] and the experience using it for medical research, primarily in the neuGRID [2] and neuGridforUsers (N4U) projects. These projects aim to provide detailed traceability for research analysis processes in the study of biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease. They have faced major challenges in managing data volumes and algorithm complexity leading to problems associated with information tracking, analysis reproducibility and scientific data verification. We present a working system that supports provenance data management for medical researchers. Medical informatics has increasingly required systems that facilitate historical data capture and management in order to support researchers’ analyses through workflow based algorithms. To facilitate the requirement of tracking large scale analyses, we have adopted CRISTAL [1], a workflow and ‘provenance data’ tracking solution. Its use has provided a rich environment for neuroscientists to track and manage the evolution of both data and workflows in neuGRID and N4U. In the N4U project in particular we have developed a so called Virtual Laboratory (VL). One major goal of the VL is to ensure the reproducibility of results and to allow sharing of analysis information between researchers. All of the workflows in N4U after design are automated, their complete history from design to orchestration being captured and stored. Another feature of the VL is its collaborative environment, allowing for 'provenance' information to be shared and used by various researchers. The N4U VL is based on services layered on top of the neuGRID infrastructure, described in detail in [2]. The VL was developed for neuroscientists involved in Alzheimer’s studies but has been designed to be reusable across other medical research communities. It has been designed to provide access to infrastructure resident data and to enable the analyses required by the medical research community. This has been achieved by basing the N4U virtual laboratory on an integrated Analysis Base [3], which has been developed following the detail requirements from both neuGRID and N4U projects. This Analysis Base provides an integrated medical data analysis environment to exploit neuroscience workflows, large image datasets and algorithms for scientific analyses. Once researchers conduct their analyses information from the Analysis Base, the analysis definitions and resulting data along with the user profiles are also made available in the Base for tracking and reusability purposes in a so-called Analysis Service via a Science Gateway, Analysis Workarea and Information Services. (see Figure 1). Figure 1 : The N4U Virtual Laboratory The N4U Analysis Service provides access to tracked information (images, pipelines and analysis outcomes) for querying/browsing, visualization, pipeline authoring and execution. Its Work Area is a facility for users to define new pipelines or configure existing pipelines to be run against selected datasets and dispatch to conduct analysis. The N4U Science Gateway provides facilities that include a Dashboard, Online Help and Service interfaces for users to interact with the underlying set of N4U services. The N4U Analysis Base: (a) indexes all external clinical datasets (b) registers neuroscience pipeline definitions and/or associated algorithms (c) stores provenance and user-derived data resulting from pipeline executions on the Grid (d) provides access to all datasets stored on the infrastructure and (e) stores users’ analysis definitions and linking them with the existing pipelines and datasets definitions. CRISTAL is a data and workflow tracking system which was used to trace the construction of the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC [4]. Using the facilities for description and dynamic modification in CRISTAL in a generic and reusable manner, CRISTAL is able to provide dynamically modifiable and reconfigurable workflows. It uses the “description-driven” nature of CRISTAL models to act dynamically on process instances already running, and can intervene in the actual process instances during execution (for further detail refer to [1]). These processes can be dynamically (re)configured based on the context of execution without compiling or stopping the process and the user can make modifications directly upon any process parameter whilst preserving all historical versions so they can run alongside the new version. In neuGRID/N4U, we have used CRISTAL to provide the provenance needed to support neuroscience analysis and to track individualized analysis definitions and usage patterns, thereby creating a practical knowledge base for neuroscience researchers. CRISTAL captures provenance data that emerges in the specification and execution of the stages in analysis workflows. The provenance management service also keeps track of the origins of the data products generated in an analysis and their evolution between different stages of research analysis. CRISTAL is a system that records every change made to its objects, which are referred to as CRISTAL Items. Whenever a modification is made to any piece of data, the definition of that piece of data or application logic, the change and the metadata associated with that change (e.g. who made the change, when and for what purpose) are stored alongside that data. This makes CRISTAL applications fully traceable, and this data may be used to assemble detailed provenance information. In N4U, CRISTAL manages data from the Analysis Service as Items, containing the full history of computing task execution; it can also provide this level of traceability for any piece of data in the system, such as the datasets, pipeline definitions and queries. Provenance querying facilities are provided by the Querying Service in neuGRID/N4U. The ability of description-driven systems to both cope with change and to provide traceability of such changes (i.e. the ‘provenance’ of the change) we see as one of the main contributions of the CRISTAL approach to building flexible and maintainable systems and we believe this makes a significant contribution to how enterprise systems can be implemented. In the future we will develop a so-called User Analysis module which will enable applications to learn from their past executions and improve and optimize new studies and processes based on the previous experiences and results. Using machine learning approaches, models will be formulated that can derive the best possible optimisation strategies using the past execution of experiments and processes. These models will evolve over time and will facilitate decision support in designing, building and running the future processes and workflows in a domain. A provenance analysis mechanism will be built on top of the data that has been captured in CRISTAL. It will employ approaches to learn from the data that has been produced, find common patterns and models, classify and reason from the information accumulated and present it to the system in an intuitive way. Work is also ongoing to make CRISTAL compliant with emerging provenance standards such as the Open Provenance Model, OPM [5].	algorithm;box counting;business logic;compiler;dashboard;decision support system;dynamic dispatch;emoticon;enterprise system;experience;experiment;informatics;knowledge base;large hadron collider;linker (computing);machine learning;mathematical optimization;pipeline (computing);pipeline (software);requirement;traceability;tracking system;user analysis;user profile;while	Richard McClatchey;Jetendr Shamdasani;Andrew Branson;Kamran Munir	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-16462-5_37	data science;data mining;database;world wide web	SE	-41.84566184185357	0.4533361500847292	38760

0ee1cc8329534b5023dc6528219e7eea9432704d	towards mkda: a data mining semantic web service	semantic web service;data mining	Nowadays a huge amount of raw medical data is generated. These data, analyzed with data mining techniques, could be used to produce new knowledge. Unluckily such tasks need skilled data analysts, and not so many researchers in medical field are also data mining experts. In this paper we present a web based system for knowledge discovery assistance in Medicine able to advice a medical researcher in this kind of tasks. The experiment specifications are expressed in a formal language we have defined. The system GUI helps the user in the their composition. The system plans a Knowledge Discovery Process (KDP). The KDP is designed on the basis of rules in a knowledge base. Finally the system executes the KDP and produces a model as result. The system works through the co-operation of different web services specialized in different tasks. The choice of web services is based on the semantic of their functionalities, according to a common OWL ontology. The system is still under development.	data mining;experiment;formal language;graphical user interface;knowledge base;semantic web service;systems architecture;web ontology language;world wide web	Vincenzo Cannella;Giuseppe Russo;Roberto Pirrone	2008			web service;web mining;semantic computing;data web;semantic grid;web standards;computer science;semantic web;social semantic web;semantic web stack;web intelligence;semantic analytics	ML	-36.520628452119645	-0.1018309643600639	38843

f834032f2111025e514fefd1abc33cfd0da02117	entering the research community		THE MAIN ELEMENT OF DOCTORAL STUDIES is always original research, which is finally compiled into a doctoral thesis. During this time the student studies literature in her/his field in depth, learns research design, problem solving, data collection and analysis methods, taking a critical view on one’s work, and writing scientific reports and papers. However, becoming an expert in one’s field is not the only goal of doctoral studies. A researcher is never working just alone, but s/he is also a member of the research community of her/his own field. In my case, this means the international computing education research community (or computing education community, whichever definition is preferred). What is the significance of this membership and how can we support students to find and take their own role in the field? I recall well my first conference trip where my supervisor sent me. I had started my PhD studies in database research half a year earlier, and I attended the VLDB conference (Very Large Data Bases) in 1992 in Vancouver, Canada. I was alone and there were some 300 other people whom I had never met. I listened to many presentations, some more and some less interesting to me, and I spoke briefly with several people on coffee breaks and social events. They were working on things quite different from what I was doing. I, however, recognized several familiar names found in relevant papers I had read. Unfortunately, they seemed to be busy people whenever I just happened to notice them passing by.

53911016d33c36e1a06967c849b48129f9132405	review of anderson and anderson's machine ethics		The Machine Ethics anthology, edited by Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson, is a collection of essays dedicated to the challenge of instilling ethical principles into intelligent machines; in contrast with the more traditional area of computer ethics, it focuses not on programmer or user decisions but on the ethical decision-making capacity of the machines themselves. As an overview of a field in its infancy, Machine Ethics is not meant to be an in-depth reference book; it largely takes Gips’s approach [8], “to raise questions rather than answer them.” Nor is it tailored to be the primary text for any well-established course, although I’d love to see an innovative professor spin a special-topics course around it, and I can imagine individual essays being used as readings for cognitive science, philosophy, and “soft” engineering courses. In any case, the volume is a thought-provoking introduction to the field of machine ethics, and I recommend it to students and researchers outside of the field who are looking to broaden their interests. Part I, “The Nature of Machine Ethics,” features essays that articulate the goals and assumptions of machine ethics. Readers need no prior background in machine ethics, as this section effectively eases them into the rest of the book. Even those who are new to ethics in general will find the section welcoming, as it provides gentle but detailed exposure to normative theories and metaethical concerns. Part II, “The Importance of Machine Ethics,” anticipates the question, “Why should we care?” In the first of two essays, Allen, Wallach, and Smit [1] give a well-rounded and direct address to this question. Turkle’s essay [10], meanwhile, seems only peripherally related to machine ethics despite the editors’ explanation for its inclusion, though it is an enlightening read in itself. The works in Part III, “Issues Concerning Machine Ethics,” focus on “issues [. . . ] that will need to be resolved if research in [machine ethics] is to progress.” The issues in question tend toward the philosophical, but some of these are still highly and immediately relevant for AI practitioners: To what extent is it ethical to put moral decisions in the hands of machines? Does there exist an acceptable standard of morality that is actually computable? Others venture into more speculative territory: When should the law recognize an intelligent machine as a person? Can a machine, regardless of how well it emulates human ethical reasoning, ever “understand” ethics in the same way that humans can? The latter question is essentially an ethics-flavored manifestation of Searle’s “strong AI” problem, as Whitby [11] alludes to in the section; editor Susan Leigh Anderson herself argues [3] that, since we are concerned with the behavior of machines, the possibility of a “no” answer to the question would not hinder the overall goals of machine ethics. As such, the section occasionally gives too much importance to esoteric points, but even these are presented in a thoughtful and well-argued manner. Page-wise, slightly under half of the book is contained in Part IV, “Approaches to Machine Ethics,” which finally delves into the question of how to build ethical machines. Some of the essays discuss computational frameworks for ethical theo-	artificial general intelligence;artificial intelligence;cognitive science;computable function;emulator;existential quantification;humans;machine ethics;primary source;programmer;reference work;speculative execution;the machine;theory	Cory Siler	2015	Artif.

In the past few months, I have been reading chapters of one book that has it all: Gavriel Salvendy’s massive tome, the Handbook of human factors and ergonomics. It is huge, with over 1,500 pages and 61 chapters. It takes two pages just to list the advisors, ten pages to list the authors of the chapters. It is also expensive: $250. Buy it. The articles are all excellent. They all reflect up-todate reviews of the areas they cover. They are wonderful self-study material, wonderful references, and would make excellent material in multiple courses. Yes, it is obscenely expensive, but this one book is the equivalent of ten normal books. Consider it as essential piece of professional equipment. Buy it. Use it. If you do not know human factors, this is a great way to find the parts relevant to your work. And even if you are an expert, this book will be valuable because it is unlikely that you are expert at all the topics covered here, yet very likely you will need some of the ones you are not (yet) expert at. I follow my own advice. I consider myself an expert (I am a Fellow of the Human Factors Society), but I still learn each time I read from these pages. So yes, grit your teeth and buy the book.

d294eccde9a79f3d546f287f6aad9f4bf13eaf9f	information processing and the management of uncertainty	information processing	1 Overview The rst International Conference on Information Processing and the Management of Uncertainty (IPMU) was held in 1986 at a time of great debate about the necessity of modelling uncertainty in intelligent systems (which at that time largely meant rule-based expert systems) and the best way of doing so. Whereas the founders of the Conference on Uncertainty in Artiical Intelligence 1 (UAI) in the United States set out with the aim of promoting the use of probability, the organisers of IPMU chose a diametrically opposed course. Though there were a few papers on probability at IPMU '86, the main focus was on alternative methods, primarily those based upon fuzzy sets. Though subsequent conferences have seen greater mix of papers, IPMU remains largely non-probabilistic with the result that the bulk of the participants come from Europe rather than the United States (despite the large amount of work on uncertainty, and especially probability, that is carried out in the US) making IPMU something of a counterpoint to UAI. The diierence in participation is exacerbated by the allowing the organisers of the initial IPMU to claim that theirs was the rst conference to be speciically organised to focus on uncertainty.	expert system;fuzzy set;information processing;logic programming	Simon Parsons;Alessandro Saffiotti	1995	Knowledge Eng.

a0ca7d39296d8d31dbbf300f58e7e375fb879492	deepweak: reasoning common software weaknesses via knowledge graph embedding		Common software weaknesses, such as improper input validation, integer overflow, can harm system security directly or indirectly, causing adverse effects such as denial-of-service, execution of unauthorized code. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) maintains a standard list and classification of common software weakness. Although CWE contains rich information about software weaknesses, including textual descriptions, common sequences and relations between software weaknesses, the current data representation, i.e., hyperlined documents, does not support advanced reasoning tasks on software weaknesses, such as prediction of missing relations and common consequences of CWEs. Such reasoning tasks become critical to managing and analyzing large numbers of common software weaknesses and their relations. In this paper, we propose to represent common software weaknesses and their relations as a knowledge graph, and develop a translation-based, description-embodied knowledge representation learning method to embed both software weaknesses and their relations in the knowledge graph into a semantic vector space. The vector representations (i.e., embeddings) of software weaknesses and their relations can be exploited for knowledge acquisition and inference. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of software weakness and relation embeddings in three reasoning tasks, including CWE link prediction, CWE triple classification, and common consequence prediction. Our knowledge graph embedding approach outperforms other description- and/or structure-based representation learning methods.	authorization;common weakness enumeration;data (computing);data validation;denial-of-service attack;experiment;feature learning;graph (abstract data type);graph embedding;improper input validation;integer overflow;knowledge graph;knowledge acquisition;knowledge representation and reasoning	Zhuobing Han;Xiaohong Li;Hongtao Liu;Zhenchang Xing;Zhiyong Feng	2018	2018 IEEE 25th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER)	10.1109/SANER.2018.8330232	data mining;task analysis;knowledge representation and reasoning;knowledge acquisition;improper input validation;integer overflow;software;data modeling;common weakness enumeration;computer science	SE	-34.737544618002886	-13.142761973676885	39601

5956c81ab739d6fe9574d642a65e692609fe8d6b	an ontological approach to geoscience dataset cataloging		Geoscience has traditionally struggled with metadata for datasets. There are many fixed metadata schemas to facilitate the search and retrieval of datasets but they have trouble representing the richness of datasets coming from an ever-evolving science. For the IRI Data Library of datasets, we want a more relational and extensible paradigm for metadata. The RDF/OWL framework in the form of OWL ontologies presents that possibility. Ontology Development The IRI ontology development (see fig. 1) for cataloging datasets began with an OWL schema creation consisting of classes, subclasses and properties. This schema incorporated both original and imported classes and properties. We imported existing ontologies from Dublin Core (dc), Really Simple Syndication (rss), part of NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), the Climate and Forecast Metadata (CF), and NASA's Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET). Both GCMD and CF ontologies are hosted and prepared by the Marine Metadata Interoperability Project (MMI). We used Protege as our ontology creation editor. Populating the ontology with individuals (sometimes referred to as instances) was the next step. First we converted existing and inferred dataset attributes into RDF/OWL metadata. Some hand editing with Protege was needed for information that was not available in our original system. We added SWRL rules and SeRQL CONSTRUCTs to be able to generate inferred triples. A perl crawler using Redland was used to gather and store the information for the ontology. The resulting triples were then transferred to Sesame where the RDFS and OWL semantics were evaluated by Storage and Inference Layers (SAILs) and stored in a Sesame RDF database. SWRL rules were translated into SeRQL CONSTRUCTs. Sesame was used to process these CONSTRUCTs and their inferences. We then stored the virtual triples with the asserted triples. Iterative Queries The search interface implements a separate search ontology that includes taxa, facets, and properties to represent the desired faceted search choices. This search ontology is connected to the dataset description ontologies by the RDF/OWL framework. The interface uses SeRQL queries to evaluate user-selected criteria in the Sesame RDF database. The interface returns rss links to the datasets and a subset of the original search terms that describe the datasets selected. Datasets and the terms that describe them are connected by the property isDescribedBy. Terms are interrelated by directlyImplies properties, and datasets are interrelated by Dublin Core isPartOf and isReplacedBy properties (these properties are used to reduce repetition in the search returns). Subsequent selection criteria narrow the range of possible datasets by creating new SeRQL queries that operate on the remaining possible datasets.

As the user makes a facet-term selection, the web display is updated to reflect the remaining possible choices and the datasets that match the selection criteria.

e217ef620caf64856c7dd5d71e492454cad9ed79	rediscovering the passion, beauty, joy, and awe: making computing fun again, part 5	enrollment crisis;high school;acm education board;successful pbja;novel best practice;middle school student;best practice;sigcse symposium;computing education;computing fun;historic high	"""In 2006, computing education was suffering from a crisis - enrollments were dropping sharply at universities and colleges across the United States, and interest in computing from high school and middle school students was waning significantly. At the 2007 SIGCSE Symposium, the ACM Education Board organized a special session to explore the underlying causes. In his keynote at the same conference, Grady Booch exhorted us to share the """"passion, beauty, joy and awe"""" (PBJA) of computing. This led to a series of room-packed sessions at the following four SIGCSE symposia to explore that idea from different angles. They have provided a forum for sharing: """"What we've done: Highlighting successful PBJA initiatives the presenters have undertaken or seen and wish to celebrate. """"What we should do (curriculum): Pointing out where our curriculum is lacking in PBJA, and how to fix it. """"How we should do it (pedagogy): Sharing how a change in attitude / focus / etc. can make strides to improving PBJA. Fortunately, enrollments have been continually rising, and there are colleges where the numbers are so strong (returning to historic highs), that some claim the crisis is over. Some point to """"the Facebook Factor"""" as the source of inspiration for many young students, claiming this is a """"Sputnik moment"""". Many dispute this, however, citing statistics that indicate under-represented students have not returned, and continuing negative connotations about the field. This PBJA """"movement"""" was born out of this enrollment crisis, but is not tied to it. There is always value in sharing novel best practices and advocating techniques that make computing fun. In the past, we tried to gather educators who brought a wide variety of perspectives (e.g., in 2010 we heard from international, domestic, high school, university and industrial representatives). At recent sessions, we've shifted from that """"breadth-first"""" model to a """"depth-first"""" one. This year we have invited three educators who have worked tirelessly toward broadening participation of computing to underrepresented groups. The hope with this panel is to be able to explore best practices in outreach, in terms of extolling the PBJA of computing."""		Daniel D. Garcia;Barbara Ericson;Joanna Goode;Colleen M.

There have been sound advances, such as the introduction of the programming language Ada and its various Programming Support Environments. Yet some in the industrial real-time computing community still use languages such as “C” and employ limited dynamic tasting as the sole means of verifying the functionality of the product.	real-time computing;real-time transcription	John Cullyer	1992		10.1007/978-3-642-88049-0_52	information technology architecture;human-centered computing;technology education	Embedded	-56.21130268562834	0.5163779546100135	39906

However, to query and build applications on top of Linked Open Data is still significantly challenging. In this work, we present Knowledge Box (KBox), an approach for transparently shifting query execution on Knowledge Graphs to the edge. We show that our approach makes the consumption of Knowledge Graphs more reliable and faster than the formerly introduced methods. In practice, KBox demands less time and resources to setup than traditional approaches, while being twice as fast as SPARQL endpoints, even when serving a single client.	central processing unit;design pattern;knowledge graph;linked data;resource description framework;sparql;semantic web;server (computing);software propagation;world wide web	Edgard Marx;Ciro Baron;Tommaso Soru;Sören Auer	2017	2017 IEEE 11th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC)	10.1109/ICSC.2017.77	rdf/xml;cwm;computer science;sparql;data mining;database;rdf query language;world wide web;rdf schema	DB	-35.70310426316238	3.786928720859807	39937

Typically a DSS supplies analytical information obtained and transformed from large data warehouses. Recently, the geographical component of information has become more important due to the growing use of this type of information in logistics, marketing, and other applications. This work describes GeoOlap, a decision support approach that proposes a method to develop decision support applications that integrates analytical and georeferenced elements from the ground up at the design stage and OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) and GIS (Geographical Information System) technologies to visualize the results. Additionally, this paper describes PostGeoOlap, an open source general-purpose tool, which supports GeoOlap and that allows developers to easily build decision support applications. A case study is presented to validate the proposed ideas.	decision support system;general-purpose markup language;geographic information system;logistics;online analytical processing;open-source software	Rodrigo Soares Manhães;Sahudy Montenegro González;Giovanni Colonese;Rogério Atem de Carvalho;Asterio Kiyoshi Tanaka	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75902-9_38	executive information system;r-cast;decision support system;intelligent decision support system;decision analysis;decision engineering;systems engineering;decision tree;management information systems;data mining;database;evidential reasoning approach;business decision mapping	DB	-36.2202680866649	-1.4222146880068607	39946

A common way of exploring these datasets is to identify and track regions of interest. Usually these regions are defined as contiguous sets of points whose attributes satisfy some user defined conditions, e.g. high temperature regions in a combustion simulation. At each time step, the regions of interest may be identified by first searching for all points that satisfy the conditions and then grouping the points into connected regions. To speed up this process, the searching step may use a treebased indexing scheme, such as a KD-tree or an Octree. However, these indices are efficient only if the searches are limited to one or a small number of selected attributes. Scientific datasets often contain hundreds of attributes and scientists frequently study these attributes in complex combinations, e.g. finding regions of high temperature and low pressure. Bitmap indexing is an efficient method for searching on multiple criteria simultaneously. We apply a bitmap compression scheme to reduce the size of the indices. In addition, we show that the compressed bitmaps can be used efficiently to perform the region growing and the region tracking operations. Analyses show that our approach scales well and our tests on two datasets from simulation of the autoignition process show impressive performance.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive mesh refinement;algorithm;bitmap index;data structure;dex;motion estimation;olap cube;octree;overhead (computing);read-only memory;refinement (computing);region growing;region of interest;regular grid;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;spatiotemporal database;test case;test data	Kesheng Wu;Wendy S.

By observing the global performance of a group of homogeneous agents-supported by a nonglobal knowledge of their environment-we attempt to extract information about the minimum size of the agent neurocontroller and the type of learning mechanism that collectively generate high-performing and robust behaviors with minimal computational effort. Consequently, a methodology for obtaining controllers of minimal size is introduced and a comparative study between supervised and unsupervised learning mechanisms for the generation of successful collective behaviors is presented. We have developed a prototype simulated world for our studies. This case study is primarily a computer games inspired world but its main features are also biologically plausible. The two specific tasks that the agents are tested in are the competing strategies of obstacle-avoidance and target-achievement. We demonstrate that cooperative behavior among agents, which is supported only by limited communication, appears to be necessary for the problem's efficient solution and that learning by rewarding the behavior of agent groups constitutes a more efficient and computationally preferred generic approach than supervised learning approaches in such complex multiagent worlds	agent-based model;analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;artificial life;beta;central processing unit;coefficient;complex dynamics;computation;density functional theory;emergence;emoticon;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;interaction;pc game;performance evaluation;prototype;robustness (computer science);section 508 amendment to the rehabilitation act of 1973;simulation;supervised learning;test set;top-down and bottom-up design;truevision tga;unsupervised learning;vii	Georgios N.

However, the estimation of the market prices of risk is an open question in the jump-diffusion derivative literature when a closed-form solution is not known. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for estimating the functions of the risk-neutral processes directly from market data. Moreover, this new approach avoids the estimation of the physical drift as well as the market prices of risk in order to price commodity futures. More precisely, we obtain some results that relate the risk-neutral drifts, volatilities and parameters of the jump amplitude distributions with market data. Finally, we examine the accuracy of the proposed method with NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) data and we show the benefits of using jump processes for modelling the commodity price dynamics in commodity futures models.

6da266ba88b2651e5986baacaa5b6a6994dc335d	microchannels for thermal management in fpgas		Thermal management of electronics is a key area of interest in today's age of 3D VLSI integration and compute-intensive applications. Microchannel cooling is gaining a lot of attention as a viable and effective means of thermal management in modern ICs. Since FPGAs are playing a greater role in the high performance computing application market, conventional heat sinks will not be sufficient to meet the high thermal budgets of such power hungry applications. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of microchannel based cooling in the context of FPGA based designs. We explore both conventional and stacked 3D FPGA designs which incorporate microchannels and analyze simulation data on microchannel cooling performance. Our study shows that microchannel based heatsinks outperform air cooling by 40 to 50 % for both conventional and 3D designs.	air cooling;computer cooling;field-programmable gate array;heat sink;simulation;supercomputer;thermal management (electronics);thermal management of high-power leds;very-large-scale integration	Girish Deshpande;Dinesh K.

It defines differential algebraic equations (DAE) which can be solved using numerical algorithms. In order to solve a DAE, Jacobian of the model is required. In this paper, a full Java implementation of Modelica model generator is made using Automatic Differentiation (AD). The generated model is packaged in a software component standard in order to be plugged in different solvers (DAE, ODE, and Optimization). Depending on the static or dynamic nature of Modelica models, the treatment is adapted in order to take advantage of automatic differentiation. Especially, in the case of static model, a Jacobian is given as sensitivity information to the optimization algorithm.	algorithm;automatic differentiation;component-based software engineering;differential algebraic equation;dynamical system;gradient;jacobian matrix and determinant;java anon proxy;java applet;mathematical optimization;modeling language;numerical analysis;open dynamics engine;simulation	Franck Verdiere;Abir Rezgui;Sana Gaaloul;Benoit Delinchant;Laurent Gerbaud;Frédéric Wurtz;Xavier Brunotte	2012	2012 UKSim 14th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSim.2012.56	computer science;theoretical computer science;programming language;algorithm	Robotics	-40.06420914951353	-15.418131504317596	40003

We develop a systematic framework to quantify the potential errors of traceroute measurement in AS-level topology inference. In comparing traceroute-derived AS paths with BGP AS paths, we take a novel approach to identifying mismatched path segments and then inferring the causes of these mismatches through a set of tests. Our results show that about 60% of mismatches are due to routers using IP addresses belonging to peering neighbors. This result helps settle a debate in previous works regarding the major cause of errors in traceroute measurement. With the approximate ground truth of the ASes with BGP monitors inside, we identify the inaccuracy of publicly available traceroute-derived topology datasets and find that between 8% and 42% of AS adjacencies on the monitored ASes are false. With a new method to characterize AS links, we show that the derived (false) links between Tier-1/large ISPs and their customers' customers appear more frequently than real links do.	approximation algorithm;border gateway protocol;care-of address;cognitive dimensions of notations;corner case;coupling (computer programming);enlightenment;ground truth;internet;peering;router (computing);routing table;traceroute	Yu M.

37eb492f054bc782a4be694550ab48907f1b6b56	possibility theory and its applications: where do we stand?		This chapter provides an overview of possibility theory, emphasizing its historical roots and its recent developments. Possibility theory lies at the crossroads between fuzzy sets, probability and non-monotonic reasoning. Possibility theory can be cast either in an ordinal or in a numerical setting. Qualitative possibility theory is closely related to belief revision theory, and common-sense reasoning with exception-tainted knowledge in Artificial Intelligence. Possibilistic logic provides a rich representation setting, which enables the handling of lower bounds of possibility theory measures, while remaining close to classical logic. Qualitative possibility theory has been axiomatically justified in a decision-theoretic framework in the style of Savage, thus providing a foundation for qualitative decision theory. Quantitative possibility theory is the simplest framework for statistical reasoning with imprecise probabilities. As such it has close connections with random set theory and confidence intervals, and can provide a tool for uncertainty propagation with limited statistical or subjective information.	artificial intelligence;belief revision;commonsense reasoning;decision theory;fuzzy set;non-monotonic logic;numerical analysis;ordinal data;possibility theory;propagation of uncertainty;set theory;software propagation	Didier Dubois;Henri Prade	2015		10.1007/978-3-662-43505-2_3	dempster–shafer theory;machine learning;belief revision;artificial intelligence;mathematical optimization;commonsense reasoning;possibility theory;decision theory;non-monotonic logic;fuzzy set;set theory;mathematics	AI	-40.04216709855221	-15.410307378601061	40005

Since the communication messages and solution methods of agents are significantly influenced by the contract type, we define the grammar of contracts first. By using this generalized contract grammar, we can express new creative contract types as well as the traditional ones like bids and auctions. The messages in agent based commerce have adopted three layers: agent communication language, electronic commerce and product specification layers. For electronic commerce, the agent is regarded as an extension of expert systems with the additional capability of communication control and meta-problem-solving. A prototype agent based commerce development environment, UNIK-AGENT is developed to implement the idea. The procedure of message generation and solution method selection is illustrated with the case of computer purchase.	e-commerce;intelligent agent	Jae Kyu Lee;Woongkyu Lee	1997		10.1109/HICSS.1997.663394	the internet;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;product design specification;software agent;database;development environment;expert system;commerce	AI	-40.041447045526	-15.396777092678219	40006

The results of holdout and cross-validation experiments show that CF by RSE of SVMs with polynomial kernel outperforms other seven classifiers, i.e., Curvelet features by SVMs classifier, Gabor features by SVMs classifier, CF by five individual SVMs classifiers. With CF and RSE of SVMs with polynomial kernel, the classification accuracies of drivers’ fatigue expressions are over 90% in both of the holdout and cross-validation experiments, which show the proposed approach of combined features extraction and RSE of SVMs can be used for developing Human-centric Driver Fatigue Monitoring Systems to increase driving safety.	cross-validation (statistics);curvelet;experiment;gabor wavelet;polynomial kernel;support vector machine;wavelet transform	Chihang Zhao;Jie Lian;Qian Dang;Can Tong	2014	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-120717	gabor transform;support vector machine;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics	ML	-40.05239718570904	-15.41001124080582	40007

Generally, the light reflected from an object is partially polarized. The degree of polarization depends upon the incident angle, which, in turn, depends upon the surface normal. Therefore, we can obtain surface normals of objects by observing the degree of polarization at each surface point. Unfortunately, the correspondence between the degree of polarization and the surface normal is not one to one. Hence, to obtain the correct surface normal, we have to solve the ambiguity problem. In this paper, we introduce a method to solve the ambiguity by comparing the polarization data in two objects, i.e., normal position and tilted with small angle position. We also discuss the geometrical features of the object surface and propose a method for matching two sets of polarization data at identical points on the object surface.	degree of polarization;matching;normal (geometry);physical object;polarization (waves);polarizer;polarizing filter (photography)	Daisuke Miyazaki;Masataka Kagesawa;Katsushi Ikeuchi	2004	IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence	10.1109/TPAMI.2004.10010	computer vision;shape;degree of polarization;computer science;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;mathematics;geometry;transparency	Vision	-40.071462596455824	-15.413182234617166	40009

IUHM emerged as a result of the development of the OPALES system, a collaborative environment for exploring and indexing video archives in a digital library. A basic design requirement of OPALES is that it must permit and support the integration of new services throughout its life cycle. Thus, IUHM depends heavily upon the notions of extensibility and openness.Support for openness, extensibility and late binding of services is provided in the IUHM model by a single reflexive mechanism. This uniform mechanism is used for describing all relationships between arbitrary system entities, including services, data and metadata. The mechanism in question consists of a generic, computable hypertext structure with typed links, known as the Information Unit (IU), and is the minimal structural scheme to which all encapsulated entities comply.We describe and justify the design of the Information Unit, as well as the semantics of its four link types, namely role, type, owner, relative. We further describe the minimal kernel of the runtime layer responsible for the dynamic behaviour specified by the IUHM compliant hypertext network. We discuss the mechanisms involved in the dynamic binding of services and service composition. We illustrate these notions by real-world examples of the integration of metadata services within the OPALES system.	archive;computable function;digital library;entity;extensibility;hypermedia;hypertext;instruction unit;late binding;openness;service composability principle	Marc Nanard;Jocelyne Nanard;Peter R.

16d36b1abca19bf532017cd5ea2c4bc44ccb4f6f	a key management scheme for iot-based video surveillance systems based on fingerprints		Nowadays, the evolving threats of terrorist and criminal attacks against public places have urged the need for active video surveillance systems. Such systems rely on video analytics modules that identify and pre-alarm abnormal events occurring in sensed visual scenes in real-time. By implementing these smart features in the digital cameras, the design of distributed and adaptive physical security policies is made possible. Yet, within these systems, data security and privacy are a major concern. In this paper, we introduce a video surveillance system whose architecture is based on the IoT model. The device layer of this architecture includes smart cameras that communicate in machine-to-machine (M2M) manner. Then, we propose a tunneling framework that ensures the security of the M2M communications. The novelty of this framework is that it uses a shared secret in order to generate a cipher key and the video sensor fingerprints as the main authentication parameter. The security evaluation of our framework has also shown its resistance to well known attacks.	artificial intelligence;authentication;cipher;closed-circuit television;data security;digital camera;fingerprint;key management;machine to machine;physical security;privacy;real-time clock;real-time locating system;shared secret;smart tv;smart camera;tunneling protocol;video content analysis;video sensor technology	Ihsen Nakouri;Mohamed Hamdi;Tai-Hoon Kim	2018	2018 IEEE 27th International Conference on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE)	10.1109/WETICE.2018.00026	shared secret;architecture;smart camera;distributed computing;computer science;data security;device fingerprint;physical security;authentication;analytics	EDA	-40.067226548581665	-15.40455686079829	40012

The multidatabase service manages multiple concurrent requests to read data from and write data to component databases through interleaving atomic transactions. The global transaction manager is the MDBS component that guarantees the correct execution, recovery, and global atomicity of multiple distributed global transactions.This paper describes a model for-transaction management in the CORDS distributed environment. We apply the CORDS transaction management model to the design and implementation of an architecture for the global transaction manager in the CORDS MDBS. In particular, we discuss a design for a transaction interface, a multidatabase concurrency control scheduler, and a recovery manager. We also describe some tentative extensions to increase the richness and flexibility of the model to include a broader class of applications.		Gopi K. Attaluri;Dexter P.

Prediction and prevention of CVD have therefore become important social problems. Many groups have developed prediction models for asymptomatic CVD by classifying its risk based on established risk factors (e.g., age, sex, etc.). More recently, studies have uncovered that many genetic variants are associated with CVD outcomes/traits. If treated as single or multiple risk factors, the genetic information could improve the performance of prediction models as well as promote the development of individually tailored risk models. In this paper, eligible genome-wide association studies for CVD outcomes/traits will be overviewed. Clinical trials on CVD prediction using genetic information will be summarized from overall aspects. As yet, most of the single or multiple genetic markers, which have been evaluated in the follow-up clinical studies, did not significantly improve discrimination of CVD. However, the potential clinical utility of genetic information has been uncovered initially and is expected for further development.	cardiovascular diseases;cessation of life;classification;financial risk modeling;genetic markers;trait	Li-Na Pu;Ze Zhao;Yuan-Ting Zhang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2012.2205009	genomics;medicine;computer science;bioinformatics;circulatory system;predictive modelling;heart	Visualization	-40.05449129826722	-15.412731661768714	40014

It has increased access to (and the openness of) data published online through a twofold process: firstly, information hitherto unavailable to users has been shared and incorporated into the project, and secondly, data previously locked in non-Open types (e.g. PDF) has been published in a machine-readable format, increasing discoverability in the context of the wider Web. Connections between datasets that could only be identified through a human user engaging separately with each existing project have now been made explicit, and the resulting aggregated data is queryable from a single userinterface (UI). Three projects contribute to JazzCats: a social network connecting musicians through various types of relationships is provided by LinkedJazz (Pattuelli, 2016); details of solos within performances (including pitch, key, and chord changes) are available from WJazzD (Pfleiderer et al., 2016); and Body&Soul (Bowen, 2013) is a discography of over 200 recordings. These complementary data contain instance-level overlaps for recordings and musicians. Bringing these resources together has enabled a new type of research question, possible only through using criteria from one dataset to inform and hone results from another.	discoverability;human-readable medium;linked data;openness;performance;portable document format;prototype;social network;user interface	Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller;Daniel Bangert;Alfie Abdul-Rahman	2017			humanities;prosopography;history	Web+IR	-47.129938323580426	-23.65362451219805	40114

The era of the Semantic Web requires a convergence toward commonly shared meanings. The combination of fuzzy cognitive maps with graph databases is a first approach to a solution. This article determines the basic requirements for the storing of fuzzy cognitive maps to test current graph databases for their structural suitability. Six out of 47 graph databases fulfill the requirements and are thus recommended for further research purposes. As a proof of concept, OrientDB is used to present how a semantic convergence can be reached through the combination of fuzzy cognitive maps and graph databases in a cognitive city by tackling fuzziness.	cognitive map;graph database;orientdb;requirement;semantic web	Sara D'Onofrio;Marcel Wehrle;Edy Portmann;Thomas Myrach	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015657	artificial intelligence;nosql;proof of concept;machine learning;graph database;fuzzy cognitive map;computer science;soft computing;semantic web;data mining;cognition;convergence (routing)	Robotics	-38.97286948526437	1.9166082883098574	40164

b457f02bb01be95e14b16dcba3730a427c446b5a	an excellent year and a transition	excellent year	This issue begins the twenty-third year of publication for Neural Networks, which is the leading journal in the world that covers the full range of neural networks and related research from all the areas of psychology and cognitive science, neuroscience and neuropsychology, mathematical and computational analysis, engineering and design, and technology and applications. As the archival journal of the International Neural Network Society (INNS), the European Neural Network Society (ENNS), and the Japanese Neural Network Society (JNNS), Neural Networks encourages all of our neural modeling colleagues to send in their best results as contributed articles to the journal both directly and through contributions to the journal’s Special Issues. This year, the founding editor-in-chief of Neural Networks, Stephen Grossberg, will step down from his editorial position. Grossberg wrote a separate editorial that appeared in the December 2010 issue of the journal with reflections about the development of the neural networks community since his founding activities. He is replaced, effective January 1, 2011, by Professor DeLiang Wang of Ohio State University. Professor Wang has also served as President of the International Neural Network Society, which Professor Grossberg also founded. As the world’s largest publishing house, Elsevier also offers the great benefit of Science Direct to millions of scientists world-wide, whichmakes Neural Networks articles easily accessible via the web everywhere in the world. In this regard, we are happy to see that downloads of Neural Networks on Science Direct have continued to increase quickly over the years. We remain committed to welcoming students as readers of Neural Networks. For example, a student can get a full year’s subscription to 10 issues of Neural Networks by joining INNS for US $25 for one year or US $35 for two years, ENNS for 48 Euros, and JNNS for 11,000 yen (plus a 2,000 yen enrollment fee). An important part of our mission is to publish Special Issues on topics of current interest. The three editorial offices are open to proposals from experts in a given field of neural networks who think the time is ripe for a Special Issue in that area. We are also happy to have proposals for review articles from experts in a given field of neural networks who think that advances in the field are ready to be presented to readers of the journal. In the past year, three Special Issues were published with the following topics and co-editors: ‘‘Social Cognition: From Babies to Robots’’ by Stephen Grossberg, Andrew Meltzoff, Javier Movellan, and Nora Newcombe; ‘‘Artificial Neural Networks: Selected Papers from ICANN 2008’’ by Vera Kurkova, Roman Neruda, and Jan Koutnik; and ‘‘Analysis and Modeling of Massively Parallel Neural Signals’’ by Yuji Ikegaya, Tomoki Fukai, and Stefan Rotter. In the coming year, three Special Issues will be published with the topics, co-editors, and scopes listed below.	amiga reflections;archive;artificial neural network;cognitive science;computation;editorial;european neural network society;jan dietz;largest;mathematics;movellan;neotoma stephensi;neural networks;neuropsychology;neuroscience discipline;paper;scientific publication;social cognition;yen	Kenji Doya;Stephen Grossberg;John G.

1caa40e5add3dc9b9331bf797679f7d2a1c4c447	mobile knowledge management support in fire service organisations	knowledge management	In emergency domains like fire services, the need for support systems enabling instant mobile access to mission-critical knowledge from different heterogeneous knowledge sources has increased significantly during the past years. A comprehensive socio-technical study that focuses on the current state of working and on the needs of the people working in fire services was conducted within the European Project AMIRA (Advanced Multimodal Intelligence for Remote Assistance). Based on the results of this study, the AMIRA system was designed, which supports knowledge management by a system that integrates various knowledge sources through an intelligent mediator component called CAKE (Collaborative Agent-based Knowledge Engine). The knowledge can be assessed through multi-modal mobile and stationary clients. The developed system has been implemented as prototype and successfully evaluated in a comprehensive evaluation based on user trials.	knowledge management;mission critical;modal logic;multimodal interaction;prototype;sociotechnical system;stationary process	Andrea Freßmann;Ralph Bergmann;Brian Taylor;Ben Diamond;Gary Carr-Smith	2007			organizational learning;data management;computer science;knowledge management;personal knowledge management	AI	-34.5620858932176	-11.13235712935878	40581

fcc7cdd97cb0f11be0a4862fc475d5ed2dd00458	an innovative portal for rare genetic diseases research	rare diseases;biomedical semantics;semantic web;interoperability;data integration	"""Advances in """"omics"""" hardware and software technologies are bringing rare diseases research back from the sidelines. Whereas in the past these disorders were seldom considered relevant, in the era of whole genome sequencing the direct connections between rare phenotypes and a reduced set of genes are of vital relevance. This increased interest in rare genetic diseases research is pushing forward investment and effort towards the creation of software in the field, and leveraging the wealth of available life sciences data. Alas, most of these tools target one or more rare diseases, are focused solely on a single type of user, or are limited to the most relevant scientific breakthroughs for a specific niche. Furthermore, despite some high quality efforts, the ever-growing number of resources, databases, services and applications is still a burden to this area. Hence, there is a clear interest in new strategies to deliver a holistic perspective over the entire rare genetic diseases research domain. This is Diseasecard's reasoning, to build a true lightweight knowledge base covering rare genetic diseases. Developed with the latest semantic web technologies, this portal delivers unified access to a comprehensive network for researchers, clinicians, patients and bioinformatics developers. With in-context access covering over 20 distinct heterogeneous resources, Diseasecard's workspace provides access to the most relevant scientific knowledge regarding a given disorder, whether through direct common identifiers or through full-text search over all connected resources. In addition to its user-oriented features, Diseasecard's semantic knowledge base is also available for direct querying, enabling everyone to include rare genetic diseases knowledge in new or existing information systems. Diseasecard is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/diseasecard/."""

The ACDCA (Austrian Center for Didactics of Computer Algebra) started these series of Conferences in 1992 holding the first ACDCA Summer Academy Meeting. The main aim of this conference series was to share ideas, experiences and research on the use of symbolic calculation software in mathematics education. After two meetings, in 1994 the first International Derive Conference was held. This conference was focused in the use of Derive CAS (Computer Algebra System) in different Science disciplines. Since then, the ACDCA Summer Academy Meeting and the International Derive Conference were held in alternating years. Specifically, the ACDCA Summer Academy Meetings were held in Krems, Austria (1992 and 1993); Honolulu, USA (1995); Sarö, Sweden (1997); Gösing, Austria (1999) and Portoroz, Slovenia (2000). The International Derive Conference was held in Plymouth, United Kingdom (1994); Bonn, Germany (1996); Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, USA (1998) and Liverpool, United Kingdom (2000). In 2002, the two conferences merged into one in Vienna, Austria. The name given to this Joint Conference was Technology and its Integration into Mathematics Education (TIME). Since then, TIME Conferences have been a very important meeting point for professionals in the use of technology in Mathematics Education. TIME has been held as a biannual symposium in Vienna, Austria (2002); Montreal, Canada (2004); Dresden, Germany (2006) Buffelspoort Resort, South Africa (2008); Málaga, Spain (2010). TIME 2012 Joint Conference was held from July 10th to 14th in Tartu, Estonia (http://time2012.ut. ee/) with the 12th ACDCA Summer Academy and 10th Conference for CAS in Education & Research (former International Derive Conference). The topics of TIME Conferences are the ones inherited from the ACDCA Summer Academy Meetings (mainly focused on didactical issues connected with the use of technology) and from the International Derive Conference (mainly geared towards exploring the use of CAS software and symbolic calculators in education at the high school, lycée, college and university levels, and towards using these tools in programming and research).	academy;computer algebra system;journal of symbolic computation;liverpool;plymouth;www	José Luis Galán García;Gabriel Aguilera Venegas;Pedro Rodríguez Cielos	2014	J.

b7ad2efe85394c740bc1c52e56a9a99562750aa8	mining hierarchies and similarity clusters from value set repositories		A value set is a collection of permissible values used to describe a specific conceptual domain for a given purpose. By helping to establish a shared semantic understanding across use cases, these artifacts are important enablers of interoperability and data standardization. As the size of repositories cataloging these value sets expand, knowledge management challenges become more pronounced. Specifically, discovering value sets applicable to a given use case may be challenging in a large repository. In this study, we describe methods to extract implicit relationships between value sets, and utilize these relationships to overlay organizational structure onto value set repositories. We successfully extract two different structurings, hierarchy and clustering, and show how tooling can leverage these structures to enable more effective value set discovery.

c520afb768ffb8976f7fe2441bf8b1771cd8c79e	a linked data approach to know-how		The Web is one of the major repositories of human generated know-how, such as step-by-step videos and instructions. This knowledge can be potentially reused in a wide variety of applications, but it currently suffers from a lack of structure and isolation from related knowledge. To overcome these challenges we have developed a Linked Data framework which can automate the extraction of know-how from existing Web resources and generate links to related knowledge on the Linked Data Cloud. We have implemented our framework and used it to extract a Linked Data representation of two of the largest know-how repositories on the Web. We demonstrate two possible uses of the resulting dataset of real-world know-how. Firstly, we use this dataset within a Web application to offer an integrated visualization of distributed knowhow resources. Lastly, we show the potential of this dataset for inferring common sense knowledge about tasks.	commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence);linked data;tag cloud;web application;web resource;world wide web	Paolo Pareti;Benoit Testu;Ryutaro Ichise;Ewan Klein;Adam Barker	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-17966-7_24	web application;web resource;data mining;knowledge extraction;cloud computing;procedural knowledge;commonsense knowledge;linked data;computer science;know-how	Web+IR	-39.29435419116353	3.1968886327769406	41000

Globalisation leads administrations to become more interoperable, irrespective of national borders. To meet these requirements, administrations and IT systems need to become more efficient. One of the main principles in software engineering is reusability. This can be applied on all levels. There is still a lot of potential at the content level. The idea of reusing content is not new but especially in federal structures where central solutions are nearly impossible this is a great challenge. The document describes an approach that allows information to be collected in a decentralised way and makes it available in an interdisciplinary manner and across regional borders. Core Directories will be designed and used as an infrastructural component to make them accessible for multiple applications. In order to share information, data interoperability standards are needed.	directory (computing);e-government;freedom of information laws by country;information management;interoperability;linkage (software);ontology (information science);requirement;software engineering	Christian Welzel;Heiko Hartenstein;Jörn von Lucke	2009			knowledge management;computer science;globalization;e-government;interoperability;reuse;public sector;information technology;reusability	SE	-43.43450033769729	3.4637591887112515	41179

254113e75a680c9f014121c656ef652531a778e4	remembrances of bob paige	bob	I first met Bob in 1969. He had just come to New York to join the systems staff at the Courant Institute. We had a CDC6600 back then, but our computing services were in the dark ages. Bob was hired to debug a home-grown time sharing system that didn’t work. He turned out to be a perfect hire; Bob thoughtfully discarded the code and built the system afresh. Our acquaintance was casual for years. I was just aware that he was an outstanding systems implementor who was knowledgeable about music and film. His name also appeared at the top of the Institute chess ladder. That was no mean feat; the Institute had a number of Russian students back then, and most were strong players. Time passed, and our relationship grew. But we really got to know each other after we both became faculty members at NYU. Somehow, we started having discussions of all sorts: computer science, math, advising students, programming languages, research, chess, parenthood, children and family, growing up, music, film, restaurants, life, and doing the right thing. Whatever the topic, Bob always had something insightful to say. I have to confess that Bob was a hard study. His interests were broad, and he often used the power of metaphor and literary allusion to make a point. I recall several discussions where I struggled to keep up with what he was saying. As I came to understand over time, Bob had extremely high standards, and it is fair to suggest that there were times when he himself did not meet them. This was never a reason for him to give up, but rather to work harder. For example, Bob had felt that his mathematics background was inadequate, so he took some math classes. I never completely understood just why he thought that mathematics was so important to his research, but it is fair to say that mathematical ideas and paradigms influenced his work. Bob was especially proud of his programming version of finite differencing, which he invented to maintain program invariants and to generate efficient code. Very few systems researchers have as mathematical and high a level perspective about programming languages as Bob had. His was visionary. His research pursued very long term problems that almost no one thought could be solved.

The project has had as one of its main objectives the quality control of 3D data and establishing a metadata schema to support the provenance and paradata required for quality assurance of 3D models. This paper describes provenance in the CRMdig schema, the paradata principles of the London Charter and how provenance and paradata could be relevant for the new strategy of Europeana. The schema, which builds on earlier work in the CARARE project, aims to foster the adoption of a clearer approach to describing the features of cultural object, the techniques and the methodologies chosen for the digitization and the motivation behind the creation of a digital object.

При построении такого рода систем особую актуальность приобретают проблемы разработки и применения эффективных методов систематизации и поиска разнородной (научные публикации, тематические коллекции документов, базы данных, ГИС-системы и т.п.) электронной информации. Традиционные методы информационного поиска, основанные на использовании ключевых слов, обладают рядом недостатков, связанных, например, с многозначностью (polysemous) используемых в запросе терминов, а также недостаточным знанием пользователями терминологии самой предметной области. Одним из перспективных направлений исследований и разработок в плане повышения эффективности информационного поиска является применение методов онтологического моделирования (ontology-based information retrieval) [5,7,8,12,14–16,18]. Такие системы информационного поиска учитывают смысловое содержание терминов запроса, используют онтологии, как для индексации информационных ресурсов, так и для организации семантического поиска. В данной работе предлагаются технологии систематизации и поиска электронной научной информации, разработанные и реализованные при построении и развитии ИАС «Природные ресурсы Карелии», а также приводятся результаты проведенных экспериментов для оценки эффективности этих технологий. Наиболее близкими по теме наших исследований и разработок являются подходы, представленные, например, в работах [2,8,15].	information retrieval;internet authentication service	Vladimir Vdovitsyn;Viktor Lebedev	2011			knowledge management;library science;natural resource;engineering	AI	-45.27715751457881	-20.5801441298125	41766

This is certainly the case in the field of materials science. For example, Materials Project has generated computational data on over 60,000 chemical compounds and has made that data available through a Web portal and REST interface. However, such portals must seek to incorporate community submissions to expand the scope of scientific data sharing. In this paper, we describe MPContribs, a computing/software infrastructure to integrate and organize contributions of simulated or measured materials data from users. Our solution supports complex submissions and provides interfaces that allow contributors to share analyses and graphs. A RESTful API exposes mechanisms for book-keeping, retrieval and aggregation of submitted entries, as well as persistent URIs or DOIs that can be used to reference the data in publications. Our approach isolates contributed data from a host project's quality-controlled core data and yet enables analyses across the entire dataset, programmatically or through customized web apps. We expect the developed framework to enhance collaborative determination of material properties and to maximize the impact of each contributor's dataset. In the long-term, MPContribs seeks to make Materials Project an institutional, and thus community-wide, memory for computational and experimental materials science.	application programming interface;computation;core data;graph (discrete mathematics);portals;representational state transfer;uniform resource identifier;web application	Patrick Huck;Anubhav Jain;Dan Gunter;Donald Winston;Kristin A.

47fa11b08f69fcf3988a4c442155b56e9131b97d	special issue on verification and validation	verification and validation	During the past decade there has been a growing interest in verification and validation (V&V) as a distinct part of computational mechanics. In part, the evidence for this increased interest is the formation of, and publication by, engineering society standards groups with a focus on V&V. In computational fluid dynamics there is the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Computational Fluid Dynamics standards committee with their seminal 1998 publication: ‘‘AIAA Guide for the Verification and Validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations’’ (G-077-1998). More recently, in solid and structural mechanics the American Society of Mechanics Engineers (ASME) Performance Test Codes Subcommittee on Verification and Validation in Computational Solid Mechanics (PTC-60) and its 2006 publication ‘‘Guide for Verification and Validation in Computational Solid Mechanics (ASME V&V 10-2006); an overview of this Guide is the first paper in this special edition and serves, in part, as an introduction to V&V. Beyond the above cited standards documents, other recent V&V related standards activities include the formation of the ASME Performance Test Codes Subcommittee on Verification and Validation in Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer (PTC-61) and the renewed, December 2006, interest by the American Nuclear Society (ANS) to update their 1987 standard ‘‘Verification and Validation of Scientific and Engineering Computer Programs for the Nuclear Industry’’ (ANS 10.4). Other significant V&V related activities include editorial policy statements related to V&V by the ASME Journal of Fluid Engineering (1991), the June 2005 editorial statement of the Clinical Biomechanics Journal, and the 2006 AIAA technical journal editorial policy on V&V covering all AIAA technical journals. We believe this to be the first special edition of any journal devoted to V&V in computational mechanics. The papers in this special edition grew out of a minisymposium on ‘‘Advances and Accomplishments in Verification & Validation’’ that was part of the 2006 World Congress on Computational Mechanics sponsored by the International Association for Computational Mechanics (IACM). Following the ASME Guide overview paper, this special issue contains fours papers; three focused on verification issues, specifically code verification, and one dealing with validation. The article by Eca, Hoekstra, Hay and Pelletier, ‘‘Verification of RANS solvers with Manufactured Solutions,’’ deals with using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) to investigate turbulent flow models. They investigate the Spalart-Allmaras one equation turbulence model, and several k–e and k–x turbulence models for twodimensional, steady, wall-bounded, incompressible flows using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Typically, MMS has been used to test computer codes in order to find coding errors, or mistakes, in the software. This article, however, uses MMS very effectively to test the robustness of the mathematical models of the physics, as well as the robustness of the numerical algorithms that map the partial differential equations of the mathematical model to the discrete mathematical model.

a25d7fbfdfb33b818890ffe4712c351cd484c3c5	distilling information from a flood: a possibility for the use of meta-analysis and systematic review in machine learning research		The current flood of information in all areas of machine learning research, from computer vision to reinforcement learning, has made it difficult to make aggregate scientific inferences. It can be challenging to distill a myriad of similar papers into a set of useful principles, to determine which new methodologies to use for a particular application, and to be confident that one has compared against all relevant related work when developing new ideas. However, such a rapidly growing body of research literature is a problem that other fields have already faced – in particular, medicine and epidemiology. In those fields, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been used exactly for dealing with these issues and it is not uncommon for entire journals to be dedicated to such analyses. Here, we suggest the field of machine learning might similarly benefit from meta-analysis and systematic review, and we encourage further discussion and development along this direction.

A set of achievable requirements has been identified which are used to realise a solution that is applied to the modelling of ephemeral flood channels. The solution described provides: (1) a common data repository within which all model run details, scientific data sets and output results reside; (2) the ability to interactively visualise and select suitable data sets from the data repository to configure the model; (3) an interface for mediating the flow of information between model and other applications; and (4) the possibility to allow model functionality and associated data to be made available to the wider scientific community. This is achieved using an object-oriented approach within the Research System Inc. Interactive Data Language (IDL) and the adoption of National Center for Supercomputer Application's HDF as a common file format for modelling scenarios. The paper outlines the development of a class library, EM_HDF, for mediating and facilitating data exchange between the model and its HDF data repository. The developed system is designed to be applicable to a wide range of modelling applications beyond the fluvial model described.

Since I know that some of the entries on topics I understand are flawed, how can I trust those on topics about which I know nothing? Perhaps most disconcerting of all as far as this discouraging line of thought goes is the entry for Fortran (81). I had to read it several times before I realized its mirthful intent, though others, I am sure, will catch on as soon as they read """"Fortran is the programming language considered by many to be the natural successor to Lisp and Prolog for AIresearch"""" and be splitting their sides by the time they reach the contributor, Aloysius Hacker. What worries me is that now I know that some of the descriptions are booby-trapped in this way, how can I ever trust the entries for such outlandish sounding techniques as viewer-centered co-ordinates (252)? To be fair, most of these quibbles are largely due to the fact that the entries are unsolicited contributions which have been arbitrarily altered by the reviewers, so the problems with them cannot be laid directly at anyone's door. This style is inevitable in a document that attempts, as this does, to present an ever-changing picture of the state of AI with readers urged to write in with improvements and updates. I believe, however, that it would improve the catalogue if some kind of quality control was applied to the entries to ensure a more even standard even if this means slowing down the turnover of editions. It would also make the catalogue more useful and a more worthwhile purchase. Who is going to buy a reference book that cannot be fully trusted and which they are expected to make redundant by picking holes in, unless of course a discount on the next edition is offered to contributors?"""	automatic sounding;computation;computational logic;fortran;hacker;lisp;programming language;prolog;reference work;springer (tank)	Simon Parsons	1991	Knowledge Eng.

BDA enable queries of large highly diverse and real volumes of patient data in an interactively dynamic way that enriches the use of the platform with data visualization for healthcare. We established a Healthcare BDA (HBDA) platform at the University of Victoria (UVic) with Compute Canada/Westgrid, and Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA), Victoria, BC, Canada. The framework was a proof-of-concept implementation that tested emulated patient data representative of the main hospital system at VIHA. We cross-referenced all data, its profiles and metadata, with the existing clinical reporting. Our HBDA platform and its performance was tested for different patient query types in simulation with the data ingested into Hadoop file system over different applications of Apache Spark with Zeppelin and Jupyter web-based interfaces, and Apache Drill interfaces. The results showed that the ingestion time of one billion records took circa 2 hours via Apache Spark. Apache Drill outperformed Spark/Zeppelin and Spark/Jupyter. However, it was restricted to running more simplified queries, and very limited in its visualizations exhibiting poor usability for healthcare. Zeppelin running on Spark showed ease-of-use interactions for health applications, but it lacked the flexibility of its interface tools and required extra setup time before running queries. Jupyter on Spark offered high performance stacks not only over our HBDA platform but also in unison to run all queries simultaneously with high usability for a variety of reporting requirements by providers and health professionals.	apache drill;apache hadoop;apache spark;big data;broadcast driver architecture;circa;data visualization;emulator;flip-flop (electronics);ipython;interaction;interactivity;requirement;simulation;unison;usability;victoria (3d figure);web application;westgrid	Dillon Chrimes;Belaid Moa;Hamid Zamani;Mu-Hsing Kuo	2016	2016 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 14th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 2nd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)	10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2016.140	engineering;data mining;database;world wide web	DB	-35.20740934263437	0.2140649473227974	42426

5a99a4fa3fe71e1361f6a476d29086c9b19af2c2	a mapreduce based distributed framework for similarity search in healthcare big data environment		Similarity search in the big data environment is a challenging task. Patient Similarity search (PaSi) is an important issue in healthcare network and data. The results of PaSi search may be highly useful for drawing different conclusions and decisions to improve healthcare systems. Such findings can also be useful for choosing the treatment paths for new patients. In this paper, we propose a MapReduce based framework as a solution to the PaSi problem in the context of a healthcare network imagined to be implemented considering the healthcare centers of India. It is assumed that such a healthcare network will be implemented in future over the Government of India cloud known as GI cloud or ‘MeghRaj’. The paper also discusses the associated implementation challenges of the proposed framework and the query handling approach for the proposed framework to solve the PaSi problem is stated. Finally, the paper outlines the future scope of the work.	big data;mapreduce;similarity search	Hiren Kumar Deva Sarma;Yogesh Kumar Dwivedi;Nripendra P. Rana;Emma L.

He graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Engineering and from this time all his life had been indissoluably associated with science. Two stages may be singled out in Yablonsky's scientific career . The first one (1959-1970) is associated with research in operation of complex engineering systems. ,At the time he published works on statistical detection theory, mathematical research in physical analogies of random search of optimum in multiextremal problems, analysis of automata behaviour in the experiments on the choice with strengthening. The second stage includes the period between 1971-1986, when Yablonsky worked at the Institute for History of Science and Technology (1971-1978) and at the AllUnion Research Institute for Systems Studies (1978-1986). At this time Yablonsky studied social systems and, first of all, laws of structure, operation and development of science as a specific social system. Into this area, new to him, Yablonsky brought the methodological culture of his former speciality. This made possible to develop an original approach to the study of social systems. This approach includes mathematical modelling as a specific research tool. Yablonsky succeeded in studing mathematical laws describing the behaviour of the """"science as a whole"""", as well as in putting complex problems associated with application of mathematical statistics, catastrophe theory, and non-linear thermodynamics to the modelling of social phenomena and trends. He was one of the first to attempt modelling the relationship between """"science as a whole"""" and the dynamics of social development, i.e. applying mathematical models to the development of policy for this area.

My first question was, “Do I have to relate what I have to say to design automation?” The answer was “No”. That seemed to me a bit odd but I accepted that. The second question was. “Do I have to talk all by myself for all of 40 minutes?” and the answer to that was “May be”. But I did find out last night that that's not necessary. I found out that I can ask out to indicate your agreement and disagreement, and to speak up and discuss and argue with me all during my talk. So my talk does no have to be an address or a lecture or a monologue, but instead can be an argument or a controversy. This is good and this pleases me, and this room is not too large for a good discussion.  Now let me establish two rules with regard to this argument. The first rule is this: that if you don't understand any word which I use, you should hold up your hand and ask me to explain it. If you allow me to use a word that you don't understand, then I will choose some one of you and ask you to explain it. The other the rule this: that if you ask me a question that perplexes me and that I don't know how to answer. I will simply say, “Let's talk about that later.”	automation;computer	Edmund C.

Significant efforts, like NDLTD, have arisen to achieve this purpose. However, currently there is little representation in these electronic databases from South Asian countries. A focused effort is required to increase the collections from these countries. This work is an effort to collect ETDs from India for harvesting and archival purposes. We develop a collection of metadata for theses and dissertations from India. Potential websites which may contain ETDs are identified manually. The URLs thus found from a collection of seeds which are fed to the Heritrix web-crawler for data collection. Splash pages are identified from the data collection and the metadata about ETDs is retrieved. The final product of the entire pipeline is a Dublin Core formatted Open Archives Initiative (OAI) compatible XML file which is ready for harvesting.	archive;case preservation;database;dublin core;html;heritrix;perl;pipeline (computing);unicode;web crawler;xml	Shalini R.

The growing availability of grid infrastructure to the wider scientific community has increased the amount of data produced by these experiments. Yet, without proper management for storing, retrieving and disseminating the results, potential benefits of grid computing may not be fully realized.  This tutorial provides an overview of the current state of the art in data management for grid computing. The topics presented include reviews of the existing research on data storage and retrieval, provenance, and data quality for grid computing. The tutorial will be beneficial for researchers in data management who want to understand data management issues in e-science and the potential in applying their current knowledge of data management to these specific issues.	computer data storage;data quality;e-science;experiment;grid computing	Maria Indrawan	2010		10.1145/1967486.1967491	semantic grid;data management;computer science;data grid;data mining;database;world wide web	HPC	-36.83136079738713	-5.729368881432704	43044

However, their services are limited by the data semantics and query expressiveness that they support. On the other hand, the recent work on selective dissemination of XML data has made significant progress in moving from XML filtering to the richer functionality of transformation for result customization, but in general has ignored the challenges of deploying such XML-based services on an Internet-scale. In this paper, we address these challenges in the context of incorporating the rich functionality of XML data dissemination in a highly scalable system. We present the architectural design of ONYX, a system based on an overlay network. We identify the salient technical challenges in supporting XML filtering and transformation in this environment and propose techniques for solving them.	internet;overlay network;sgi onyx;scalability;semantic data model;xml	Yanlei Diao;Shariq Rizvi;Michael J.

31454d1b03f418cf68e8fde07783dc61af34e2c1	recommending concepts to experts: an exploration of recommender techniques for collaborative ontology engineering platforms in the biomedical domain.		Biomedical ontologies such as the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and others are increasingly produced with the help of collaborative ontology engineering platforms that facilitate cooperation and coordination among a large number of users and contributors. While collaborative approaches to engineering biomedical ontologies can be expected to yield a number of advantages, such as increased participation and coverage, they come with a number of novel challenges and risks. For example, they might suffer from low participation, lack of coordination, lack of control or other related problems that are neither well understood nor addressed by the current state of research. In this paper, we aim to tackle some of these problems by exploring techniques for recommending concepts to experts on collaborative ontology engineering platforms. In detail, this paper will (i) discuss different recommendation techniques from the literature (ii) map and apply these categories to the domain of collaboratively engineered biomedical ontologies and (iii) present prototypical implementations of selected recommendation techniques as	collaborative software;ontology (information science);ontology engineering;recommender system	Simon Walk;Markus Strohmaier;Tania Tudorache;Natalya Fridman Noy;Csongor Nyulas;Mark A.

The article incorporates input from workshop attendees as well as from its authors. Abstract Five years after the science of visual analytics was formally established , we attempt to use two different studies to assess the current state of the community and evaluate the progress the community has made in the past few years. The first study involves a comparison analysis of intellectual and scholastic accomplishments recently made by the visual analytics community with two other visualization communities. The second study aims to measure the degree of community reach and internet penetration of visual-analytics-related resources.

However, technological and physical constraints may sometimes hamper a productive use. One of the key issues is the problem of false-positive RFID tag reads, that is, RFID transponders that are detected unintentionally by the reader hardware. The present paper proposes and evaluates a comprehensive time-series analysis technique to identify and filter false-positives from the RFID data stream. Furthermore, we investigate the value of additional knowledge about the business process to be monitored. We empirically test our approach using a large set of RFID data collected at the distribution center of a large European retailer.	automatic identification and data capture;business process;dynamic time warping;logistics;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;time series;transponder	Thorben Keller;Frédéric Thiesse;Elgar Fleisch	2014			logistics;computer science;marketing;operations management;data mining;information management;world wide web	HCI	-37.116270301983306	-6.551218315469847	44138

a30e33b3df25a71474c033dfdd0a086d05f19c77	special issue on big data computing, analytics and applications		With the rapid growth of data in the past few years, information technologies have made significant impacts on global environments on both positive and negative aspects. Generation of huge amounts of data, called big data, across different sectors such as banking, health care, retail and education, among others, is creating the need for an efficient tool to manage this data. This will foster many interesting problems in the intersection of computing, analytics and applications. Conventional database management tools do not have the capability to manage surging volumes of unstructured data. For example, more than 80% of data is unstructured in the form of videos, tweets, GPS coordinates and emails, which means that decisions need to be made at high velocity. Data is expected to exponentially grow through data collected via pervasive sensors and/or the Internet. It also leads to new emerging challenges that have the potential to create more accurate solutions for science and technologies. We believe that we need a new way for personal and ubiquitous computing where big data is immensely involved, especially for the data trace collected from ambient sensors, wearable, social media and so on. This special issue is devoted to addressing new challenges in big data computing, analytics and applications in personal and ubiquitous Computing. We intend to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners interested in this research area from academia, industry and service providers, to share ideas, experiences and practical implementations. Both theoreticians as well as practitioners, including system builders and individuals applying big data in personal and ubiquitous computing domains, are encouraged to submit their papers to this special issue. To that end, papers are solicited from all BigCom related areas emphasizing theoretical foundations, novel modeling, algorithmic methodologies and data-driven applications. This issue is in collaboration with The 2nd International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications (BIGCOM) held in Shenyang, Liaoning, China (http://conf. neu.edu.cn/bigcom2016/), and addresses on hot topics relevant to big data computing, analytics and applications. Following a review process, we accepted 10 papers from BIGCOM’16 for this theme issue. Each of the papers was peer-reviewed by at least two experts in the field. In the following, we provide a brief introduction to each paper. The paper ‘‘Redundancy Reduction for Indoor DeviceFree Localization’’ by Jinjun Liu, Ning An, Md. Tanbir Hassan, Min Peng, Zheng Cui and Shenghui Zhao presents a method of redundancy reduction. With the goal of using fewer nodes while maintaining high localization accuracy, the proposed method controls the two-level redundancy efficiently and reduces the number of nodes greatly, thereby reducing the needed amount of localization data and the hardware costs. The results show that the proposed method can be used as an efficient tool for indoor devicefree localization. The paper ‘‘CondioSense: High-quality Context-aware Service for Audio Sensing System via Active Sonar’’ by Fan Li, Huijie Chen, Xiaoyu Song, Qian Zhang, Youqi Li and Yu Wang presents CondioSense, a Context-aware service for audio sensing system, which identifies the & Chenren Xu chenren@pku.edu.cn	big data;email;entity–relationship model;experience;global positioning system;internet;personal and ubiquitous computing;pervasive informatics;sensor;social media;sonar;velocity (software development);wearable computer	Chenren Xu;Zhu Han;Yanyong Zhang;Lan Zhang	2016	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-016-0973-1	analytics;data science;business intelligence;software analytics	HCI	-37.56647432158274	-8.80505493746711	44312

Everyone still programs in his or her own favorite programming language, source code is rarely made available, accessibility of models to non-programming researchers is essentially non-existent, and even for other modelers, the profusion of source code in a multitude of programming languages, written without programming guidelines, makes it almost impossible to access, check, explore, re-use, or continue to develop. It is high time to change this situation, especially since the tools are now readily available to do so. We propose that the modeling community adopt three simple guidelines that would ensure that computational models would be accessible to the broad range of researchers in cognitive science. We further emphasize the pivotal role that journal editors must play in making computational models accessible to readers of their journals.	accessibility;cognitive model;cognitive science;computation;computational model;computer simulation;journal;programming languages;programming language;source code	Caspar Addyman;Robert M.

It answers farmers queries based on the location, season, crop and other information provided by farmers. aAQUA makes use of novel database systems and information retrieval techniques like intelligent caching, offline access with intermittent synchronization, semantic-based search, etc. Agricultural content repositories (digital library), Agri-price information (Bhav Puchiye), farmer schemes and various operations support databases (aAQUA-QoS) have also emerged from the experience of aAQUA deployments. aAQUA's large scale deployment provides avenues for researchers to contribute in the areas of knowledge management, cross-lingual information retrieval, and providing accessible content for rural populations. Apart from agriculture, aAQUA can be configured and customized for expert advice over mobile networks and the Internet in education, Healthcare and other domains of interest to a developing population.
