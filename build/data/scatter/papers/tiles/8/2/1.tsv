29668bd8e6cfcc501a72954ae9ad70b70583fe9e	semantic matching between job offers and job search requests		Part of the interaction with the candidate concerns the identification of unknown words (typing errors and spelling mistakes) at which point the system asks the user to correct his text. When a user's request does not match with any requirements in the job offers data base, the system enters into a dialogue with the candidate in order to relax or modify the constraints he imposed on the job search criteria at initial request time.	database;regular language description for xml;requirement;semantic matching;web search engine	Jose Vega	1990			path of least resistance;natural language processing;semantic matching;artificial intelligence;semantic search;bone resorption;computer science;periodontal membrane	Web+IR	-40.047744498338524	-73.0735940813256	20958
acbd41d7e0fd94f269ec98a73c0462631233ec7b	communication matters: exploring older adults' current use of patient portals	aging population;older adults;patient engagement;patient portal	OBJECTIVES Patient portals have the potential to increase patient engagement. Older patients are of particular interest as they are likely to suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Yet, questions remain about how patient portals are perceived and deemed useful by older adults. This study explored attitudes toward, perceived utility of, and requirements of a patient portal from the perspective of older adults.   METHODS We used a mixed-method approach integrating online surveys, a review of existing portals, and participatory design workshops with 17 people who were 65 years old and over.   RESULTS The findings demonstrate that the participants used a patient portal primarily as one of the communication channels to interact with their providers, rather than as a tool for accessing and managing personal health information. Consequently, the perception of whether or not a provider would use the patient portal was a primary factor that older adults considered in determining the adoption and use of a portal.   CONCLUSIONS It is important to understand that older adults would perceive a patient portal as one part of a larger communication system to interact with a provider. This finding will help researchers and practitioners to advance the design and use of a patient portal to effectively incorporate it into older adults' health care and better serve the unique needs of the ageing population.

6c1798c5a0a79c96bbc5dbf667d09d15c93600e7	the va's use of dicom to integrate image data seamlessly into the online patient record	systems integration	The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard to integrate image data objects from multiple systems for use across the healthcare enterprise. DICOM uses a structured representation of image data and a communication mechanism that allows the VA to easily acquire radiology images and store them directly into the online patient record. Images can then be displayed on low-cost clinician's workstations throughout the medical center. High-resolution diagnostic quality multi-monitor VistA workstations with specialized viewing software can be used for reading radiology images. Various image and study specific items from the DICOM data object are essential for the correct display of images. The VA's DICOM capabilities are now used to interface seven different commercial Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and over twenty different radiology image acquisition modalities.	dicom;file archiver;multi-monitor;numerous;physical object;picture archiving and communication systems;picture archiving and communication system;radiology;united states department of veterans affairs;workstation	Peter M.

To address this gap, we designed a novel user-friendly, web-based application. We describe the preliminary evaluation of feasibility and usability of the application to promote recovery following mTBI in youth, the Self-Monitoring Activity-Restriction and Relaxation Treatment (SMART). SMART incorporates real-time recommendations for individualized symptom management and activity restriction along with training in cognitive-behavioral coping strategies.   METHODS We conducted a usability evaluation to assess and modify the SMART system prior to further study and deployment. Children ages 11-18 years presenting to the emergency department were recruited after symptoms resolved. Usability was assessed using a 60-min think-aloud protocol of teens and parents describing their interaction with the application. Upon completion of the tasks, each participant also completed the system usability scale (SUS).   RESULTS We performed tests with 4 parent/child dyads. The average age of the children was 13 years (standard deviation=1.8). The parents were an average of 41.5 years old (standard deviation=6.2). Research revealed that the participants were enthusiastic about the interactive portions of the tool particularly the video based sessions. Parents were concerned about the speed at which their child might move through the program and the children thought that the system required large amounts of reading. Based on user feedback, researchers modified SMART to include an audio file in every module and improved the system's aesthetic properties. The mean SUS score was 85, with high SUS scores (>68) indicating satisfactory usability.   CONCLUSION High initial usability and favorable user feedback provide a foundation for further iterative development and testing of the SMART application as a tool for managing recovery from concussion.	adolescent (age group);audio media;brain concussion;cognition disorders;coping behavior;deploy;iteration;iterative and incremental development;linear programming relaxation;mild traumatic brain injury;morbidity - disease rate;real-time transcription;smart system;system usability scale;think aloud protocol;web application	Judith W.

573538be9ccab81af6573e7ca0562abb94cf4c6a	development and validation of a technology acceptance model for safety-enhancing, wearable locating systems	technology acceptance model;safety;evacuation;survey;locating;privacy	Events of disasters on passenger ships can never be completely excluded while numbers of passengers on cruises are continuously increasing. Innovations in ubiquitous and networked computing such as wearable locating systems for passengers could enable faster muster and more efficient search for missing people. As the safety enhancement depends on the effective usage of these technologies, passengers’ acceptance is crucial, though largely unknown, and infrastructure implies high costs for shipping companies. In order to investigate passengers’ acceptance, a context-specific technology acceptance model was developed based on a literature review and qualitative interviews with passengers. The model was validated by an online survey with 2086 passengers aged between 16 and 81 years. The context-specific factors social influence, expected usefulness, trust, privacy concern, and perceived security risk explain 95% of the variance in the target variable intention to use locating systems with social influence as the strongest predictor. The context-specific factors are most determined by the passenger characteristics age and need for safety. In conclusion, the model presents insights into the relationships between passenger characteristics and context-specific factors enabling systematic interventions to increase acceptance for locating systems and, thereby, contributes to enhance safety for the occurrence of an evacuation.	wearable computer	Sonja Th.

To test our algorithm, which allows for various gradations of preciseness in pointing, subjects performed an object identification task in a strict experimental setting. 20 subjects participated and were instructed to always use a pointing gesture (they were led to believe they were testing a new kind of ‘digital pointing device’). The subjects performed their tasks on two distances: close (10 subjects) and at a distance of 2.5 meters (10 subjects). The assumption is that these conditions yield precise and imprecise pointing gestures respectively. In addition we varied the ‘type’ of target objects (geometrical figures versus pictures of persons). This study resulted in a corpus of 600 multimodal referring expressions. A statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed a main effect of distance (subjects adapt their language to the kind of pointing gesture) and also a main effect of target (persons are more difficult to describe than objects). The advantages and disadvantages of this evaluation method are discussed.	algorithm;experiment;expression (computer science);lazy evaluation;multimodal interaction;natural language generation;pointing device;text corpus	Ielka van der Sluis;Emiel Krahmer	2004			computer vision;simulation;computer science	HCI	-44.06419461100093	-57.83796840741545	21189

Informed consent of emergency patients to be enrolled in clinical trials is a particularly difficult issue due to impaired competencies of patients' to give consent, short diagnostic and therapeutic windows, as well as the requirement to provide detailed information to participants. Whereas the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guideline, Additional Protocol to the European Bioethical Convention concerning Biomedical Research, as well as appropriate regulations adopted by the Food and Drugs Administration (USA) allow waivers from participants' consent or deferred consent for emergency research, the regulations of most European Community countries following the Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC) do not give space for a deferred consent or a waiver from consent for adult patients (unless surrogate consent is made use of). This is even more confusing in case of Poland, where conflicting regulations on a waiver from a participant's consent in emergency research exist and the regulations on surrogate consent of temporarily incompetent adults are too restrictive and authorise only the guardianship courts to consent, which is not or hardly feasible in practice. European Community regulations need to be amended to allow for implementation of the deferred consent or waivers from consent for emergency research in order to enable ethical research of emergency conditions that should become a large part of important public health priorities.

This study explores these issues with an analysis of health and medical informatics related OSS projects on SourceForge, a large repository of open source projects.   METHODOLOGY A search was conducted on the SourceForge website during the period from May 1 to 15, 2007, to identify health and medical informatics OSS projects. This search resulted in a sample of 174 projects. A Java-based parser was written to extract data for several of the key variables of each project. Several visually descriptive statistics were generated to analyze the profiles of the OSS projects.   RESULTS Many of the projects have sponsors, implying a growing interest in OSS among organizations. Sponsorship, we discovered, has a significant impact on project success metrics. Nearly two-thirds of the projects have a restrictive license type. Restrictive licensing may indicate tighter control over the development process. Our sample includes a wide range of projects that are at various stages of development (status). Projects targeted towards the advanced end user are primarily focused on bio-informatics, data formats, database and medical science applications.   CONCLUSION We conclude that there exists an active and thriving OSS development community that is focusing on health and medical informatics. A wide range of OSS applications are in development, from bio-informatics to hospital information systems. A profile of OSS in health and medical informatics emerges that is distinct and unique to the health care field. Future research can focus on OSS acceptance and diffusion and impact on cost, efficiency and quality of health care.	bio-informatics;british informatics olympiad;database;description;health care;health occupations;hospital information systems;informatics (discipline);information system;java;medical informatics applications;medicine;open sound system;parser;scientific publication;sourceforge;structured product labeling licensing terminology;format	Balaji Janamanchi;Evangelos Katsamakas;Wullianallur Raghupathi;Wei Gao	2009	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.02.006	data mining;world wide web	SE	-52.86376641559611	-66.18506257288107	21241
f02fa052a897b6ae476c235c6afa9867dd924613	individual differences and long-term consequences of tdcs-augmented cognitive training		A great deal of interest surrounds the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to augment cognitive training. However, effects are inconsistent across studies, and meta-analytic evidence is mixed, especially for healthy, young adults. One major source of this inconsistency is individual differences among the participants, but these differences are rarely examined in the context of combined training/stimulation studies. In addition, it is unclear how long the effects of stimulation last, even in successful interventions. Some studies make use of follow-up assessments, but very few have measured performance more than a few months after an intervention. Here, we utilized data from a previous study of tDCS and cognitive training [Au, J., Katz, B., Buschkuehl, M., Bunarjo, K., Senger, T., Zabel, C., et al. Enhancing working memory training with transcranial direct current stimulation. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 28, 1419–1432, 2016] in which participants trained on a working memory task over 7 days while receiving active or sham tDCS. A new, longer-term follow-up to assess later performance was conducted, and additional participants were added so that the sham condition was better powered. We assessed baseline cognitive ability, gender, training site, and motivation level and found significant interactions between both baseline ability and motivation with condition (active or sham) in models predicting training gain. In addition, the improvements in the active condition versus sham condition appear to be stable even as long as a year after the original intervention.

6ea713fd1caebe6a2ff1b1399d80fd23f12e09c7	development of hypertension management mobile application based on clinical practice guidelines		This study aims to develop and evaluate a mobile application for hypertension management based on Clinical Practice Guidelines. The application was developed according to Web-Roadmap methodology. In planning phase, we defined the tasks and product of each phase, selected clinical practice guidelines and extracted intervention items for hypertension management. In analysis phase, we analysed intervention items and made data dictionary, rules, use-case diagram, hypertension management ontology and tailored recommendations for the application. In design phase, we developed an entity-relations diagram, algorithm, and user interface and coded them in the implementation phase. In evaluation phase, first, the knowledge-base was evaluated for its accuracy by experts and they proposed three more detailed recommendations, which were added to the application. Second, mobile heuristics were evaluated. The evaluators pointed out 33 usability-related problems on mobile heuristics items. Out of these, three problems were solved by reflecting evaluators' comments.	comment (computer programming);data dictionary;diagram;extraction;guideline [publication type];heuristics;hypertensive disease;mobile app;nih roadmap initiative tag;practice guidelines as topic;practice management, medical;rule (guideline);usability;user interface device component;algorithm	H.

f15e03b286f3bdfebbc569e5b988cf373000848f	analyzing conflicts between clinical trials from a patient perspective	eligibility criteria;linked open data;clinical trials	Patients with serious long-term disease often search for clinical trial information on their own, using sites such as ClinicalTrials.gov. We are developing a patient-focused search tool for clinical trials. Since patients are often concerned that participation in one clinical trial may preclude their participation in other trials, one of the planned features of this system will be the ability to analyze whether treatments in one trial will prevent a patient from participating in another. This paper describes an approach to this task. Eligibility criteria are classified according to linguistic pattern, UMLS concepts, content, and time. The criteria are then compared with treatments and side effects in other trials relevant to a patient, in order to identify potential conflicts.

This paper describes the development and innovative features of the SAGE Guideline Model and reports our experience encoding four guidelines. Innovations include methods for integrating guideline-based decision support with clinical workflow and employment of enterprise order sets. Using SAGE, a clinician informatician can encode computable guideline content as recommendation sets using only standard terminologies and standards-based patient information models. The SAGE Model supports encoding large portions of guideline knowledge as re-usable declarative evidence statements and supports querying external knowledge sources.		Samson W. Tu;James R.

GORILLA is designed as an interface between digital language archive services and language data producers. It addresses various problems of common digital language archive infrastructures. At the same time it serves the speech and language technology communities by providing a platform to create and share speech and language data from low-resourced and endangered languages. It hosts an initial collection of language models for speech and natural language processing (NLP), and technologies or software tools for corpus creation and annotation. GORILLA is designed to address the Transcription Bottleneck in language documentation, and, at the same time to provide solutions to the general Language Resource Bottleneck in speech and language technologies. It does so by facilitating the cooperation between documentary and theoretical linguistics, and speech and language technologies research and development, in particular for low-resourced and endangered languages.	archive;corpus linguistics;documentation;language model;language technology;medical transcription;natural language processing;text corpus	Damir Cavar;Malgorzata Cavar;Lwin Moe	2016			natural language processing;artificial intelligence;gorilla;linguistics;computer science	NLP	-33.83062698254901	-76.26945497838531	21565

The accuracy of the proposed sampling methods was considered in association by comparing with reference results previously obtained by Fully Retrieving Sampling (FRS) method, which involved analyzing the contents and categories of all articles from the database. The results suggested that RRS and DRS methods were appropriate, efficient and reasonably accurate for categorization of relatively large volume of research articles. RRS method was highly recommended, especially when the contents of sample articles was unevenly distributed. By DRS and RRS methods, only about 6.3% of total articles were required for obtaining similar results as those given by FRS method. The percentage Expected Worst Errors (EWE) from DRS and RRS methods were observed to range from 1.0 to 5.5%. The EWE value could be reduced by increasing the sample size.	categorization;citation index;gibbs sampling;monte carlo method;polymer;sampling (signal processing)	T. Buranathiti;N.

In a preliminary study, chemists were observed performing five different tasks representative of typical uses of the scientific journal literature. The tasks simulated browsing journals, answering specific questions given a citation to an article, answering specific questions given no citation, writing essays to summarize and integrate information, and finding “analogous transformations” for chemical reactions. Chemists carried out these tasks using one of three systems: (a) t.lheprinted journals supplemented with a widely used printed index system, (b) a hypertext system (the SuperBook@ document browser), or (c) a new electronic system (Pixlook) that incorporates traditional document retrieval methods plus full text indexing and delivers bitmap images of journal pages. Both electronic systems had a large advantage over the printed system for search and essay tasks. SuperBook users were faster and more accurate than Pixlook users at finding information relevant to browsing and search topics. Certain SuperBook hypertext features, however, did not work as well as Pixlook for displaying target articles. The patterns of data and log files of subjects suggest how SuperBook, Pixlook and related systems might be improved.	bitmap;data logger;digital library;document retrieval;emoticon;hypertext;printing	Dennis E.

Although some health helplines offer support services (e.g., counselling), many function in ways that are similar to physically co-present (i.e., face-to-face) primary care consultations. However, due to the lack of physical presence, there are differences in the way health consultations are routinely managed on the telephone. This article explores some ways in which healthcare is managed at a distance, on a telephone helpline.   METHODS Data are 196 recorded calls from the helpline, Healthdirect Australia. Using conversation analysis, this paper compares the delivery of healthcare over the telephone with what is known about physically co-present primary care consultations.   RESULTS Through an exploration of the overall structure of these helpline calls, we show how Healthdirect Australia calls are organised in terms of eight distinct phases: call opening, establishment of reason-for-calling, check of caller safety, creation of a confidential patient file, medical information-gathering, health advice, caller survey questions, and call closing. We demonstrate how interactants organise their talk around these phases, with a particular focus on the shift between mandated administrative tasks and traditional medical tasks.   CONCLUSIONS Findings from this study suggest that there are systematic differences between the overall structure of health helplines and physically co-present primary care consultations. We demonstrate that the delivery of health information and advice via helplines can be challenging, but that service can be enhanced through continued efforts to inform understanding about how medical encounters routinely unfold in over-the-phone environments.

2565741a95b8da955a0703acea8417c156bf3364	crisis maps - observed shortcomings and recommendations for improvement		Cartographic communication through crisis maps takes place in a unique environment characterised by the immediate risks of considerable loss and stress. Many such maps are designed by practitioners with limited resources, pressured for time, and who often fail to pay the necessary attention to map graphics. This can reduce map clarity and make orientation to and understanding of essential crisis information difficult. To identify the most frequent shortcomings that may compromise the interpretation of depicted objects, phenomena presented, and actions required, we assessed the map graphics of 106 maps specifically designed for communication and action in crises. The results showed that they were often visually overloaded. Crisis data were not conveyed by appropriate cartographic representations, and due to the inappropriate use of visual variables, the associative and selective properties of cartographic symbols were overlooked, and their ordered and quantitative features ignored. The use of colour was often not adapted to conventional visual language, and colour symbolism was not always taken into account. The cartographic symbols used were often incomprehensible, illegible, ambiguous, and unclassified, and they lacked symbolism and hierarchical organisation. The article aims to address these problems by proposing guidelines which do not require much time or expertise, but which would ensure that cartographically correct crisis maps are well designed. Objects, phenomena or actions specific to crisis management would be indicated using appropriate map graphics and their importance highlighted, so as to make interpretation easier for all participants in a crisis event, and so facilitate crisis communication and response.

While clinicians are recommended to ask patients about alcohol use and provide brief interventions and specialist referral, this is poorly implemented in routine practice. We undertook a national consultation to ascertain the appropriateness of proposed standards for recording information about alcohol use in electronic health records (EHRs) in the UK and to identify potential barriers and facilitators to their implementation in practice.   METHODS A wide range of stakeholders in the UK were consulted about the appropriateness of proposed information standards for recording alcohol use in EHRs via a multi-disciplinary stakeholder workshop and online survey. Responses to the survey were thematically analysed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research.   RESULTS Thirty-one stakeholders participated in the workshop and 100 in the online survey. This included patients and carers, healthcare professionals, researchers, public health specialists, informaticians, and clinical information system suppliers. There was broad consensus that the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questionnaires were appropriate standards for recording alcohol use in EHRs but that the standards should also address interventions for alcohol misuse. Stakeholders reported a number of factors that might influence implementation of the standards, including having clear care pathways and an implementation guide, sharing information about alcohol use between health service providers, adequately resourcing the implementation process, integrating alcohol screening with existing clinical pathways, having good clinical information systems and IT infrastructure, providing financial incentives, having sufficient training for healthcare workers, and clinical leadership and engagement. Implementation of the standards would need to ensure patients are not stigmatised and that patient confidentiality is robustly maintained.   CONCLUSIONS A wide range of stakeholders agreed that use of AUDIT-C and AUDIT are appropriate standards for recording alcohol use in EHRs in addition to recording interventions for alcohol misuse. The findings of this consultation will be used to develop an appropriate information model and implementation guide. Further research is needed to pilot the standards in primary and secondary care.	alcohol use disorder identification test alcohol consumption questions questionnaire;alcohol use disorders identification test;cessation of life;confidentiality;consultation;electronic health records;ethanol;health services;information systems;information model;information system;management audit;norm (social);numerous;patient referral;patients;premature obstetric labor;secondary care;standards characteristics	Shamil Haroon;Darren Wooldridge;Jan Hoogewerf;Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar;John Williams;Lina Martino;Neeraj Bhala	2018		10.1186/s12911-018-0612-z	knowledge management;medical education;implementation research;information system;information technology management;alcohol use disorders identification test;health care;audit;psychological intervention;health informatics;medicine	HCI	-60.398844785859616	-63.04817744338886	22250

It is not only the economic interests of a clinic, but the safety and the health of a patient that are regarded as criteria for optimality, as well as convenience and fatigability level of medical personnel. The article offers the logics and methodology for such a survey, which would consist of three blocks. At the start, on the basis of the experience of operations performed by the authors, the system of verifiable current hypotheses is structured. The second block deals with the content analysis (CA) of the publications relating to the description of respective medical cases, which partially allows to confirm the previously suggested hypothesis. The final stage will involve a survey in the form of a questionnaire of leading surgeons. The results of two first stages of work are presented in this article.

Meanwhile, many nursing home residents do not pursue this actively. This paper examines if augmenting a conventional chair-based bike exercise, with a suite of four recreational virtual environments, will increase the intrinsic motivation with a group of nursing home residents. After 4-months of availability, results suggest that the augmentation has increased the intrinsic motivation to exercise, by comparing results from before and after, using measurement scales from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory.	indoor positioning system;virtual reality	Jon Ram Bruun-Pedersen;Stefania Serafin;Lise Busk Kofoed	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH)	10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586265	simulation;medicine;physical medicine and rehabilitation;physical therapy	Visualization	-56.809036730248216	-55.48282673412333	22453

Utilization of e-health is therefore urgently recommended by German health authorities. However, the diffusion of such technologies is currently very low, despite the availability of the underlying technology. A market failure is a likely reason for the unsatisfying situation, as there are currently hardly regular business models for electronic health services. This paper conducts a case study on telemonitoring, which has significant positive impact on patients with chronic heart failure, to illustrate a market engineering approach for e-health applications. The introduced case study is located in a southern German region, where health insurances and a physician network want to establish a telemonitoring solution. We investigate the socioeconomic, technical and legal environment in order to derive a transaction object and build a transaction service. Patients will transfer vital parameters to physicians on a daily base. Caregivers observe patients' health status and compile quarterly reports for the e-health provider. The provider distributes the funds of the health insurances according to the compliance among the stakeholders and adjusts the model on an annual base according to the realized savings. The presented solution can be built upon the emerging German infrastructure for telemedicine and be extended to further regions later.	compiler;market engineering	Sebastian Dünnebeil;Ali Sunyaev;Jan Marco Leimeister;Helmut Krcmar	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.423	business model;actuarial science;insurance;market failure;computer science;telematics;information management;law;heart;health care	SE	-58.00340946420651	-61.67724655138257	22807

We introduce a framework to measure the coverage of information with labels. The framework is based on a set of metrics including completeness, unambiguity, multilinguality, labeled object usage, and monolingual islands. We apply this framework on seven diverse datasets, from the web of data, a collaborative knowledge base, open governmental and GLAM data. We gain an insight into the current state of labels and multilinguality on the web of data. Comparing a set of differently sourced datasets can help data publishers to understand what they can improve and what other ways of collecting and data can be adopted.	semantic web;world wide web	Lucie-Aimée Kaffee;Elena Paslaru Bontas Simperl	2018		10.1016/j.procs.2018.09.007	completeness (statistics);world wide web;knowledge base;computer science	HCI	-35.097482470391704	-66.0390553949785	22938
35cf63032dc987e0bc09b62ee1667eafbd2f2dc8	ensuring positive impact of dq metadata: implications for decision support		Required) Organizations continue to manage poor quality data despite being aware of its negative impact on decision making. One effective way of addressing this situation is to inform decision-makers of the quality of the data they are using by providing data quality (DQ) metadata. However, despite its availability, not all decision-makers use DQ metadata. Further, when DQ metadata is included, the resulting dataset may be different from and significantly larger than the dataset created without DQ metadata. This potentially creates an information overload and the decision maker is conflicted about the use of DQ metadata. This paper demonstrates that decision-makers will use DQ metadata when a guideline about how DQ metadata should be used is provided. The paper also illustrates that variations in task complexity, work experience, and domain-specific experience interact. When guidance on how to use DQ metadata is provided the impact of DQ metadata on consensus among decision-makers depends on such interactions.	data quality	G.

A digital survey was sent to 678 academic institutions over a 1-month period. 2427 responses were analyzed using Chi-squared tests for independence. Post-hoc Bonferroni correction was applied for all comparisons between training levels, clinical setting, and specialty. 58 % of all residents self-report violating HIPAA by sharing protected health information (PHI) via text messaging with 27 % reporting they do it “often” or “routinely” compared to 15-19 % of attendings. For all specialties, 35 % of residents use text messaging photo or video sharing with PHI. Overall, 5 % of respondents “often” or “routinely” used HIPAA compliant (HCApps) with no significant differences related to training level. 20 % of residents admitted to using non-encrypted email at some point. 53 % of attendings and 41 % of residents utilized encrypted email routinely. Physicians from surgical specialties compared to non-surgical specialties demonstrated higher rates of HIPAA violations with SMS use (35 % vs. 17.7 %), standard photo/video messages (16.3 % vs. 4.7 %), HCApps (10.9 % vs. 4.9 %), and non-HCApps (5.6 % vs 1.5 %). The most significant barriers to complying with HIPAA were inconvenience (58 %), lack of knowledge (37 %), unfamiliarity (34 %), inaccessible (29 %) and habit (24 %). Medical professionals must acknowledge that despite laws to protect patient confidentiality in the era of mobile technology, over 50 % of current medical trainees knowingly violate these rules regularly despite the threat of severe consequences. The medical community must further examine the reason for these inconsistencies and work towards possible solutions.	compliance behavior;confidentiality;email encryption;health insurance portability and accountability act;hoc (programming language);hospital admission;protected health information;rule (guideline);specialties, surgical;text messaging;training programs;message	Randall McKnight;Orrin Franko	2016	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-016-0489-2	medicine;computer science;nursing;mobile device;computer security	HCI	-60.984176920391015	-64.55580139731758	23029

UNLABELLED Management of heart failure is usually multidisciplinary and collaboration between stakeholders in a dedicated HI network like the HerzMobil Tirol can be supported by a mHealth-based telemedicine approach. The aim is to gain insights through textual analysis of collaboration notes that might trigger further developments and improvements of the HI network. A reusable pipeline for textual analysis of unstructured textual notes was implemented using the open source analytics software KNIME. After preprocessing, a keyword analysis was performed resulting in a classification of all notes in predefined categories.   RESULTS Medical and organizational issues dominate the communication with health status and therapy aspects as well as clinical treatment, discharge letter and home visits. Beside aspects of data transmission and mobile phone, technological issues are minor topics during the collaboration.

To examine these effects concurrently, we assigned 145 undergraduates to three context effect conditions. They were requested to solve 20 hypothetical purchase problems that had three alternatives described along two attribute dimensions. We measured their choices, confidence ratings, and response times. We found that adding the third alternative had significant effects for choice proportions and confidence ratings in all three conditions. The attraction effect was more prominent than the other two effects with regard to choice proportions. The compromise effect condition yielded low confidence ratings and long response times, although the choice proportion was high for the third alternative. These results indicate that the mutual relationship among choice proportions, confidence ratings, and reaction times requires theoretical investigation.	attribute-value system;mcgurk effect	Takashi Tsuzuki;Jerome R.

Existing studies have focussed on point mutation extraction methods from biomedical literature which can be used to support the time consuming work of manual database curation. However, these methods were limited to point mutation extraction and do not extract features for the annotation of proteins at the residue level. This work introduces a system that identifies protein residues in MEDLINE abstracts and annotates them with features extracted from the context written in the surrounding text. MEDLINE abstract texts have been processed to identify protein mentions in combination with taxonomic species and protein residues (F1-measure 0.52). The identified protein-species-residue triplets have been validated and benchmarked against reference data resources (UniProtKb, average F1-measure of 0.54). Then, contextual features were extracted through shallow and deep parsing and the features have been classified into predefined categories (F1-measure ranges from 0.15 to 0.67). Furthermore, the feature sets have been aligned with annotation types in UniProtKb to assess the relevance of the annotations for ongoing curation projects. Altogether, the annotations have been assessed automatically and manually against reference data resources. This work proposes a solution for the automatic extraction of functional annotation for protein residues from biomedical articles. The presented approach is an extension to other existing systems in that a wider range of residue entities are considered and that features of residues are extracted as annotations.	abstract summary;alignment;categories;classification;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);digital curation;entity;extraction;f1 score;knowledge base;medline;parsing;point mutation;protein annotation;relevance;uniprot	Kevin Nagel;Antonio Jimeno-Yepes;Dietrich Rebholz-Schuhmann	2008	BMC Bioinformatics	10.1186/1471-2105-10-S8-S4	fuzzy logic;point mutation;biology;knowledge base;dna microarray;feature extraction;reference data;computer science;bioinformatics;data mining;proteomics;information retrieval;cross-validation	NLP	-35.23004370699344	-69.88683888895771	23511

8cd51dc721578563ca1a20dd558ea98052b859fb	human centered interfaces for assisted living		Assisted living has a particular social importance in most developed societies, due to the increased life expectancy of the general population and the ensuing ageing problems. It has also importance for the provision of improved home care in cases of disabled persons or persons suffering from certain diseases that have high social impact. This paper is primarily focused on the description of the human centered interface specifications, research and implementations for systems geared towards the well-being of aged people. Two tasks will be investigated in more detail: a) nutrition support to prevent undernourishment/malnutrition and dehydration, and b) affective interfaces that can help assessing the emotional status of the elderly. Such interfaces can be supported by ambient intelligence and robotic technologies.	ambient intelligence;emoticon;home automation;robot;whole earth 'lectronic link	Anastasios Tefas;Ioannis Pitas	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23169-8_1	gerontology;simulation;medicine;human–computer interaction	HCI	-58.73362004620532	-55.76637775191484	23638

Mapping only the most frequently reported tests provides one way to prioritize the effort and mitigate the resource burden. We evaluated the implications of selective mapping on ELR for public health by comparing reportable conditions from an operational ELR system with the codes in the LOINC Top 2000. Laboratory result codes in the LOINC Top 2000 accounted for 65.3% of the reportable condition volume. However, by also including the 129 most frequent LOINC codes that identified reportable conditions in our system but were not present in the LOINC Top 2000, this set would cover 98% of the reportable condition volume. Our study highlights the ways that our approach to implementing vocabulary standards impacts secondary data uses such as public health reporting.		Roland E. Gamache;Shaun J. Grannis;Brian E.

Due to challenges in modeling the peculiarities of human physiological and psychological responses, automatic detection of fixation points is an open problem. Indeed, no objective methods are currently capable of fully modeling the human perception of regions of interest (ROIs). Thus, research often relies on user studies with eye tracking systems. In this paper we propose a cost-effective and convenient alternative, obtained by having internet workers annotate videos with ROI coordinates. The workers use an interactive video player with a simulated mouse-driven fovea, which models the fall-off in resolution of the human visual system. Since this approach is not supervised, we implement methods for identifying inaccurate or malicious results. Using this proposal, one can collect ROI data in an automated fashion, and at a much lower cost than laboratory studies.	algorithm;bottom-up proteomics;computer vision;crowdsourcing;data compression;experiment;eye tracking;high- and low-level;human-based computation;machine vision;malware;map;region of interest;supervised learning;top-down and bottom-up design;tracking system;usability testing	Flavio P.

fcff28033e2009d4f387abed1ce6a263f905785c	the meta-structure of knowledge and the explanatory gap		Time and object are elements of the meta-structure of our knowledge, yet in conflict with the general change in the world. Time and object are shown to be products of our decomposition of change. Accordingly, there are no objects (and subjects) in the world: the object is the concept and its meaning is its relative position in the structure of knowledge. Thus, the referent is the concept and perception is the result of interpreting raw sensation within this conceptual structure. The material signifier of all our concepts is the sensation thus being the clay with which we shape our representations of the world. However, it is impossible to represent the clay itself using clay as material signifier. Therefore, the explanatory gap is nothing more than the un-closeable gap between signifier and signified. The gap can only be closed when filled with sensation (thus becoming part of the physical world). http://webs.uvigo.es/jmmatias/knowledge/knowledge.htm	machine perception	José M.

Our proposed platform, CrowdLabel, a web-based open-source annotation system, was developed for crowdsourcing medical labels from multiple expert and/or non-expert annotators. We describe the platform and an example of use; to improve FQT estimation by creating reference labels against which automated algorithms can be benchmarked. A total of 501, 30s segments were extracted from 15 foetal ECG (FECG) recordings from a private database. 23 volunteers participated in the study and provided a total of 7,307 FQT annotations, which were aggregated using a probabilistic label aggregator (PLA). The best annotator identified by the PLA had a standard deviation in the change of FQT annotations of 13.35 ms and 35.52 ms when labelling FECG with `very good' and `poor' signal quality respectively. The PLA does not require any ground truth to identify the best annotator or annotations. Annotator accuracy was also shown to be a function of objective signal quality measures. The feasibility of the CrowdLabel annotation system for ECG crowdsourcing with an unknown ground truth, as well as the results of the first experiment conducted using such a platform have been demonstrated.	algorithm;cardiovascular technologist;crowdsourcing;database;ground truth;open-source software;programmable logic array;web application	Tingting Zhu;Joachim A.

The present study sought to determine the effect of packages' color on hazard-related perceptions in a Virtual Environment. There were two conditions: achromatic grayscale and chromatic red, yellow, blue, green. A sample of 40 design students rated their hazard-related perceptions e.g., level of hazardousness and awareness of consequences of eight 3D packages, which differed in contents' hazardousness and familiarity, on hazard related perceptions. The results indicated that color does affect hazard-related perceptions. Compared to the achromatic versions, red and yellow produced different effects, when applied to hazardous packages which are both familiar and unfamiliar. Red increased hazard perception but did not affect awareness of consequences, and yellow did not affect the first, but decreased the latter. Blue decreased both dimensions, whereas green did not affect the first but decreased the latter. The results draw attention to the importance of color and familiarity on hazard-related perceptions.	virtual reality	Hande Ayanoglu;Rita Boto;Júlia Teles;Emília Duarte	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20898-5_1	psychology;computer vision;simulation;social psychology	Visualization	-45.91089686561925	-52.71218550437372	24055

Materials and Methods For this qualitative study, we conducted a series of 42 think-aloud interviews with 32 adults. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach.   Results We identified themes related to patient preferences, reservations, and mixed attitudes toward consenting electronically; low- and high-information-seeking behavior; and an emphasis on reassuring information, such as data protections and prohibitions against sharing data with pharmaceutical companies. Participants expressed interest in the types of information contained in their EHRs, safeguards protecting EHR data, and specifics on studies that might use their EHR data.   Discussion This study supports the potential value of interactive e-consent applications that allow patients to customize their consent experience. This study also highlights that some people have concerns about e-consent platforms and desire more detailed information about administrative processes and safeguards that protect EHR data used in research.   Conclusion This study contributes new insights on how e-consent applications could be designed to ensure that patients' information needs are met when seeking consent for research use of health record information. Also, this study offers a potential electronic approach to meeting the new Common Rule requirement that consent documents contain a """"concise and focused"""" presentation of key information followed by more details."""

Focus groups involving 103 PWMS identified significant experiences. Questionnaires were sent to 4100 PWMS (approximately 5% of the MS population) and 2030 responded. Information provision was found to have improved dramatically over the last seven years. Of those respondents who had been diagnosed in the last five years, 71 per cent thought they had received information. Of the total surveyed population, 43 per cent thought they had not received information. Information provision was found to be inconsistent, although centres noted for their interest in the patient perspective did perform somewhat better. Categories of information need were identified, and their importance and the difficulty in obtaining them were quantified. There is considerable scope for improving provision of information to people with MS.	focus group;information needs;quantifier (logic)	Mark Hepworth;Janet Harrison	2004	Health Informatics Journal	10.1177/1460458204040668	medicine;focus group;data mining;social psychology;statistics	HCI	-62.71550894550767	-63.4399837944807	24205

When plotted in the Cartesian plane according to this formulation, the documents that are constantly shifted along the x-axis and the y-axis can be seen. This effect of shifting is more or less evident according to which NB model, Bernoulli or multinomial, is chosen.

However, it has previously been shown that increased physical and cognitive activity can decrease the occurrence of falls in the elderly. This paper investigates the potential for a long-term, unsupervised fall prevention training tool in the form of the StepKinnection game, which was designed to exercise both reflex times and movement speed while also providing entertainment. Specifically, this game was used in a three month user study consisting of 10 participants over the age of 65. Adherence to the training program, enjoyment of the game, and ease of use of the game were investigated using a custom usability questionnaire, four established usability scales, heuristic evaluation of gameplay data, and semi-structured interviews. Results show that participants generally had positive attitudes towards the game, they felt that they would engage with this training program more than there current exercises, and that the game was easy to use without guidance or supervision beyond the initial set up support and instructions provided at the start of the experiment period.	experience;heuristic evaluation;interaction;kinect;semiconductor industry;stepping level;unsupervised learning;usability testing;user-centered design;video game design;video game development;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jaime Andres Garcia;William L.

089f71f08ff8973d8f4f7b7422982bdf5917f619	a general framework for the distributed management of exceptions and comorbidities		In the last decades, many different computer-assisted management systems for Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs) have been developed. While CIGs propose a “standard” evidence-based treatments of “typical” patients, exceptions may arise, as well the need to cope with comorbidities. The treatment of deviation from “standard” execution has attracted a lot of attention in the recent literature, but the approaches proposed are focused on the treatment either of exceptions or of comorbities. However, this is a clear limitation, since during a CIG execution, both these issues can occur. In this paper, we propose the first approach which supports the integrated treatment of both exceptions and comorbidities. To achieve such a goal, we propose a modular client-server architecture supporting the concurrent execution of multiple guidelines. The architecture proposed has been designed as a further layer building upon “traditional” execution engines for a single CIG. Thus, our methodology is general and can be used to extend the CIG systems in the literature. Finally, we describe our approach in action on a case study, in which a comorbid patient is treated for Peptic Ulcer and for deep Venous Thrombosis and, during the treatment, she manifests a heart failure.	client–server model;exception handling;inscriptiones graecae;interaction;java;scott continuity;server (computing)	Alessio Bottrighi;Luca Piovesan;Paolo Terenziani	2018		10.5220/0006552800660076	data mining;computer science;distributed management	SE	-50.87872562431182	-65.09249670411737	24400

With the CAMP service, the patient uses his own cellular phone to submit his daily peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and answer a simple questionnaire regarding to daily activities. The CAMP service participant then receives an asthma symptom assessment and care suggestion message immediately after imputing his information. This assessment, which is in accordance with the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) standard, includes weather conditions that might adversely affect the asthma patient (e.g. temperature, pollen count, etc.). This information is, in turn, used to advise the asthma patient how to avoid a severe asthmatic attack.	asthma;effective method;expiration, function;mobile phone;patients;peak expiratory flow rate measurement;pollen;symptom assessment;peak expiratory flow (procedure)	Shu-Hui Hung;Huan Chin Tseng;Wen Ho Tsai;Hsin-Hung Lin;Jen Hsien Cheng;Yi-Ming Chang	2007	Studies in health technology and informatics		data mining;internet privacy;mobile phone;asthma;medicine	HCI	-58.62101345121585	-64.99348647744657	24516

Previous work in information extraction from speech includes spoken document retrieval and named entity detection. This task differs from the named entity task in that the information we are interested in is a subset of the named entities in the message, and consequently, the need to pick the correct subset makes the problem more difficult. Also, the caller’s identity may include information that is not typically associated with a named entity. In this work, we present two information extraction methods, one based on hand-crafted rules, and one based on a maximum entropy model. We find that both systems give good performance when applied to manually-derived transcriptions, and that the maximum entropy system can reliably identify the time intervals containing phone numbers, even in the presence of significant decoding errors.	document retrieval;information extraction;named entity;principle of maximum entropy;telephone number	Jing Huang;Geoffrey Zweig;Mukund Padmanabhan	2001		10.1007/3-540-45637-6_6	natural language processing;search engine indexing;knowledge base;speech recognition;computer science;principle of maximum entropy;machine learning;pattern recognition;data mining;world wide web;expert system;information extraction;information retrieval	NLP	-36.32026427191774	-64.02130853961896	24832

In the worst case, systematic favoritism for a certain type of document can render other parts of the collection invisible to users. This potential bias can be evaluated by measuring the retrievability for all documents in a collection. Previous evaluations have been performed on TREC collections using simulated query sets. The question remains, however, how representative this approach is of more realistic settings.  To address this question, we investigate the effectiveness of the retrievability measure using a large digitized newspaper corpus, featuring two characteristics that distinguishes our experiments from previous studies: (1) compared to TREC collections, our collection contains noise originating from OCR processing, historical spelling and use of language; and (2) instead of simulated queries, the collection comes with real user query logs including click data.  First, we assess the retrievability bias imposed on the newspaper collection by different IR models. We assess the retrievability measure and confirm its ability to capture the retrievability bias in our setup. Second, we show how simulated queries differ from real user queries regarding term frequency and prevalence of named entities, and how this affects the retrievability results.	best, worst and average case;clickstream;digital library;experiment;information access;named entity;retrievability;text retrieval conference;tf–idf	Myriam C.

However, an offence may also be unintentional or exceptional, performed by a benevolent member of the community. This article examines whether a victim’s decrease in trust towards an unintentional or occasional offender can be repaired in an online setting, by designing and evaluating systems to support forgiveness. We study which of three systems enable the victim of a trust breakdown to fairly assess this kind of offender. The three systems are: (1) a reputation system, (2) a reputation system with a built-in apology forum that may display the offender’s apology to the victim and (3) a reputation system with a built-in apology forum that also includes a ‘‘forgiveness’’ component. The ‘‘forgiveness’’ component presents the victim with information that demonstrates the offender’s trustworthiness as judged by the system. We experimentally observe that systems (2) and (3), endorsing apology and supporting forgiveness, allow victims to recover their trust after online offences. An apology from the offender restores the victim’s trust only if the offender cooperates in a future interaction; it does not alleviate the trust breakdown immediately after it occurs. By contrast, the ‘‘forgiveness’’ component restores the victim’s trust directly after the offence and in a subsequent interaction. The applicability of these findings for extending reputation systems is discussed. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent work on topic-sensitive PageRank [6] and personalized PageRank [8] has explored how to extend PageRank values with personalization aspects. To achieve personalization, these algorithms need specific input: [8] for example needs a set of personalized hub pages with high PageRank to drive the computation. In this paper we show how to automate this hub selection process and build upon the latter algorithm to implement a platform for personalized ranking. We start from the set of bookmarks collected by a user and extend it to contain a set of hubs with high PageRankrelated to them. To get additional input about the user, we implemented a proxy server which tracks and analyzes user’s surfing behavior and outputs a set of pages preferred by the user. This set is then enrichened using our HubFinder algorithm, which finds related pages, and used as extended input for the [8] algorithm. All algorithms are integrated into a prototype of a personalized Web search system, for which we present a first evaluation.	centralized computing;collaborative filtering;computation;depth perception;genetic algorithm;multi-user;off topic;pagerank;personalization;portland pattern repository;prototype;proxy server;server (computing);usb hub;web page;web search engine	Paul-Alexandru Chirita;Daniel Olmedilla;Wolfgang Nejdl	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-27780-4_7	the internet;computer science;operating system;web page;data mining;database;hits algorithm;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine;server	Web+IR	-36.10439861054735	-57.90287297252123	25179

This expected availability of device observations in a standardised representation enables secondary usage if interoperability with clinical information systems can be achieved. The Device Observation Reporter (DOR) described in this work is a gateway that connects these realms. After a user chooses a selection of signals from different devices in the digital operating room, the DOR records these semantically described values for a specified duration. Upon completion, the signals descriptions and values are transformed to Health Level Seven version 2 messages and sent to a hospital information system/electronic health record system within the clinical IT network. The successful integration of device data for documentation and usage in clinical information systems can further leverage the novel device communication standard proposals. Complementing these, an Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise profile will aid commercial implementers in achieving interoperability. Their solutions could incorporate clinical knowledge to autonomously select signal combinations and generate reports of diagnostic and interventional procedures, thus saving time and effort for surgical documentation.	.cda file;application program interface;application programming interface;architecture as topic;business logic;cellular reprogramming techniques;component-based software engineering;description;documentation;electronic health records;fast healthcare interoperability resources;health level 7;hospital information systems;iso/iec 42010;information system;interventional procedure;medical devices;operating room;realms;receptors, opioid, delta;semantic interoperability;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;solutions;web service;clinical document architecture;message;research grants	Björn Andersen;Hannes Ulrich;Daniel Rehmann;Ann-Kristin Kock;Jan-Hinrich Wrage;Josef Ingenerf	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318710	semantic interoperability;interoperability;computer science;data mining;database;world wide web	Visualization	-54.01235202693959	-63.23389673656572	25466

Due to the integrative structure of the project the ontology needs to represent entities from various disciplines on a large spatial and temporal scale. Initial term acquisition was performed by exploiting a database scaffold, literature analysis and communications with domain experts. The ontology design is based on the DOLCE upper ontology and other existing domain ontologies were linked or partly included whenever appropriate (e.g., the FMA for anatomical entities and the UMLS for definitions and lexical information). About 2300 predominantly medical entities were represented but also a multitude of biomolecular, epidemiological, and hemodynamic entities. The usage of the ontology in the project comprises terminological control, text mining, annotation, and data mediation.	annotation;conferences;controlled vocabulary;documentation;email;entity;epidemiology;fma instruction set;foundations;genetic heterogeneity;hemodynamics;informatics (discipline);integrated project support environment;intracranial aneurysm;molecular biology;molecular medicine;ontology (information science);simulation;software architecture;strychnine;subarachnoid hemorrhage;text mining;unified medical language system;upper ontology;user interface	Martin Boeker;Holger Stenzhorn;Kai Kumpf;Philippe Bijlenga;Stefan Schulz;Susanne Hanser	2007	AMIA ...

These extend the usage possibilities to new situations and therapies also targeting a wider range of users.

From 22,808 articles pertaining to 19 antidepressants, 1000 were randomly selected and manually labelled according to article type (including, randomised controlled trials, editorials, etc.). We applied a machine learning approach termed 'active learning', where the learner (machine) selects the order in which the user (human) labels examples. Via simulation, we determined the number of articles a user needed to label to produce a classifier with at least 95% recall and 90% precision in three scenarios related to evidence synthesis. We found that the active learning process reduced the number of training instances required by 70%, 19%, and 14% in the three scenarios. The results show that the active learning method may be used in some scenarios to produce accurate classifiers that meet the needs of evidence synthesis tasks and reduce manual effort.	active learning (machine learning);antidepressive agents;editorial;medline;machine learning;one thousand;pubmed;randomness;simulation;statistical classification	Adam G.

Stated beliefs about deception and deceptive messages or incidents are content analyzed in a sample of 324 computer-mediated communications. Relevant stated beliefs are obtained through systematic sampling and querying of the blogosphere based on 80 English words commonly used to describe deceptive incidents. Deception is conceptualized broader than lying and includes a variety of deceptive strategies: falsification, concealment (omitting material facts) and equivocation (dodging or skirting issues). The stated beliefs are argued to be valuable toward the creation of a unified multi-faceted ontology of deception, stratified along several classificatory facets such as (1) contextual domain (e.g., personal relations, politics, finances & insurance), (2) deception content (e.g., events, time, place, abstract notions), (3) message format (e.g., a complaint: they lied to us, a victim story: I was lied to or tricked, or a direct accusation: you're lying), and (4) deception variety, each tied to particular verbal cues (e.g., misinforming, scheming, misrepresenting, or cheating). The paper positions automated deception detection within the field of library and information science (LIS), as a feasible natural language processing (NLP) task. Key findings and important constructs in deception research from interpersonal communication, psychology, criminology, and language technology studies are synthesized into an overview. Deception research is juxtaposed to several benevolent constructs in LIS research: trust, credibility, certainty, and authority.		Victoria L.

In this study, expert programmers were directly questioned regarding the nature of their mental representations while they were engaged in a design task. This investigative technique was used with the explicit intention of eliciting introspective reports of mental imagery. The resulting transcripts displayed a considerable number of common elements. These suggest that software design shares many characteristics of more concrete design disciplines. They also provide promising areas for further investigation of software development support tools and design strategies.	mental representation;programmer;software design;software development	Marian Petre;Alan F.

With the availability of these resources we also seek to enable the evaluation of the applicability of specific tools and representations towards improving the performance of event extraction systems. Additionally we supplied evaluation software and services and constructed a visualisation tool, stav, which visualises event extraction results and annotations. These resources helped the participants make sure that their final submissions and research efforts were on track during the development stages and evaluate their progress throughout the duration of the shared task. The visualisation software was also employed to show the differences between the gold annotations and those of the submitted results, allowing the participants to better understand the performance of their system.

Automatic detection is therefore a key step toward tools that can characterize communication quality and thus help in applications from call center management to mental health monitoring. However, most existing computational linguistic approaches to these phenomena are unsuitable for general use in this way, and particularly for analyzing human-human dialogue: Although models of other-repair are common in human-computer dialogue systems, they tend to focus on specific phenomena (e.g., repair initiation by systems), missing the range of repair and repair initiation forms used by humans; and while self-repair models for speech recognition and understanding are advanced, they tend to focus on removal of """"disfluent"""" material important for full understanding of the discourse contribution, and/or rely on domain-specific knowledge. We explain the requirements for more satisfactory models, including incrementality of processing and robustness to sparsity. We then describe models for self- and other-repair detection that meet these requirements (for the former, an adaptation of an existing repair model; for the latter, an adaptation of standard techniques) and investigate how they perform on datasets from a range of dialogue genres and domains, with promising results."""

But these similarities are only skin deep. The kinds of trees used by the two theories are actually quite different: in GSDT, text can appear at both leaf nodes and internal nodes in the trees; whereas in RST, text can only appear at leaf nodes. So the structures might be isomorphic trader some mapping but that mapping remains to be worked out (at the very least, isonaorphism could only be achiew~d by annotating arcs iu an intentional structure tree with """"rhetorical"""" labels; there is an interesting parallel here with the dilference between dependency grammar and phrase structure gramnaar). A more significant, difference is that, in RST, leaf nodes (the atomic text spans) are typically taken to be single clauses; but in GSDT, if our atomic elements (the bottom level discourse segments) were clauses, then, given the constraints the theory claims on pronominalization and reference, we'd rule out as anomolous a large space of perfectly legitimate pronominalizations (those where the antecedent and anaphor are in clauses at the same level of embedding in the discourse structure: recall that material in a sister discourse segment is inaccessible).

This has to be viewed as a problem especially in the domains characterized by a complex and long-term treatment, as the medical decision making process may not be comprehensible anymore from the data entries themselves. Context representation can overcome these limitations, enabling the record to express causality, revisions, conflicts, or individual heuristics explicitly. This article introduces CLINICON which is a formal framework for domain-independent context representation based on Sowa's conceptual graphs.	causality;conceptual graph;conflict (psychology);heuristic (computer science);john f. sowa;medical decision making;medical records;patients	Robert Müller	1997	Proceedings : a conference of the American Medical Informatics Association.

We examined the quality of data entered by providers in the free-text portion of our institutional EHR handoff tool. Overall, 65% of handoff notes contained at least one error (average 1.7 errors per note). Most errors were omissions in information around patient plan/management or assessment/diagnosis rather than entry of false data. Factors associated with increased error rate were increasing hospital day number; weekend note; medical (vs. surgical) service team; and authorship by a medical student, first or fourth year resident physician, or attending physician. Our findings suggest that errors are common in handoff notes, and while these errors are not completely false data, they may provide individuals caring for patients an inaccurate understanding of patient status.	bit error rate;contain (action);electronic health records;ibm notes;note (document);patients	Elliot G.

8c81355a986f2935a7d762062864de81512ff250	exhaustively characterizing a patient cohort by prevalence of emr facts: a generalized, vendor-agnostic method for quality control and research		We present a method for rapidly ranking all distinct facts in an electronic medical record (EMR) system by howover-represented or under-represented they are in a patient cohort of interest relative to some larger referencepopulation of patients in the same EMR. We have implemented this method as a plugin for i2b2, the open sourcedata warehouse platform widely used in research health informatics. Our method is highly flexible in terms of whatmedical terminologies it supports and is vendor-independent thanks to leveraging the i2b2 star schema rather thanany one specific EMR. It can be applied to a wide range of informatics problems including finding healthdisparities, searching for variables to include in a risk calculator or computable phenotype, detection ofcomorbidities, discovery of adverse drug reactions. The case study we present here uses this software to findunlabeled flowsheets for patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	adverse reaction to drug;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;clinical informatics;computable function;electronic health records;electronics, medical;excalibur: morgana's revenge;gucy2c protein, human;informatics (discipline);large;lateral thinking;medical records;patients;star schema	Alex F.

It has generally been assumed that for this latter case people must engage in a deeper semantic evaluation of items during the search process. This idea is central to Information Foraging theory. But do people actually spend longer assessing items when engaged in a semantically demanding search task' We investigate this by having participants locate target items in 16-item menus. Participants were either told exactly what to look for (known-item search) or they were told the category that the target belonged to (semantic search). Participants were faster and more accurate at known-item searches. Eye-movement data show that this was because participants were more likely to skip over items when performing known-item searches. Contrary to expectation, we found limited empirical evidence to support the idea that deeper semantic evaluations of items lead to longer gaze durations (this occurred only when items were arranged very close together). This finding is important because it reveals how people adopt different eye gaze strategies depending on the kind of search activity they are engaged in.	eb-eye;information foraging;semantic search	Duncan P.

Government agencies and patient safety organizations recognize that interruptions contribute to medical errors. The purpose of this study was to observe, record, and contextualize activities and interruptions experienced by physicians and Registered Nurses (RNs) working in a Level One Trauma Center.   METHODS    DESIGN A case study that relied on an ethnographic study design using the shadowing method.   SUBJECTS A convenience sample of physicians and RNs, each with at least 6 months of experience in the Emergency Department (ED), were asked to participate. In these kinds of detailed qualitative investigations, it is quite common to have a small sample size. Ethical approval: Approval was obtained from institutional ethic committees prior to initiating the study. Community consent was obtained from the ED staff through in-service education.   SETTING All observations were made in the trauma section of the ED of a tertiary teaching hospital. The hospital is situated in a major medical center in the Gulf Coast region of the United States of America (USA).   FINDINGS Five attending ED physicians were observed for a total of 29h, 31min. Eight RNs were shadowed for a total of 40 h, 9min. Interruptions and activities were categorized using the Hybrid Method to Categorize Interruptions and Activities (HyMCIA). Registered Nurses received slightly more interruptions per hour than physicians. People, pagers, and telephones were identified as mediums through which interruptions were delivered. The physical environment was found to contribute to interruptions in workflow because of physical design and when supplies were not available. Physicians and RNs usually returned to the original, interrupted activity more often than leaving the activity unfinished.   CONCLUSION This research provides an enhanced understanding of interruptions in workflow in the ED, the identification of work constraints, and the need to develop interventions to manage interruptions. It is crucial that interruptions be delivered in such a way that there is minimal negative impact on performance. The significance and importance of the interruption must always be weighed against the negative impact that it has on smooth, efficient workflow.	accident and emergency department;categorization;convenience sampling;cumulative trauma disorders;departure - action;erectile dysfunction;gulf of execution;interrupt;manufactured supplies;physical design (electronics);registration;shadowing (histology);situated;teaching hospitals;telephone;trauma centers;wounds and injuries;per hour;tertiary	Juliana J.

The aim is to leverage human effort by providing preprocessed phrase lists with a high percentage of useful material.#N##N#Method: The approach is to develop six different scoring methods that are based on different aspects of phrase occurrence. The emphasis here is not on lexical information or syntactic structure but rather on the statistical properties of word pairs and triples that can be obtained from a large database.#N##N#Measurements: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) incorporates a large list of humanly acceptable phrases in the medical field as a part of its structure. The authors use this list of phrases as a gold standard for validating their methods. A good method is one that ranks the UMLS phrases high among all phrases studied. Measurements are 11-point average precision values and precision-recall curves based on the rankings.#N##N#Result: The authors find of six different scoring methods that each proves effective in identifying UMLS quality phrases in a large subset of MEDLINE. These methods are applicable both to word pairs and word triples. All six methods are optimally combined to produce composite scoring methods that are more effective than any single method. The quality of the composite methods appears sufficient to support the automatic placement of hyperlinks in text at the site of highly ranked phrases.#N##N#Conclusion: Statistical scoring methods provide a promising approach to the extraction of useful phrases from a natural language database for the purpose of indexing or providing hyperlinks in text.

BACKGROUND Despite technology advances and considerable efforts focused on the identification and quantification of VE aftereffects, few have addressed means for recuperation, the focus of the current study.   METHOD After 15 min-60 min of VE exposure and recalibratory exercises, hand-eye coordination and postural stability were assessed electronically, the former via a 3-D measure capturing pointing errors, and the latter by head and body oscillations while standing in the tandem Romberg position. Both measurements were collected immediately after VE exposure and every 15 min up to 1 hr thereafter.   RESULTS Participants (more than 900 college students) who experienced the peg-in-hole readaptation strategy had a significant decrease (p < 0.000 in pointing errors following the exercise; the other two methods (i.e., rail walking, natural decay) showed no significant change. For posture, all groups showed significant improvement during the 15 minutes after VE exposure, yet none returned to baseline by 1 hr postexposure.   CONCLUSION Although hand-eye coordination readaptation strategies showed noticeable effects immediately after they were performed, aftereffects were not completely eliminated after 1 hr; hence further research on readaptation strategies is essential to achieve more substantial recalibratory gains in hand-eye coordination and posture. Additionally, hand-eye coordination and vestibular aftereffects may require a period exceeding the VE immersion time in order to recover.   APPLICATION These findings may serve as a guide in the development of monitoring policies following VE exposure.	acoustic neuroma;baseline (configuration management);body position;data recovery;exercise;futures studies;immersion (virtual reality);maxima and minima;objective-c;policy;poor posture;quantitation;romberg's method;sequela of disorder;virtual reality	Roberto K.

354021dbdb8c1270783c24e19de62a8e831d88ec	dimensions of affecting factors on the acceptance of smartphones regarding travel information		With hand-held devices and mobile computing becoming ubiquitous in our lives, it is true that many people are interested in the usage of smartphones in the tourism industry. However, even though there are lots of studies on technology acceptance and online travel information, there is little research on smartphone acceptance for travel information. The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants of travelers’ intentions to adopt smartphones within the context of their travel activities. In this paper we propose a new approach to examine the intention of travelers to use smartphones by viewing smartphone usage from two standpoints: hardware (technology) and software (online travel information). In terms of hardware, the united theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model is used to investigate the intention to use smartphones, and the travel websites satisfaction (E-SAT) model is used to investigate the intention to use smartphones in terms of software. Based on the literature of two research streams, this study proposes an instrument to measure the affecting factors on the acceptance of smartphones regarding travel information.	mobile computing;mobile device;smartphone	Eun Jung No;Jin Ki Kim	2011			computer science;streams;tourism;software;internet privacy;mobile computing;marketing	HCI	-61.3122112408103	-52.13731164558426	26970

Previous HCI research on decision support systems (DSS) has improved the information visualization aspect of DSS information design, but has somewhat overlooked the cognitive aspect of decision-making, namely that human reasoning is heuristic and reflects systematic errors or cognitive biases. We report on an empirical study of two cognitive biases: conservatism and loss aversion. Two remediation techniques recommended by previous research were tested: the expected return method, an actuarial-inspired approach presenting objective metrics; and bootstrapping, a technique successful in improving judgment consistency. The results show that the two biases can occur simultaneously and can have a huge impact on decision-making. The results also show that the two debiasing techniques are only partly effective. These findings suggest a need for more research on debiasing, and indicate some directions for exploring debiasing techniques and building decision support systems.	bootstrapping (compilers);decision support system;heuristic;human–computer interaction;information design;information visualization;risk aversion	Yunfeng Zhang;Rachel K.

cd8a8e74d011ea8b377cd10f1b015db324630e54	tool support for authoring eligibility criteria for cancer trials		A critical component of authoring new clinical trial protocols is assembling a set of eligibility criteria for patient enrollment. We found that clinical protocols in three different cancer domains can be categorized according to a set of clinical states that describe various clinical scenarios for that domain. Classifying protocols in this manner revealed similarities among the eligibility criteria and permitted some standardization of criteria based on clinical state. We have developed an eligibility criteria authoring tool which uses a standard set of eligibility criteria and a diagram of the clinical states to present the relevant eligibility criteria to the protocol author. We demonstrate our ideas with phase-3 protocols from breast cancer, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Based on measurements of redundancy and percentage coverage of criteria included in our tool, we conclude that our model reduces redundancy in the number of criteria needed to author multiple protocols, and it allows some eligibility criteria to be authored automatically based on the clinical state of interest for a protocol.	categorization;classification;diagram;eligibility determination;mammary neoplasms;non-small cell lung carcinoma;patients;prostatic neoplasms;protocols documentation;small cell carcinoma of lung	Daniel L.

183f55f8e9d9e2f9636aedc11f420b696d8d2269	virtual reality course based on the sat counseling method for self-guided mental healthcare		The necessity of keeping employees' good mental health in companies has been widely recognized and even legislated recently in Japan. It is a big issue because of the huge number of target people, which is beyond the capacity of existing number of psychological experts or counselors. The means to keep good mental health by themselves are needed. In this paper, we propose a virtual reality course to meet this purpose based on the existing SAT counseling method. Unlike other conventional counseling methods focusing on the psychological aspects, the SAT method puts importance on physicality, and approaches mental problems from bodily symptoms. It does not need a client to tell his/her traumatic episodes or secrets, and uses visual stimulation by images of light and positive face representation instead of nuanced linguistic expressions. Also, it is well structured which can be practiced in relatively short time in 5 to 10 minutes. Thus, it gives a good basis for developing a self-guided course. We have developed a self-guided digital mental healthcare course SAT-VR based on the SAT method. Using the evaluation scale established by the SAT method, stress mitigation was observed in the lab study.	head-mounted display;oculus rift;relative change and difference;virtual reality	Tatsuya Ito;Takeshi Kamita;Atsuko Matsumoto;Tsunetsugu Munakata;Tomoo Inoue	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)	10.1109/ICHI.2018.00041	mental health;applied psychology;health care;expression (mathematics);virtual reality;counseling method;psychology	Visualization	-57.25695145395009	-54.684751409780816	27217

In this study the relationship between four user satisfaction measures and five adoption behaviors were explored in the context of the implementation of the Veteran's Health Administration Computerized Patient Record System 1.0. Findings suggest that the relationship is modest and depends on the measurement system used. Specifically, direct reports of affect and judgements of specific task efficacy related to behavior more often than usability and a general user satisfaction instrument.	behavior;cns disorder;computer user satisfaction;evaluation;information systems;information system;judgment;proxy server;system of measurement;usability	Charlene R.

The performance improvement of LFMs over baseline approaches, however, hovers at only low percentage numbers. Therefore, it is time for a better understanding of their real power beyond the overall RMSE (root-mean-square error), which as it happens, lies at a very compressed range, without providing too much chance for deeper insight. This paper provides a detailed experimental study regarding the performance of classical staple LFMs on a classical dataset, Movielens 1M1, that sheds light on a much more pronounced excellence of LFMs for particular categories of users and items, for RMSE and other measures. In particular, LFMs exhibit surprising and excellent advantages when handling several difficult user and item categories. By comparing the distributions of the test and predicted ratings, we show that the performance of LFMs is influenced by the rating distribution. We then propose a method to estimate the performance of LFMs for a given rating dataset. Also, we provide a very simple, open-source, library that implements staple LFMs achieving a similar performance as some very recent (2013) developments in LFMs, and at the same time being more transparent than some other libraries in wide use."""	baseline (configuration management);experiment;library (computing);movielens;netflix prize;open-source software;recommender system	Cheng Chen;Lan Zheng;Alex Thomo;Kui Wu;Srinivasan Venkatesh	2014		10.1145/2554850.2554925	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;evaluation;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;computer security;statistics;recommender system	ML	-37.57712333675502	-54.90354240666631	27470

At the same time, the fluid nature of such environments hinders administrators' efforts to define access control policies that appropriately balance patient privacy and healthcare functions. Manual efforts to define these policies are labor-intensive and error-prone, often resulting in systems that endow certain care providers with overly broad access to patients' medical records while restricting other providers from legitimate and timely use. In this work, we propose an alternative method to generate these policies by automatically mining usage patterns from electronic health record (EHR) systems. EHR systems are increasingly being integrated into clinical environments and our approach is designed to be generalizable across HCOs, thus assisting in the design and evaluation of local access control policies. Our technique, which is grounded in data mining and social network analysis theory, extracts a statistical model of the organization from the access logs of its EHRs. In doing so, our approach enables the review of predefined policies, as well as the discovery of unknown behaviors.

Archival data on hospital IT usage obtained from the Dorenfest Institute is combined with archival data on the quality of hospital care processes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a three-year longitudinal study of a balanced panel data set consisting of 2,848 U.S. hospitals. Our analyses extends earlier research on the association between healthcare IT usage and efficiency improvements in healthcare organizations that have primarily focused on outcomes associated with operating cost reduction. Preliminary results from our study indicate a positive impact of clinical information systems, patient scheduling applications, and human resource management information systems on the quality of health care processes. However, quality increase comes at a cost as clinical systems usage and patient scheduling system usage increase hospital operating expenses.	archive;management information system;panel data;scheduling (computing)	Mark F.

This paper reports a study of handover in a medical admissions unit. We draw on the notion of awareness as conceptualised within the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work literature to explore the role played by a variety of cognitive artifacts in supporting continuous coverage. While such awareness is typically characterised as being ‘effortless’, our study reveals that maintaining awareness in a context such as the medical admissions unit is effortful due to invisible work. We suggest that the notion of awareness is beneficial for exploring the practices of continuous coverage because it moves attention away from the moment of handover, instead encouraging consideration of the variety of practices through which clinicians display their work to, and monitor the work of, colleagues on different shifts. We argue that efforts to support continuous coverage should focus on improving awareness by increasing the visibility of information.	awareness;computer-supported cooperative work	Rebecca Randell;Stephanie M.

a780fed0445a1cc289976fe653c531a60c704491	a platform-independent user-friendly dictionary from italian to lis		The Lack of written representation for Italian Sign Language (LIS) makes it difficult to do perform tasks like looking up a new word in a dictionary. Most of the paper dictionaries show LIS signs in drawings or pictures. It’s not a simple proposition to understand the meaning of sign from paper dictionaries unless one already knows the meanings. This paper presents the LIS dictionary which provides the facility to translate Italian text into sign language. LIS signs are shown as video animations performed by a virtual character. The LIS dictionary provides the integration with MultiWordNet database. The integration with MultiWordNet allows a rich extension with the meanings and senses of the words existing in MultiWordNet. The dictionary allows users to acquire information about lemmas, synonyms and synsets in the Sign Language (SL). The application is platform independent and can be used on any operating system. The results of input lemmas are displayed in groups of grammatical categories.	context-free grammar;dictionary;operating system;protologism;sl (complexity);synonym ring;usability;wordnet	Umar Shoaib;Nadeem Ahmad;Paolo Prinetto;Gabriele Tiotto	2012			artificial intelligence;natural language processing;proposition;grammatical category;sign language;synonym;italian sign language;computer science;user friendly	NLP	-35.23656641182891	-75.04541628914721	27697

We are aiming to develop a system to support reading novel taking an advantage of digital books. In this paper, we propose an elemental method to generate dynamic abstracts for each reading progress. Generating dynamic abstract can be assumed as a topic of summarization task in the field of natural language processing. The proposed method focuses on the local variation of word importance, though some existing criterions for summarization focus on the overall word importance. We prepared four types of local variation and compared the effectiveness of those with each other. We conducted the experiment to detect words accepted to manually-generated dynamic abstracts with each types of the proposed method while the general word importance criterion ( tf-idf ) is used as the comparative method. Through the discussions of the results, it was confirmed that some types of the proposed method were more effective to detect the words accepted to dynamic abstracts than the comparative method.

Telemedicine is one way of providing support to patients, to manage and receive care from home. Medical researchers use clinical trials to evaluate telemedicine technologies by comparing medical improvements of the patients. However, the patients' interactions and experiences with the technology are important because unpleasant experiences may result in non-adherence to a medical program. HCI experts have contributed in user-centred evaluations for decades. This research complements a telemedicine clinical trial with human-centred evaluation to understand patients during the post- rollout phase. Findings present patients' placement of telemedicine device in their homes, patients' feelings of using the device and their family involvement, and our experiences of conducting a HCI research with medical researchers in a clinical trial. We conclude that though the telemedicine device is seen as life-saving, patients treat it just as a regular device. We conclude that telemedicine evaluations such as clinical trials can benefit from evaluation methods in HCI.	experience;human–computer interaction;usability	Sakib Jalil;Dianna L. Hardy;Trina S.

eb686ef89ba1852b814c3297efb6165cf0a5f576	ontology based intercultural patient practitioner assistive communications from qualitative gap analysis	journal article;cross cultural issues;domain ontology;computer mediated communication cmc	Purpose – There is an increasing interest in using information and communication technologies to support health services. But the adoption and development of even basic ICT communications services in many health services is limited, leaving enormous gaps in the broad understanding of its role in health care delivery. The purpose of this paper is to address a specific (intercultural) area of healthcare communications consumer disadvantage; and it examines the potential for ICT exploitation through the lens of a conceptual framework. The opportunity to pursue a new solutions pathway has been amplified in recent times through the development of computer-based ontologies and the resultant knowledge from ontologist activity and consequential research publishing. Design/methodology/approach – A specific intercultural area of patient disadvantage arises from variations in meaning and understanding of patient and clinician words, phrases and non-verbal expression. Collection and localization of data concepts, their attributes and individual instances were gathered from an Aboriginal trainee nurse focus group and from a qualitative gap analysis (QGA) of 130 criteria-selected sources of literature. These concepts, their relationships and semantic interpretations populate the computer ontology. The ontology mapping involves two domains, namely, Aboriginal English (AE) and Type II diabetes care guidelines. This is preparatory to development of the Patient Practitioner Assistive Communications (PPAC) system for Aboriginal rural and remote patient primary care. Findings – The combined QGA and focus group output reported has served to illustrate the call for three important drivers of change. First, there is no evidence to contradict the hypothesis that patientpractitioner interview encounters for many Australian Aboriginal patients and wellbeing outcomes are unsatisfactory at best. Second, there is a potent need for cultural competence knowledge and practice uptake on the part of health care providers; and third, the key contributory component to determine success or failures within healthcare for ethnic minorities is communication. Communication, however, can only be of value in health care if in practice it supports shared cognition; and mutual cognition is rarely achievable when biopsychosocial and other cultural worldview differences go unchallenged. Research limitations/implications – There has been no direct engagement with remote Aboriginal communities in this work to date. The authors have initially been able to rely upon a cohort of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people with relevant cultural expertise and extended family relationships. Among these advisers are health care practitioners, academics, trainers, Aboriginal education researchers and workshop attendees. It must therefore be acknowledged that as is the case with the QGA, the majority of the concept data is from third parties. The authors have also discovered that urban influences and cultural sensitivities tend to reduce the extent of, and opportunity to, witness AE usage, thereby limiting the ability to capture more examples of code-switching. Although the PPAC system concept is qualitatively well developed, pending future work planned for rural and remote community engagement the authors presently regard the work as mostly allied to a hypothesis on ontology-driven communications. The concept data population of the AE home talk/health talk ontology has not yet reached a quantitative critical mass to justify application design model engineering and real-world testing.

The database was officially released in 2006, and has attracted a growing number of researchers in academia and industry. We present the two major software tools that facilitate accessing the relational database: the web-based QueryBuilder and a downloadable virtual machine (VM) image.   RESULTS QueryBuilder and the MIMIC-II VM have been developed successfully and are freely available to MIMIC-II users. Simple example SQL queries and the resulting data are presented. Clinical studies pertaining to acute kidney injury and prediction of fluid requirements in the intensive care unit are shown as typical examples of research performed with MIMIC-II. In addition, MIMIC-II has also provided data for annual PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenges, including the 2012 Challenge """"Predicting mortality of ICU Patients"""".   CONCLUSIONS QueryBuilder is a web-based tool that provides easy access to MIMIC-II. For more computationally intensive queries, one can locally install a complete copy of MIMIC-II in a VM.

However, many studies have reported a null or even detrimental effect of haptic guidance on training compared to unassisted practice. While prior studies have focused on using haptic guidance to refine a movement strategy, our study explores its effect on the discovery of a new strategy. Subjects learned to manipulate a virtual under-actuated system via a haptic device either with or without haptic guidance (and without haptic feedback of system dynamics). The guidance enabled subjects to experience a range of successful movements, rather than strictly enforcing one trajectory. Subjects who trained with guidance adopted a strategy that involved faster reaches, required greater control of the system's degrees of freedom, and increased the potential for faster task completion. However, overall improvement of task performance was limited with the new strategy.	axon guidance;entity name part qualifier - adopted;haptic device component;haptic technology;motor skills;movement;null value;refinement (computing);robot;system dynamics;executing - querystatuscode;semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway involved in neuron projection guidance	Tricia L.

The system takes as input a set of patient records in electronic format and gives as output, for each document, information regarding HAI. In order to achieve this goal, a temporal processing together with a deep syntactic and semantic analysis of the patient records is performed. Medical knowledge used by the rules is derived from a set of documents that have been annotated by medical doctors. After a brief description of the context of this work, we present the general architecture of our document processing chain and explain how we perform our temporal and linguistic analysis. Finally, we report our preliminary results and we lay out the next steps of the project.

9bd8ce9d10f1fe6b1de680c1f4fdfd5a8cff7560	strengthen cancer surveillance in sri lanka by implementing cancer registry informatics to enhance cancer registry data accuracy, completeness, and timeliness	data collection;health information systems;registries	Cancer surveillance is a process of systematic, continuous collection, storage, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of epidemiological information on cancer cases occurring in a particular geographic area. The process of cancer surveillance is also called 'cancer registration'. A system to conduct cancer registration is called 'cancer registry'. The purpose of the project is to implement cancer registry informatics to enhance electronic cancer registry reporting activities that take advantage of emerging health information technology. The expected function of the application is to strengthen the cancer registry data accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. The goals to be achieved are: determine the incidence of cancers with respect to geographic, demographic characteristics; monitor trends and patterns of cancer incidences over time; identify high-risk populations; provide data for epidemiological studies and prioritize health resource allocations.

Structured news reports are XML documents, where the text entries are restricted to individual words or simple phrases, such as names and domain-specific terminology, and numbers and units. We assume structured news reports do not require natural language processing. In this paper, we present propositional fusion rules as a way of implementing logic-based fusion for structured news reports. Fusion rules are a form of scripting language that define how structured news reports should be merged. The antecedent of a fusion rule is a call to investigate the information in the structured news reports and the background knowledge, and the consequent of a fusion rule is a formula specifying an action to be undertaken to form a merged report. It is expected that a set of fusion rules is defined for any given application. We give the syntax and mode of execution for fusion rules, and explain how the resulting actions give a merged report.	natural language processing;propositional calculus;scripting language;xml	Anthony Hunter;Rupert Summerton	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-45062-7_41	natural language processing;xml;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;database;algorithm	Web+IR	-37.87346728680383	-78.7059401908493	28624

Although these improvements have been observed from the fusion of result sets from several distinct information retrieval systems, it has often been thought that fusing different document retrieval strategies in a single information retrieval system will lead to similar improvements. In this study, we show that this is not the case. We hold constant systemic differences such as parsing, stemming, phrase processing, and relevance feedback, and fuse result sets generated from highly effective retrieval strategies in the same information retrieval system. From this, we show that data fusion of highly effective retrieval strategies alone shows little or no improvement in retrieval effectiveness. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of the performance of modern data fusion approaches, and demonstrate the reasons why they do not perform well when applied to this problem. Detailed results and analyses are included to support our conclusions.	deployment environment;document retrieval;experiment;information retrieval;naivety;parsing;relevance feedback;result set;stemming	Steven M.

However, decision support for more complex problems has been much more difficult to create. Decision aids are now being developed for very complex problems, and their effects among low-and high-task-knowledge individuals are still being explored. One such task is credibility assessment, in which message recipients or observers must determine a message's veracity and trustworthiness. Credibility assessment is made difficult by lack of constraints, hidden or incomplete information, and mistaken beliefs of the assessor.#R##N##R##N#The theory of technology dominance (TTD) proposes that technology is most effectively applied in intelligent decision aids when an experienced user is paired with a sophisticated decision aid. This work examines TT D in the complex task of credibility assessment. To assist in credibility assessment, we created a decision aid that augments the capabilities of the user-whether novice or professional. Using hypotheses based on TT D, we tested the decision aid using high-stakes deception in recorded interviews and involved both student (novice) and law enforcement (professional) users. Both professionals and novices improved their assessment accuracy by using the decision aid. Consistent with TTD, novices were more reliant on the decision aid than were professionals. However, contrary to TTD, there was no significant difference in the way novices and professionals interacted with the system, and the decision aid was not more beneficial to professionals. Novices and professionals frequently discounted the aid's recommendations, and in many cases professionals did not view explanations when the decision aid contradicted their assessments. Potential reasons for these findings, as well as limitations and future research opportunities, are discussed.		Matthew L. Jensen;Paul Benjamin Lowry;Judee K. Burgoon;Jay F.

The objective of a specialized version of the system is to provide medical and healthcare information services to users via interactive search for personalized patient needs. Patients usually have questions regarding healthcare, including those which concern illness symptoms, duration and types of treatment, possible drug effects, and more. Authorized personnel would often be ideal in responding to such needs; however they could potentially be very expensive, and not easy to support and maintain. If patients could have access to information at their home, by means of i-phone or online access, this could save time, doctor office visit expenses, as well as valuable and restricted medical time. What is more, information concerning other anonymized and similar patient cases provides knowledge and perspective on a wide range of patient issues. From the doctors' perspective, they typically need to spend time on differential analysis about new patient cases: study symptoms, research possible causes, rank results by emergency priority and treat them accordingly. A search system that would direct a doctor (or patient/user) to similar patient cases would save significant amount of manual search time. The powerful new feature of this system is the storage and mining of past patient cases knowledge, to create metadata to be used in the subsequent retrieval of relevant documents. Finally, the interactive search system would speed up identification of rare cases; for instance, symptoms that do not appear commonly in past cases may require special treatment or expert referral. We build a model which dynamically learns medical needs of interacting MDs and patients. The model works on free or unstructured text, allowing disambiguation of vague words and flexibility in describing medical needs. In addition, both experts with an advanced knowledge of medical terminology, and beginning users using basic medical terms, can achieve high search relevance. Furthermore, our approach obviates the need for the assignment of tags or labels, such as treatment, symptoms, causes, to documents, to respond effectively to user queries. In particular, we build a temporal difference algorithm to predict user's information needs by incorporating both current and predicted knowledge into learning the user profile. Our source of information about the user consists of submitted queries and feedback on the returned results. We tested our system on publicly available medical data (OhsuMed TREC dataset 2002) and we achieved a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy, compared to the literature. We provide quantitative results as well as demonstration screenshots which illustrate a) the value of interaction (user time spent with system versus results accuracy), b) the value of using medical terminology understanding, when compared with simple general words, and c) the value of allowing the maximum number of feedback submissions to vary.	algorithm;authorization;emoticon;feedback;freedom of information laws by country;human–computer interaction;information needs;information source;longest common subsequence problem;personalization;relevance;screenshot;temporal difference learning;text retrieval conference;user profile;vagueness;word-sense disambiguation	Maria Daltayanni;Chunye Wang;Ram Akella	2012	2012 Annual SRII Global Conference	10.1109/SRII.2012.65	computer science;data science;data mining;information retrieval	Web+IR	-50.27553446623495	-68.81881703352975	28796

MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched databases, previously collected papers, and references for relevant papers published from January 2000 to June 2012. For selection, papers had to: be a primary study; involve a computerized system for health information processing, decision support, or management reporting; and include an economic evaluation. Data on study design and economic evaluation methods were extracted and analyzed.   RESULTS Forty-two papers were selected and 33 were deemed high quality (scores ≥ 8/10) for further analysis. These included 12 economic analyses, five input cost analyses, and 16 cost-related outcome analyses. For HIS types, there were seven primary care electronic medical records, six computerized provider order entry systems, five medication management systems, five immunization information systems, four institutional information systems, three disease management systems, two clinical documentation systems, and one health information exchange network. In terms of value for money, 23 papers reported positive findings, eight were inconclusive, and two were negative.   CONCLUSIONS We found a wide range of economic evaluation papers that were based on different assumptions, methods, and metrics. There is some evidence of value for money in selected healthcare organizations and HIS types. However, caution is needed when generalizing these findings. Better reporting of economic evaluation studies is needed to compare findings and build on the existing evidence base we identified.	8b/10b encoding;database;decision support system;disease management;display resolution;documentation;electronic health records;evaluation;extraction;health information exchange;health information systems;information processing;information system;license;money;one health initiative;order management system;paper;peer review;primary health care;scientific publication;scope (computer science);interest	Jesdeep Bassi;Francis Y.

There have been many reports on concept generation in various fields such as linguistics and robotics. In the context of language acquisition, however, they mainly deal with letters, i.e. symbols, in general. Since both the concept and language acquisitions progress in parallel, we notice the importance to investigate concept generation without symbols existing a priori. In this paper, we propose a non-symbol-based method that pays attention to multimodal mutual information.	map;mutual information;organizing (structure)	Kunio Kitahara;Akira Hirose	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-10684-2_29	language acquisition;natural language processing;computer science;multivariate mutual information;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mutual information;interaction information;pointwise mutual information	Robotics	-33.77516851846239	-79.05132164113495	29046

As IC is integral to publicly funded clinical testing services, we incorporated pre-test concepts necessary for IC in GetCheckedOnline (GCO), British Columbia's online sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) testing service.   OBJECTIVE We assessed the acceptability of this IC step and its design options among potential users during usability testing of GCO.   METHODS English-speaking participants≥19years were recruited from Craigslist and among provincial STI clinic clients for usability testing of an early version of GCO, which included a consent webpage presenting 8 pre-test statements for review prior to completing testing. Participants were interviewed regarding their acceptability, perceptions, and understanding of the consent page; transcripts were analyzed thematically.   RESULTS We conducted 13 interviews (9 males, 4 females; 9 self-identified as heterosexual; all had previously tested for STBBI). We identified three main themes: i) the meaning of IC (consent page viewed as important and for protection of individual and organization; participants demonstrated varying understandings of specific components); ii) the impact of previous experience on understanding IC (participants understood difference between online and in-person testing; IC concepts were better understood by participants with more testing experience); iii) the role of website design on achieving IC (design of page to disrupt speedy click-throughs was valued and demonstrated seriousness of the consent page).   CONCLUSIONS Our careful attention to both content and design of the consent page of GCO was highly valued by potential users of the service, and effective in disrupting routinization of consent on websites. We argue that principles of IC apply equally in online self-testing programs as in clinical practice, and can be effectively achieved without detracting from the user experience.

7b774cf36ee040d5157c224515a0356e31e5c3e8	affective natural language generation	affective natural language generation	The automatic generation of natural language messages (or NLG) has been employed in many computer systems and for various purposes, which go from providing information on a particular subject, to instructing on how to perform some -complexaction, to arguing about a particular claim (for an overview, see [24]). In the majority of systems that have been designed in the last decade, these messages are adapted, in their content and presentation style, to the context in which they have to be applied: that is, to the Hearer’s characteristics (represented in a “mental model” of the Hearer), to the application domain and, generally in a more implicit way, to the Speaker’s characteristics. Adaptation is based on “strong” assumptions about the Hearer’s mental state and the way this state is influenced by communication of each individual component of the message, and by understanding of the relationships among these components. The aspects of the mental state that are represented, in the large majority of cases, are the Hearers’ beliefs and knowledge of domain topics and their goals about the domain state; in some cases, this may extend to representing other aspects, such as the ability to perform domain actions, the interest towards topics, the preference towards domain states. When a Speaker’s model is represented as well, this includes second-order beliefs and goals of the same type. Generally seen as informative tools, these systems give little space to representation of less rational aspects, such as emotions, of both Speaker and Hearer. However, natural language communication is influenced by a number of factors, of which the more rational ones constitute only a subset. Especially when communication occurs in “delicate” scenarios, such as a medical setting, the Hearer cannot be expected to coolly react to what is being said. Many studies in the health behaviour research have shown that patients’ attention and understanding is highly affected by their emotional involvement [1,26]. It therefore appears worthwhile to investigate whether, when and how emotions, personalities and other extra-rational factors should be taken into account when designing a NLG tool. By paraphrasing Rose Picard [22], we define Affective Natural Language Generation as “NLG that relates to, arises from or deliberately influences emotions or other non-strictly rational aspects of the Hearer”: these aspects (denoted with the generic term of “attitudes”) include personality traits, emotions and highly-placed values. We argue for the need for affective NLG by considering	application domain;information;mental model;mental state;musicbrainz picard;natural language generation	Fiorella de Rosis;Floriana Grasso	1999		10.1007/10720296_15	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	NLP	-47.58295892064859	-59.8963717925138	29139

They have been extended to represent temporal constraints such as """"patients with the same symptoms and the same administered therapies, receive in the next period the same therapies"""". These constraints are called temporal functional dependencies (TFD). Another extension for FDs allows one to represent approximate functional dependencies (AFDs), as """"patients with the same symptoms generally get the same therapy"""". It enables data to deviate from the defined constraints according to a user-defined percentage. By merging the concepts of temporal functional dependency and of approximate functional dependency, we obtain the concept of approximate temporal functional dependency (ATFD). Mining ATFDs from large databases may be an hard job from the computational point of view. Moreover, convenient and meaningful representations of mined results are needed for conveying knowledge to domain experts. In this paper, we propose a framework for mining complex ATFDs and a way to represent data satisfying such ATFDs, which is informative as well as human-readable. Within the framework, we designed and applied sound and advanced model-checking techniques. For proving the feasibility of our proposal, we used real world databases from two medical domains (namely, psychiatry and pharmacovigilance) and tested the running prototype we developed on such databases."""	approximation algorithm;computation;functional dependency;functional derivative;human-readable medium;information;mined;model checking;prototype;relational database	Pietro Sala;Carlo Combi;Matteo Cuccato;Andrea Galvani;Alberto Sabaini	2015	2015 International Conference on Healthcare Informatics	10.1109/ICHI.2015.42	dependency theory;computer science;data science;data mining;database	DB	-52.277103090360576	-67.71684730234811	29141

To support the development of clinical trial management systems for such trials, a community-based primary care research information model is needed. We analyzed the requirements of trials in this environment, and constructed an information model to drive development of systems supporting trial design, execution, and analysis. We anticipate that this model will contribute to a deeper understanding of all the dimensions of clinical research and that it will be integrated with other clinical research modeling efforts, such as the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model, to complement and expand on current domain models.   DESIGN We used unified modeling language modeling to develop use cases, activity diagrams, and a class (object) model to capture components of research in this setting. The initial primary care research object model (PCROM) scope was the performance of a randomized clinical trial (RCT). It was validated by domain experts worldwide, and underwent a detailed comparison with the BRIDG clinical research reference model.   RESULTS We present a class diagram and associated definitions that capture the components of a primary care RCT. Forty-five percent of PCROM objects were mapped to BRIDG, 37% differed in class and/or subclass assignment, and 18% did not map.   CONCLUSION The PCROM represents an important link between existing research reference models and the real-world design and implementation of systems for managing practice-based primary care clinical trials. Although the high degree of correspondence between PCROM and existing research reference models provides evidence for validity and comprehensiveness, existing models require object extensions and modifications to serve primary care research.	activity diagram;chronic disease;class diagram;clinical trials, randomized;complement system proteins;computable function;dimensions;information model;language model;object-relational database;primary health care;randomized algorithm;reference model;requirement;unified modeling language;subclass	Stuart M.

A significant element of these fiscal datasets are code lists, which serve not only for the coding and the simplicity of representation of budget concepts, but can also act as linking entities between budget datasets of different countries, bodies, years and structure, in order to facilitate their comparison. To this end, we made an extensive survey of code lists that refer or are related to fiscal or other concepts that are included in budget datasets, recording totally 239 international and national classifications. We selected some of these classifications to represent them semantically with SKOS and then we examined their linking possibilities. While manual and automated methods are insufficient for linking large code lists, tools using semi-automated methods, like Alignment seem to be more suitable for this specific task.	entity;optimal computing budget allocation;qr code;semiconductor industry;simple knowledge organization system;universal remote;vii	Panagiotis-Marios Filippidis;Sotirios Karampatakis;Kleanthis Koupidis;Lazaros Ioannidis;Charalampos Bratsas	2016	2016 11th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMAP)	10.1109/SMAP.2016.7753404	computer science;data science;data mining;management science	DB	-35.98349382233217	-72.39880710013654	29470

In particular, we examine the social goals of being collegial and being adversarial. Through our early experimentation, we found that speech and dialogue acts are not able to capture the complexities and nuances of the social intentions of discourse participants. Therefore, we introduce a set of 9 social acts specifically designed to capture intentions related to being collegial and being adversarial. Social acts are pragmatic speech acts that signal a dialogue participant’s social intentions. We annotate social acts in discourses communicated in English and Chinese taken from Wikipedia talk pages, public forums, and chat transcripts. Our results show that social acts can be reliably understood by annotators with a good level of inter-rater agreement.	adversary (cryptography);inter-rater reliability;mediawiki;social media;speech corpus;text corpus;wikipedia	David B.

Recently, the promising Michon model was extended, leading to the widely used GADGET matrix. Nevertheless, the correlation of such models to actual road accidents and their causes has so far been weak. In addition, the use of those models for predicting driver behavioural adaptation has not proven feasible. This paper introduces a new concept for modelling driver's performance, that of DRIVABILITY. DRIVABILITY is defined as a combination of permanent and temporary factors that affect a driver's performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a DRIVABILITY index and a methodology to measure it, in order to move from over-simplistic, hierarchical modelling to a multi-dimensional sphere. The usability of the newly proposed concept is shown through its application in three different example cases, including a system monitoring driver hypovigilance, a system for driver basic training, and an elderly driver's assessment scheme.	functional programming;system monitoring;taxonomy (general);usability	Evangelos Bekiaris;Angelos Amditis;Maria C.

Introduction of diversified medical information collection devices supported diversified number of medical information to be collected. However, such introduction has geometrically increased volume of medical information collected in comparison to previously. Therefore, difficulties are faced in managing and processing such information and information sharing among various medical information devices is becoming difficult as well. The study as a research on applied ontology for expressing medical knowledge wants to integrate logical and structural method of approaching of information and wants to effectively manage and provide information generated during medical diagnosis activities through information sharing among medical information devices. Especially, through integration with home healthcare system, the study wants to apply medical knowledge center, consultation center or home healthcare support system to provide technical medical terminologies that are used by doctors to clear up understanding to patients.	information system	Seoksoo Kim;Jaegu Song	2007	The 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Pervasive Computing (IPC 2007)	10.1109/IPC.2007.12	middleware;computer science;middleware;world wide web;computer security;computer network	AI	-55.73498485757644	-60.25500889431127	29923

In this paper, we focus on methods of evaluating digital Chinese fonts and their typeface characteristics to seek a good way to enhance the character recognition rate. To accomplish this, we combined psychological analysis methods with statistical analysis. It involved an extensive survey of distinctive features of eighteen popular digital typefaces. Survey results were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Then another objective experiment was conducted using the best six fonts derived from the survey results. These experimental results reveal an effective way of choosing legible digital fonts most suitable for comfortable reading of books, magazines, newspapers, and for display of texts on cell-phones, e-books, and digital libraries, and finding out the features for improving character legibility of different Chinese typefaces. The relationships among legibility, eye-strain, and myopia, will be discussed.	book;digital library;e-book;library (computing);optical character recognition	Bing Zhang;Ying Li;Ching Y.

Wireless sensor networks have a great potential for the development of tools, such as serious games, that encourage acquiring good energy and healthy habits among users in the workplace. This paper presents the development of a serious game using CAFCLA, a framework that allows for integrating multiple technologies, which provide both context-awareness and social computing. Game development has shown that the data provided by sensor networks encourage users to reduce energy consumption in their workplace and that social interactions and competitiveness allow for accelerating the achievement of good results and behavioral changes that favor energy savings.	behavioral change;behaviorial habits;computation (action);context awareness;departure - action;human–computer interaction;information privacy;internet;laboratory;light;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;promotion (action);protocols documentation;real-time clock;real-time locating system;requirement;social computing;social network;solutions;user interface;sensor (device)	Óscar García;Ricardo S.

Using scenario-based testing with think-aloud protocols, we evaluated the usability of portals for parents of children with cystic fibrosis, diabetes or arthritis. DESIGN Sixteen parents used a prototype and test data to complete 14 tasks followed by a validated satisfaction questionnaire. Three iterations of the prototype were used.   MEASUREMENTS During the usability testing, we measured the time it took participants to complete or give up on each task. Sessions were videotaped and content-analyzed for common themes. Following testing, participants completed the Computer Usability Satisfaction Questionnaire which measured their opinions on the efficiency of the system, its ease of use, and the likeability of the system interface. A 7-point Likert scale was used, with seven indicating the highest possible satisfaction.   RESULTS Mean task completion times ranged from 73 (+/- 61) seconds to locate a document to 431 (+/- 286) seconds to graph laboratory results. Tasks such as graphing, location of data, requesting access, and data interpretation were challenging. Satisfaction was greatest for interface pleasantness (5.9 +/- 0.7) and likeability (5.8 +/- 0.6) and lowest for error messages (2.3 +/- 1.2) and clarity of information (4.2 +/- 1.4). Overall mean satisfaction scores improved between iteration one and three.   CONCLUSIONS Despite parental involvement and prior heuristic testing, scenario-based testing demonstrated difficulties in navigation, medical language complexity, error recovery, and provider-based organizational schema. While such usability testing can be expensive, the current study demonstrates that it can assist in making healthcare system interfaces for laypersons more user-friendly and potentially more functional for patients and their families.	chronic disease;cystic fibrosis;error message;heuristic;interface device component;iteration;patients;portals;protocols documentation;prototype;test data;theme (computing);think aloud protocol;usability testing	Maria T.

The design of the system under study was based on an integration of hypertext and rule-based systems. World-Wide Web technology was used for the implementation of the system. By using grounded theory and stimulated recall, we found that getting patient-specific support and continuing medical education were the two major usages of the system and that the three parameters relevance, validity, and work were important in describing how the system was experienced by the users.	cns disorder;decision support system;education, medical;education, medical, continuing;hypertext;patients;relevance;rule-based system;world wide web;biopsychosocial aod use disorder theory	Daniel Karlsson;Christer Ekdahl;Ove Wigertz;Urban Forsum	1997	Proceedings : a conference of the American Medical Informatics Association.

Current models are unsustainable, in particular due to the ageing demographic shift. To date, LAMP has created a database of almost 3,400 `assets' from part (22km2) of the ambulance catchment of the largest acute hospital in Ireland - an area representing ~120,000 citizens. A clinical software GUI called `Community Health Compass' is presented in this paper which uses this database and could potentially produce `social prescriptions' to patients coming to the hospital. This prescription would direct them to the assets and services in their community, near their postal address, and tailored to their condition and preferences, which could help to improve their health and wellbeing. However, there are a number of social implications and challenges associated with technology-mediated social prescribing, which will need to be considered to ensure the success and uptake of the intervention, while preserving personal choice and ensuring social responsibility. Data sharing, governance, accountability for patients, and community sector capacity are some of the main challenges for implementation of the LAMP model. These challenges and potential approaches to meeting them are presented. Forecasting these challenges is an attempt to proactively explore the issues, so as to develop a future technology-mediated social prescription delivery model that integrates with, and provides for, society's needs while reducing potential negative affects.	futures studies;graphical user interface;postal;social engineering (security)	Christopher J.

The tool provides tailored feedback on behavioral risk, readiness and confidence in an effort to empower patients to make decisions about improving health behaviors. In turn, the tool will facilitate an informed and balanced discussion between patients and their providers about behavioral changes, incorporating both the clinical view and the individual's preferences for choosing among multiple behavior change goals based on their psychosocial characteristics, and evaluation of benefits and barriers.	abnormal behavior;cardiovascular diseases;choose (action);chronic disease;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;electronic health record system;health behavior;informatics (discipline);multi-level cell;patients;thin layer chromatography;benefit	Jianhua Li;Sharib A.

We describe ANSIBLE --- A Network of Social Interactions for Bilateral Life Enhancement. ANSIBLE is a virtual world ecosystem that implements evidence based strategies to promote social connectedness and psychological well-being, while being extendable and able to accommodate technical and environmental limitations of long duration flight. ANSIBLE was deployed in a twelve month isolation study to evaluate its capacity to maintain the social connection between participants in an isolated Mars simulation analog environment and their friends and family (FF) living outside the habitat. The Mars simulation exercise takes place at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) facilities in Waimea, HI, where subjects undergo adjustments in physiology and lifestyle that are analogous to some of the challenges in a confined environment, with Mars exploration conditions (e.g. with communication latencies and blackouts, in close quarters, under restricted water and energy use). We present preliminary results suggesting that ANSIBLE can increase feelings of closeness as well as satisfaction with FF relationships over traditional methods, as well as promoting continued interactions of FF with crew members, closeness to humanity, decreased stress, and the perception that time is moving fast.	ansible;centrality;ecosystem;extensibility;habitat;interaction;simulation;virtual world	Peggy Wu;Tammy Ott;Jacki Morie	2016		10.1145/2927929.2927933	simulation;engineering;communication;social psychology	Metrics	-55.92098239192843	-52.51066388562164	30716

This paper, presents improvements to document summarization by analyzing the sentence position and recommendations of sentences from other sentences for making an efficient document summarizer. As we know humans are good in summarizing the contents, we have made few studies to improve the efficiency of our system much closer to user selection (manual summaries). This article focuses only on providing improvements for news articles. We have attempted to obtain summaries much closer or equal to manually generated summaries and the results obtained were promising. We also, show that term frequency approach combined with position weight gives better results, while adding node weight with the above feature yield results that were significantly better than the former approach. The paper also, illustrates some studies on some common evaluation criterion to generate a unique summary by various users. The results were also, compared with commercially existing Microsoft summarizer.

An experiment is reported in which detailed logging of use of experimental information systems was used to determine the optimal configuration of the systems for each user. Tasks were varied, and the cognitive abilities of users were tested to assess one important personal characteristic. The results showed that it was possible to create an optimal configuration to match the cognitive abilities of users, but that it was more difficult to assess which configuration was the best match for specific tasks. The person‐in‐task interaction proved to be the least powerful indicator of design configurations. These results suggest that usable information systems can be created for users by careful analysis of the interaction of design features wit...	information system	Bryce Allen	1998	Online Information Review	10.1108/eb024663	simulation;human–computer interaction;multimedia;world wide web;information system;statistics	HCI	-44.8496195735087	-56.016086266092664	31005
bd84b897a32e9b80a008cac6a91d750f6fcf750c	residents' numeric inputting error in computerized physician order entry prescription	numeric inputting;computerized physician order entry;prescription error	BACKGROUND Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system with embedded clinical decision support (CDS) can significantly reduce certain types of prescription error. However, prescription errors still occur. Various factors such as the numeric inputting methods in human computer interaction (HCI) produce different error rates and types, but has received relatively little attention.   OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine the effects of numeric inputting methods and urgency levels on numeric inputting errors of prescription, as well as categorize the types of errors.   METHODS Thirty residents participated in four prescribing tasks in which two factors were manipulated: numeric inputting methods (numeric row in the main keyboard vs. numeric keypad) and urgency levels (urgent situation vs. non-urgent situation). Multiple aspects of participants' prescribing behavior were measured in sober prescribing situations.   RESULTS The results revealed that in urgent situations, participants were prone to make mistakes when using the numeric row in the main keyboard. With control of performance in the sober prescribing situation, the effects of the input methods disappeared, and urgency was found to play a significant role in the generalized linear model. Most errors were either omission or substitution types, but the proportion of transposition and intrusion error types were significantly higher than that of the previous research. Among numbers 3, 8, and 9, which were the less common digits used in prescription, the error rate was higher, which was a great risk to patient safety.   CONCLUSIONS Urgency played a more important role in CPOE numeric typing error-making than typing skills and typing habits. It was recommended that inputting with the numeric keypad had lower error rates in urgent situation. An alternative design could consider increasing the sensitivity of the keys with lower frequency of occurrence and decimals. To improve the usability of CPOE, numeric keyboard design and error detection could benefit from spatial incidence of errors found in this study.	behaviorial habits;bit error rate;categorization;clinical decision support system;computerized physician order entry system;dental intrusion;digit structure;embedded system;error detection and correction;generalized linear model;human computer;human–computer interaction;incidence matrix;input method;insurance, physician services;keypad device component;numbers;order management system;usability;keyboard	Xue Wu;Changxu Wu;Kan Zhang;Dong Wei	2016	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.01.002	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining	HCI	-59.82296911848148	-68.70202342202053	31027
fb9080be3acdc6af661f11e2ecfe654c5f97bd7b	the impact of anticipatory patient data displays on physician decision making: a pilot study		Computerized patient records have long offered the promise of facilitated access to patient data for clinical decision-making. Nonetheless, the decision process benefits of improved patient data access have been poorly quantified by prior informatics research. We conducted a pilot study to test the feasibility of study methods and gather data for the planning of a future clinical trial designed to assess the impact of patient data summary displays on serum lipid test interpretation time, on targeted data retrieval time for related data, and on decision quality. The pilot demonstrated feasibility and high face validity of the decision-making simulation methods used. Problem-focused patient data summaries appear to reduce time-based decision performance measures by 40-50%, and may improve decision quality even without the inclusion of knowledge-based recommendations or guideline representations.	am broadcasting;cholesterol;data access;data retrieval;decision making;decision quality;exptime;experiment;expert systems;expert system;informatics (discipline);information systems;information system;jama (numerical linear algebra library);kahn process networks;knowledge engineering;knowledge-based systems;medical records;mg (editor);nicklas nygren;non-standard raid levels;patients;primary health care;rem sleep behavior disorder;retinoblastoma;simulation;stevens-johnson syndrome;take command;writing commons;xojo;benefit	Robert B.

Materials and Methods We identified EHR-based diabetes phenotype definitions that were developed for various purposes by a variety of users, including academic medical centers, Medicare, the New York City Health Department, and pharmacy benefit managers. We applied these definitions to a sample of 173 503 patients with records in the Duke Health System Enterprise Data Warehouse and at least 1 visit over a 5-year period (2007-2011). Of these patients, 22 679 (13%) met the criteria of 1 or more of the selected diabetes phenotype definitions. A statistically balanced sample of these patients was selected for chart review by clinical experts to determine the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes in the sample.   Results The sensitivity (62-94%) and specificity (95-99%) of EHR-based type 2 diabetes phenotypes (compared with the gold standard ADA criteria via chart review) varied depending on the component criteria and timing of observations and measurements.   Discussion and Conclusions Researchers using EHR-based phenotype definitions should clearly specify the characteristics that comprise the definition, variations of ADA criteria, and how different phenotype definitions and components impact the patient populations retrieved and the intended application. Careful attention to phenotype definitions is critical if the promise of leveraging EHR data to improve individual and population health is to be fulfilled.		Susan E.

Different research goals suggest different research approaches, ranging from field studies to lab studies to online experimentation. This tutorial will provide an overview of the different types of research goals, common evaluation approaches used to address each type, and the constraints each approach entails. Participants will come away with a broad perspective of research goals and approaches in IR, and an understanding of the benefits and limitations of these research approaches. The tutorial will take place in two independent, but interrelated parts, each focusing on a unique set of research approaches but with the same intended tutorial outcomes. These outcomes will be accomplished by deconstructing and analyzing our own published research papers, with further illustrations of each technique using the broader literature. By using our own research as anchors, we will provide insight about the research process, revealing the difficult choices and trade-offs researchers make when designing and conducting IR studies.	experiment;html element;information retrieval	Diane Kelly;Filip Radlinski;Jaime Teevan	2014		10.1145/2600428.2602290		HCI	-40.182628651605135	-55.95181279985564	31243

[13]. Over the years, a number of alternative approaches have been proposed, all of which have been evaluated on early TREC test collections. In this work, we perform a wider analysis of system ranking estimation methods on sixteen TREC data sets which cover more tasks and corpora than previously. Our analysis reveals that the performance of system ranking estimation approaches varies across topics. This observation motivates the hypothesis that the performance of such methods can be improved by selecting the “right” subset of topics from a topic set. We show that using topic subsets improves the performance of automatic system ranking methods by 26% on average, with a maximum of 60%. We also observe that the commonly experienced problem of underestimating the performance of the best systems is data set dependent and not inherent to system ranking estimation. These findings support the case for automatic system evaluation and motivate further research.	algorithm;experiment;relevance;text retrieval conference;text corpus	Claudia Hauff;Djoerd Hiemstra;Leif Azzopardi;Franciska de Jong	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12275-0_16	computer science;machine learning;data mining;ranking svm;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-37.81168344458163	-61.884265360200565	31404

With the increasing number of documents, it is becoming crucial to automate these processes. Clustering is a solution for organizing large amount of documents. In this article we propose a method of improving document retrieval that was implemented in RKB Knowledge Base. Our method heavily relies on linguistic analysis, which aims to identify document specific noun phrases. We apply an adjusted hierarchical clustering algorithm for learning clusters of documents.	algorithm;cluster analysis;document retrieval;hierarchical clustering;information system;knowledge base;organizing (structure);purity (quantum mechanics)	Mahmoud Gindiyeh;Gintare Grigonyte;Johann Haller;Algirdas Avizienis	2009			data mining;cluster analysis;computer science	ML	-33.901631756841596	-67.43170732284511	31478

They are an important part of the work force, highly experienced and often hard to replace. However, their productivity can be affected by health problems, such as lower back pain. This increases the cost for employers and reduces the quality of life of the office workers. Knowledge workers that spend a large part of their day in front of a screen are particularly affected by pack pain. Regular exercise can help to mitigate some of these issues. This training can be performed in microbreaks that are taken at regular intervals during the work day. In this work we present ExerSeat, a combination of a smart sensing chair that uses eight capacitive proximity sensors to precisely track the posture of persons on or near an office chair. It is augmented by a desktop training software that is able to track exercises and training units during microbreaks, by analyzing frequency and form. We have performed a pilot over eight weeks with ten office workers. They performed training units at regular intervals during their work day. We report on the findings.	human factors and ergonomics	Andreas Braun;Ingrid Schembri;Sebastian Frank	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-26005-1_16	computer science;simulation;software;human factors and ergonomics;office chair;back pain;proximity sensor	Robotics	-53.68678506153801	-56.34134976176787	31531

Cognitive theorists have speculated that these moments occur at subtask boundaries. In this article, we empirically test this speculation by examining how workload changes during execution of goal-directed tasks, focusing on regions between adjacent chunks within the tasks, that is, the subtask boundaries. In a controlled experiment, users performed several interactive tasks while their pupil dilation, a reliable measure of workload, was continuously measured using an eye tracking system. The workload data was extracted from the pupil data, precisely aligned to the corresponding task models, and analyzed. Our principal findings include (i) workload changes throughout the execution of goal-directed tasks; (ii) workload exhibits transient decreases at subtask boundaries relative to the preceding subtasks; (iii) the amount of decrease tends to be greater at boundaries corresponding to the completion of larger chunks of the task; and (iv) different types of subtasks induce different amounts of workload. We situate these findings within resource theories of attention and discuss important implications for interruption management systems.	cognitive tutor;dilation (morphology);eye tracking;interrupt;theory;tracking system	Brian P.

Letter repetitions are unique CMC cues in that they appear to be a written emulation of a spoken paralinguistic cue – phoneme extension. In this study we explore letter repetitions as a CMC cue, with specific emphasis on elucidating the link between them and spoken nonverbal cues. The letter repetitions are studied in the Enron Corpus, a large ecologically valid collection ( 500,000) of e-mail messages sent by and to employees of the Enron Corporation. We conclude that letter repetitions in the corpus often, but not always, emulate spoken nonverbal cues. This conclusion is examined in a longitudinal analysis that demonstrates the dynamic nature of this cue, and suggests that the usage of letter repetitions is increasing over time, while the link to spoken language is	amanda;computer-mediated communication;ecology;email;emoticon;emulator;enron corpus;personalization;sentiment analysis	Yoram M.

We propose such a semantic indexing method, by combining handwritten word recognition with information retrieval techniques. We first present a novel handwritten word segmentation and recognition approach for instructional videos. Then we construct a table-of-contents (TOC) structure from course materials. We use word recognition results to query the TOC, implemented as matrix operations, and spot the most likely discussed chapters and topic words for each video.

Computer-aided education has recently been considered as a likely intervention method for such cases, and therefore different systems have been proposed and developed worldwide. In more recent years, affective computing applications for the aforementioned interventions have also been proposed to shed light on this problem. In this paper, we examine the technological and educational needs of affective interventions for autistic persons. Enabling affective technologies are visited and a number of possible exploitation scenarios are illustrated. Emphasis is placed in covering the continuous and long term needs of those persons by unobtrusive and ubiquitous technologies with the engagement of an affective speaking avatar. A personalised prototype system facilitating these scenaria is described. Last but not least, we examine the feedback educators for autistic persons provide for the system in terms of its usefulness, efficiency and the envisaged reaction of the autistic persons, which has been collected by means of an anonymous questionnaire.

The success of the DICOM open standard cannot be overstated in its ability to enable an explosion of innovation in the best of breed picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) industry. At the heart of the success of allowing interoperability between disparate systems have been three fundamental DICOM operations: C-MOVE, C-FIND, and C-STORE. DICOM C-MOVE oversees the transfer of DICOM Objects between two systems using C-STORE. DICOM C-FIND negotiates the ability to discover DICOM objects on another node. This paper will discuss the efforts within the DICOM standard to adapt this core functionality to Internet standards. These newer DICOM standards look to address the next generation of PACS challenges including highly distributed mobile acquisition systems and viewing platforms.	anatomic node;archive;c-store;calculi;dicom;entity name part qualifier - adopted;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;health information systems;information system;interoperability;medical records;medical imaging;next-generation network;picture archiving and communication systems;picture archiving and communication system;radiology information systems;stepping level;web application;web service;standards characteristics	Paul Lipton;Paul G.

There is a great need for ways to organize and present views of clinical data that could satisfy physicians' information needs without overwhelming them with extraneous information. We carried out a study on the information needs of physicians during patient care to determine the types of views may best meet their needs. In the study physician information needs in inpatient and outpatient settings were observed and classified. Our study showed that each type of view (time-, concept-, and sourceoriented) is appropriate for certain situations, although there may not always be an advantage of one view ove another in some situations. The findings confirmed our supposition that physicians need different types of views.		Qing Zeng-Treitler;James J.

Especially, in the area o f telehealthcare, it is necessary to share distributed medical information to make medical decisions because it is not easy to make a decision without any face-to-face contact between patients and doctors. Occasionally, medical teams often need to share medical information with far-off clinicians to care patients much more. For such a reason, it is sufficient to develop HSKM for healthcare systems. The developed HSKM is applied to make a medical decision for patients, which is based on Health Service Ontology and Case-based reasoning (CBR). Health Service Ontology is based on medical information like symptoms, diseases, departments and doctors knowledge. Medical records are stored as cases in knowledge-base. The cases are applied to find appropriate medical cases in the medical group decision making using CBR. To extract a medical decision, patients and doctors' interactive contexts are considered during the making a medical decision. The contexts are operated as constraints to reach the medical goal using Constraints Satisfaction Problem (CSP). We used an example to discuss the necessity of the proposed HSKM and we expect the implementation and verification of the superiority o f the system in further research.	case-based reasoning;interactivity;knowledge management	Hyun Jung Lee;Mye M.

A framework is presented that organizes the various facets of boredom, particularly in supervisory control settings, and research gaps and future potential areas for study are highlighted.   BACKGROUND Given the ubiquity of boredom across a wide spectrum of work environments--exacerbated by increasingly automated systems that remove humans from direct, physical system interaction and possibly increasing tedium in the workplace--there is a need not only to better understand the multiple facets of boredom in work environments but to develop targeted mitigation strategies.   METHOD To better understand the relationships between the various influences and outcomes of boredom, a systems-based framework, called the Boredom Influence Diagram, is proposed that describes various elements of boredom and their interrelationships.   RESULTS Boredom is closely related to vigilance, attention management, and task performance. This review highlights the need to develop more naturalistic experiments that reflect the characteristics of a boring work environment.   CONCLUSION With the increase in automation, boredom in the workplace will likely become a more prevalent issue for motivation and retention. In addition, developing continuous measures of boredom based on physiological signals is critical.   APPLICATION Personnel selection and improvements in system and task design can potentially mitigate boredom. However, more work is needed to develop and evaluate other potential interventions.	boredom;experiment;influence diagram;objective-c;personnel selection;structure of articular surface of bone	Mary L.

However, there are several challenges which certainly affected the benefits expected from standard order sets. To boost standard order sets utilization, a problem-oriented knowledge delivery solution was proposed in this study to facilitate access of standard order sets and evaluation of its treatment effect. In this solution, standard order sets were created along with diagnostic rule sets which can trigger a CDS-based reminder to help clinician quickly discovery hidden clinical problems and corresponding standard order sets during ordering. Those rule set also provide indicators for targeted evaluation of standard order sets during treatment. A prototype system was developed based on this solution and will be presented at Medinfo 2013.

5ec03df896cc5c147eacc68a5b33646ba9bfd680	a high-speed large-capacity dictionary system	high speed	This paper describes a method of adapting dictionaries for use by a computer in such a way that comprehensiveness of vocabulary coverage can be maximized while look-up time is minimized. Although the programming of the system has not yet been completed, it is estimated at the time of writing that it will allow for a dictionary of 20,000 entries or more, with a total look-up time of about 8 milliseconds (.008 seconds) per word, when used on an IBM 704 computer with 32,000 words of core storage. With a proper system of segmentation, a dictionary of 20,000 entries can handle several hundred thousand different words, thus providing ample coverage for a single fairly broad field of science. Although the system has been designed specifically for purposes of machine translation of Russian, it is applicable to other areas of linguistic data processing in which dictionaries are needed.	core storage;dictionary;lookup table;machine translation;uptime;vocabulary	Sydney M.

Patent documents are typically written with specific terminologies which often require the expertise of domain experts to interpret and organize for patent analysis. The rapid growth of number of patents applications and registry increases the difficulty in extracting and synthesizing knowledge from patents. The aim of this paper is to construct a framework of expressing and extracting accurate knowledge from patent documents that are related to dental implant connections. First, domain related patents are collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Text mining techniques are used to analyze the key words in the sample set of patents. An ontology is created to express the domain knowledge by using a new ontology engineering technique. In recent years, the aging population has increased the demand for new products and innovations in the dental implant industry. Dental implants are a global, medically accepted treatment used to restore the human masticatory function. The patents collected in the domain of implant connections are used to test the validity and reliability of the ontology development framework. The study of patents related to dental implant connections is considered a critical part of advancing dental implant devices since these designs and innovations are subjected to extensive clinical trials. Given an accurate ontology schema, dental researchers correlate successful prior art designs to successful clinical trials to better understand the interaction between a new artificial body part and the response of the surgical implantation. The value of a patent increases dramatically if the device can be safely used by dentists to treat patients with fewer failures and longer utility.	cochlear implant;ion implantation;microchip implant (human);ontology engineering;retinal implant;text mining	Amy J.

This study was designed to develop methods for evaluating the gaze behaviors of spotters during air-to-ground search and to compare field derived measures with similar lab measures reported in the literature. A secondary aim was to assess adherence to a prescribed scan path, evaluate search effectiveness, and determine the predictors of task success. Eye movements were measured in 10 volunteer spotters while searching from the air for ground targets. Static visual acuity at several eccentricities and contrast levels and performance on a lab-based search performance were also measured. Gaze relative to the head was transformed to gaze relative to the ground using information from the scene. Coverage and task success were similar to literature values from a lab-based study of air-to-ground search. Air search task success could be predicted best from a combination of gaze and laboratory variables and, like previous lab-based research, experience was not one of them. Results from this field study provide some support for the generalizability of lab research. In both lab and field research performance is quite poor. Future improvements in air search and rescue success will depend upon improvements in training, the refinement of scan tactics, changes to the task methods or environment, or modifications to parameters of the search exercise.	code coverage;field research;refinement (computing);volunteer computing	James L.

Meanwhile, multitasking while viewing television is also at a peak stage. The present study examined enjoyment and signal detection memory outcomes in single-task and multitasking experimental conditions, where the primary task was watching positive, negative, and neutral television content, and the dual task condition permitted participants to go online on a second screen. Results demonstrate that multitasking viewing situations had negative effects on enjoyment and memory for non-emotional messages, but largely no effect when the primary task was viewing emotional messages. Specifically, multitasking was related to less enjoyment of neutral messages, lower recognition memory performance and sensitivity, and a more conservative criterion bias. The necessity of including the emotional content of messages as a variable when exploring memory and enjoyment in media multitasking situations is discussed.	computer multitasking	Bridget Rubenking	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.015	psychology;emotion;human multitasking;multimedia;memory;communication;social psychology	HCI	-50.99626245936578	-54.28924286777833	33034

DESIGN We conducted a series of focus groups involving both ED and EMS team members using a crisis scenario as the basis of the focus group discussion. We also collected organizational workflow data.   RESULTS We identified three major challenges to coordination between ED and EMS teams including ineffectiveness of current information and communication technologies, lack of common ground, and breakdowns in information flow.   DISCUSSION The three challenges highlight the importance of designing systems from socio-technical perspective. In particular, these inter-team coordination systems must support socio-technical issues such as awareness, context, and workflow between the two teams.	accident and emergency department;awareness;emergency medical service;erectile dysfunction;focus group;information flow (information theory);objective-c;sociotechnical system;teams	Madhu C.

With the advent of haptics and its integration into virtual assembly systems, users now have the potential advantage of tactile information. This paper reports research that aims to quantify how the provision of haptic feedback in an assembly system can affect user performance. To investigate human–computer interaction processes in assembly modeling, performance of a peg-in-hole manipulation was studied to determine the extent to which haptics and stereovision may impact on task completion time. The results support two important conclusions: first, it is apparent that small (i.e. visually insignificant) assembly features (e.g. chamfers) affect the overall task completion at times only when haptic feedback is provided; and second, that the difference is approximately similar to the values reported for equivalent real world peg-in-hole assembly tasks.	assembly language;assembly modelling;attachments;chamfer;collision detection;experiment;haptic technology;human–computer interaction;interactivity;mit engineering systems division;memory management;performance;product engineering;relative change and difference;scalability;stereopsis;synchronization (computer science);the coroner's toolkit;virtual engineering;virtual reality	Theodore Lim;James M.

Two key factors limit the effectiveness of physiotherapy:  low compliance of patients with repetitive movement exercises, and inadequate awareness of patients of their own posture.  The Backtrainer system addresses these problems by real-time monitoring of the spine position, by providing a framework for  most common physiotherapy exercises for the low back, and by providing feedback to patients in a motivating way. A minimal  sensor configuration was identified as two inertial sensors that measure the orientation of the lower back at two points with  three degrees of freedom. The software was designed as a flexible platform to experiment with different hardware, and with  various feedback modalities. Basic exercises for two types of movements are provided: mobilizing and stabilizing. We developed  visual feedback - abstract as well as in the form of a virtual reality game - and complemented the on-screen graphics with  an ambient feedback device. The system was evaluated during five weeks in a rehabilitation clinic with 26 patients and 15  physiotherapists. Subjective satisfaction of subjects was good, and we interpret the results as encouraging indication for  the adoption of such a therapy support system by both patients and therapists.

It calls for a “learning health system designed to generate and apply the best evidence for the collaborative healthcare choices of each patient and provider; to drive the process of discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care; and to ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care” [Smith et al. 2013]. A learning health system would thus continously improve based on the long recognized, but so far largely unmet, goal to use wide and deep “big data” from generally deployed electronic record systems with “the potential to transform medical practice by using information generated every day to improve the quality and efficiency of care” [Murdoch and Detsky 2013]. Progress toward a learning health system has long been impeded by three major challenges: low adoption of electronic records, the lack of interoperability among clinical information systems, and effective platforms to analyze and visualize large-scale digital health data. After decades of scant progress, recent federal programs have spurred electronic health record (EHR) adoption to levels over 90% for hospitals and approaching 70% for community-based providers.1 Advanced imaging technologies and genomics are an emerging part of medical practice and contribute additional, important, but very large, new data.

This research study investigated whether users’ level of domain knowledge influenced their decision to stop information searches. Stopping behavior was investigated using a convenience sample of 15 thirdand fourth-year undergraduate students at a large university. Subjects completed a series of self-assessments about background information and levels of knowledge regarding four search domains. Subjects completed search tasks in four search domains and task times were measured. Tasks were counterbalanced among subjects. Subjects completed questionnaires about search experiences and reasons for stopping and participated in exit interviews. The study results indicated: (1) No association between knowledge level and stopping behavior (task times); (2) Positive correlation between levels of domain knowledge and levels of domain interest; (3) Positive correlation between satisfaction with the search process and the retrieved results; and (4) Negative correlation between satisfaction with search results and task times.	experience;knowledge level;negative feedback	Maureen Dostert	2011		10.1002/meet.2011.14504801219	simulation;artificial intelligence;social psychology	AI	-36.26917883120285	-53.20337359556667	33668
3ffda1b976044847f8ca86171a52bb0937aea1a9	prediction of the time to pregnancy by kernel density estimation on lifestyle questionnaire		Current pregnancy measures can be classified into three types: natural pregnancy, artificial insemination, and in vitro fertilization. For those who are trying to get pregnanct, however, it is difficult to judge when they should switch from natural pregnancy to other methods because the factors that contribute to pregnancy are usually not clear. This paper presents a personalized method to estimate the time to pregnancy (TTP) for a natural conception by using kernel density estimation and k-nearest neighbor. Using this method, we can provide suggestions and a TTP estimation to guide decisions on which methods and actioins are suitable for those willing to conceive. In addition, we developed a user-friendly GUI system that can show the probability of the TTP and provide feedback through tips without requiring user expertise.	coefficient;graphical user interface;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;kernel density estimation;nearest neighbor search;personalization;radio frequency;trusted third party;usability;on-line system	Shunsuke Nakamura;Toshihiko Yamasaki;Kiyoharu Aizawa;Yusuke Ishikawa	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)	10.1109/ICCE.2018.8326140	computer vision;artificial insemination;feature extraction;computer science;kernel density estimation;pregnancy;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	Visualization	-42.76866622963143	-54.156796966617904	33675
3b5df43b838d17bc6968e078ac28e840898d2380	the origins of zipf's meaning-frequency law		In his pioneering research, G. K. Zipf observed that more frequent words tend to have more meanings, and showed that the number of meanings of a word grows as the square root of its frequency. He derived this relationship from two assumptions: that words follow Zipf’s law for word frequencies (a power law dependency between frequency and rank) and Zipf’s law of meaning distribution (a power law dependency between number of meanings and rank). Here we show that a single assumption on the joint probability of a word and a meaning suffices to infer Zipf’s meaningfrequency law or relaxed versions. Interestingly, this assumption can be justified as the outcome of a biased random walk in the process of mental exploration. Introduction G. K. Zipf (1949) investigated many statistical regularities of language. Some of them have been investigated intensively such as Zipf’s law for word frequencies (Fedorowicz, 1982; Ferrer-i-Cancho & Gavaldà, 2009; Font-Clos, Boleda, & Corral, 2013; Ferrer-i-Cancho, 2016a) or Zipf’s law of abbreviation (Strauss, Grzybek, & Altmann, 2006; Ferrer-i-Cancho et al., 2013). Some others, such as Zipf’s law of meaning distribution have received less attention. In his pioneering research, Zipf (1945) found that more frequent words tend to have more meanings. The functional dependency between μ, the number of meanings of a word, and f , the frequency of a word, has been approximated with (Ilgen & Karaoglan, 2007; Baayen & Moscoso del Prado Martín, 2005; Zipf, 1945) μ ∝ f , (1)	approximation algorithm;clos network;fitts's law;functional dependency;word lists by frequency;zipf's law	Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho;Michael S.

6525336073d893f40b0783179b8816874f2d4864	database query interface for medical information systems		With the development of multimedia technology, there is considerable interest from the medical profession in developing multimedia information systems which can be used to store patient records which include the full set of patient information. In order to use such systems one needs powerful but simple user-friendly interfaces. MIDWIFE (Multi-media Information Database With Intelligent Front End) has been designed to meet these requirements. The basic concepts and model for interaction are described. The use of a hypertext-like approach is an important element in this. The use of browse mode for inspecting results fits well with this notion and is important for a medical information system.	information system	M. Howard Williams;G.

2ae10fbffcc45cd95e92cf55146c2594ed76f46b	a tool for managing elderly volunteering activities in small organizations		This paper describes a pilot application developed by the authors within a project in the area of elders assistance. Specifically, the work addresses the problem of assigning scheduled activities to a set of volunteers by means of an interactive tool that considers both users’ needs/preferences and constraints posed by the organization that manages the volunteers. Particular emphasis is given to the problem of assigning a group of seniors to the “right task” so as to obtain a positive outcome of the services offered by the volunteering association while maximizing the volunteers’ level of satisfaction perceived, in this domain, as a relevant requirement. This paper describes the design of a complete application for supporting this process focusing, in particular, on the back-end functionalities where a formalization as a generic optimization problem and a heuristic, developed to serve the time constants required in the domain, have been integrated. Experimental results, conducted with realistic data, support the particular design of the solution and encourage future work.

In a 2 (Structure) × 2 (Story) × 2 (Sex) mixed design, participants read two inverted pyramid and two chronological news stories, each on a different topic. Dependent measures included secondary task reaction times (STRTs), cued recall, recognition accuracy, and text comprehension. Women had slower reaction times than men across stories, but a significant interaction showed their use of cognitive resources was less affected by variations in story structure. These results are discussed in the context of a comprehensibility interpretation of the STRT measure. The findings suggest that the common use of the inverted pyramid structure, which has been criticized as difficult to comprehend, may not explain the decrease in female news readers.		Miglena M.

The telecare service was intended to prevent exasperations in patients and employed a digital self-report application for remote monitoring of patients' health condition. Based on interviews conducted after a service trial of ten weeks, patient and provider-perceived benefits and concerns related to the service are described. Comparing the data from the two stakeholder groups, we highlight key tensions related to patient safety, what it constitutes as a value, and views on how it can be promoted or undermined through telecare. The way potential technology-embedded value biases can fuel patient-provider tensions are also discussed.  Our objective is to inform value-centered design of telecare technology and services by providing an in-depth empirical understanding of relevant value perspectives and tensions.	embedded system	Yngve Dahl;Jarl Reitan;Anita Das	2018		10.1145/3240167.3240168	human–computer interaction;telecare;norwegian;nursing;stakeholder;computer science;patient safety	HCI	-60.78955057713623	-60.23421962124181	33997

OBJECTIVE To describe the behaviors and attitudes of physicians who used EDECS.   DESIGN Pre-post questionnaires were used to assess physician attitudes. Time studies of the intervention phase were observational, using clocks embedded in the software.   PARTICIPANTS One hundred and forty two residents and interns in emergency, pediatric, internal, and family medicine and patients with the above-mentioned complaints.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Physician utilization of EDECS, time spent using EDECS, physician satisfaction and beliefs.   RESULTS Eighty four percent of the 142 eligible physicians used EDECS at least once. Five hundred and ninety one of 789 (75%) eligible cases were completed using EDECS. Median session time decreased from 12 min for session 1, to 5.5 min for sessions 16 and above. Physicians generally agreed that care with EDECS was better than standard care, particularly with respect to documentation. There was, however, considerable heterogeneity in belief among complaints.   CONCLUSIONS These data illuminate both the potentials of computer-assisted decision making and the need for context-specific approaches when attempting to implement guidelines.	attitude;behavior;body fluids;cns disorder;care-of address;decision making;documentation;electronic health records;electronics, medical;embedding;expert system;fever;liquid substance;low back pain;maxima and minima;medical records;ninety;occupational diseases;patients;real-time transcription	Vladislav J.

550d70d9c90615692734909ca6e01c5fed413a34	psychological paradox of game software trial		Abstract Game software trial versions, as the scaled-down versions of the software through imposing restrictions on functionality and/or usage of a grace period, are often given to users for free evaluation. Such a move is intended to encourage the eventual purchase of the full version software. Offering a trial version could psychologically influence an individual (i.e., arousing emotions as joy from playing the game), thereby heightening his or her willingness to pay (WTP) for the full version software, for which the individual’s fundamental nature of self-control might avert him or her from doing so — the psychological paradox. Considering that a game software trial version is usually restricted through the permitted grace period (time restriction) or the extent of functionality available for use (functionality restriction), this research examines the psychological effects of these two forms of trial restrictions on users by anchoring on the opponent-process theory. Results from an online study involving 128 users reveal that imposing functionality restriction could lead to strong negative consequences on users’ cognitive absorption but heighten users’ self-control outcomes. Interestingly, imposing time restriction does not have an observable effect on these two variables. These findings provide insightful theoretical and practical implications.

We present a critical analysis of evidence related to efficacy of stress management devices based on comprehensive literature review and information provided by the vendors. The analysis was conducted along four dimensions: metrics, theoretical frameworks, evaluation, and FDA clearance. The review resulted in identification of critical issues including limited information on operational characteristics, controversial theoretical underpinnings, and lack of systematic evaluation.

METHODS A biorepository of DNA and plasma was created by recruiting patients referred for non-invasive lower extremity arterial evaluation or stress ECG. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was defined as a resting/post-exercise ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than or equal to 0.9, a history of lower extremity revascularization, or having poorly compressible leg arteries. Controls were patients without evidence of PAD. Demographic data and laboratory values were extracted from the EMR. Medication use and smoking status were established by natural language processing of clinical notes. Other risk factors and comorbidities were ascertained based on ICD-9-CM codes, medication use and laboratory data.   RESULTS Of 1802 patients with an abnormal ABI, 115 had non-atherosclerotic vascular disease such as vasculitis, Buerger's disease, trauma and embolism (phenocopies) based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and were excluded. The PAD cases (66+/-11 years, 64% men) were older than controls (61+/-8 years, 60% men) but had similar geographical distribution and ethnic composition. Among PAD cases, 1444 (85.6%) had an abnormal ABI, 233 (13.8%) had poorly compressible arteries and 10 (0.6%) had a history of lower extremity revascularization. In a random sample of 95 cases and 100 controls, risk factors and comorbidities ascertained from EMR-based algorithms had good concordance compared with manual record review; the precision ranged from 67% to 100% and recall from 84% to 100%.   CONCLUSION This study demonstrates use of the EMR to ascertain phenocopies, phenotype heterogeneity and relevant covariates to enable a GWAS of PAD. Biorepositories linked to EMR may provide a relatively efficient means of conducting GWAS.	abnormal renal physiology;algorithm;ankle brachial pressure index (observable entity);application binary interface;arterial system;arteriopathic disease;atherosclerosis;behavior;biorepository;code;concordance (publishing);electronic health records;electronics, medical;embolism;excalibur: morgana's revenge;exclusion;extraction;genome-wide association study;icd-9-cm;informatics (discipline);limb structure;lower extremity;medical records;natural language processing;note (document);parkinson disease;patients;peripheral vascular diseases;plasma active;rest;smoke;software diagnosis;status epilepticus;vasculitis;wounds and injuries;revascularization	Iftikhar J.

TOAS, a software system, extracts useful information from literature abstract files, which have identified fields that repeat in each abstract record of specific databases, such as Engineering Index (ENGI), INSPEC, Business Index, U.S. Patents, and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) Research Reports. The TOAS applies various technologies, which include natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics (CL), fuzzy analysis, latent semantic indexing, and principle components analysis (PCA). This software system combines simple operations (i.e., listing, counting, list comparisons and sorting of search term retrieved consolidated records' field results) with complex matrix manipulations, statistical inference and artificial intelligence approaches to reveal patterns and provide insights from large amounts of information, primarily related to technology-oriented management issues. The authors apply the TOAS tool on its own root technologies, NLP and computational linguistics--two apparently synonymous terms. These terms, however, when used in a literature search of the same abstract databases, ENGI and INSPEC, provide distinctly different search results with only 10% to 25% search result abstract records overlap. This paper introduces TOAS, summarizes analyses comparing NLP and CL, and then discusses the underlying development implications.	computational linguistics;natural language processing	Robert J.

Although clinical laboratories reflect many aspects of traditional production systems, the medical profession is, as are most specialized areas of practice, much more willing to entertain analytical methods that describe their systems with domain-appropriate terminology and semantics. In this paper we discuss the development of a framework for creating domain-specific simulation objects for modeling clinical laboratories; we demonstrate their applicability in projects undertaken with the chemistry laboratory at Seattle Children's Hospital. The primary objective of our work is to improve the efficiency of building clinical laboratory discrete-event simulation models.	list of discrete event simulation software	Shuainan Hu;Joseph A.

501b3e074cff4b91444360e35572a1ac1a61129c	direct comparison of medcin® and snomed ct® for representation of a general medical evaluation template		BACKGROUND Two candidate terminologies to support entry of general medical data are SNOMED CT and MEDCIN. We compare the ability of SNOMED CT and MEDCIN to represent concepts and interface terms from a VA general medical examination template.   METHODS We parsed the VA general medical evaluation template and mapped the resulting expressions into SNOMED CT and MEDCIN. Internists conducted double independent reviews on 864 expressions. Exact concept level matches were used to evaluate reference coverage. Exact term level matches were required for interface terms.   RESULTS Sensitivity of SNOMED CT as a reference terminology was 83% vs. 25% for MEDCIN (p<0.001). The sensitivity of SNOMED CT as an interface terminology was 53% vs. 7% for MEDCIN (P< 0.001).   DISCUSSION The content coverage of SNOMED CT as a reference terminology and as an interface terminology outperformed MEDCIN. We did not evaluate other aspects of interface terminologies such as richness of clinical linkages.	application program interface;ct scan;clinical use template;medcin - codesystem;medical examination;pet/ct scan;parsing;review [publication type];systematized nomenclature of medicine	Steven H.

Mobilizing many of the great – and the not­so­great – philosophes of the 18th century, the Encyclopedie was a massive reference work for the arts and sciences, which sought to organize and transmit the totality of human knowledge while at the same time serving as a vehicle for critical thinking. In its digital form, it is a highly structured corpus; some 55,000 of its 77,000 articles were labeled with classes of knowledge by the editors making it a perfect sandbox for experiments with supervised learning algorithms. In this study, we train a Naive Bayesian classifier on the labeled articles and use this model to determine class membership for the remaining articles. This model is then used to make binary comparisons between labeled texts from different classes in an effort to extract the most important features in terms of class distinction. Re­applying the model onto the original classified articles leads us to question our previous assumptions about the consistency and coherency of the ontology developed by the Encyclopedists. Finally, by applying this model to another corpus from 18th century France, the Journal de Trevoux, or Memoires pour l'Histoire des Sciences & des Beaux­Arts, new light is shed on the domain of Literature as it was understood and defined by 18th century writers.	machine learning;ontology (information science)	Russell Horton;Robert Morrissey;Mark Olsen;Glenn Roe;Robert Voyer	2009	Digital Humanities Quarterly		humanities;digital humanities;history;philosophy;computer science;artificial intelligence;sociology;literature	AI	-37.18682269316366	-72.6767143672142	34890

Telemedicine is considered to be a tool that can address challenges such as staff shortage, funding limitations and limited access to services in rural areas. Hospice services via telemedicine can be delivered directly into a patient's home by utilizing videoconferencing technology. The Missouri Telehospice Project aims to investigate the impact of a telehospice model on satisfaction with delivered care, caregiver burden, crisis prevention rates and overall cost of delivered care. Five urban and rural hospice agencies in Missouri are participating. A needs assessment study was conducted where hospice staff members responded to a set of questions within focus group and interview sessions providing feedback about the design, type of technology, frequency of usage and perceived impact on quality of hospice care.	cost of illness;focus group;home care services;hospice care;needs assessment;palliative care;patients;telemedicine;television	Debra R.

It not only hosts and serves large amounts of pages but also offers large amounts of information potentially useful for individuals and businesses. Modern decision support can no more be effective without timely and accurate access to this unprecedented source of data. However, unlike in a database, the structure of data available on the Web is not known apriori and its understanding seems to require human intervention. Yet the conjunction of layout rules and simple domain knowledge enables in many cases the automatic understanding of such unstructured data. In such cases we say that data is semi-structured. Wrapper generation for automatic extraction of information from the Web has therefore been a crucial challenge in the recent years. Various authors have suggested different approaches for extracting semi-structured data from the Web, ranging from analyzing the layout and syntax of Web documents to learning extraction rules from user's training examples. In this paper, we propose to exploit the HTML structure of Web documents that contain information in the form of multiple homogeneous records. We use a Tree Alignment algorithm with a novel combination of heuristics to detect repeated patterns and infer extraction rules. The performance study shows that our approach is effective in practice, yielding practical performance and accurate results.	information extraction;web page	Ajay Hemnani;Stéphane Bressan	2002		10.1007/3-540-46146-9_78	semi-structured data;web modeling;the internet;html;decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;database;world wide web;information extraction;domain knowledge	NLP	-36.01407911693757	-60.03064348099488	35041

The distributed and heterogeneous nature of healthcare institutions results in disconnected information islands which hinder the treatment of patients. Better and user centred healthcare services require that the information islands are connected and medical professionals are able to view the treatment process as a whole. Healthcare record exchange standards help pulling together the data. The concepts of provenance and process documentation help to analyse the way results are produced. Given the technologies of patient record exchange and process documentation, we are investigating how these technologies can help to improve healthcare services provided in the home care environment of the K4Care EU project. We present the service oriented informatics environment of the K4Care platform and show that making this system provenance aware enables medical professionals to easily find the reasons why certain procedures were followed in a treatment and find out how the procedures can be improved.	documentation;european union;genetic heterogeneity;handling (psychology);home care of patient;informatics (discipline);information processing;medical records;patients;service-oriented architecture;standards characteristics	Ákos Hajnal;Tamás Kifor;Gianfranco Pedone;László Zsolt Varga	2007	Studies in health technology and informatics		documentation;knowledge management;information processing;health care;informatics;computer science	HCI	-55.27528139617237	-61.82487874893574	35188

While refining their search goals, users are likely to apply a variety of strategies, such as searching for more general or more specific concepts in reaction to the information and structures they encounter in the results. This is called opportunistic search. In this paper we describe how semantic fisheye views (SFEV) can be designed to effectively support this search process by enabling rapid, interactive exploration of the multiple contexts that are useful for different opportunistic search strategies. Similar to other focus + context techniques, SFEVs visually emphasize and increase the detail of information related to the focus and de-emphasize or filter less important information. The contribution of the SFEV approach is the flexible definition of context as a combination of interest metrics, which can be reconfigured and combined to support a wide range of information visualizations and leading to the discovery of diverse new search goals. To further characterize the effectiveness of this technique for opportunistic search, we have developed a visual information retrieval interface for a large collection of annotated images that implements two distinctly different SFEVs; the first one uses similarity metrics to guide exploration over the images and keywords in the collection, and the second uses metrics that derive conceptual distance from an external general semantic model, WordNet. The results of a formal user experiment suggest that semantic-guided search is significantly more effective than similarity based search for complex opportunistic search and sensemaking tasks.

For example, anxiety often transitions to disappointment, which is likely to sink to depression before rising to happiness and relaxation, and these states are conditioned by the states of others in our communities. Modeling these complex dependencies can yield insights into human emotion and support more powerful sentiment technologies.  We develop a theory of conditional dependencies between emotional states in which emotions are characterized not only by valence (polarity) and arousal (intensity) but also by the role they play in state transitions and social relationships. We implement this theory using conditional random fields (CRFs) that synthesize textual information with information about previous emotional states and the emotional states of others. To assess the power of affective transitions, we evaluate our model in a collection of 'mood' updates from the Experience Project. To assess the power of social factors, we use a corpus of product reviews from a website in which the community dynamics encourage reviewers to be influenced by each other. In both settings, our models yield improvements of statistical and practical significance over ones that classify each text independently of its emotional or social context.	conditional entropy;conditional random field;linear programming relaxation;text corpus;theory	Moritz Sudhof;Andrés Goméz Emilsson;Andrew L.

Unlike other systems proposed in the past, we filter information sources to check for crowdsourcing feasibility and then assess the drug's effectiveness based on its reported detrimental effect on a patient. This helps in eliminating certain drugs that would almost certainly have an adverse effect on the patient's health and thereby obtain a set of recommendable drugs. These recommendations are further refined by analyzing the sentiment behind the opinions of patients who have been administered these drugs in the past. The resultant set of prescribable drugs agrees with those suggested by the consulted physicians for the considered sample set of diabetes patients. The critical assessment of the prototype system for Diabetes Type II drugs by both doctors and patients also reiterates the need for a feedback system that can possibly go a long way in improving patient experience of a drug. This leads us to conclude that PeopleSave, as a combination of the recommendation system prototype and the proposed feedback system, can be successful in improving the process of prescription of medicines for a varied range of medical conditions.	crowdsourcing;prototype;recommender system;resultant	Rahul Majethia;Varun Mishra;Akshit Singhal;K Manasa LakshmiManasa;Kunchay Sahiti;Vijay Nandwani	2016	2016 8th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2016.7440000	data mining;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-57.5769222464857	-68.44575090622635	35299

In this paper, we introduce EMTriage, a distributed Android application with the ability to access patients EHR's, and depending on the data and inputs, assess and distribute an acuity level to patients in need of resources. We use the Emergency Severe Index, a proven triage tool to set acuity level so paramedics know who to attend to first. We also introduce functionality such as, patients emailing their primary care doctors, directions to their closet hospital, access to information about diagnosing yourself, and an emergency warning system to inform people that you need help.

To enable this high degree of patient empowerment, the project p-medicine developed a Patient Empowerment Tool that is part of a clinical research infrastructure consisting of data management, data warehouse, biobank access, imaging, simulation and decision support tools. Patient autonomy is enhanced by giving patients access to their data and by providing means for informed choices and consent. Because the highly integrative nature of the Patient Empowerment Tool raised ethical concerns, an ethical requirements analysis was carried out, resulting in the assignment of five ethical clusters. The one concerned with the Patient Empowerment Tool was used to identify several concerns, like the access to unfavorable information or negative diagnosis, incomprehensible risk/benefit display, and other factors that may overstress certain patients. From the ethical point of view, the user interface should contain different profiles and control mechanisms to protect the patient and to provide an adaptable and intelligent display of information, sufficient guidance and help for users from vulnerable populations as well as for patients with life threatening diseases.	biobank;choice behavior;control system;data management;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;information needs;patients;personalization;point of view (computer hardware company);population;precision medicine;requirement;requirements analysis;simulation;solutions;user interface device component	Wolfgang Kuchinke	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610615	medical imaging;medicine;decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;data warehouse;data mining;biological engineering;data analysis;user interface	Visualization	-55.61205950395261	-63.78160802820808	35430

But, if the importance of features (or items) is different respectively, feature weighting structure needs to be changed according to the importance of features. This paper presents a GA based feature weighting method. Through this weighting method, we can focus on the good items while removing bad ones or reducing their impacts.	collaborative filtering;optimizing compiler;recommender system	Sung-Hwan Min;Ingoo Han	2005		10.1007/11495772_49	similarity;metric;computer science;similitude;collaborative filtering;machine learning;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval;recommender system	ECom	-36.38343598761987	-58.40273440331888	35547

Representation of content is not dependent of the search strategy and other elements of information retrieval systems (IRS) but rather has some relationship with them. In the conventional IRS, each document in the file is characterized by one or more index terms which supposedly describe its content. Those terms are assigned from the natural language or from a pre-prepared list (Thesaurus). Over the years, other means of representing content were suggested. Also, attempts were made to combine several of them assuming independence. This paper discusses the attributes of the items in the data-base and their qualities. It seems that there is no single one which has all the desired qualities. If the attributes are not totally independent neither highly correlated then combining them in a certain way may increase effectiveness.

However, most methods have addressed extraction of the strength of relations. Our goal is extracting the underlying relations between entities that are embedded in social networks. To this end, we propose a method that automatically extracts labels that describe relations among entities. Fundamentally, the method clusters similar entity pairs according to their collective contexts in Web documents. The descriptive labels for relations are obtained from results of clustering. The proposed method is entirely unsupervised and is easily incorporated into existing social network extraction methods. Our method also contributes to ontology population by elucidating relations between instances in social networks. Our experiments conducted on entities in political social networks achieved clustering with high precision and recall. We extracted appropriate relation labels to represent the entities.	cluster analysis;embedded system;entity;experiment;ontology (information science);ontology learning;precision and recall;semantic web;social network;unsupervised learning;world wide web	Junichiro Mori;Takumi Tsujishita;Yutaka Matsuo;Mitsuru Ishizuka	2006		10.1007/11926078_35	unsupervised learning;the internet;similarity;entity–relationship model;biological classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;similitude;machine learning;semantic web;ontology;data mining;database;cluster analysis;semantic network;world wide web;social network	Web+IR	-35.59846193380456	-59.22290736436535	35814

The purpose of this study is to determine if members of a journal editorial board can consistently and reliably use a single numeric scoring system to evaluate the quality of peer reviews. A retrospective analysis of 11 randomly selected manuscripts that had undergone external peer review by three reviewers was performed. Six had been rejected and five accepted. Each deputy editor was asked to score each of the reviews. The intraclass correlation was determined for each of the manuscripts to determine the consistency in grading. The intraclass correlation for 10 of the 11 manuscripts was above 0.87. This study demonstrates that an editorial board of deputy editors, without external training, can consistently and reliably grade reviews with excellent agreement.	randomness	Stephen R.

As an initial step in this direction, we conducted a study where 42 participants wrote two essays on two opposing stances about abortion (pro-choice and pro-life). Participants’ affective states (14 emotions plus neutral) were tracked at 15-second intervals via a retrospective affect judgment protocol. The results indicated that engagement, anxiety, confusion, frustration, and curiosity were the more frequent states, while the ‘basic’ emotions (e.g., sadness, disgust) were comparatively infrequent. Participants experienced more boredom when writing essays that did not align with their positions on abortion, but were more engaged when there was alignment. Participants also reported more curiosity while writing pro-choice essays. Importantly, boredom, engagement, and curiosity were the affective states that predicted essay quality. Lastly, selfreported interest before writing differed based on the alignment of positions and was related to affect in expected directions. We discuss the implications of our findings for ITSs that support the development of writing proficiency.	align (company);problem solving;sadness	Caitlin Mills;Sidney K.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the determinants of CIS continuance intention in a late post-adoption phase at the Georges Pompidou University Hospital (HEGP) in Paris.   METHODS We designed an electronic survey instrument based on an IT post-adoption model (ITPAM) developed from three previous models, i.e., the Delone and McLean Information Success Model, the Davis TAM model and the Bhattacherjee information system continuance intention model.   RESULTS 419 questionnaires were collected from CIS users directly involved in patient care. The perceived CIS quality, usefulness and user satisfaction are significantly lower for medical professions than other professional groups. Continuance intention is very high within all professional subgroups. In a multiple regression analysis, the global satisfaction (R(2) = .780) was positively and significantly correlated with CIS quality, confirmation of expectations and perceived CIS usefulness. The continuance intention (R(2) = .392) was positively and significantly correlated with perceived CIS usefulness, confirmation of expectations and global satisfaction.   CONCLUSION In a late post-adoption CIS deployment phase, continuance intention does not significantly depend on individual end user characteristics but is significantly associated with the perceived CIS usefulness, confirmation of expectations and global satisfaction.	accident and emergency department;angela mclean (biologist);computer user satisfaction;deploy;digeorge syndrome;ibm tivoli access manager;information system;medical information systems;occupations;tamoxifen;confirmation - responselevel	Brahim Hadji;Isabelle Dupuis;Laurence Leneveut;Didier Heudes;Jean-François Wagner;Patrice Degoulet	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-432-9-990	knowledge management;end user;continuance;information system;medicine	Web+IR	-61.16990319360454	-64.14639933338152	36391

1f10df986e3235f1deda73e1200155f4f4b88713	curating github for engineered software projects	mining software repositories;cutation tools;data curation;github	Software forges like GitHub host millions of repositories. Software engineering researchers have been able to take advantage of such a large corpora of potential study subjects with the help of tools like GHTorrent and Boa. However, the simplicity in querying comes with a caveat: there are limited means of separating the signal (e.g. repositories containing engineered software projects) from the noise (e.g. repositories containing home work assignments). The proportion of noise in a random sample of repositories could skew the study and may lead to researchers reaching unrealistic, potentially inaccurate, conclusions. We argue that it is imperative to have the ability to sieve out the noise in such large repository forges. We propose a framework, and present a reference implementation of the framework as a tool called reaper, to enable researchers to select GitHub repositories that contain evidence of an engineered software project. We identify software engineering practices (called dimensions) and propose means for validating their existence in a GitHub repository. We used reaper to measure the dimensions of 1,857,423 GitHub repositories. We then used manually classified data sets of repositories to train classifiers capable of predicting if a given GitHub repository contains an engineered software project. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using a set of 200 repositories with known ground truth classification. We also compared the performance of the classifiers to other approaches to classification (e.g. number of GitHub Stargazers) and found our classifiers to outperform existing approaches. We found stargazers-based classifier (with 10 as the threshold for number of stargazers) to exhibit high precision (97%) but an inversely proportional recall (32%). On the other hand, our best classifier exhibited a high precision (82%) and a high recall (86%). The stargazer-based criteria offers precision but fails to recall a significant portion of the population.	ground truth;imperative programming;reference implementation;sieve (mail filtering language);software engineering;software project management;software repository;text corpus	Nuthan Munaiah;Steven Kroh;Craig Cabrey;Meiyappan Nagappan	2017	Empirical Software Engineering	10.1007/s10664-017-9512-6	data mining;skew;ground truth;software;computer science;population;classifier (linguistics);data curation;data set;reference implementation	SE	-40.14934973800974	-64.71515397620992	36450

The core problem of personalized recommendation is to model and track users’ interests and their changes. To address this problem, both content-based filtering (CBF) and collaborative filtering (CF) have been explored. User interests involve interests on fixed categories and dynamic events, yet in current CBF approaches, there is a lack of ability to model user’s interests at the event level. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to user profile modeling. In this model, user's interests are modeled by a multi-layer tree with a dynamically changeable structure, the top layers of which are used to model user interests on fixed categories, and the bottom layers are for dynamic events. Thus, this model can track the user's reading behaviors on both fixed categories and dynamic events, and consequently capture the interest changes. A modified CF algorithm based on the hierarchically structured profile model is also proposed. Experimental results indicate the advantages of our approach.	algorithm;bayesian network;collaborative filtering;layer (electronics);personalization;recommender system;unified framework;user profile	Jue Wang;Zhiwei Li;Jinyi Yao;Zengqi Sun;Mingjing Li;Wei-Ying Ma	2006		10.1007/11610113_42	filter;simulation;user modeling;systems modeling;content management;computer science;collaborative filtering;database;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-37.141832161824944	-57.626957818980394	36468

Contrast patterns describe significant differences between groups. This chapter introduces the task and techniques of contrast pattern mining and reviews work in quantitative and computational folk music analysis as mining for contrast patterns. Three case studies are presented in detail to illustrate different pattern representations, datasets and groupings of folk music corpora, and pattern mining methods: subgroup discovery of global feature patterns in European folk music, emerging pattern mining of sequential patterns in Cretan folk tunes, and association rule mining of positive and negative patterns in Basque folk music. While this chapter focuses on examples in folk music analysis, the concept of contrast patterns offers opportunities for computational music analysis more generally, which can draw on both musicological traditions of quantitative comparative analysis and research in contrast data mining.	data mining	Kerstin Neubarth;Darrell Conklin	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-25931-4_15	humanities;communication;literature	ML	-42.22845434934615	-72.72122033108614	36475
77be2427eaf3f49ce29339ab617544c0d025b632	measuring situation awareness of student air traffic controllers with online probe queries: are we asking the right questions?		Situation awareness (SA) is a major factor determining operator performance in the current and future airspace systems, so it is not surprising that a considerable body of research on measuring operator SA has been amassed. A commonly used SA measurement method is a probe technique in which the operator is queried about the current state of his/her task environment, either offline (while a computer simulation is paused) or online (while a computer simulation is running.) Although sufficient evidence for the reliability and validity of both techniques is available, one factor that has not been systematically investigated is the efficacy of the questions themselves. We evaluated the types of online probe questions used for predicting the performance of student air traffic controllers in a simulated air traffic management task. These data were obtained from 84 students who completed a 16-week radar internship course in which their situation awareness and performance were assessed at the midpoint and end of the course. We subjected probe question latencies to a principle component analysis (PCA) to explore the variation between questions and grouped them based on the resulting components. The SA question components that emerged from PCA were then used to model the relations between SA factors and performance. The resulting model provides a framework for understanding factors involved in SA, a way to evaluate the validity of individual probe questions as a measure of SA, and a method for determining the efficacy of SA questions in predicting operator performance. The construct of Situation Awareness (SA) has been a major topic of interest for theorists, researchers, designers, and operators for over 25 years. Simply speaking, SA refers to the operator’s understanding of an evolving situation that he or she is in for the purpose of projecting system states into the near future (Durso & Dattel, 2004). Within the domain of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), SA encompasses the ability to understand and effectively use complex display information and is therefore often studied in computer-controlled simulated environments. The importance of this construct has led to diverse theoretical perspectives that have been debated over the years (e.g., Chiappe, Strybel, & Vu, 2015; Endsley, 2015; Stanton, Salmon, & Walker, 2015), and these have been recently presented in a special issue on situation awareness in The Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making (Pritchet, 2015). The most widely cited theory of SA is Endsley’s Three-Level Model of SA (Endsley, 2015). According to Endsley, SA involves the perception of the elements in the environment, comprehension of the elements and current situation, and projection of the future status of the situation. Perception of elements refers to detection of relevant information in the operator’s task environment. Comprehension refers to understanding the significance of the elements in light of one’s task goals, and projection is the ability to project the future actions of the elements in the environment. Chiappe et al. (2012, 2015) viewed Endsley’s model as “information in the head” based on the information processing approach taken by Endsley, and the method for assessing SA, known as the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), described below. Chiappe et al. developed a situated model of SA that focuses on whether information is held in memory or offloaded to the operator’s task environment, and this model is consistent with an online method developed by Durso and Dattell (20004), known as the Situation Present Assessment Method (SPAM). Stanton, Salmon, and Walker (2015) instead take a systems’ view and propose a distributed model of SA. In this view, SA is considered activated knowledge within a system at a point in time that belongs to both human and non-human agents. Within this final framework, SA is assessed by identifying the propositional networks showing information nodes and the relationships between them. These differences in the theoretical approaches to SA may in part be due to the fact that they are expressed in the abstract, devoid of any context. Wickens (2015), for example, pointed out that the construct of situation awareness, “. . . cannot easily be defined/discussed in the abstract, devoid of a context any more than we can talk about ‘a situation’ without saying what that situation is (p. 90)”. In other words, it is difficult to debate the nature and processes involved in acquiring and maintaining SA without referencing specific tasks and work environments. Wickens also notes that the SA construct is different from CONTACT James D. Miles jim.miles@csulb.edu Psychology Department, California State University, 1250 Bellflower Blvd., Long Beach, CA, USA.

In other words, it makes sense to speak of “high” or “low” workload without a specific context, but to speak of “high” or “low” SA, it is necessary to state “. . . awareness of what. (p. 90)” Finally, Wickens noted that it is more important to determine the applicability of SA rather than whether a particular theory is correct. Consistent with Wickens’ views, in this article, we report on the further development of an online tool for SA assessment of air traffic control operations, focused on the measurement of SA from the standpoint of en route air traffic controllers’ tasks and task environment. 1. Air Traffic Control Air traffic control is a highly skilled complex task, in which actions are based on well-learned procedures and strategic plans which are continuously formulated and updated. For the majority of controllers managing en route sectors, performance is based almost exclusively on the operators’ interactions with primary traffic displays and, consequently, performance is highly dependent on effective human–computer interfaces. In general, the goal of air traffic controllers (ATCos) is to ensure the safe and efficient flow of traffic from origin to destination. Safety is achieved by maintaining a minimum separation between aircraft. The minimum separation is defined by vertical and lateral dimensions creating a “hockey puck” of space around each aircraft. The exact values for vertical and lateral separation depend on the sector characteristics and other conditions, but increased safety can be achieved with increased lateral and vertical separation between aircraft. However, separation between aircraft also affects the number of aircraft in a sector thus conflicting with the second goal of efficiency. Sector efficiency determines the capacity of the current National Airspace System (NAS). Therefore, the controller must balance safety and efficiency by adhering to procedures established by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and using cognitive skills when these procedures fail to resolve a situation (Wickens, Mavor, & McGee, 1997). Some skills required for effective air space management were summarized by Jeannot, Kelly, and Thompson (2003). Controllers do not consider aircraft in isolation, but instead consider relative data between pairs of aircraft. Moreover, controllers are efficient in that they consider only those data needed to make decisions about aircraft. They also operate in a predictive mode thus anticipating a situation that may occur minutes ahead. Finally, ATCos consider the most important information for effective performance as “having the picture,” which is equated with SA. The reliance on the ATCo’s skill in managing traffic is one reason why ATCo workload is considered to be a major bottleneck limiting capacity in the NAS (Kopardekar et al., 2008). Recent programs such as the FAA’s Next Generation Airspace System (NextGen) is aimed at reducing the workload of ATCos through increased automation and changes in the roles and responsibilities of all operators in the NAS. However, increased automation can produce lower operator SA in some instances, and it is important to measure changes in SA that are brought about by the introduction of new automation and operating concepts because SA has been shown to be a factor in many airspace incidents (e.g., Rogers, Mogford, & Mogford, 1995; Durso, Truitt, Hackworth, & Crutchfield, 1998).	amiga walker;awareness;cognitive engineering;computer simulation;francis;fuchsian group;human–computer interaction;information processing;kelly criterion;lateral computing;lateral thinking;list comprehension;miles gordon technology;next-generation network;online and offline;principal component analysis;situated;situation calculus	James D.

Emoticons are thought to be used to convey emotion (Derks et al, 2007; Wolf, 2000). Specifically, it is believed that emoticons supplement electronic communication with non-verbal cues, such as those often seen in face-to-face communication (Lo, 2008). We collected text messages from participants who also rated the messages across a number of emotional dimensions. We asked a separate group to rate the same messages on the same dimensions. By comparing when a particular emoticon was used, the emotional qualities of the message as rated by both the sender and reviewer, we aim to investigate which emoticon is likely to be included in text messages according to emotional intent, and whether this emotional intent will likely be understood.	computer-mediated communication;emoticon	Milagros Florentina Lopez Obeso;Morgan Magnus Fleming	2015			psychology;natural language processing;symbolic communication;artificial intelligence	HCI	-44.535462990574885	-61.17960793601639	36534

There are many specifications in cardiology, particularly in the ECG standardization arena. The existence of ECG formats, however, does not guarantee the implementation of homogeneous, standardized solutions for ECG management. In fact, hospital management services need to cope with various ECG formats and, moreover, several different visualization applications. This heterogeneity hampers the normalization of integrated, standardized healthcare information systems, hence the need for finding an appropriate combination of ECG formats and a suitable EIS-based software architecture that enables standardized exchange and homogeneous management of ECG formats. Determining such a combination is one objective of this paper. The second aim is to design and develop the integrated healthcare information system that satisfies the requirements posed by the previous determination. The ECG formats selected include ISO/IEEE11073, Standard Communications Protocol for Computer-Assisted Electrocardiography, and an ECG ontology. The EIS-enabling techniques and technologies selected include web services, simple object access protocol, extensible markup language, or business process execution language. Such a selection ensures the standardized exchange of ECGs within, or across, healthcare information systems while providing modularity and accessibility.	accessibility;as-easy-as;business process execution language;cardiology discipline;communications protocol;disk mirroring;end-to-end principle;enterprise application integration;enterprise information system;home care services, hospital-based;hyper-igm immunodeficiency syndrome, type 1;interoperability;isoproterenol;language disorders;markup language;ontology;programming paradigm;recursion;requirement;reuse (action);scp-ecg;soap;seamless3d;server (computing);web page;web service;xml;format	Jesús D.

However, less is known about psychopathology-related variables that may mediate relations between depression/anxiety with PSU – especially variables involving emotional regulation processes. We recruited 261 college students for a repeated-measures web survey, administered self-report measures of depression, anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, mindfulness, smartphone use frequency, and PSU; one month later, participants completed these measures again. We tested a model where depression severity and anxiety sensitivity predicted distress tolerance and mindfulness, in turn predicting smartphone use frequency, and one-month PSU severity, adjusting for age and sex. Distress tolerance and mindfulness were inversely associated with levels of PSU. Distress tolerance mediated relations between anxiety sensitivity and levels of PSU. Mindfulness mediated relations between both depression and anxiety sensitivity with PSU severity. Results are discussed in the context of emotion regulation theory and compensatory internet use theory, with clinical implications for emotion regulation skills training and mindfulness in offsetting PSU.	distress (novel);smartphone	Jon D.

A total of 584 home health care nurses and GPs who used e-messaging and 495 home health care nurses and GPs who did not use e-messaging completed the questionnaire. The results showed that there was high agreement, in all the groups, that e-messaging led to better communication quality, better access to patient information, and an improved ability to prevent and reduce errors and omissions. Nurses reported the most agreement, which led to the conclusion that it was the characteristics of the profession rather than the use of e-messaging that influenced high agreement.	cross-sectional data;experience;home care services;home health care specialty;homebound persons;mail;patients;women's health services;general practice (field)	Merete Lyngstad;Ragnhild Hellesø	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-415-2-388	cross-sectional study;district nurse;family medicine;health care;nursing;medicine	HCI	-60.3254437604572	-64.2626967615192	36813
04d3878a651f8aad0d9e3560f9c85c8904c0cd30	a smart wearable sensor system for counter-fighting overweight in teenagers	lifestyle monitoring;wearable sensors;smart garment design;teenagers;co design	PEGASO is a FP7-funded project whose goal is to develop an ICT and mobile-based platform together with an appropriate strategy to tackle the diffusion of obesity and other lifestyle-related illnesses among teenagers. Indeed, the design of an engaging strategy, leveraging a complementary set of technologies, is the approach proposed by the project to promote the adoption of healthy habits such as active lifestyle and balanced nutrition and to effectively counter-fight the emergence of overweight and obesity in the younger population. A technological key element of such a strategy sees the adoption of wearable sensors to monitor teenagers' activities, which is at the basis of developing awareness about the current lifestyle. This paper describes the experience carried out in the framework of the PEGASO project in developing and evaluating wearable monitoring systems addressed to adolescents. The paper describes the methodological approach based on the co-designing of such a wearable system and the main results that, in the first phase, involved a total of 407 adolescents across Europe in a series of focus groups conducted in three countries for the requirements definition phase. Moreover, it describes an evaluation process of signal reliability during the usage of the wearable system. The main results described here are: (a) a prototype of the standardized experimental protocol that has been developed and applied to test signal reliability in smart garments; (b) the requirements definition methodology through a co-design activity and approach to address user requirements and preferences and not only technological specifications. Such co-design approach is able to support a higher system acceptance and usability together with a sustained adoption of the solution with respect to the traditional technology push system development strategy.	adolescent (age group);behaviorial habits;clothing;emergence;emoticon;focus group;illness (finding);overweight;prototype;requirement;specification;usability;user requirements document;wearable computer;sensor (device)	Carlo Emilio Standoli;Maria Renata Guarneri;Paolo Perego;Marco Mazzola;Alessandra Mazzola;Giuseppe Andreoni	2016		10.3390/s16081220	co-design;embedded system;simulation;engineering;multimedia	HCI	-61.08606108963094	-55.75627386599742	36876
459688b6b980a52873db42435804a9d4dba23632	a framework for incorporating patient preferences to deliver participatory medicine via interdisciplinary healthcare teams		Participatory medicine refers to the equal participation of patients and interdisciplinary healthcare team (IHT) members as part of care delivery. Facilitating workflow execution is a significant challenge for participatory medicine because of the need to integrate IHT members into a common workflow. A further challenge is that patient preferences should be considered when executing a workflow. To date there is limited research on supporting patient workflow as part of participatory medicine practices. To address that shortcoming we used a two-phase approach to develop a framework for participatory medicine that integrates different IHT members and workflows including the incorporation of patient preferences about care delivery options. Our framework uses a domain ontology to define the patient, IHT concepts and relations, as well as a workflow for operationalizing participatory medicine via an IHT. Proof of concept of the proposed framework is illustrated with a palliative care pain management case study.	delivery of health care;informatics (discipline);medical care team;natural science disciplines;ontology (information science);pain management;palliative care;patients;two-phase commit protocol	Craig E.

People believe that activity tracking systems, such as the Fitbit, may aid them in meeting recommended levels of physical activity. Similar systems have been the subject of previous research, but many of these studies were conducted over a short-term and some results may be attributable to reactivity or novelty effects. We ran a longitudinal mixed-methods effectiveness study using the Fitbit Zip activity tracker with 50 participants. In this paper we present two main challenges experienced during this study: the unreliability of the device and a lack of engagement by some of the participants. The issues we experienced can help inform the design of future studies.	activity tracker;futures studies;tracking system	Daniel Harrison;Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze;Paul Marshall;Jon Bird	2014		10.1145/2638728.2641320	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;activity tracker;health;quantified self;computer security	HCI	-60.00460534889464	-54.35622868331685	37080

ce19be59c03ead09e28d8f218f51c27e138f9ad8	persons with dementia and their caregivers using gps		The aim of the study is to generate knowledge on the use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to support autonomy and independence for persons with dementia. By studying a larger cohort of persons with dementia (n=208) and their caregivers, this study provides essential knowledge for planning and implementing GPS technology as a part of public health care services. Commercially available GPS technology was provided to the cohort of 208 persons with dementia from nineteen different Norwegian municipalities. The participants used GPS when performing outdoor activities as part of their daily life during a period of time between 2012 and 2014. Their family caregivers were instructed on how to use the GPS technology for locating the participants. The study documents that using GPS for locating persons with dementia provide increased safety for the person with dementia, their family caregivers and their professional caregivers. Furthermore the results confirm that by using GPS, persons with dementia may maintain their autonomy, enjoy their freedom and continue their outdoor activities despite the progression of the disease. Preconditions for successful implementation are that health professionals are trained to assess the participant's needs, that ethical dilemmas are considered, that caregivers have adequate knowledge about using the technology and that procedures and routines for administrating the GPS and locating persons with dementia are established. Early intervention and close collaboration between persons with dementia, family caregivers and professional caregivers are important for successful implementation of GPS in public health care.	autonomy;codes of ethics;color gradient;global positioning system;global positioning systems;health care;health services;large;precondition;presenile dementia;numeral 19	Tone Øderud;Bjørg Landmark;Sissel Eriksen;Anne Berit Fossberg;Sigrid Aketun;May Omland;Karl-Gerhard Hem;Elisabeth Østensen;Dag Ausen	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-566-1-212	data collection;global positioning system;activities of daily living;public health;family caregivers;cohort;dementia;nursing;independent living;medicine	HCI	-58.95475997129113	-59.19708242360721	37216

A list of smartphone usage competencies with 34 items was defined through expert survey and panel. Based on the competence and previous literature, a training program and learning aids were designed in this study. There were 41 participants in our program. The results of self-administrated smartphone usage ability questionnaire indicated that all competencies were significantly improved after training. However, the results also demonstrated that some items were still difficult for the elderly to comprehend. Overall, this study provided a first exploration of defining smartphone usage competency and built a training program for the elderly. With strong suggestion, future mobile health (mHealth) services can follow this study to insure the smartphone usage ability of the elderly.

The system automatically extracts events from the raw text, formalized as a sequence of temporally ordered predicate-arguments. These events are given to a machine-learner that produces a coarse-grained rating of the story. The results of the machine-learner and the extracted events are then used to generate fine-grained advice for the students.	rewrite (programming);rewriting;temporal logic;user story	Harry Halpin;Johanna D.

Compliance rates for use of the ACS order set, aspirin ordering, and beta-blocker ordering were calculated as the percentages of patients who had each action performed within 24 hours of admission.#N##N#Results: For all ACS admissions, the decision support tool significantly increased use of the ACS order set (p = 0.009). Use of the ACS order set led, within the first 24 hours of hospitalization, to a significant increase in the number of patients who received aspirin (p = 0.001) and a nonsignificant increase in the number of patients who received beta-blockers (p = 0.07). Results for confirmed AMI cases demonstrated similar increases, but did not reach statistical significance.#N##N#Conclusion: The decision support tool increased optional use of the ACS order set, but room for additional improvement exists.

50429bbf6fd083925f8c1de169427efc1e5df77d	semantic web tools for categorization greek texts on the internet: the meda13 standard and tego ontology		The wider question of this study is the suitability of existing Web search engines for the needs of school education. It examines the relevance to the teaching objectives of the results returned by the search process given a query and its (stated or unstated) purpose in the context of an educational activity. The particular field of teaching and research interest is Modern Greek in Cypriot secondary education (third high school grade, G9). For the purpose of the research, the exploratory-descriptive and experimental approaches were adopted. The goal of this work is to automate the categorization of Greek texts available in the Internet into textual genres, according to their external (structural/format) and internal (linguistic, stylistic) features, using Semantic Web technology, i.e. metadata and ontologies. The long term vision is to build a semantic search engine that categorizes its results into textual genres as understood and used in high school teaching. The results so far highlighted the need for multi-categorization of texts, mainly due to their hybrid and multimodal nature. The contribution of this paper lies in the construction of a semantic search engine suitable for the needs of school education which returns results classified into textual genres, in accordance to their external and internal characteristics. An algorithm to categorize texts into genres was designed and tested on the basis of the standard metadata Dublin Core (DC). By adapting DC model to the needs of the present work, a model called ‘MeDa13’ (MetaData13) that includes thirteen elements, was designed. In addition, TeGO ontology (Textual Genres Ontology) was constructed in order to clarify concepts and terms that are stated in the definitions of textual genres. TeGO was developed specifically for teaching Modern Greek focusing on textual genres. In this paper, we describe the proposed models and present the target objectives and outcomes.	algorithm;categorization;computer file;dublin core;information retrieval;internet;multimodal interaction;ontology (information science);relevance;semantic web;semantic publishing;semantic search;web search engine	Chrystalla Neofytou	2013			semantic web;categorization;owl-s;search engine;metadata;ontology (information science);natural language processing;semantic search;artificial intelligence;semantic web stack;computer science	Web+IR	-41.21547034930775	-61.48769094842553	37672

The study makes an attempt to provide an overview of the general status of the hospitals. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-CCR and BCC models have been applied for the Input-output data collected from 15 hospitals for the year 2009-2010. The study found that out of 15 hospitals, 2 hospitals are technically efficient and 8 hospitals are pure technically efficient. Assessment of technical efficiency concludes that the performance of hospitals is good but still very far from the optimal level. On average, a technical inefficient hospital may reach on the efficiency frontier if it is able to increase its output by 30.20%. The mean value of OTE (60.80%) indicates that on average a hospital to be efficient has to produce 39.20% more output with the same level of inputs.		Sandeep Kumar Mogha;Shiv Prasad Yadav;S. P.

The University of Calgary Driving Simulator (UCDS) was used to evaluate intersection performance. Measures of those who were able to stop or ran the yellow light, speed over the span of the intersection, perception response time, and eye movements were analyzed to determine if performance improved or whether undesirable adaptive behaviours occurred. In-vehicle signs facilitated an increase in the frequencies of stopping for both younger and older drivers at intersections with relatively short yellow onsets. The speed at the yellow light onset for both those who stopped and those who proceeded through the intersection was reduced by the presence of the in-vehicle signs. The primary behavioral influence of the in-vehicle signs was to cause the drivers' to reduce their velocity in advance of an intersection. Eye movement analyses indicated that younger drivers looked at the in-vehicles signs more often and for longer overall durations than older drivers. Older drivers had slower intersection approach speeds, stopped more accurately, and were more likely to not clear the intersection before the traffic light turned to an all-red phase than younger drivers. The implications of the in-vehicle sign results are discussed in terms of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) design guidelines and evaluation methods.		J. K. Caird;S. L. Chisholm;J.

However, when using the latter technologies, one prominent challenge constitutes a continuous user engagement. Incentive management techniques can help to tackle this challenge by motivating users through rewards and recognition in exchange of task completion. For this purpose, we aim at developing a conceptual framework that can be integrated with existing mHealth mobile crowdsourcing and crowdsensing platforms. The development of this framework is based on insights we obtained from the TrackYourTinnitus (TYT) mobile crowdsensing platform. TYT, in turn, pursues the goal to reveal insights to the moment-tomoment variability of patients suffering from tinnitus. The work at hands presents evaluated data of TYT and illustrates how the results drive the idea of a conceptual framework for an incentive management in this context. Our results indicate that a proper incentive management should play an important role in the context of any mHealth platform that incorporates the idea of the crowd. c © 2018 The Authors.

LSA is a useful method to take advantage of large amounts of available text, discern meaning within the text, and see how meanings change over time, across the media coverage in the sector. We explain the theory of LSA, the process, and apply it to a dataset of over 83,000 media articles to create a semantic model of document and word meanings. We measure how groups of documents differ and then visualize how the discourse changes over time. We find that LSA is useful for measuring how discourse shifts across this broad set of data. In our empirical case, we find that smartphone discourse went through four distinct periods, with different dynamics of transition and stability. These characteristics suggested particular theoretical bases which LSA is also well suited to examine.	apply;cognition;graphical user interface;heat map;latent semantic analysis;numerical analysis;smartphone;the forest	Jacob Miller;David Gefen;V.

For obvious reasons of patient safety, ethics, and cost-effectiveness, there is a need to shift the training and assessment from the operating theatre to a simulated environment (e.g. skills lab). This paper presents the state of the art on training and assessment of surgical skills in minimally invasive surgery, and discusses remaining challenges.	management information system;point of view (computer hardware company);virtual reality	Magdalena K.

08c5fc02f9f67510297490b83f1d3800ffbeee57	children psychotherapy with mobile devices		Computer Assisted Therapy is an applied and research field that has been rapidly evolving hand in hand with the advances of technology. In particular, the mass adoption of the internet and computers as tools to support several types of approaches has shown good results for a wide assortment of issues [1]. These technologies, primarily used to support therapists and clinicians while managing their records, accessing local or remote information [1][2], have more recently, and most importantly, been growingly used to serve patients as well, either independently or as a support for cooperation between patient and therapists. Amongst the existing examples, one can find simple registration (e.g., amount of cigarettes per day) diaries, short text-based tests or basic procedures and guidelines [3] or more advanced systems offering some support for personalization within the used tools [4] and data exchange between actors. However, traditionally, the majority of these tools requires some computer usage skills from both actors and is usually destined to adults or young adults. For teenagers and, most importantly, for children, who are also frequently in need of support and therapeutic aid, the number of existing tools is very low [5]. Requirements for applications directed toward children are significantly different from those that are oriented toward adults [6] and, in a vast majority of situations, adult oriented applications are not adequate to younger patients. This book chapter addresses the specific needs and requirements that technology must abide to when used in support of therapy for children and teenagers, focusing mainly on Cognitive Behavioral Approaches for the treatment of internalizing disorders like depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and somatic or physical problems [7].It provides an overview of existing approaches and systems and describes in detail two existing systems that aim at offering therapists, and their patients, tailored tools for the support of individual and group approaches for these disorders.	computer;internet;personalization;requirement;text-based (computing)	Marco de Sá;Luís Carriço;João Faria;Isabel Sá	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-25691-2_4	psychiatry;psychotherapist;clinical psychology	HCI	-58.989507868090605	-56.73056995275526	38028

These measurements are used in economic studies (cost effectiveness analysis) as weights for life years (so called Quality adjusted life years or QALYs), in development of guidelines for clinical care (again as quality weights for life years), and to help identify the best treatment alternative for individual patients through application of decision analysis. iMPACT3 (Internet Multimedia Preference Assessor Construction Tool) is a free publicly accessible web site that helps researchers design experimental protocols for measurement of utilities. When the researcher is finished with his or her design, iMPACT3 generates a set of HTML files that use Javascript to implement the protocol. iMPACT3 then downloads those to the researcher's computer, where they can be used in a stand alone fashion to collect data from patients in a clinic or published on the web. We describe and discuss computer approaches for measurement of utilities and their applications in healthcare. We then discuss the design of iMPACT3 and approaches for automatic generation of web sites for data collection in clinical studies.		Leslie Lenert	2000	Proceedings.

What makes a query di cult and how one may predict this is an active research area, focusing mainly on factors relating to the retrieval algorithm, to the properties of the retrieval data, or to statistical and linguistic features of the queries that may render them di cult. This work addresses query di culty from a different angle, namely the users’ own perspectives on query di culty. Two research questions are asked: (1) Are users aware that the query they submit to an IR system may be di cult for the system to address? (2) Are users aware of specific features in their query (e.g., domain-specificity, vagueness) that may render their query di cult for an IR system to address? A study of 420 queries from a Web search engine query log that are pre-categorised as easy, medium, hard by TREC based on system performance, reveals an interesting finding: users do not seem to reliably assess which query might be di cult; however, their assessments of which query features might render queries di cult are notably more accurate. Following this, a formal approach is presented for synthesising the user-assessed causes of query di culty through opinion fusion into an overall assessment of query di culty. The resulting assessments of query di culty are found to agree notably more to the TREC categories than the direct user assessments.	algorithm;information retrieval;sensitivity and specificity;vagueness;web search engine;web search query	Christina Lioma;Birger Larsen;Hinrich Schütze	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23318-0_3	online aggregation;sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;ranking;computer science;query by example;data mining;rdf query language;web search query;view;world wide web;crowdsourcing;information retrieval;query language;spatial query;subjective logic	Web+IR	-36.345796347524114	-54.83929219387533	38057

However, little is known about the neural correlates of this effect. This work examined the electrophysiological features of the prosocial video game effect on prosociality by using a help-needed decision task. Seventy participants played either prosocial or neutral video games for 20 min and then participated in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment that estimated the perceived need for help in others and prosocial behavior (i.e., charitable money donated). The results showed no significant differences between the two games in perceived need for help and money donation (prosocial behavior). Moreover, there were inconsistent results for N2 and P300 waves, in which weak evidence was found for larger frontal N2 when help was needed but not offered in the prosocial video game group; however, there were no differences in right-parietal P300 amplitudes. These findings provide no supportive evidence for the general learning model, which proposes that prosocial video games may promote empathy and prosocial-related behaviors. However, we should note the limitation of the small sample size. Further implications and limitations are discussed.	erp	Zhaojun Teng;Qian Nie;Yanling Liu;Cheng Guo	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.10.014	donation;social psychology;psychology;prosocial behavior;empathy;personal distress;event-related potential	HCI	-55.03447701958885	-52.885523457826366	38075

Eleven of 22 clinicians who were offered the laptops successfully adopted their use in the exam room. These clinicians were able to increase their exam room time with the patient by almost 4 minutes (25%), apparently without lengthening their overall work day. Patient response to exam room computing was overwhelmingly positive. The RF network response time was similar to the hardwired network. Problems cited by some laptop users and many of the eleven non-adopters included battery issues, different equipment layout and function, and inadequate training. IT support needs for the RF laptops were two to four times greater than for hardwired desktops. Addressing the reliability and training issues should increase clinician acceptance, making a successful general roll-out for exam room computing more likely.		Larry A. Dworkin;Michael Krall;Homer L.

2b8307abcc48adfeea85f2185ce01c0f813dcd51	a comparative analysis of cascade measures for novelty and diversity	diversity;user needs;comparative analysis;data collection;novelty;effectiveness measures;web search;user behavior	Traditional editorial effectiveness measures, such as nDCG, remain standard for Web search evaluation. Unfortunately, these traditional measures can inappropriately reward redundant information and can fail to reflect the broad range of user needs that can underlie a Web query. To address these deficiencies, several researchers have recently proposed effectiveness measures for novelty and diversity. Many of these measures are based on simple cascade models of user behavior, which operate by considering the relationship between successive elements of a result list. The properties of these measures are still poorly understood, and it is not clear from prior research that they work as intended. In this paper we examine the properties and performance of cascade measures with the goal of validating them as tools for measuring effectiveness. We explore their commonalities and differences, placing them in a unified framework; we discuss their theoretical difficulties and limitations, and compare the measures experimentally, contrasting them against traditional measures and against other approaches to measuring novelty. Data collected by the TREC 2009 Web Track is used as the basis for our experimental comparison. Our results indicate that these measures reward systems that achieve an balance between novelty and overall precision in their result lists, as intended. Nonetheless, other measures provide insights not captured by the cascade measures, and we suggest that future evaluation efforts continue to report a variety of measures.	experiment;qualitative comparative analysis;unified framework;web search engine	Charles L.

The TREC programme is introduced in this context, and an overview is given of the methods used in TREC. The Okapi team’s participation in TREC is then discussed. The team has made use of TREC to improve some of the automatic techniques used in Okapi, specifically the term weighting function and the algorithms for term selection for query expansion. The consequence of this process has been a very good showing for Okapi in terms of the TREC evaluation results. Some of the issues around the much more difficult problem of interactive evaluation in TREC are then discussed. Although some interesting interactive experiments have been performed at TREC, the problems of reconciling the requirements of the laboratory context with the concerns of interactive retrieval are still largely unresolved.	experiment;text retrieval conference	Stephen E.

We applied this methodology to a particular framework for incremental GL structuring (mark-up) and to GLs in three clinical domains. A gold-standard mark-up was created, including 196 plans and subplans, and 326 instances of ontological knowledge roles (KRs). A completeness measure of the acquired knowledge revealed that 97% of the plans and 91% of the KR instances of the GLs were recreated by the clinical editors. A correctness measure often revealed high variability within clinical editor pairs structuring each GL, but for all GLs and clinical editors the specification quality was significantly higher than random (p<0.01). Procedural KRs were more difficult to mark-up than declarative KRs. We conclude that given an ontology-specific consensus, clinical editors with mark-up training can structure GL knowledge with high completeness, whereas the main demand for correct structuring is training in the ontology's semantics.	correctness (computer science);engineering;guideline [publication type];increment;knowledge engineer;ontology;spatial variability;specification	Erez Shalom;Yuval Shahar;Meirav Taieb-Maimon;Guy Bar;Avi Yarkoni;Ohad Young;Susana B.

BACKGROUND The fit of a person to a chair is related to the geometric and kinematic compatibility between the two. This geometric compatibility influences the motions that are allowed or prohibited and the support pressures at the body-chair interface. Thus, during evaluation, it is necessary to treat the chair and user as a system.   METHOD Four dynamic test conditions were evaluated with 14 participants of varying anthropometries. Test conditions were selected to compare the ability to accommodate primary and secondary motions (recline and spinal articulation) of seated occupants. The ability of a chair to allow recline, yet maintain head and hand positions, was compared across chairs. Also, the ability of each chair to allow and support spinal articulation was evaluated. Motion data for the chair, head, thorax, pelvis, and extremities were collected along with chair back pressures. Upon completion of testing, subjective assessments were also conducted.   RESULTS Statistically significant differences were found between chairs relative to head and hand motions. Also, significant differences were noted for the chairs' ability to move with the body during spinal articulation and the ability to provide support. Subjective assessments also yielded differences.   CONCLUSIONS Biomechanical analyses using motions and pressures can be conducted on office chairs with significant differences detected in their performance.   APPLICATION Biomechanical assessments can be used to compare and contrast office chairs in terms that are relatable to fatigue reduction as well as operator performance.	biconnected component;chairs;chest;evaluation procedure;fatigue;mechanics;medical device incompatibility problem;motion;office chair;recliner	Tamara Reid Bush;Robert P.

In this scenario, similarity searching can be used to retrieve related images from past situations. However, the retrieved images often are similar among themselves and, therefore, add little to none new information to the rescue decision-making process. In this paper, we take advantage of diversity queries to increase the variety of the representative elements about an incident, whereas the remaining and related data are grouped according to the set of representatives. Thus, our approach enables content retrieval, grouping and an easier exploration of the result set. Experiments performed on real datasets shows that our proposal outperforms the existing methods regarding both quality and performance, being at least three orders of magnitude faster.	algorithm;content-based image retrieval;contingency plan;crowdsourcing;diversification (finance);experiment;result set;user-centered design;world file	Lucio F.

DESIGN Case report. Electronic messages between a hospital consultant and GPs were counted. The authors determined whether a message sent by the consultant was integrated into the receiving GP's electronic medical record system. After the observation period, the GPs answered a questionnaire.   MEASUREMENTS The number of electronic messages and the percentage of messages integrated into the electronic medical record.   RESULTS The volume of messages was maintained during the 3 years after the original study. In the original study, the percentage of the messages integrated by the GPs increased during the year. After that study, however, seven GPs stopped integrating data from messages. The extent to which received messages were integrated varied widely among practices.   CONCLUSION The authors conclude that extrapolation of the results of the original study would have led to incorrect conclusions. Although the volume of messages remained stable after the original study, GPs changed their method of handling messages. Initially, all GPs used the opportunity to copy data from the messages into their own records. At the end of the observation period (that is, the 3 years after completion of the original study), more than 50 percent of GPs had ceased copying data from the messages into their own records. The majority of GPs, however, wanted to expand the use of electronic messaging.	diabetes mellitus;electronic health records;electronics, medical;error message;extrapolation;handling (psychology);medical records;objective-c;patients;secondary care	Peter W.

V arious methods for automatic plagiarism detection have bee n developed whose objective is to assist human experts to analyze docume nts for plagiarism. Unlike other tasks in natural language p rocessing and information retrieval, it is not possible to publish a co llection of real plagiarism cases for evaluation purposes s ince they cannot be properly anonymized. Therefore, current evaluations fo und in the literature are incomparable and often not even rep roducible. Our contribution in this respect is a newly developed large-sca le orpus ofartificial plagiarism and new detection performance measures tailored to the evaluation of plagiarism detection algorit hms.	digital library;information retrieval;library (computing);natural language;rendering (computer graphics);www	Alberto Barrón-Cedeño;Martin Potthast;Paolo Rosso;Benno Stein	2010			natural language processing;computer science;data mining;information retrieval	ML	-34.33248938948851	-64.31489284870983	38879

The information is distributed within database tables in large textual attributes with a free structure. Information retrieval from these information is necessary for complementing cardiotocography signals with additional information that is to be implemented in a decision support system.The basic statistical overview (n-gram analysis) helped with the insight into data structure, however more sophisticated methods have to be used as human (and expert) processing of the whole data were out of consideration: over 620,000 text fields contained text reports in natural language with (many) typographical errors, duplicates, ambiguities, syntax errors and many (nonstandard) abbreviations.There was a strong need to efficiently determine the overall structure of the database and discover information that is important from the clinical point of view. We have used three different methods: k-means, self-organizing map and a self-organizing approach inspired by ant-colonies that performed clustering of the records. The records were visualized and revealed the most prominent information structure(s) that were consulted with medical experts and served for further mining from the database.The outcome of this task is a set of ordered or nominal attributes with a structural information that is available for rule discovery mining and automated processing for the research of asphyxia prediction during delivery. The proposed methodology has significantly reduced the processing time of loosely structured textual records for both IT and medical experts.	information retrieval;information system;swarm intelligence	Miroslav Bursa;Lenka Lhotská;Václav Chudácek;Jirí Spilka;Petr Janku;Lukás Hruban	2015	J.

In contrast to statistically-based work on sample sizes, we hypothesize that some topics or topic sets are better than others at predicting true system effectiveness, and that with the right choice of topics, accurate predictions can be obtained from small topics sets. Using a variety of effectiveness metrics and measures of goodness of prediction, a study of a set of TREC and NTCIR results confirms this hypothesis, and provides evidence that the value of a topic set for this purpose does generalize.	experiment;information retrieval;text retrieval conference	John Guiver;Stefano Mizzaro;Stephen E.

VA SmartHome (SH) technology, developed for Veterans with TBI, uses an accurate indoor tracking technology capable of following numerous individuals simultaneously and resolving their location to approximately 15 cm in an open environment. In addition, SH technologies provide time- and location-dependent prompts to promote independence of the participant by providing reminders for the management of daily activities such as medication, meal planning, and other necessary tasks. SH tech-nology was initially developed for clinical rehabilitation settings, however, was recently expanded to private homes of Veterans with TBI. Current features available in the SH and the process of implementation are presented.		Kristina M. Martinez;Karen M. Mann;Christina Dillahunt-Aspillaga;Jan M.

The slow but progressive nature of the disease, together with its neurological nature, ultimately compromises the behavior and function of people who may be essentially healthy from a physical perspective. An illustration of this is the wandering behavior frequently found in people with dementia. In this paper, a novel AAL solution for caregivers, particularly tailored for Alzheimer's patients who are the early stage of the disease and exhibit unpredictable wandering behavior, is briefly described. Salient aspects of a user evaluation are presented, and some issues relevant to the practical design of AAL systems in dementia cases are identified.	atm adaptation layer;relevance	Jie Wan;Caroline A.

This paper explores the challenges in bringing together different communities with the necessary skill sets to design such technologies for and with people with a disability. A collaborative approach involving a maker community, a disability services organization, and university staff and students was investigated through the theoretical lens of infrastructuring. Maker communities can potentially provide skilled and willing volunteers, while disability services organizations possess disability sector expertise and the university can contribute design expertise through its staff and students. While these parties complement each other, tensions can arise that require resolution. Through ethnography and co-design this study identified key tensions that arise in a collaboration including differences in motivations, the importance of sensitive and accurate need finding, managing expectations, and leveraging health and safety standards. Resolution of these tensions can lead the way to more sustainable collaborative projects.	image resolution	Ravihansa Rajapakse;Margot Brereton;Laurianne Sitbon;Paul Roe	2015		10.1145/2838739.2838824	knowledge management;management science;management;collaboration	HCI	-62.110703283973315	-53.34491340356711	39040

The combination of these two types of information has not been studied in previous work in order to produce object rankings. We apply CJ to the use case of scientific paper assessment and we validate it over simulated data. The results show that the rankings produced by our algorithm improve current scientific paper ranking practice based on averages of opinions weighted by their reviewers’ self-assessments.	algorithm;scientific literature;simulation	Ewa Andrejczuk;Juan A.

To address these problems, an expert system for online search assistance was developed. This prototype augments the searching capabilities of novice users by providing automatic query reformulation to improve the search results, and automatic ranking of the retrieved passages to speed the identification of relevant information. Users’ search performance using the expert system was compared with their search performance on their own, and their search performance using an online thesaurus. The following conclusions were reached: (1) the expert system significantly reduced the number of queries necessary to find relevant passages compared with the user searching alone or with the thesaurus. (2) The expert system produced marginally significant improvements in precision compared with the user searching on their own. There was no significant difference in the recall achieved by the three system configurations. (3) Overall, the expert system ranked relevant passages above irrelevant passages.	expert system;iteration;online search;prototype;query expansion;relevance;thesaurus;usability testing;vocabulary	Susan Gauch;John B.

The study was motivated in part by the suspicion that evidence in support of the Media Equation, especially in the field of conversational agents, was supported by incomplete data; too often omitted in its purview is the occurrence of unsavoury user responses. Our study shows that conversations with Jabberwacky often bring about the expression of negative verbal disinhibition. We discovered that 10% of the total stems in the corpus reflected abusive language, and approximately 11% of the sample addressed hard-core sex. Users were often rude and violated the conversation maxims of manner, quantity, and relevance. Also particularly pronounced in the conversations was a persistent need of the user to define the speakers’ identities (human vs. machine). Users were also curious to understand and test the cognitive capabilities of the chatterbot. Our analysis indicates that the Media Equation may need qualifying, that users treat computers that talk, less as they do people and more as they might treat something not quite an object yet not quite human. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In a within-subjects design, the participants played the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with VCs with different dynamic facial expressions (predefined or dependent on the participant's electrodermal and facial EMG activity). In general, VC facial expressions elicited congruent facial muscle activity. However, both frontal EEG asymmetry and facial EMG activity elicited by an angry VC facial expression varied as a function of preceding interactional events (human collaboration/defection). Pre-decision inner emotional-motivational processes and emotional facial expressions were dissociated, suggesting that human goals influence pre-decision frontal asymmetry, whereas display rules may affect (pre-decision) emotional expressions in human-VC interaction. An angry VC facial expression, high pre-decision corrugator EMG activity, and relatively greater left frontal activation predicted the participant's decision to defect. Both post-decision frontal asymmetry and facial EMG activity were related to reciprocal cooperation. The results suggest that the justifiability of VC emotional expressions and the perceived fairness of VC actions influence human emotional responses.

During the medical application software development, specialized programming libraries are commonly used in order to solve the requirements of computation and scientific visualization. However, these libraries do not provide suitable tools for reading DICOMDIR files, making necessary the implementation of a flexible tool for reading these files, which can be also easily integrated into applications under development. To solve this problem, this work introduces an object-oriented design and an open-source implementation for such reading tool. It produces an output data tree containing the information of the DICOM images and their related radiological studies, which can be browsed easily in a structured way through navigation interfaces coupled to it.	comefrom;computation;conformance testing;dicom;digital imaging;directory (computing);library (computing);open-source software;radiology;requirement;scientific visualization;software development	Ricardo Villegas;Guillermo Montilla;Hyxia Villegas	2007	IJHISI	10.4018/jhisi.2007010105	medical software;visualization;computer science;theoretical computer science;software development;data mining;database;object-oriented programming	SE	-50.278732919117765	-62.56480205891008	39343

However, despite their emergence, such systems have not been entirely embraced by GPs. There is little qualitative research exploring practical barriers to the adoption of decision support systems in this setting.   METHOD Qualitative interviews with 15 GPs in the West Midlands.   RESULTS Several practical barriers were identified to the use of computerised support systems in primary care consultations. These included limitations of practitioners' IT skills, problems for GPs in understanding the risk output of systems and GP concerns about communicating risk sufficiently well to patients. Concerns over the time implications of using a system in a consultation was also identified as a barrier.   CONCLUSION Designers of decision support systems for use in primary care consultations must account for the practical needs of users when developing computerised support systems. Systems must be acceptable to the format of a consultation, include definitions of what output means, and help facilitate dialogue between the GP and the patient.	consultation;decision making;decision making, shared;decision support systems, clinical;decision support system;emergence;evidence-based medicine;general adaptation syndrome;global positioning system;knowledge bases;knowledge base;patients;primary health care;promotion (action);qualitative research	Duncan Short;Martin Frischer;James Bashford	2004	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.02.001	medicine;decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;qualitative research;nursing;management science	HCI	-60.669290102404034	-62.98026008605141	39349

abbb22faa83910e0f087c217a5a7a84ce9bcc1eb	retrieval algorithms optimized for human learning		While search technology is widely used for learning-oriented information needs, the results provided by popular services such as Web search engines are optimized primarily for generic relevance, not effective learning outcomes. As a result, the typical information trail that a user must follow while searching to achieve a learning goal may be an inefficient one involving unnecessarily easy or difficult content, or material that is irrelevant to actual learning progress relative to a useru0027s existing knowledge. We address this problem by introducing a novel theoretical framework, algorithms, and empirical analysis of an information retrieval model that is optimized for learning outcomes instead of generic relevance. We do this by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates a cognitive learning model into a retrieval objective, and then give an algorithm for an efficient approximate solution to find the search results that represent the best u0027training setu0027 for a human learner. Our model can personalize results for an individual useru0027s learning goals, as well as account for the effort required to achieve those goals for a given set of retrieval results. We investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of our retrieval framework relative to a commercial search engine baseline (u0027Googleu0027) through a crowdsourced user study involving a vocabulary learning task, and demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized results from our model on word learning outcomes.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);computational model;crowdsourcing;data science;information needs;information retrieval;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;personalization;relevance;test set;usability testing;vocabulary;web search engine	Rohail Syed;Kevyn Collins-Thompson	2017		10.1145/3077136.3080835	data mining;learning to rank;human–computer information retrieval;information retrieval;instance-based learning;computer science;semi-supervised learning;cognitive models of information retrieval;search engine;stability (learning theory);machine learning;active learning (machine learning);algorithm;artificial intelligence	Web+IR	-35.55382965329646	-53.565651839076594	39440

Our approach focuses on dividing a defined knowledge base into sections corresponding to discrete clinical events associated with the evaluation and treatment of a specific disorder. Common reasons for subspecialty referral are used to generate situational statements that serve as entry points into the knowledge base. Each section includes defining questions generated using keywords associated with specific topics. Defining questions are linked to patient-focused answers. Evaluation of a thyroid cancer web site designed using this approach has identified high ratings for usability, relevance, and comprehension of retrieved information. This approach may be particularly useful in the development of resources for newly diagnosed patients.	knowledge base;list comprehension;patient referral;patients;relevance;thyroid carcinoma;usability;web site	Matthew I.

The past twenty years have seen tremendous changes-new drugs, new devices, and new techniques. These changes will certainly continue, but the true megachanges of the next decade will center around gathering, managing, and using clinical information. This prediction will prove true for all the health care areasadministrative, clinical, teaching, and research. Yet we make it at a time when most health care information is still being managed manually and in ways that can be charitably described as “refinements” of the 1975 information management paradigm. True reengineering of the health care information management infrastructure has hardly begun. The press for improved access to health care, the expectation of having health care provided at lower cost, the development of vertically and horizontally integrated delivery systems, the emphasis on wellness, and the transition to medicine based on an understanding of the human genome are creating dramatic changes in roles and responsibilities in the health care system. Although information system consultants and vendors are flocking to offer solutions, these solutions still tend to follow old paradigms. Millions of dollars are being wasted on information systems that work barely adequately for the present and that offer little or nothing for the future. The development of a new, robust information management paradigm is the critical challenge facing the health care industry. Four cornerstones of medical informatics form the basis for developing a new information management paradigm for health care. These four cornerstone areas of knowledge and expertise extend well beyond the skills associated with traditional data processing and information systems and include:	code refactoring;flocking (behavior);health care;informatics (discipline);information systems;information management;information system;medical informatics;programming paradigm;solutions;women's health services;responsibility	Nancy M.

Electronic calendars are of great use in time-based memory tasks. In this project, we enter the mixed reality realm for helping dementia patients. Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Memory loss is an example. Here, mixed reality refers to the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new episodic memory visualisations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. Cognitive models are approximations of a patient's mental abilities and limitations involving conscious mental activities (such as thinking, understanding, learning, and remembering). External representations of episodic memory help patients and caregivers coordinate their actions with one another. We advocate distributed cognition, which involves the coordination between individuals, artefacts and the environment, in four main implementations of artificial intelligence technology in the Kognit storyboard: (1) speech dialogue and episodic memory retrieval; (2) monitoring medication management and tracking an elder's behaviour (e.g., drinking water); (3) eye tracking and modelling cognitive abilities; and (4) serious game development towards active memory training. We discuss the storyboard, use cases and usage scenarios, and some implementation details of cognitive models and mixed reality hardware for the patient. The purpose of future studies is to determine the extent to which cognitive enhancement technology can be used to decrease caregiver burden.	cognitive model;mixed reality	Daniel Sonntag	2015			cognitive skill;computer science;artificial intelligence;mixed reality;cognitive load	HCI	-57.20435382696636	-53.86435149397437	39777

In this paper, we introduced a new relational complexity network framework derived from network theory and cognitive mechanisms to explain some key aspects in the decisional processes of air traffic control tasks. In the validating experiment, we manipulated different aircraft interaction patterns and found that controllers' workload ranking, conflict detection rate, intervention decision and task completion time were significantly influenced by positions of single aircraft or aircraft pairs in the relational complexity network.

0d639749fcc677575dd29aa6ab555007e45d9f32	supporting researchers with a semantic literature management wiki		Nowadays, research group members are often overwhelmed by the large amount of relevant literature for any given topic. The abundance of publications leads to bottlenecks in curating and organizing literature, and important knowledge can be easily missed. While a number of tools exist for managing publications, they generally only deal with bibliographical metadata and their support for further content analysis is limited to simple manual annotation or tagging. Here, we investigate how we can go beyond these approaches by combining semantic technologies, including natural language processing, within a user-friendly wiki systems to create an easy-to-use, collaborative space that facilitates the semantic analysis and management of literature in a research group. We present the Zeeva system as a first prototype that demonstrates how we can turn existing papers into a queryable knowledge base.	knowledge base;natural language processing;organizing (structure);prototype;usability;wiki	Bahar Sateli;René Witte	2014			knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-34.33439352874391	-67.12184212505699	39875

We use a corpus of heterogeneous documents to address the issue that information seekers usually face – a variety of different types of information sources. We directly extract information from these, but minimally redact and meaningfully order it to form a coherent text. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that quantitative results are not sufficient to judge the quality of a summary and that other quality criteria, such as coherence, should also be taken into account. We find that our manually created corpus is of high quality and that it has the potential to bridge the gap between reference corpora of abstracts and automatic methods producing extracts. Our corpus is available to the research community for further development.	bridging (networking);coherent;compiler;display resolution;pyramid (image processing);rouge (metric);text corpus	Darina Benikova;Margot Mieskes;Christian M.

4d790c21cd3727e8f3b80c25ca6737f617e50d4b	letter from the editor	molecular pathology;breast cancer research	The current issue features six contributions related to Immunotherapy. A study on the effect of neutral Ginseng polysaccharides on murine bone marrow dendritic cells (DCs) (Meng, p. 233), the use of a one-replicon vector to simultaneously co-express antigen and adjuvant (Ma, p. 242), and the influence of intradermal application of vitamin D3 on DCs and regulatory T-cells (Bakdash, p. 250) are presented. Two commentaries discuss the generation of DC vaccines (Radford, p. 259) and mRNA as an off-the-shelf therapeutic (Van Lint, p. 265). Finally, this section contains a letter on autologous heat-shock protein vaccines (Colaco, p. 275). In the rubric New Targets, we feature research papers on yellow fever vaccination in people over 60 y (Takesaki Miyaji, p. 277) and TLR9 adjuvants with SE36/ AHG malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates (Tougan, p. 283), as well as commentaries on the development of a Toxoplasma gondii vaccine (Verma, p. 291) and the idea of developing novel pharmaceutical products in tandem with their prospective antidotes in anticipation of possible adverse events (Caoili, p. 294). Three papers on HPV deal with vaccine uptake among female higher-education students in Greece (Donadiki, p. 300), correlation of comfort with alternative settings for vaccine delivery (McRee, p. 306) and systemic and mucosal HPV-specific antibody responses after vaccination (Scherpenisse, p. 314). Four papers are related to Pertussis: a case report on B. pertussis infection in a child with completed primary vaccination (Shankar, p. 322), a CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant for acellular pertussis vaccine (Asokanathan, p. 325), a confocal microscopy study of the effects of pertussis toxin and toxoids on CHO-cells (Tan, p. 332), and an improved whole-cell vaccine with reduced endotoxin content (Oliveira Dias, p. 339). A wide range of papers fall in the category Licensed Vaccines: a systemic review of trials conducted to increase seasonal influenza vaccination rates among health care workers (Schmidt, p. 349), recommendations for tick-borne encephalitis vaccination from the Central European Vaccination Awareness Group (Zavadska, p. 362), seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus in Mexico and implications for hepatitis A vaccination (Lazcano-Ponce, p. 375), safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Synflorix (Dicko, p. 382), compliance with rotavirus vaccination guidelines in the US (Eisenberg, p. 389), comparison of serologic responses to primary vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine versus 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in HIV infected patients (Lu, p. 398), and a commentary on correlates of protection for influenza virus (Cox, p. 405). The rubric Technologies features a short report on archaeosomes as adjuvants for a vaccine against Chagas disease (Higa, p. 409), and a study on developing a Vero cell DNA reference standard for residual DNA measurement (Cao, p. 413). One study for Clinical Issues assesses the potential for implementation of HIV vaccine trials in hard-to-reach female sex workers in Spain (Etcheverry, p. 420).	10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine;adverse event;antidote;bone marrow;booster (electric power);booster immunization - actsubstanceadministrationcode;chemical and drug induced liver injury;cholecalciferol;dendritic cells;factor viii;females;hiv infections;heat shock proteins;hepatitis a virus;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);influenza vaccination;lu decomposition;lint (software);malaria vaccines;mucous membrane;os-tan;orthomyxoviridae;paper;patients;pertussis toxin;pertussis vaccine;pharmaceutical adjuvants;pharmaceutical preparations;polysaccharide vaccine;polysaccharides;polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine;primates;prospective search;reference standards;replicon;rotavirus;schmidt decomposition;systematic review;tick-borne encephalitis;toxoids;toxoplasma gondii;vaccines, conjugate;yellow fever vaccine;cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine;synflorix	Richard W.

DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS The authors dissected nursing diagnostic terms from two source terminologies (Home Health Care Classification and the Omaha System) into the semantic categories of the ISO model. Consistent with the ISO model, they selected Focus and Judgment as required semantic categories for creating intensional definitions of nursing diagnostic concepts in the MED. Because the MED does not include Focus and Judgment hierarchies, the authors developed them to define the nursing diagnostic concepts.   RESULTS The ISO model was sufficient for dissecting the source terminologies into atomic terms. The authors identified 162 unique focus concepts from the 266 nursing diagnosis terms for inclusion in the Focus hierarchy. For the Judgment hierarchy, the authors precoordinated Judgment and Potentiality instead of using Potentiality as a qualifier of Judgment as in the ISO model. Impairment and Alteration were the most frequently occurring judgments.   CONCLUSIONS Nursing care represents a large proportion of health care activities; thus, it is vital that terms used by nurses are integrated into concept-oriented terminologies that provide broad coverage for the domain of health care. This study supports the utility of the ISO Reference Terminology Model for Nursing Diagnoses as a facilitator for the integration process.	breast feeding;cns disorder;categories;dictionary;entity;health care;intensional logic;judgment;medline;nomenclature;osi model;terminology model	Jee-In Hwang;James J.

In this paper, we formally analyse two important but distinct reasons for normalising documents with respect to length, namely verbosity and scope, and discuss the practical implications of not normalising accordingly. We review a number of language modelling approaches and a range of recently developed retrieval methods, and show that most do not correctly model both phenomena, thus limiting their retrieval effectiveness in certain situations. Furthermore, the retrieval characteristics of long natural language queries have not traditionally had the same attention as short keyword queries. We develop a new discriminative query language modelling approach that demonstrates improved performance on long verbose queries by appropriately weighting salient aspects of the query. When combined with query expansion, we show that our new approach yields state-of-the-art performance for long verbose queries.	information retrieval;language model;natural language;norm (social);query expansion;query language	Ronan Cummins	2016		10.1145/2872427.2883009	query expansion;computer science;data mining;database;oscilloscope;information retrieval;query language	Web+IR	-34.25410828481936	-63.25159225997916	40056

This paper contributes to the discourse on how national health information systems can scale to the lower levels and how mobile technology is supporting the collection, handling and dissemination of data. But can mHealth go beyond the 'hype' and visions it has come to be associated with? Using an action research methodology in a long-term action research project, the usability and then scalability of mobile solutions for large scale national health information systems are studied. In this paper, initial successes and challenges with using m-Health for national public health information systems is reported and discussed.

Computational support has the potential to enable these individuals to regain control over some aspects of their lives. Our research aims to carefully seek out issues that might be appropriate for computational support and to build enabling technologies that increase individuals' functional independence in the home environment. Using a case-study approach, we explored the needs and informed the design of a pacing aid for an individual with a cognitive impairment whose quality of life was negatively affected by her inability to pace herself during her morning routine. The contributions of this research include insights we gained with our methodology, two sets of design dimensions: user-centered contraints developed from capabilities and preferences of our users and system-centered capabilities that could be explored in potential designs, a design concept which illustrates the application of these design dimensions into a potential pacing aid, and evaluations of paper prototypes guided by the design dimensions.	paper prototyping;user-centered design	Jessica Paradise;Elizabeth D.

These items may then be evaluated for their degree of match against the input. This type of approach to retrieval has some problems. It requires one to look explicitly for items in memory whenever the possibility exists that there might be something of interest there. Also, this approach does not easily tolerate discrepancies or omissions in the input features or indices. In a question-answering system , a user may make incorrect assumptions about the contents of the knowledge base. This makes a tolerant retrieval method even more necessary. An alternative, two-stage model of conceptual information retrieval is proposed. The first stage is a spontaneous retrieval that operates by a simple marker-passing scheme. It is spontaneous because items are retrieved as a by-product of the input understanding process. The second stage is a graph matching process that filters and evaluates items retrieved by the first stage. This scheme has been implemented and validated in the SCISOR information retrieval system.	artificial neural network;information retrieval;information system;knowledge base;knowledge representation and reasoning;matching (graph theory);programming paradigm;question answering;scheme;spontaneous order;spreading activation	Lisa F.

The online GIS survey enables the continuous monitoring and developing of the health problems of the elderly and helps them in their early care by the healthcare units. GIS survey123 is a customizable tool, which can be used to conduct research that is then published on an Android, iOS, and web platform. The ArcGIS software was used for the geographic mapping of data collected from a wide range of sources, so that health care professionals can investigate the factors associated with the onset of the diseases. Also, direct geographic mapping aims at identifying health problems of the elderly in Greece and transferring information to health care professionals in order to impose proper control measures in a very small period of time.

This cross-sectional study was aimed to validate a culturally-adapted Italian Patient Activation Measure (PAM13-I) for patients with chronic conditions.   METHODS 519 chronic patients were involved in the Italian validation study and responded to PAM13-I. The PAM 13 was translated into Italian by a standardized forward-backward translation. Data quality was assessed by mean, median, item response, missing values, floor and ceiling effects, internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and average inter-item correlation), item-rest correlations. Rasch Model and differential item functioning assessed scale properties.   RESULTS Mean PAM13-I score was 66.2. Rasch analysis showed that the PAM13-I is a good measure of patient activation. The level of internal consistency was good (α = 0.88). For all items, the distribution of answers was left-skewed, with a small floor effect (range 1.7-4.5 %) and a moderate ceiling effect (range 27.6-55.0 %). The Italian version formed a unidimensional, probabilistic Guttman-like scale explaining 41 % of the variance.   CONCLUSION The PAM13-I has been demonstrated to be a valid and reliable measure of patient activation and the present study suggests its applicability to the Italian-speaking chronic patient population. The measure has good psychometric properties and appears to be consistent with the developmental nature of the patient activation phenomenon, although it presents a different ranking order of the items comparing to the American version. PAM13-I can be a useful assessment tool to evaluate interventions aimed at improving patient engagement in healthcare and to train doctors in attuning their communication to the level of patients' activation. Future research could be conducted to further confirm the validity of the PAM13-I.	acclimatization;cross-sectional data;data quality;floor and ceiling functions;gnly wt allele;genetic translation process;internal consistency;item response theory;missing data;patients;potassium aggravated myotonia;rasch model;sample variance;self-management (computer science)	Guendalina Graffigna;Serena Barello;Andrea Bonanomi;Edoardo Lozza;Judith Hibbard	2015		10.1186/s12911-015-0232-9	health informatics;medicine;nursing	HCI	-62.54566874160441	-64.31550839795432	40794

The clinical guidelines were used for decision support in primary care in order to improve the quality of electronic referrals to a hospital. Guidelines were developed by the specialists at the hospital, but the design and the development of the system was done in collaboration with general practitioners working in primary care. This paper sums up the findings from a study six months after the introduction of the decision support system, and is based on interviews with users in primary care. The work processes differed between the practices; General practitioners who wrote the referrals after the patient had left the office did not find the system as useful as the ones who wrote them when the patient was present. The general practitioners were reluctant to use guidelines that resulted in an additional workload in terms of providing the hospital with more information than before, but found the system useful as a support for assuring that they made the right clinical decisions. The guidelines were also seen as useful as a support for refusing to refer the patient to specialized care.	decision support system	Vigdis Heimly;Øystein Nytrø	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration	10.1109/IRI.2011.6009582	interview;decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;health care;collaboration	HCI	-60.16129397908084	-64.20732235246102	41042

It has been observed that the combination of two perception-based decisions could be better than one, provided that the decision-makers communicate with each other and jointly adopt the most confident judgment; simply select the most confident judgment without any dyadic interaction, or communicate with each other on shareable arguments based on reasoning. In this paper, we report a recently conducted visual perception experiment with decisions from nineteen pairs of subjects and their reported confidence factors when making such a decision. Utilizing the concept of a “cognitive diversity” between two systems and the combinatorial fusion algorithm, our results demonstrated that the fusion of two visual perception decision systems can be better than each of the individual systems only if the two systems perform relatively good and they are cognitively diverse. Our study not only provides a robust algorithm to fuse two visual perception decision-making systems, but also suggests a resilient approach to use the cognitive diversity in fusion when the performance of each individual system is not known or cannot be obtained, which is often the case for complex problems.	algorithm;color vision;dyadic transformation	Elena Paolercio;Cameron McMunn-Coffran;Brian Mott;D.

With the use of e-learning systems, the UI patient’s classical follow-up as well as MDSC sphincter injection therapy are shown. The “Virtual Patient” case allowed us to demonstrate the main results and the creation of a robotic system from the MDSC study. In this way, the authors will disseminate the new procedure developed in Collegium Medicum JU in UI patients. The “Virtual Patient” case may help students get involved in this new procedure along the main program.	cell (microprocessor);entry point;robot;user interface	Klaudia Stangel-Wójcikiewicz;Monika Piwowar;Malgorzata Migdal;Krzysztof Skotniczny	2014	Bio-Algorithms and Med-Systems	10.1515/bams-2014-0007	urology;medicine;physical therapy;gynecology	Robotics	-56.81292772113224	-65.10095695941077	41245
b041b927f0db14aa42a40fb074b4f2a8fb81874f	the development and validation of a one-bit comparison for evaluating the maturity of tag distributions in a web 2.0 environment	text mining;entropy information;domain analysis	Tags generated by domain experts reaching a consensus under social influence reflect the core concepts of the tagged resource. Such tags can act as navigational cues that enable users to discover meaningful and relevant information in a Web 2.0 environment. This is particularly critical for nonexperts for understanding formal academic or scientific resources, also known as hard content. The goal of this study was to develop a novel one-bit comparison OBC metric and to assess in what circumstances a set of tags describing a hard-content resource is mature and representative. We compared OBC with the conventional Shannon entropy approach to determine performance when distinguishing tags generated by domain experts and nonexperts in the early and later stages under social influence. The results indicated that OBC can accurately distinguish mature tags generated by a strong expert consensus from other tags, and outperform Shannon entropy. The findings support tag-based learning, and provide insights and tools for the design of applications involving tags, such as tag recommendation and tag-based organization.	capability maturity model;web 2.0	Kuo-Hao Tang;Li-Chen Tsai;Sheue-Ling Hwang	2016	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23454	domain analysis;text mining;computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval;entropy	Web+IR	-34.59222568066484	-55.06830065436205	41264

The documents are full scientific papers. This problem imposes several challenges, such as identifying text passages that contain relevant information, collecting the relevant information pieces, populating a database and a data warehouse, and mining these data. For this purpose, this paper proposes the IEDSS-Bio, an environment for Information Extraction and Decision Support System in Biomedical domain. In a case study, experiments with machine learning for identifying relevant text passages (disease and treatment effects, and patients number information on Sickle Cell Anemia papers) showed that the best results (95.9% accuracy) were obtained with a statistical method and the use of preprocessing techniques to resample the examples and to eliminate noise.	algorithm;data mining;database;decision support system;experiment;information extraction;machine learning;parallel computing;population;preprocessor;scientific literature;text mining	Pablo Freire Matos;Leonardo O.

However, this assumption must be considered grossly inaccurate since uncertainty is intrinsic to the document retrieval process. The inability of the standard Boolean model to deal effectively with the inherent fallibility of retrieval decisions is the main reason for a number of serious deficiencies exhibited by present-day operational retrieval systems. This article reviews recent advances in information retrieval research and examines their practical potential for overcoming these deficiencies. The primary source for this review is the subsequent articles that comprise this special issue of  Information Processing & Management , although earlier results published elsewhere have also been considered.

We describe and evaluate a linkage protocol for Utah's Controlled Substance Database. Prescriptions (N = 22,401,506) dated 2005-2009 were linked using The Link King software and patient identifiers (e.g. names, dates of birth) for 2,232,725 patients. Review of 998 randomly selected record pairs classified 46 percent as definitely correct links and 54 percent as probably correct links. A correct link could not be confirmed for <1 percent. None were classified as probably incorrect links or definitely incorrect links. Record set reviews (N = 100 patients/set for 10 set sizes, randomly selected) classified 27-49 percent as definitely correct links and 39-63 percent as probably correct links. Fewer had too little information to confirm a link (5%-22%) or were probably incorrect (0%-6%). None were definitely incorrect. Overall, results suggest that Utah's Controlled Substance Database records were correctly linked. These data may be useful for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of patient-controlled substance prescription histories.	classification;cross-sectional data;forty nine;identifier;linkage (software);name;patients;percent (qualifier value);randomness;registries;review [publication type];controlled substance;genetic linkage	April F.

Structured news reports are XML documents, where the textentries are restricted to individual words or simple phrases, such as names and domain-specific terminology, and numbers and units. We assume structured news reports do not require natural language processing. Fusion rules are a form of scripting language that define how structured news reports should be merged. The antecedent of a fusion rule is a call to investigate the information in the structured news reports and the background knowledge, and the consequent of a fusion rule is a formula specifying an action to be undertaken to form a merged report. It is expected that a set of fusion rules is defined for any given application. In this paper we extend the approach to handling probability values, degrees of beliefs, or necessity measures associated with textentries in the news reports. We present the formal definition for each of these types of uncertainty and explain how they can be handled using fusion rules. We also discuss the methods of detecting inconsistencies among sources. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This research review will familiarize the reader with current research applicable to the development of image retrieval systems and provides additional material for exploring the topic further, both in print and online. The discussion will cover several broad areas, among them classification and indexing systems used for describing image collections and research initiatives into image access focusing on image attributes, users, queries, tasks, and cognitive aspects of searching. Prospects for the future of image access, including an outline of future research initiatives, are discussed. Further research in each of these areas will provide basic data which will inform and enrich image access system design and will hopefully provide a richer, more flexible, and satisfactory environment for searching for and discovering images. Harnessing the true power of the digital image environment will only be possible when image retrieval systems are coherently designed from principles derived from the fullest range of applicable disciplines, rather than from isolated or fragmented perspectives.	ada semantic interface specification;digital image;image retrieval;peering;systems design;theory	Corinne Jörgensen	1999	Computers and the Humanities	10.1023/A:1002065412222	information;content analysis;image retrieval;computer science;image;data mining;semiotics;linguistics;multimedia;information retrieval;digital image;systems design	HCI	-37.66536241360565	-66.3048793717596	41425

The intelligent system autonomously varies control parameters to generate different haptic effects on the robotic device. The robotic device is able to apply both resistive and assistive forces for guiding the patient during the exercise. The fuzzy logic based decision-making system estimates muscle fatigue of the patient using exercise performance and generates a combination of resistive and assistive forces so that the stroke survivor can exercise for longer durations with increasing control. The fuzzy logic based system is initially developed using a study with healthy subjects and preliminary results are also presented to validate the developed system with healthy subjects. The next stage of this work will collect data from stroke survivors for further development of the system.	artificial intelligence;assistive technology;autonomous robot;cerebrovascular accident;chronic fatigue syndrome;decision making;estimated;fuzzy logic;haptic device component;haptic technology;patients;physical therapy exercises;stroke rehabilitation;survivors	Rajibul Huq;Rosalie Wang;Elaine C.

This paper attempts to quantify the societal value of the WC by tracking the downstream use of images found on the platform. We take a random sample of 10,000 images from WC and apply an automated reverse-image search to each, recording when and where they are used 'in the wild'. We detect 54,758 downstream uses of the initial sample and we characterise these at the level of generic and country-code top-level domains (TLDs). We analyse the impact of specific variables on the odds that an image is used. The random sampling technique enables us to estimate overall value of all images contained on the platform. Drawing on the method employed by Heald et al (2015), we find a potential contribution of USD $28.9 billion from downstream use of Wikimedia Commons images over the lifetime of the project.	downstream (software development);image retrieval;interactive media;monte carlo method;reverse image search;sampling (signal processing);writing commons	Kristofer Erickson;Felix Rodriguez Perez;Jesus Rodriguez Perez	2018		10.1145/3233391.3233533	information retrieval;public domain;initial sample;peer production;sampling (statistics);interactive media;odds;commons;computer science	NLP	-46.36118322025481	-77.19651266290148	41529

This has been tackled by means of systems that analyse the user query and try to use the grammar features of each language to find a possible answer. This approach has failed to work for users of other languages or for documents in different languages, save for a few languages for which the query can be machine translated to the target language or all languages. Where there are more languages, however, this approach is impracticable for information extraction in a reasonable time. The massively multilingual approach (> 6 languages) necessarily involves the languageindependent representation of the contents, that is, using an interlingua. This paper reports a promising early trial of a method that launches a query in any language against a language-independent representation of the document set using a general-purpose UNL interlingua and receives a precise response.	archive;compiler;general-purpose markup language;information extraction;language-independent specification;software quality assurance;universal networking language	Jesús Cardeñosa;Carolina Gallardo;Miguel A.

However, manual indexing is expensive. Automated indexing methods in general use terms found in the document. Thesaurus descriptors are complex terms that are often not used in documents or have specific meanings within the thesaurus; therefore most weighting schemes of automated indexing methods are not suited to select thesaurus descriptors. In this paper a linear associative system is described that uses similarity values extracted from a large corpus of manually indexed documents to construct a rank ordering of the descriptors for a given document title. The system is adaptive and has to be tuned with a training sample of records for the specific task. The system was tested on a corpus of some 80,000 bibliographic records. The results show a high variability with changing parameter values. This indicates that it is very important to empirically adapt the model to the specific situation it is used in. The overall median of the manually assigned descriptors in the automatically generated ranked list of all 3,631 descriptors is 14 for the set used to adapt the system and 11 for a test set not used in the optimization process. This result shows that the optimization is not a fitting to a specific training set but a real adaptation of the model to the setting	thesaurus	Reginald Ferber	1997		10.1007/BFb0026731	natural language processing;search engine indexing;vector space;ranking;computer science;data mining;database;weighting;natural language;world wide web;information retrieval	Vision	-35.445189172455365	-62.419326617044106	41561

Our goal was to evaluate the performance and robustness of our recently developed commercial-grade CLIR systems for English and Asian languages. The main contribution of this article is the investigation of different strategies, their interactions in both monolingual and bilingual retrieval tasks, and their respective contributions to operational retrieval systems in the context of NTCIR-4. We report results of Japanese and English monolingual retrieval and results of Japanese-to-English bilingual retrieval. In monolingual retrieval analysis, we examine two special properties of the NTCIR experimental design (two levels of relevance and identical queries in multiple languages) and explore how they interact with strategies of our retrieval system, including pseudo-relevance feedback, multi-word term down-weighting, and term weight merging strategies. Our analysis shows that the choice of language (English or Japanese) does not have a significant impact on retrieval performance. Query expansion is slightly more effective with relaxed judgments than with rigid judgments. For better retrieval performance, weights of multi-word terms should be lowered. In the bilingual retrieval analysis, we aim to identify robust strategies that are effective when used alone and when used in combination with other strategies. We examine cross-lingual specific strategies such as translation disambiguation and translation structuring, as well as general strategies such as pseudo-relevance feedback and multi-word term down-weighting. For shorter title topics, pseudo-relevance feedback is a major performance enhancer, but translation structuring affects retrieval performance negatively when used alone or in combination with other strategies. All experimented strategies improve retrieval performance for the longer description topics, with pseudo-relevance feedback and translation structuring as the major contributors.	cross-language information retrieval;design of experiments;interaction;judgment (mathematical logic);query expansion;relevance feedback;statistical machine translation;weight function;word-sense disambiguation	Yan Qu;David A.

We apply Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA; Pustejovsky, Hanks, & Rumshisky, 2004) to extra ct conceptual dimensions according to context. The dynamic nature of these concepts is exemplified with the case study of SAND. On the other hand, knowledge patterns (KPs) often convey different conceptual re lations and are therefore polysemic structures. The development of pattern-ba sed constraints can help to disambiguate them and at the same time avoid concep tual noise, which would be a first step towards the systematization of auto ma ic knowledge extraction.

In such a home-care scenario, a persistent need arises for efficiently monitoring the patient contacts and the MCC's functionality, in order to effectively manage and interpret the large volume of medical data collected during the patient sessions with the system, and to assess the use of MCC resources. Software agents were adopted to provide the means to accomplish such real-time information-processing tasks, due to their autonomous, reactive and/or proactive nature, and their effectiveness in dynamic environments by incorporating coordination strategies. Specifically, the objective of the MAS is to monitor the MCC environment, detect important cases, and inform the healthcare and administrative personnel via alert messages, notifications, recommendations, and reports, prompting them for actions. The main aim of this paper is to present the overall design and implementation of a proposed MAS, emphasizing its functional model and architecture, as well as on the agent interactions and the knowledge-sharing mechanism incorporated, in the context of a generic MCC.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;cns disorder;chronic disease;compliance behavior;continuous operation;disease management;entity name part qualifier - adopted;function model;generic drugs;health services;how true feel alert right now;interaction;intranet;merkel cell carcinoma;multi-agent system;patients;published comment;real-time data;report;requirement;software agent;telemedicine;message;notification	Vassilis Koutkias;Ioanna Chouvarda;Nicos Maglaveras	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine	10.1109/TITB.2005.847511	simulation;medicine;information processing;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software agent;data mining;world wide web	Visualization	-54.67728416231727	-62.02590305670264	42079

The Cranfield experiment paradigm has been dominant for the in-vitro evaluation of IR systems. Alternative to this paradigm, laboratory-based user studies have been widely used to evaluate interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems, and at the same time investigate users’ information searching behaviours. Major drawbacks of laboratory-based user studies for evaluating IIR systems include the high monetary and temporal costs involved in setting up and running those experiments, the lack of heterogeneity amongst the user population and the limited scale of the experiments, which usually involve a relatively restricted set of users. In this paper, we propose an alternative experimental methodology to laboratory-based user studies. Our novel experimental methodology uses a crowdsourcing platform as a means of engaging study participants. Through crowdsourcing, our experimental methodology can capture user interactions and searching behaviours at a lower cost, with more data, and within a shorter period than traditional laboratory-based user studies, and therefore can be used to assess the performances of IIR systems. In this article, we show the characteristic differences of our approach with respect to traditional IIR experimental and evaluation procedures. We also perform a use case study comparing crowdsourcing-based evaluation with laboratory-based evaluation of IIR systems, which can serve as a tutorial for setting up crowdsourcing-based IIR evaluations.	amazon mechanical turk;crowdsourcing;experiment;infinite impulse response;information retrieval;interaction;performance;programming paradigm;the turk;usability testing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Guido Zuccon;Teerapong Leelanupab;Stewart Whiting;Emine Yılmaz;Joemon M.

The changing dimensions of local communities increase the need for individual preparedness of our healthrelated practitioners. Information communication technology (ICT) of low-richness medium for public health and community outreach practitioners is discussed as a means to initiate interoperable communications in these local communities for emergency response. We seek to answer: What ICT devices do local public health and community outreach practitioners need to be individually prepared as front-line responders? An assessment of front-line responder response characteristics are presented and reviewed to advance discussions surrounding the need for individual preparedness in a local community. Our assessment also compares the benefits of ham radio operations known for their longevity and reliability in crisis where communication protocols are established to modern ICT that are plug-and-play. The contribution of this research is to present a potential connection towards e-public health where health-related front-line responders could benefit.	interoperability;plug and play	Elizabeth Gomez;Kathleen Higginbotham	2006			community organization;environmental health;environmental resource management;political science;socioeconomics;community building	HCI	-59.42260471111873	-61.62182201204577	42225

98611aeef0cc5f0d9759e34c91bdd1ccbfc3cdc4	m-therapy: a multisensor framework for in-home therapy management: a social therapy of things perspective		Social Internet of Things is assumed to provide health services by incorporating social networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although, much development in therapy monitoring has been observed recently, few advancements have been achieved in the domain of in-home therapy. Existing industrial and medical solutions require complex and expensive hardware and software that are impractical for home use. Another challenge for in-home therapy is that therapists cannot confirm whether patients are conducting the therapy correctly and for the prescribed number of times. To address these challenges, we propose the multisensor therapy (m-Therapy) framework, in which multiple gesture-tracking sensors and environmental sensors are used to collect therapy and ambient data. The m-Therapy framework compresses the collected data and uploads to a big data server. The framework uses a model of the therapy to guide a patient performing therapy exercises outside medical institutions and even at home. Ambient IoT sensors can help maintain an appropriate ambient environment, which is generally maintained at the medical institutions. We have developed analytics that can provide live or statistical kinematic data, including rotational and angular range of motion of the joints of interest, and ambient environmental data, which can be shared with therapists and caregivers. We present our findings, which shows that the proposed m-Therapy monitoring system can be deployed in real-life scenarios.	angularjs;augmented reality;big data;computer hardware;futures studies;high- and low-level;internet of things;real life;research data archiving;sensor;server (computing);social network;television;upload;user interface;virtual reality	Md.

We investigated the use of one or more sensory channels to cue dynamic control allocations to a human operator or computer, as part of AA, and to support operator system/situation awareness (SA) and performance. It was expected that complex auditory and visual cueing through system interfaces might address previously observed SA decrements due to unannounced or unexpected automation-state changes as part of adaptive system control. AA of the telerobot was based on a predetermined schedule of manualand supervisory-control allocations occurring when operator workload changes were expected due to the stages of a teleoperation task. The task involved simulated underwater mine disposal and 32 participants were exposed to four types of cueing of task-phase and automation-state changes including icons, earcons, bi-modal (combined) cues and no cues at all. Fully automated control of the telerobot combined with human monitoring produced superior performance compared to completely manual system control and AA. Cueing, in general, led to better performance than none, but did not appear to completely eliminate temporary SA deficits due to changes in control and associated operator reorienting. Bi-modal cueing of dynamic automation-state changes was more supportive of SA than modal (single sensory channel) cueing. The use of icons and earcons appeared to produce no additional perceived workload in comparison no cueing. The results of this research may serve as an applicable guide for the design of human–computer interfaces for real telerobotic systems, including those used for military tactical operations, which support operator achievement and maintenance of SA and promote performance in using AA. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, ontology itself is not sufficient for fully representing the complex knowledge needed in classification schemes which are continuously evolving. This article describes the application of SWRL/ OWL-DL to the representation of knowledge intended for proper classification of a complex neurological condition, namely epilepsy. The authors present a rigorous and expandable approach to the ontological classification of epileptic seizures based on the 1981ILAE classification. It provides a classification knowledge base that can be extended with rules that describe constraints in SWRL. Moreover, by transforming an OWL classification scheme into JESS (rule engine in Java platform) facts and by transforming SWRL constraints into JESS, logical inferences and reasoning provide a mechanism to discover new knowledge and facts. The logic representation of epileptic classification amounts to greater community understanding among practitioners, knowledge reuse and interoperability.

To enforce semantic specification, ontology has been widely used in many clinical diagnostic decision support systems (Yu, 2006). In particular, neurology, as a subspecialty, has many native built in semantics. Additionally, neurological conditions are unique and may not be very familiar to other medical specialists. The medications prescribed by neurologists and the investigations (e.g. Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Nerve Conduction Study/ Electromyography (NCS/ EMG) etc) are often different from other medical subspecialties. Hence, having a specialty specific ontology is essential to integrate neurology with other medical software systems. It is particularly important when developing a specific ontology system for epilepsy, a subspeciality within neurology. Epilepsy is a condition which is frequently encountered by general practitioners before these patients get referred to a neurologist. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition with significant morbidity and increased risk of mortality compared to the general population. Proper diagnosis and management is of essential importance not only in the short term but also for long term prognosis. In this article we present a rigorous and expandable approach to ontological classification of the epileptic seizures based on the 1981ILAE classification. Section 2 identifies the role of ontology for developing knowledge specification of domain concept, particularly in the context of clinical decision support systems, by a literature review. Section 3 outlines the complexities involved in classification of epilepsy type and syndrome. Section 4 describes the development of epilepsy ontology for knowledge modeling and reasoning. Finally, we evaluate the ontology in the context of clinical decision making. oNtoloGY for CraftiNG sPeCifiCatioNs of DoMaiN CoNCePts Historically, expert systems have been used to assist in medical decision making involving diagnosis, prediction, evaluation, monitoring (Heathfield, 1999; Hernandez, Sancho, Belmonte, Sierra, & Sanz, 1994; Keles & Keles, 2008; Liebowitz, 1997; Tsumoto, 2003). By encapsulating domain knowledge into a set of rules, expert systems simulate the performance of one or more human experts with expert knowledge and experience in a specific problem domain. With the advent of Semantic Web movement, a growing interest in ontologies is being noticed as means of representing human knowledge and as critical components in knowledge management over the Web. Various research communities commonly assume that ontologies are the appropriate modeling structure for representing knowledge. While expert systems emphasize technology, ontologies emphasize knowledge. Ontologies make a domain specific knowledge base reusable, sharable and interoperable. Domain-specific questions can then be answered by reasoning over such highly specialized knowledge. Ontologies have evolved in computer science as computational artifacts to provide computer systems with a conceptual yet computational model of a particular domain of interest. While expert systems provide excellent tools for reasoning with domain rules, they often lack the means to resolve semantic ambiguities inherent in the predicates and related facts. Hence, a key requirement is to reason in a semantically consistent way is to exploit both the ontology and the rule-based knowledge to draw inferences. 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/modeling-classification-schemeepileptic-seizures/38944"""	algorithm;business rules engine;clinical decision support system;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;computation;computational model;computer science;computer simulation;domain-specific modeling;electroencephalography;electromyography;expert system;fax;intel technology journal;interoperability;java;jess;knowledge base;knowledge management;knowledge modeling;logic programming;medical decision making;ontology (information science);pa-risc;problem domain;resonance;semantic web rule language;software system;uniform resource identifier;web language;web ontology language;web page;world wide web	Bhaswati Ghosh;Partha S.

72c831e37ea3cde09531baef65962d898c048434	the temporal aspects of clinical guidelines		"""Temporal aspects play a major role within clinical guidelines. Temporal issues arise when considering both guidelines per se, and the application of guidelines to specific patients. As a matter of fact, guidelines per se specify different diagnostic and\or therapeutic patterns, and temporal constraints on the intended times of execution of the actions they contain are an intrinsic part of guidelines themselves. Moreover, guidelines must be executed on the basis of patients' data, which are intrinsically temporal data (consider, e.g., the time when symptoms hold). Devising suitable representation formalisms to properly model such pieces of temporal information is a challenging task, for which several solutions have been proposed in the last years. Besides representation formalisms, temporal reasoning methodologies are also needed. Temporal abstraction is needed in order to infer abstract temporal data (as described in guideline action conditions) from """"raw"""" timestamped patient data. Moreover, temporal constraint propagationis also needed, both at acquisition and at execution time. During acquisition, temporal constraint propagation is used to detect whether the temporal constraints in the guideline are consistent. At execution time, it is needed in order to check whether the actual time of execution of actions has respected the temporal constraints in the guideline, and to detect which are the next candidate actions to be executed, on the basis of the temporal constraints in the guideline. This chapter sketches some of the most important recent results about the above issues."""	execution;inference;local consistency;patients;run time (program lifecycle phase);software propagation	Paolo Terenziani;Efrat German;Yuval Shahar	2008	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-58603-873-1-81	knowledge management;data mining;medicine	AI	-52.29500857525941	-67.68502811323805	42367

In particular it does not suffer from random answers, question misunderstanding and can cover every parts of the text. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the objective understanding of a learner by analyzing his eye movements while reading. We conduct our experiment on Japanese texts and try to predict, by analyzing the eye gaze, how many questions about the texts the reader will be able to answer to. We show that we obtain 5.27% of error in the number of correct answers estimation by using eye gaze features. As a comparison, we try to predict the number of correct answers by using the reader's self assessment understanding and show that it leads to 9.04% error.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is one of the most widely used classification systems for clinical problems and procedures. In Italy the 9th revision of the standard is used and recommended in primary care for encoding prescription documents. This paper describes a statistical and terminological study to assess ICD-9-CM use in primary care and its comparison to the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), specifically designed for primary care. The study has been conducted by analyzing the clinical records of about 199,000 patients provided by a set of 166 General Practitioners (GPs) in different Italian areas. The analysis has been based on several techniques for detecting coding practice and errors, like natural language processing and text-similarity comparison. Results showed that the selected GPs do not fully exploit the diseases and procedures descriptive capabilities of ICD-9-CM due to its complexity. Furthermore, compared to ICPC-2, it resulted less feasible in the primary care setting, particularly for the high granularity of the structure and for the lack of reasons for encounters.	acm international collegiate programming contest;controlled vocabulary;natural language processing;sensor	Elena Cardillo;Maria Teresa Chiaravalloti;Erika Pasceri	2015		10.1145/2750511.2750525	library science;medicine;pediatrics	SE	-50.52923011584276	-68.09261564232094	42444

The Radiology Information System (RIS) database was interrogated to obtain a file containing all examinations recorded within a one-month period. Two sectors were specifically studied: abdominal ultrasound and chest radiography. Each of these sectors had one reader per day. The periods studied were October 2001 (before implementation of electronic signature) and February 2002 (3 months after electronic signature implementation). For the abdominal ultrasound examinations, the median time from transcription to final signature decreased from 11 days to 3 days with the introduction of electronic signature (P < 0.001). For the chest radiographs, the median time from transcription to final signature decreased from 10 days to 5 days with the introduction of electronic signature (P < 0.001). Electronic signature significantly shortens the time interval between transcription and finalization of radiology reports.	abdominal abscess;electronic signature;information system;medical imaging;plain chest x-ray;radiography;radiology information systems;relational interface system;timeline fluoride releasing resin;transabdominal ultrasound;transcription (software)	Luigi Lepanto	2003	Journal of Digital Imaging	10.1007/s10278-003-1730-3	electronic signature;real-time computing;simulation;radiology;medicine;computer science;ultrasound	Security	-56.98312682716399	-65.82680352032276	42755

d99173934f5f8eb963ab49bda346510c51287227	fedstats promotes statistical literacy	statistical literacy	"""HE MAJOR STATISTICAL AGENCIES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE CREATED a publicly accessible digital library called FedStats (www.FedStats.gov). The library's holdings—accessed by millions of people each month—are stored and maintained independently by agencies across all executive departments of the U.S. government. This operation is in direct contrast with most other nations, where a single, centralized statistical agency exists. FedStats users will eventually be able to access the statistical holdings of more than 70 agencies, each with an annual budget of more than $500,000 for the creation of statistics [2]. These independent collections contain a variety of digital materials that are generally divided into two types: text-based or numeric-based. Text-based materials include electronic versions of paper publications, articles prepared by staff for publication in books and journals, internal memoranda, and items written specifically for the Web. Many of these documents contain graphs and tables. Moreover , it is not unusual for the word (versus numeric) content to be a very small percentage of the total. For example, the monthly press release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on the """" Employment Situation """" usually has 20 pages with several tables embedded in the text and an appendix of 15 tables spread over 14 pages containing over 5,000 statistics from two surveys, one of which is the Current Population Survey (CPS). In addition to these typical library materials, holdings of numeric-based information—primarily aggregate-level statistics—are also made Web-accessible. The means of access varies from simple spread-sheets to relational databases. For example, BLS provides users with the ability to extract subsets of statistics from a database (called LABSTAT) it maintains of over 200,000 time series. Approximately 20,000 of these series are CPS-based as compared to the less than 3,000 contained in the monthly press release. Thus, one can see that only a small fraction of the statistics regularly computed are available in Web-accessible, word-based documents. Another type of numeric-based holding is a database of individual unit/variable-level information, for example, the responses of person 1 to question 1, person 1 to question 2, person n to question k. In the case of the CPS, a monthly probability-based sample of more than 47,000 households containing around 95,000 persons aged 15 or older provides responses to a series of questions designed to determine their labor force classification and various characteristics of their jobs. In any particular month, these same people may"""	aggregate data;book;centralized computing;digital library;embedded system;graph (discrete mathematics);job stream;memorandum;relational database;table (database);text-based (computing);time series;world wide web	Cathryn S.

To our knowledge there have been no studies investigating whether and how ambulance officers use online evidence systems if provided. We surveyed ambulance officers to examine their knowledge and use of the Clinical Information Access Program (CIAP), an online evidence system providing 24-hour access to information to support evidence-based practice.   METHODS A questionnaire was completed by 278 ambulance officers in New South Wales, Australia. Comparisons were made between those who used CIAP and officers who had heard of, but not used CIAP.   RESULTS Half the sample (48.6%) knew of, and 28.8% had used CIAP. Users were more likely to have heard of CIAP from a CIAP representative/presentation, non-users from written information. Compared to ambulance officers who had heard of but had not used CIAP, users were more likely to report better computer skills and that their supervisors regarded use of CIAP as a legitimate part of ambulance officers' clinical role. The main reasons for non-use were lack of access(49.0%) and training(31.4%). Of users, 51.3% rated their skills at finding information as good/very good, 67.5% found the information sought all/most of the time, 87.3% believed CIAP had the potential to improve patient care and 28.2% had directly experienced this. Most access to CIAP occurred at home. The databases frequently accessed were MIMS (A medicines information database) (73.8%) and MEDLINE(67.5%). The major journals accessed were Journal of Emergency Nursing(37.5%), American Journal of Medicine(30.0%) and JAMA(27.5%).   CONCLUSION Over half of ambulance officers had not heard of CIAP. The proportion who knew about and used CIAP was also low. Reasons for this appear to be a work culture not convinced of CIAP's relevance to pre-hospital patient care and lack of access to CIAP at work. Ambulance officers who used CIAP accessed it primarily from home and valued it highly. Lack of access to CIAP at central work locations deprives ambulance officers of many of the benefits of an online evidence system.	24-hour clock;asg software solutions;accessibility;ambulances;database;digital history;first draft of a report on the edvac;freedom of information laws by country;health policy;information access;journal;manuscripts;microwave;patients;relevance;benefit;citation;interest	Johanna I.

A further goal was to assess the importance of individual operator capabilities when providing adaptive aiding.   BACKGROUND Psychophysiological measures are useful for monitoring cognitive workload in laboratory and real-world settings. They can be recorded without intruding into task performance and can be analyzed in real time, making them candidates for providing operator functional state estimates. These estimates could be used to determine if and when system intervention should be provided to assist the operator to improve system performance.   METHODS Adaptive automation was implemented while operators performed an uninhabited aerial vehicle task. Psychophysiological data were collected and an artificial neural network was used to detect periods of high and low mental workload in real time. The high-difficulty task levels used to initiate the adaptive automation were determined separately for each operator, and a group-derived mean difficulty level was also used.   RESULTS Psychophysiologically determined aiding significantly improved performance when compared with the no-aiding conditions. Improvement was greater when adaptive aiding was provided based on individualized criteria rather than on group-derived criteria. The improvements were significantly greater than when the aiding was randomly provided.   CONCLUSION These results show that psychophysiologically determined operator functional state assessment in real time led to performance improvement when included in closed loop adaptive automation with a complex task.   APPLICATION Potential future applications of this research include enhanced workstations using adaptive aiding that would be driven by operator functional state.		Glenn F. Wilson;Christopher A.

The web-based approach used in the Norwegian clinical trial on wellbeing for chronically ill patients can be seen as a very small health care community for the patients. After introducing the NEXES project, the technical platform used for the wellbeing case, and the collaboration notation in BPMN, a specific case is described in detail and related to how the collaboration between the patient and health care stakeholders can be seen as a small group. Finally reflections are given on how the clinical trial could be extended by adding a ‘competition’ element using online communities in order to motivate the patients to do their rehabilitation exercises, and which technology standard could be used for this approach.	amiga reflections;business process model and notation;online community;virtual community;web application;world wide web	Leendert W.

5b157dfae87e36454dc305f762f0dfda889aac8b	a novel approach for upper limb robotic rehabilitation for stroke patients		This paper presents a novel neuro-rehabilitation system for recovery of arm and hand motor functions involved in reaching and grasping. The system provides arm weight support and robotic assistance of the hand closing/opening within specific exercises in virtual reality. A user interface allows the clinicians to perform an easy parametrization of the virtual scenario, customizing the exercises and the robotic assistance to the needs of the patient and encouraging training of the hand with proper recruitment of the residual motor functions. Feasibility of the proposed rehabilitation system was evaluated through an experimental rehabilitation session, conducted by clinicians with 4 healthy participants and 2 stroke patients. All subjects were able to perform the proposed exercises with parameters adapted to their specific motor capabilities. All patients were able to use the proposed system and to accomplishing the rehabilitation tasks following the suggestion of the clinicians. The effectiveness of the proposed neuro-rehabilitation will be evaluated in an imminent prolonged clinical study involving more stroke patients.	rehabilitation robotics	Michele Barsotti;Edoardo Sotgiu;Daniele De Leonardis;Mine Sarac;Giada Sgherri;Giuseppe Lamola;Chiara Fanciullacci;Caterina Procopio;Carmelo Chisari;Antonio Frisoli	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-42324-1_45	physical medicine and rehabilitation;rehabilitation;haptic technology;stroke;computer science;user interface	Robotics	-44.30008126786509	-52.511486283311456	43151

f466c6d8c5b2279c97a40e838b1c36b6fdf15d06	medline as a source of just-in-time answers to clinical questions		Clinicians increasingly use handheld devices to support evidence-based practice and for clinical decision support. However, support of clinical decisions through information retrieval from MEDLINE(R) and other databases lags behind popular daily activities such as patient information or drug formulary look-up. The objective of the current study is to determine whether relevant information can be retrieved from MEDLINE to answer clinical questions using a handheld device at the point of care. Analysis of search and retrieval results for 108 clinical questions asked by members of clinical teams during 28 daily rounds in a 12-bed intensive care unit confirm MEDLINE as a potentially valuable resource for just-in-time answers to clinical questions. Answers to 93 (86%) questions were found in MEDLINE by two resident physicians using handheld devices. The majority of answers, 88.9% and 97.7% respectively, were found during rounds. Strategies that facilitated timely retrieval of results include using PubMed(R) Clinical Queries and Related Articles, spell check, and organizing retrieval results into topical clusters. Further possible improvements in organization of retrieval results such as automatic semantic clustering and providing patient outcome information along with the titles of the retrieved articles are discussed.	clinical decision support system;cluster analysis;database;formulary (model document);information retrieval;lookup table;medline;mobile device;organizing (structure);spell checker;intensive care unit;statistical cluster	Dina Demner-Fushman;Susan E.

We sought to measure the attitudes and experience of Dutch general practitioners towards clinical decision support.   METHODS A preliminary survey was created based on questions from published surveys, modified with the results of interviews. The final web-based survey was administered to 43 general practitioners in a practice area where a decision support implementation is planned.   RESULTS Thirty general practitioners (70%) completed the survey. Most felt that decision support is a good idea (23/30), although fewer reported positive experience with decision support (10/30). Participants were supportive of rules and guidelines, but commonly had the sense that there were too many alerts.   CONCLUSION Dutch clinicians are positive about decision support, but future efforts should try to reduce the perception of overload, for example by ensuring that alerts are relevant and choosing less interruptive forms of notification for less severe alerts.	alert brand of caffeine;attitude;choose (action);clinical decision support system;decision support systems, clinical;patients;rule (guideline);scientific publication;web application;general practice (field);notification	Stephanie Medlock;Saeid Eslami;Marjan Askari;Henk J.

This paper introduces a new problem, called query taxonomy generation, which is trying to organize users’ queries into a hierarchical structure of topic classes. Such a query taxonomy provides a basis for the in-depth analysis of users’ queries on a larger scale and can benefit many information retrieval systems. The proposed approach to this problem consists of two computational processes: hierarchical query clustering to generate a query taxonomy from scratch, and query categorization to place new-arrived queries into the taxonomy. The obtained results of preliminary experiment have shown the potential of the proposed approach in generating taxonomies for queries, which may be useful in various Web information retrieval applications.	automatic taxonomy construction;categorization;cluster analysis;computation;hierarchical and recursive queries in sql;information retrieval;taxonomy (general);web query classification	Shui-Lung Chuang;Lee-Feng Chien	2003	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684520310489032	sargable;query optimization;query expansion;web query classification;ranking;computer science;data mining;database;web search query;world wide web;information retrieval;query language;search engine;taxonomy;spatial query	Web+IR	-35.029106716690784	-58.69240521199434	43707

There is little research on implementation of addiction-related interventions in primary care, particularly in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) that provide primary care to underserved populations. We used mixed methods to examine three FQHCs' implementation of Seva, a smart-phone app that offers patients online support/discussion, health-tracking, and tools for coping with cravings, and offers clinicians information about patients' health tracking and relapses. We examined (a) clinicians' initial perspectives about implementing Seva, and (b) the first year of implementation at Site 1.   METHODS Prior to staggered implementation at three FQHCs (Midwest city in WI vs. rural town in MT vs. metropolitan NY), interviews, meetings, and focus groups were conducted with 53 clinicians to identify core themes of initial expectations about implementation. One year into implementation at Site 1, clinicians there were re-interviewed. Their reports were supplemented by quantitative data on clinician and patient use of Seva.   RESULTS Clinicians anticipated that Seva could help patients and make behavioral health appointments more efficient, but they were skeptical that physicians would engage with Seva (given high caseloads), and they were uncertain whether patients would use Seva. They were concerned about legal obligations for monitoring patients' interactions online, including possible """"cries for help"""" or inappropriate interactions. One year later at Site 1, behavioral health care providers, rather than physicians, had incorporated Seva into patient care, primarily by discussing it during appointments. Given workflow/load concerns, only a few key clinicians monitored health tracking/relapses and prompted outreach when needed; two researchers monitored the discussion board and alerted the clinic as needed. Clinician turnover/leave complicated this approach. Contrary to clinicians' initial concerns, patients showed sustained, mutually supportive use of Seva, with few instances of misuse.   CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the value of (a) focusing implementation on behavioral health care providers rather than physicians, (b) assigning a few individuals (not necessarily clinicians) to monitor health tracking, relapses, and the discussion board, (c) anticipating turnover/leave and having designated replacements. Patients showed sustained, positive use of Seva.

Twenty three medical, nursing and allied health clinicians working in Australia (Victoria) participated in qualitative research examining work practices with P&S for patient care. They criticised a slow, inefficient eHealth information system (eHIS) environment permeated by usability errors. EHealth systems expanded workloads and system demands were onerous, increasing the clinicians' scepticism of reliance on information technology. Consequently many clinicians had developed trade-offs to avoid reliance an eHIS. The trade-offs include IT support avoidance and shared passwords to PKI and computer accounts. Handover-sheets populated by transcribed notes were circulated between all clinicians present. The practices ensure paper persistence and escalate P&S threats to data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Study evidence suggests poor eHISs hamper patient care and may represent a larger P&S threat than indicated by studies to date.	confidentiality;information system;password;persistence (computer science);pervasive informatics;population;public key infrastructure;threat (computer);usability;user space;victoria (3d figure);workspace	Juanita Fernando	2009	2009 International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions, (ICITST)		public relations;medicine;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-58.65704292086731	-62.63972770608217	43870

One of the challenges in creating good quality documentation templates has been the inability to address specialized clinical disciplines and adapt to local clinical practices. A one-size-fits-all approach leads to poor adoption and inefficiencies in the documentation process. On the other hand, the cost associated with manual generation of documentation templates is significant. Consequently there is a need for at least partial automation of the template generation process. We propose an approach and methodology for the creation of structured documentation templates for diabetes using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

VA developed and deployed a computer-based disability exam documentation system in order to improve exam report quality and timeliness. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing joint disability examinations supported by computerized templates to the examinations documented via dictation, to determine if the system met the intended goals or had unintended consequences. Consenting veterans were randomized to undergo exams documented using computerized templates or via dictation. We compared exam report quality, documentation time costs, encounter length, total time to fulfill an exam request with a finalized exam report, and veteran satisfaction. Computer-based templates resulted in disability exam reports that had higher quality scores (p. 0.042) and were returned to the requesting office faster than exam reports created via dictation (p. 0.02).  Documentation time and veteran satisfaction were similar for both the documentation techniques. Encounter length was significantly longer for the template group. Computer-based templates impacted the VA disability evaluation system by improving report quality scores and production time and lengthening encounter times. Oversight bodies have called for mandated use of computer-based templates nationwide. We believe mandates regarding use of health information technology should be guided by data regarding its positive and negative impacts.	documentation;randomized algorithm;unintended consequences	Steven H.

Conditions to isolate and identify the SET were determined and reproduced in experiments for further analysis. Students and seven professional categories of adults (N = 77) were involved in three experimental conditions (control group, group with prior warning, group with final control) while individually performing a task with similar characteristics compared to real operating conditions and under moderate time-pressure. The results were: (1) highest performance with prior warning and (2) demonstration that academic and professional training favor the SET. After discussing different cognitive processes potentially related to the SET, we described (3) the psycho-cognitive process underlying the SET: Initial Goal Fixedness (IGF), a combination of the anchoring of the initial goal of the activity with a focus on the features of the initial goal favored by an Einstellung effect. This suggested coping with the negative effect of the SET by impeding the IGF rather than trying to increase the subjects’ awareness at the expense of their health. Extensions to other high-risk industries were discussed.	cognition;experiment;identity governance framework;mcgurk effect	Philippe Fauquet-Alekhine;Anne Boucherand	2015	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-015-0351-1	psychology;attentional control;simulation;performance;engineering;social psychology	HCI	-48.31267859285386	-55.293019827208035	44090

The experimental design involved two between-subjects variables: mood induction (none induction, positive induction, negative induction) and gambling attitude (problem gamblers, healthy individuals), and one withinsubjects variable: bias-inducing contextual cues (gambler’s fallacy, illusion of control, wishful thinking, endowment effect). In four decision tasks, participants were asked to select one option among four (very prudent, prudent, hazardous, very hazardous) after having been induced with negative or positive mood (or without mood induction for control group). They filled the South Oaks Gambling Screen at the end of the experiment. Results showed that mood did not influence healthy participants; however, problem gamblers were more risk-seeking after negative mood induction.	design of experiments;inductive reasoning;negative feedback;selection bias	Ivana Baldassarre;Michele Carpentieri;Olimpia Matarazzo	2015				HCI	-53.553564895254716	-53.24561363317749	44105

This study investigated the effect of cognitive styles on usersu0027 informationseeking task performance using a knowledge domain information visualization system called CiteSpace. Method. Sixteen graduate students participated in a user experiment. Each completed an extended cognitive style analysis wholistic-analytic test (the Extended CSA-WA test) on cognitive style, and then conducted eight tasks in the CiteSpace system. Analysis. Usersu0027 behaviour and performance data were analysed using statistical techniques to explore the relationships among various measures. The techniques include Pearson Correlation, multivariate analysis of variance, Pearson Chi-squared test and nonparametric tests such as Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results. Results demonstrated that usersu0027 cognitive styles did impact their search performance. The wholistic-Analytic ratio obtained from the cognitive test is significantly correlated with result correctness. After dividing the subjects into two groups based on the median wholistic-analytic ratio, analysis showed that subjects with wholistic preference felt significantly more satisfied with results than those with analytic preference. Additionally, subjects with analytic preference found significantly more correct answers than those with wholistic preference. Conclusions. These results indicated that cognitive style is an important factor in the study of information science and human-computer interaction. Research in this area provides valuable indication of future information system design.	information visualization	Xiaojun Yuan;Xiangmin Zhang;Chaomei Chen;Joshua M. Avery	2011	Inf.

This work provides a novel classification of ellipsis based on the analysis of ellipsis usage rather than forms in a corpus of information seeking dialogues. The aim is to demonstrate that pragmatic analysis is necessary for the interpretation of ellipsis. The context, in terms of the dialogue participants' belief states, determines interpretation and in turn the interpretation of the ellipsis changes the context for the interpretation of subsequent utterances. The dialogues produced in a NLU system using this classification are presented. F Johnson, IP&M 1994	information seeking;natural language understanding	F. C. Johnson	1994	Inf. Process.

31042be1ae84f65e40edf5e87a0d0d8812944f38	automatic detection of psychological distress indicators and severity assessment from online forum posts		Psychological disorders are frequently under-diagnosed and consequently have an irreversible impact on individuals and society. The stigma associated with such disorders makes face-to-face discussions with family members and clinicians difficult for many individuals. In contrast, people openly relate experiences on Internet forums. This paper describes a novel system that analyses forum posts to: (1) detect distress indicators that directly map to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV constructs, and (2) assess the severity of distress for prioritizing individuals who should seek clinical help (i.e. triage). For distress indicator detection, we use support vector machines (SVMs) trained on a suite of innovative intraand inter-message features. We show significant improvements in multi-label classification accuracy using humangenerated rationales in support of annotated distress labels. For triage assessment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) in dealing with noisy distress label detections and encoding expert rules.	design rationale;distress (novel);experience;inventory;markov chain;markov logic network;multi-label classification;sensor;support vector machine;text corpus	Shirin Saleem;Rohit Prasad;Shiv Naga Prasad Vitaladevuni;Maciej Pacula;Michael Crystal;Brian P Marx;Denise M Sloan;Jennifer Vasterling;Theodore Speroff	2012			computer security	HCI	-45.75142110305694	-64.12823902627888	44404
4bd0b43ef88d51619f4385f5059970788c616564	developing an intelligent cross-facility-based therapeutic decision reminder engine	drugs;hospitals;testing;engines;biomedical informatics	Background: The duplication of medication orders is a critical issue that causes medication errors for patients and wastes medical resources? National Health Insurance of Taiwan provided a NHI-PharmaCloud web-based database, and it contains the most complete personal drug history across different healthcare facilities in Taiwan. Currently, most healthcare facilities check the patients' cross facility medical information from NHI-PharmaCloud manually. However, new drugs are released quickly and frequently, and the same ingredients or the same pharmacological mechanisms can be hard to detect, therefore, it is difficult for clinical staff to prevent duplicated medication orders. Methods: To prevent duplicated medication orders, to add more flexible duplicate medication order checking rules, and to improve patient drug-use safety, we developed an Intelligent Cross Facilities Based Therapeutic Decision Reminder Engine (TDRE) [Fig. 1.] based on NHI-PharmaCloud in Taipei Medical University Hospital. In addition, to ensure TDRE performance in future implementations, we also conducted load testing to determine how the maximum workload TDRE would be able to support once it is deployed on a basic hardware system. Results and Discussion: The maximum affordable workload of TDRE in our deployed environment is 1100 requests per second. From the test results we can infer that TDRE would be able to provide 528,000 (1100 × 60 × 8 = 528,000) requests during an eight-hour working day. The test results show that TDRE worked properly and is able to fulfill our expected goal. Field-testing at Taipei Medical University Hospital indicates that the average service volume (inpatient plus outpatient) is approximately 6000 to 7000 encounters per day. Therefore, TDRE should be able to support this service quantity.	load testing;web application;web server	Cheng-Yi Yang;Ming-Chieh Tsai;Ray-Jade Chen;Yu-Sheng Lo;Lan-Ying Kang;Chien-Tsai Liu	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)	10.1109/ICHI.2016.50	simulation;medicine;operations management;biological engineering	HPC	-58.67146086595434	-66.57237604445764	44416

Typically, clinical research institutions have an elaborate established review process; the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of this process can result in approval delays thus significantly impacting the biomedical research. This paper describes the development of a Web-based information system designed to make the process of protocol approval more efficient, organized, and accurate. The system enables the principal investigators (Pis) to initiate, track and manage clinical studies, monitor review processes, view status changes, and quickly respond to requests for additional information. In addition, it allows the protocol coordinators (PCs) to manage the entire Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval process.	asea irb;information system;open-source software;relational database management system;requirement;review board;web application	Huey Cheung;Yang Fann;Shaohua Alex Wang;Barg Upender;Adam Frazin;Raj Lingam;Sarada Chintala;Frank Pecjak;Gladys Wang;Marc Kellogg;Robert L.

There is some difficulty, however, in evaluating the impact of the test query set on retrieval results. The traditional evaluation process, the Cranfield evaluation paradigm, which uses a corpus and a set of user queries, focuses on making the queries as re-alistic as possible. Unfortunately such query sets lack the fine grained control necessary to test algorithm properties. We present an approach called Controlled Query Generation (CQG) that creates query sets from documents in the corpus in a way that regulates the theoretic information quality of each query. This allows us to generate reproducible and well defined sets of queries of varying length and term specificity. Imposing this level of control over the query sets used for testing retrieval algorithms enables the rigorous simulation of different query environments to identify specific algorithm properties before introducing user queries. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of CQG by generating three dif-ferent query environments to investigate characteristics of two blind relevance feedback approaches.	algorithm;document retrieval;information quality;programming paradigm;relevance feedback;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;theory;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Christopher T.

To take just one aspect of communication, how can we assess the fluency of coordination that results from using some communication technology? This paper describes two groups of measures with this general purpose. The measures described have been devised to be used in a particular approach to evaluation for the design of communication systems that borrows from experimental and ethnographic methods. This approach is promoted as a practical and rigorous way of assessing design alternatives.  The first group of measures are subjective ratings that assess someone's awareness of the attentional status of their conversational partner, such awareness is necessary for the successful coordination of conversation. The rating scales are shown to be sensitive in that they distinguish between video and audio mediated conversation in a short experiment.  The second group are measures derived from video records of communicative behaviour using “activity set” analysis. This can be used to assess coordination in communication directly. An activity set is a mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of behavioural states. A publicly available tool, Action Recorder, makes it possible to score the tapes in near real time. “Simple statistics” are extracted from a single activity set, examples are: the proportion of time spent looking towards the video monitor and the average duration of these glances. “Contingent statistics” are extracted from two or more activity sets, for example, the proportion of time both members of a pair are looking towards their video monitors. A way of assessing the synchronization evident in two people's behaviour is presented that makes use of these contingent statistics. Inter-observer reliabilities are given for all the measures generated.		Leon Adam Watts;Andrew F. Monk;Owen Daly-Jones	1996	Int. J. Hum.-Comput.

The authors implemented four enhanced actionable reminders targeting performance of annual mammography, one-time bone-density screening, and diabetic testing. There was no difference in rates of appropriate testing between the four intervention and four matched, control primary care clinics for screening mammography (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02), bone-density exams (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.02), HbA1c monitoring (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.42) and LDL cholesterol monitoring (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.59). Of the survey respondents, 79% almost never used the system or were unaware of the functionality. In the 9/228 (3.9%) cases with indirect evidence of mammography reminder use, there was a significantly lower proportion with test performance. Our actionable reminders did not improve receipt of overdue testing, potentially due to limitations of workflow integration.	bone tissue;cholesterol;clinic;diabetes mellitus;order management system;primary health care;screening mammography;seventy nine;cellular targeting	Robert E.

The goal of the EBMC project is to analyze skin cancer treatment processes regarding their compliance with relevant guidelines. For this, first of all, the actual treatment processes have to be discovered from the available data sources. In general, the L∗ life cycle model has been suggested as structured methodology for process mining projects. In this experience paper, we describe the challenges and lessons learned when realizing the L∗ life cycle model in the EBMC context. Specifically, we provide and discuss different approaches to empower data of low maturity levels, i.e., data that is not already available in temporally ordered event logs, including a prototype for structured data acquisition.

BACKGROUND Fitts' law has been successfully applied to translational movements in the past, providing generalization beyond a specific task as well as performance predictions. For movements involving both translations and rotations, no equivalent theory exists, making comparisons of input devices for these movements more ambiguous.   METHOD The study consisted of three experiments. In the first two, participants performed either pure translational or pure rotational movements of 1 degree of freedom. The third experiment involved the same movements combined.   RESULTS On average, the performance times for combined movements were equal to the sum of the times for equivalent separate rotational and translational movements. A simple Fitts' law equivalent for combined movements with a similar slope as the separate components was proposed. In addition, a significant degree of coordination of the combined movements was found. This had a strong bias toward a parallel execution in 12 out of 13 participants.   CONCLUSION Combined movements with rotations and translations of 1 degree of freedom can be approximated using a simple Fitts' law equivalent. The rotational and translational components appear to be coordinated by the central nervous system to generate a parallel execution.   APPLICATION The results may help drive human interface designs and provide insights into the coordination of combined movements. Future extensions may be possible for the movements of higher degrees of freedom used in robot teleoperation and virtual reality applications.	approximation algorithm;cns disorder;experiment;fitts's law;generalization (psychology);genetic translation process;human reliability;input device;language translations;movement;parallel computing;the times;user interface;virtual reality	Martin F.

Unlike a universal classification, UST's main purpose would not be to serve as an indexing language to be applied directly on an universal scale but to: (a) serve as a source in the construction of special schemes; (b) serve as a concordance between a great many classification schemes, existing ones as well as new ones. The following problems arising in the planning for UST are dealt with briefly: (1) The structure of UST—UST would have to be as complete and detailed as possible. (2) The use of UST in the construction of special schemes—especially the """"extraction"""" of special schemes. (3) The use of UST as a concordance or """"switching language"""" between different classification schemes as a basis for cooperative cataloguing and the possibility to have special schemes common to a group of related institutions (semiuniversal classifications).

Traditionally, textual information around the image is used to represent the high-level features of the image. We argue that such “flat” representation can not describe images well. In this paper, Hierarchical Representation (HR) and HR-Tree are proposed for image description. Salient phrases in HRTree are further to distinguish this image with others sharing the same ancestor concepts. First, we design a method to extract the salient phrases for the images in data records. Then HR-Trees are built using these phrases. Finally, new hierarchical clustering algorithm based on HR-Tree is proposed for users’ browsing conveniently. We demonstrate some HR-Trees and clustering results in experimental section.. These results illustrate the advantages of our methods.	algorithm;cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;high- and low-level;image retrieval;web page;world wide web	Congle Zhang;Sheng Huang;Gui-Rong Xue;Yong Yu	2006		10.1007/11610113_34	the internet;image analysis;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database;semantics;hierarchical clustering;cluster analysis;world wide web;information extraction;information retrieval	ML	-35.700915124080545	-59.24441469421737	45013
f48c867eb3bcbeb1eab6ad91d9bad91af9797634	in search of a dataset for handwritten optical music recognition: introducing muscima++		Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has long been without an adequate dataset and ground truth for evaluating OMR systems, which has been a major problem for establishing a state of the art in the field. Furthermore, machine learning methods require training data. We analyze how the OMR processing pipeline can be expressed in terms of gradually more complex ground truth, and based on this analysis we present the MUSCIMA++ dataset of handwritten music notation that addresses musical symbol recognition and notation reconstruction. The MUSCIMA++ dataset v.0.9 consists of 140 pages of handwritten music, with 91255 manually annotated notation symbols and 82261 explicitly marked relationships between symbol pairs. The dataset allows training and evaluating models for symbol classification, symbol localization, and notation graph assembly, both in isolation and jointly. Open-source tools are provided for manipulating the dataset, visualizing the data and annotating further, and the dataset itself is made available under an open license.	1:1 pixel mapping;adjacency matrix;ampersand;application domain;attachments;data model;encode;graphical user interface;graphics;ground truth;hoc (programming language);machine learning;music encoding initiative;open content;optical character recognition;optical mark recognition;parsing;programming paradigm;requirement;satisfiability modulo theories;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;type signature;xml	Jan Hajic;Pavel Pecina	2017	CoRR		natural language processing;speech recognition;artificial intelligence	Vision	-34.057950335507186	-75.34265033671998	45068

d21e619e7d9d9445d70aa07f5d7a2e94c16ea901	detecting positive medical history mentions		In medical practice, knowing the medical history of a patient is crucial for diagnosis and treatment suggestion. However, such information is often recorded in unstructured notes from doctors, potentially mixed with the medical history of family members and mentions of disorders for other reasons (e.g. as potential side-effects). In this work we designed a scheme to automatically extract the medical history of patients from a large healthcare database. More specifically, we first extracted medical conditions mentioned using a rule-based system and a medical gazetteer, then we classified whether such mentions reflected the patient's history or not. We designed our method to be simple and with little human intervention. Our results are very encouraging, supporting the potential for efficient and effective deployment in clinical practice.	database;excalibur: morgana's revenge;rule-based system;sensor;software deployment	Bing Bai;Pierre-François Laquerre;Richard G.

It implements a sophisticated security and role model to protect privacy and to minimize the risk of eavesdropping of patient data. The Clearinghouse serves as a centralized platform for distributed, distantly located medical research and health care. It is based on Open-Source software, thus ensuring continued support, maintenance, security and last but not least continuity of the platform. The use of the Clearinghouse minimizes turnaround times by superseding comparably slow and insecure conventional communication methods otherwise used for the exchange of radiological images and clinical documents, such as standard mail and courier services. Furthermore, it alleviates the integration of distantly located expert knowledge into diagnostic routines, culminating in an increased health care quality regardless of location of patients or physicians.	authorization documentation;centralized computing;open-source software;patients;privacy;quality of health care;radiology;scott continuity;secure digital;teleradiology	Michael Spitzer;Lars Brinkmann;Frank Ückert	2007	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-58603-774-1-508	web application;health care;data mining;software;project commissioning;teleradiology;role model;health care quality;eavesdropping;computer science	Security	-52.89320576350849	-62.08954548124448	45158
f068c9be6e7fecfe336fbe8d427f5e8052699597	toward automated classification of consumers' cancer-related questions with a new taxonomy of expected answer types	automated question answering;question classification	This article examines methods for automated question classification applied to cancer-related questions that people have asked on the web. This work is part of a broader effort to provide automated question answering for health education. We created a new corpus of consumer-health questions related to cancer and a new taxonomy for those questions. We then compared the effectiveness of different statistical methods for developing classifiers, including weighted classification and resampling. Basic methods for building classifiers were limited by the high variability in the natural distribution of questions and typical refinement approaches of feature selection and merging categories achieved only small improvements to classifier accuracy. Best performance was achieved using weighted classification and resampling methods, the latter yielding an accuracy of F1 = 0.963. Thus, it would appear that statistical classifiers can be trained on natural data, but only if natural distributions of classes are smoothed. Such classifiers would be useful for automated question answering, for enriching web-based content, or assisting clinical professionals to answer questions.

76d3439e220dd067fab9177ae278073aa90472a8	effective medical resources searching using an ontology‐driven medical information retrieval system: h1n1 case study	multilingual information retrieval system;information retrieval;medical information systems;philosophy;semantic web;ontology	Purpose – As international users increase rapidly, multilingual systems have become a very important service for global users. The purpose of this paper is to design and implement an ontology-driven medical information retrieval (OMIR) system by building a medical ontology based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) medical records. Design/methodology/approach – A traditional cataloging scheme is used as a navigation menu in the CDC system. This traditional cataloging scheme is transformed to a unique medical ontology for global users in the OMIR system. An experimental study was conducted on both an ontology-driven medical information system (OMIR) and the CDC system. Findings – The medical ontology can be used to filter out unsuitable resources based on semantic relationships. In addition, the recommended resources can be categorized and provide the patron with different languages to access resources. The OMIR system provides better relevancy and shorter search times compared with alternative systems. Research limitations/implications – The OMIR system is currently implemented for medical resources from the CDC. The developed method may also be applied to other domain areas. Originality/value – This paper represents a practical method of building a multilingual medical information retrieval system and explains the functional use of ontological knowledge. This study provides insights into medical information seeking performance on the medical database systems.	categorization;database;experiment;information retrieval;information seeking;information system;relevance	Myongho Yi	2012	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640471211221368	computer science;semantic web;ontology;data mining;database;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-34.29552087106524	-59.49803571977872	45247

Clinically meaningful changes in patient physiology were identified and then mapped to the inherent psychophysical properties of the visualization. A long history of psychophysical research has provided an understanding of the parameters within which the human information processing system is able to detect changes in the size, shape and color of visual objects (Gescheider, 1976, Spence, 1990, and Baird, 1970). These detection thresholds are known as just noticeable differences (JNDs) which characterize the amount of change in an object's attribute that is recognizable 50% of the time. A prototype version of the display has been demonstrated to facilitate anesthesiologist's performance while reducing cognitive workload during simulated cardiac events (Agutter et al., 2002). In order to further improve the utility of the new cardiovascular visualization, the clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular variables are mapped to noticeable perceptual changes in the representational elements of the display. The results of the method described in this paper are used to merge information from the psychophysical properties of the cardiovascular visualization, with clinically relevant changes in the patient's cardiovascular physiology as measured by the clinical meaningfulness questionnaire. The result of this combination will create a visualization that is sensitive to changes in the cardiovascular health of the patient and communicates this information to the user in a meaningful, salient and intuitive manner.	display device;image scaling;information processing;information processor;prototype;visual objects	Robert Albert;Noah Syroid;Yinqi Zhang;James Agutter;Frank Drews;David L.

c22ebaac95b00670ce7d74703977170af56c49b3	examining social media use among parents of children with cancer	cancer;social support;health information;social media	Americans are increasingly using social media for healthrelated communication. Facebook is the most widely used social media platform in the US. Much of the previous research on social media and health communication has focused on Facebook Groups related to a specific disease, or Facebook Pages related to an advocacy organization. However, less is known about how people communicate about health on personal Facebook Pages. In this study we expand upon previous research by examining the patterns of Facebook use among one unique population: parents caring for a child with cancer. We examined themes in cancerrelated exchanges through a content analysis of 12 months of data from 18 publically available Facebook Pages hosted by parents of children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (15,852 total posts). Four categories of health-related Facebook usage emerged: documenting the cancer journey, (2) promoting awareness and advocacy about pediatric cancer, (3) sharing emotional strain associated with caregiving, and (4) mobilizing symbolic and instrumental forms of support. Our findings show that Facebook Pages offer a platform for people to share their cancer experiences, promote advocacy and awareness, and mobilize social support. Information professionals, particularly those who work with consumer and patient populations, should remain aware that social media platforms can provide layperson-generated, user-centered content that meets the informational, emotional, and logistical needs of caregivers and patients.	experience;facebook messenger;logistics;multimedia framework;population;social media;social support;software documentation;user-centered design	Susan A.

They improve the quality of care by making patients' medical history more accessible. However, little is known about the factors contributing to the successful EHR implementation in dental clinics.   OBJECTIVES This article aims to identify the perceived critical success factors of EHR system implementation in a dental clinic context.   METHODS We used Grounded Theory to analyse data collected in the context of Brunei's national EHR - the Healthcare Information and Management System (Bru-HIMS). Data analysis followed the stages of open, axial and selective coding.   RESULTS Six perceived critical success factors emerged: usability of the system, emergent behaviours, requirements analysis, training, change management, and project organisation. The study identified a mismatch between end-users and product owner/vendor perspectives.   DISCUSSION Workflow changes were significant challenges to clinicians' confident use, particularly as the system offered limited modularity and configurability. Recommendations are made for all the parties involved in healthcare information systems implementation to manage the change process by agreeing system goals and functionalities through wider consensual debate, and participated supporting strategies realised through common commitment.	bru-pel;clinic;contribution;dental clinics;electronic health records;emergence;grounded theory;health care;information systems;information system;management system;patients;recommender system;requirement;requirements analysis;scrum (software development);usability	Yusof Haji Sidek;Jorge Tiago Martins	2017	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.08.007	medical record;knowledge management;health care;management system;information system;hrhis;health information technology;critical success factor;health informatics;medicine	HCI	-61.12988893576212	-61.85601809171728	45399

The proposed evaluation measures exploit the vector space representation and calculate the similarity of the two ontologies (learned and gold) at the lexical and relational levels. Extensive evaluation experiments are provided, which show that these measures capture accurately the deviations from the gold ontology.

7ef61020c7500d417d188ceb4f635e6b51b7c64f	a method to estimate operator's mental workload in multiple information presentation environment of agricultural vehicles		The development of mechanized agriculture has brought many new features to agricultural vehicles today. Considering more human limitations, such as situational awareness and the potential for mental overload, operator’s mental workload seems to be a critical issue. This study presents a quantitative method for determining the mental workload imposed on agricultural vehicle operators and to express their mental workload by means of a model that was objective and could stand up to the test of validity. The proposed model consisted of three task elements and six weighted moderating factors. And a modified task workload analysis measurement was used to validate the model by analyzing video recordings of eighteen subjects working in three combine harvester vehicles over an eight-hour shift. The comparison results implied the model’s validity. Subjective workload was mildly correlated with the three task elements in the model. It is shown to provide an objective method for assessment and prediction of operator’s mental workload in the multiple information presentation environment of farming machines.

The research compared the users' choice of interaction modality between DTMF and speech-enabled IVR modalities. The targeted users were oral users of Southern Africa with diverse literacy levels ranging from functionally illiterate to literate adults but who are nevertheless numerically literate. We found that the type of application presented to the users instigated their choice between DTMF and the speech-enabled IVR modalities.	dual-tone multi-frequency signaling;information access;information system;interactive voice response;literate programming;modality (human–computer interaction);numerical analysis;subpixel rendering	Tembalethu Jama Ndwe;Etienne Barnard;Mqhele E.

The Infobutton Manager (IM), accessed through a clinical information system, anticipates the clinician's questions and provides links to pertinent electronic resources. We conducted an observational usefulness case study of medical residents (MDs), nurse practitioners (NPs), registered nurses (RNs), and a physician assistant (PA), using the IM in a laboratory setting. Generic question types and success rates for each clinician's information needs were characterized. Question type frequency differed by clinician type. All clinician types asked for institution-specific protocols. The MDs asked about unfamiliar domains, RNs asked about physician order rationales, and NPs asked questions similar to both MDs and RNs. Observational data suggest that IM success rates may be improved by tailoring anticipated questions to clinician type. Clinicians reported that a more visible Infobutton may increase use.	breast feeding;degree / license / certificate - physician assistant;information needs;information system;note:find:pt:custodial care facility:doc:case manager;protocols documentation;registration;relevance	Sarah A.

Different approaches to classify spatial granularity will be compared and applied to a corpus of human place descriptions. Results show how hierarchical structures as well as deviations depend on the respective classifications. They further indicate certain difficulties in developing a suitable classification of spatial references. Findings contribute to the understanding of human spatial language, and thus the development of flexible mechanisms for their interpretation and integration in location-based systems.

There are unmet needs with respect to current electronic mapping of drug indications. For example, the active ingredient sildenafil has 2 distinct indications, which differ solely on dosage strength. In progressing toward a practice of precision medicine, there is a need to capture and structure therapeutic intent for computational reuse, thus enabling more sophisticated decision-support tools and a possible mechanism for computer-aided drug repurposing. The indications for drugs, such as those expressed in the Structured Product Labels approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, appears to be a tractable area for developing an application ontology of therapeutic intent.	cobham's thesis;drug repositioning;ontology;precision medicine;reuse (action);sildenafil	Stuart J.

This paper introduces a model for rewarding and evaluating users using retrospective validation, with only a small gold standard required to initiate the system. A simulation of the model shows that users are rewarded appropriately for high quality responses however analysis of data from an implementation of the model in a text annotation game indicates it may not be sophisticated enough to predict user performance.	crowdsourcing;display resolution;information retrieval;norm (social);relevance;simulation	Jon Chamberlain	2014		10.1145/2594776.2594779	simulation;computer science;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-36.64104041650894	-54.28317684377723	45756

STUDY DESIGN We compared the coverage and outcomes of IVF children reported in aggregated IVF statistics, the Medical Birth Register (subsequently: MBR) and research data based on reimbursements for IVF treatments in Finland in 1996-1998.   RESULTS The number of newborns were nearly equal in the three data sources (N = 4331-4384), but the linkage between the MBR and the research data revealed that almost 40% of the reported IVF children were not the same individuals. The perinatal outcomes in the three data sources were similar, excluding the much lower incidence of major congenital anomalies in the IVF statistics (157/10 000 newborns) compared to other sources (409-422/10 000 newborns).   CONCLUSION The differences in perinatal outcomes in the three data sets were in general minor, which suggests that the observed non-recording in the MBR is most likely unbiased.	abbreviations;congenital abnormality;data quality;digital history;embryo transfer (procedure);exception handling;female infertility;fertilization in vitro;hoc (programming language);incidence matrix;infant, newborn;linkage (software);linux/rk;manuscripts;mg (editor);sperm injections, intracytoplasmic;spermatozoa cell count;tspo gene;citation;genetic linkage;interest	Mika Gissler;Reija Klemetti;Tiina Sevón;Elina Hemminki	2004	BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making	10.1186/1472-6947-4-3	health informatics;data quality;medicine;population pyramid;gynecology;nursing;obstetrics;pediatrics;clinical study design	HCI	-57.438591744060034	-66.91457659588049	45770

METHOD A retrospective analysis of the sample hospital information system database was conducted using three months of data before and after the implementation of an IVWMS System (DoseEdge®) which uses barcode scanning and photographic technologies to track and verify each step of the preparation process. The financial impact associated with wasted and missing >IV doses was determined by combining drug acquisition, labor, accessory, and disposal costs. The intercepted error reports and pharmacist detected error reports were drawn from the IVWMS to quantify the number of errors by defined error categories.   RESULTS The total number of IV doses prepared before and after the implementation of the IVWMS system were 110,963 and 101,765 doses, respectively. The adoption of the IVWMS significantly reduced the amount of wasted and missing IV doses by 14,176 and 2268 doses, respectively (p < 0.001). The overall cost savings of using the system was $144,019 over 3 months. The total number of errors detected was 1160 (1.14%) after using the IVWMS.   CONCLUSION The implementation of the IVWMS facilitated workflow changes that led to a positive impact on cost and patient safety. The implementation of the IVWMS increased patient safety by enforcing standard operating procedures and bar code verifications.	bl (logic);barcode;categories;congenital neurologic anomalies;cost savings;disposal;eighty;financial cost;hang (computing);hypertensive disease;immunoglobulins;information system;management system;manuscripts;ninety nine;pharming;physiological sexual disorders;plasma cleaning;ploidies;preparation;receptors, progesterone;refractory anemias;sensor;standard operating procedure;tellurium;total number;trial inclusion and exclusion criteria submission domain;nickel	Alex C.

General acceptance that undesired behavior (human error) is inevitable in the end has led to the acknowledgement that safety could be enhanced when a recovery from undesired behavior can be realized. The current training programs do not satisfy for this purpose due to the danger of negative training. This paper proposes an outline for a training that assists the crew to recognize undesired behavior and to establish a recovery from it. For the outline the concept of maintaining sensing influence (MSI) is used. It assumes that whatever a pilot does, he is continually guided by the critical variable MSI. According to the MSI concept undesired behavior implies that the pilot shifted context to maintain his SI, while the instructor did not take account of the context shift. Undesired behavior is not an objective fact, it is a value of the instructor implying that the instructor and pilot do not share the same context. Having identified the switch in context, MSI becomes a criterion by which the instructor can understand the pilot's undesired behavior and assist the pilot to recover desired behavior	human error	Machteld van der Vlugt;Peter A.

To address clinical needs in this area, the College of American Pathologists (CAP), secretariat of the Systematized Nomenclature of Human and Veterinary Medicine (SNOMED), has entered into partnership with the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) Standards Committee, the American College of Radiology, the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the American Academy of Neurology, the American Veterinary Medical Association, and other professional specialty organizations to develop the controlled terminology that is needed for diagnostic imaging applications. Terminology development is coordinated with ongoing development and maintenance of the DICOM Standard. SNOMED content is being enhanced in two general areas: 1) imaging procedure descriptions and 2) diagnostic observations. The SNOMED DICOM Microglossary (SDM) has been developed to provide context-dependent value sets (SDM Context Groups) for DICOM coded-entry data elements, and semantic content speci®cations (SDM Templates) for reports and other structures composed of multiple data elements. The capability of storing explicitly-labeled coded descriptors from the SDM in DICOM images and reports improves the potential for selective retrieval of images and related information. A pilot test of distributed multispecialty terminology development using a World Wide Web (WWW) application was performed in 1997, demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale distributed development of SDM terminology.	academy;context-sensitive language;dicom;digital imaging;medical imaging;radiology;systematized nomenclature of medicine;www;world wide web	W.

This paper reports on a Structured Clinical User Interface (SCUI) which achieves this goal by using technologies developed in the Galen project: a new formalism to represent models of terminology coupled with a server to access and use this knowledge. This approach opens the way to the development of clinical systems which use conceptual knowledge, driven by models of terminology, in a dynamic and flexible way. Furthermore, the overall task of building a clinical application is separated into a terminological part handled by the server and an application part handled by application developers without needing to worry about implementing the terminology. The SCUI is specifically developed and tested in the context of infectious diseases to satisfy the demands made by the medical intensive care unit to the Geneva Hospital's microbiology laboratory.

In experiments, we used four letters (B, H, N, 0) as the characters. These characters are considered to represent groups categorized by shape. Black, blue, green, red, and yellow were the colors tested. The colored characters were evaluated through 24 impression word pairs. The results showed a significant difference between men's and women's impressions. It was also shown that the impression of characters can be expressed by three factors, Elegance, Liveliness, and Potency, for both men and women. The importance of the factors differed for the men's impression when compared with the women's impression. The first factor of the women's impression was Elegance, whereas the first factor of the men's impression was Liveliness. It was also shown that the color is more important than the shape of characters. The impression of black and yellow in Liveliness and green in Elegance varied for women, and the impression of blue in Elegance varied for men.	categorization;color;experiment;microsoft word for mac;women writers project	Yui Nonomura;Teruhisa Hochin;Hiroki Nomiya	2015	2015 IEEE/ACIS 16th International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)	10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176253	text mining;decision support system;computer science;programming language;character	Visualization	-44.20664271057558	-60.103163793962786	46310

The SCI algorithm exploits the fact that SCI stopwords in a search phrase function as a placeholder. Such a phrase serves effectively as a fixed adjacency condition determined by the number n of adjacent stopwords (i.e., retrieve all records where word A and word B are separated by n words in at least one location). The algorithm integrates over search phrases with different numbers of adjacent stopwords to provide a flexible adjacency or proximity capability (i.e., retrieve all records where word A and word B are separated by n or less words in at least one location, where n is the maximum separation desired between A and B in at least one location). The Google algorithm exploits the fact that asterisks (in Google) separating words in a phrase function like word wildcards. The difference between two such phrases (the first phrase containing one less asterisk than the second phrase) serves effectively as a fixed adjacency or proximity condition, with the number of separating words equal to the number of asterisks in the first phrase. The algorithm integrates over these phrase differentials to provide a flexible adjacency or proximity capability (i.e., retrieve all records where word A and word B are separated by n or less words in at least one location, where n is the maximum separation desired between A and B in at least one location).

9bb2abad44c2a4bd1fcb7d33afdf376146815a3c	the robust reading competition annotation and evaluation platform		The ICDAR Robust Reading Competition (RRC), initiated in 2003 and re-established in 2011, has become a de-facto evaluation standard for robust reading systems and algorithms. Concurrent with its second incarnation in 2011, a continuous effort started to develop an on-line framework to facilitate the hosting and management of competitions. This paper outlines the Robust Reading Competition Annotation and Evaluation Platform, the backbone of the competitions. The RRC Annotation and Evaluation Platform is a modular framework, fully accessible through on-line interfaces. It comprises a collection of tools and services for managing all processes involved with defining and evaluating a research task, from dataset definition to annotation management, evaluation specification and results analysis. Although the framework has been designed with robust reading research in mind, many of the provided tools are generic by design. All aspects of the RRC Annotation and Evaluation Framework are available for research use.	algorithm;download;international conference on document analysis and recognition;internet backbone;nist hash function competition;online and offline;real-time transcription;specification language;version control	Dimosthenis Karatzas;Lluís Gómez;Anguelos Nicolaou;Marçal Rusiñol	2018	2018 13th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems (DAS)	10.1109/DAS.2018.22	task analysis;simulation;robustness (computer science);computer science;modular design;annotation;text mining	NLP	-34.414522967860314	-75.32008596762658	46564

Nonetheless, several early adopting health plans and provider organizations have begun to design and pilot social and mobile media platforms to empower members to enhance self management of health and wellness goals. In this case study of a large health plan in Pennsylvania, the authors describe the design and execution of a member survey to identify some factors that are significantly associated with interest in adopting such technology platforms for obtaining health-related information and services. Analysis of relevant data from more than 4,000 responses indicates significant differences among important segments of the member population defined with respect to demographic factors, level of computer and social media usage, and frequency of engagement in specific online activities. They anticipate that these insights can assist health plans to develop and deploy targeted services and tools for health and wellness management.	social media	Sinjini Mitra;Rema Padman	2012	J.

7be300d9a169a171e02415c3cd2c2ce026a63aa8	terms as labels for concepts, terms as lexical units: a comparative analysis in ontologies and specialized dictionaries	concept;lexical unit;terminological dictionary;term;ontology	Terms or terminological units are objects that are manipulated by different fields and that are at the core of several applications, e.g. representing knowledge, describing specialized usages, classifying documents. This inevitably leads to discrepancies and often large ones between resources in which terms are described and encoded e.g., ontologies, terminologies, dictionaries, thesauri. This paper attempts to characterize these differences by analyzing two different applications: 1 the elaboration of a domain ontology; and 2 the compilation of a specialized dictionary whose aim is to account for the linguistic functioning of terms. We deliberately chose two very different resources that rely on opposing methodologies hoping that this would lead to a better understanding of some of the facets terms may have and what can be expected of resources that describe them. Examples are taken from the fields of computing and the Internet. We focus more specifically on input devices. The analysis reveals that resources manipulate terms in very different ways and questions the possibility of exchanging data from one resource to the other without jeopardizing some of the principles on which they are based.	dictionary;ontology (information science);qualitative comparative analysis	Marie-Claude L'Homme;Gabriel Bernier-Colborne	2012	Applied Ontology	10.3233/AO-2012-0116	natural language processing;term;philosophy;epistemology;computer science;ontology;data mining;linguistics;programming language;concept;information retrieval	AI	-35.00213194003285	-71.02737974385	46793

533997ad8a4a74e68f3ecd6c3ad2a91a4ae9b3bd	a holistic approach for creating a digital ecosystem enabling personalized assistive care for elderly		The demographic change of the worldwide population has made the healthcare and social systems some of the most disturbed domains because of the costs induced by the increased incidence of multiple chronic diseases associated with ageing, but also by the growing number of the elderly and escalating life expectancy. Healthcare expenditure is furthermore expecting to mount due to the strong necessity of deploying better assistive care for older people that is up to create age-friendly environments, personalized treatments and support, appropriate medical devices and access to upgrading knowledge and information. In this context, the new digital technologies have a critical role and the potential to sustain the implementing of new elderly-centered solutions. A digital ecosystem should be based on a holistic approach able to link and interconnect multiple healthcare domains, patient-centered insights, and technology.

When building knowledge bases, the  lack of decision support for complex multiple-disease patients is usually transferred to computer-based systems. Starting  from a GEM-encoded instance of CPGs, we developed a module that automatically generated IF-THEN-WITH decision rules. A two-stage  unification process has been implemented. All the rules whose IF-part was in partial matching with a patient clinical profile  were triggered. A synthesis of triggered rules has then been performed to eliminate redundancies and incoherence. All remaining,  eventually competitive, recommendations are finally displayed to physicians leaving them the control and the responsibility  of handling the controversy and thus the opportunity to make informed decisions.    	recommender system	Gersende Georg;Brigitte Séroussi;Jacques Bouaud	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39907-0_24	knowledge base;decision support system;complex multiplication;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;decision rule;management science	ML	-52.854418916170424	-67.76334557772714	46956

The international Intelligence Communities have seen open sources grow increasingly easier and cheaper to acquire in recent years. Up to 80% of electronic data is textual and most valuable information is often encoded in pages which are neither structured, nor classified. The process of accessing all these raw data, heterogeneous for language used, and transforming them into information is therefore inextricably linked to the concepts of textual analysis and synthesis, hinging greatly on the ability to master the problems of multilinguality. This paper describes SYNTHEMA SPYWatch, a content enabling system for OSINT,which has been adopted by some Intelligence operative structures in Italy to support the Collection,Processing, Exploitation, Production, Dissemination and Evaluation cycle. By this system, operative officers can get an overview of great volumes of textual data,which helps them discover meaningful similarities among documents and find all related information.	information access;open-source intelligence;text corpus	Federico Neri;Paolo Geraci	2009	2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation	10.1109/IV.2009.99	computer science;data science;data mining;information retrieval	DB	-34.35367785982045	-66.4133884306265	47022
320f77d3e87c3087ecf956b129bbe2ff25cf02c5	special issue in clinical information systems security	qa76 electronic computers computer science computer software;clinical information system;r medicine general	Managing patient care records has become an increasingly complex issue with the widespread use of advanced technologies. The vast amount of information for every routine care procedure must be securely processed within different databases. Clinical information systems (CIS) address the need for a computerized approach in managing personal health information. Hospitals and public or private health insurance organizations are continuously upgrading their database and data management systems to more sophisticated architectures. The possible support of today’s large patient archives and the flexibility of a CIS in providing up-to-date patient information and worldwide doctors’ collaboration, has leveraged research on CIS in both the academic and the government domains. At the same time, it has become apparent that patients require more control over their clinical data, these being either the results of clinical examinations or medical histories. Due to the large amount of information that can be found on the Internet and the free access to medical practitioners and hospitals worldwide, patients may choose to communicate their information so as to obtain several expert opinions regarding their conditions. Given the sensitive nature of the information stored and inevitably in transit, security has become an issue of outmost necessity. Numerous EU and US research projects have been launched to address security in CIS (e.g., EUROMED, ISHTAR, and RESHEN), whereas regulatory compliance to acts such as the HIPAA has become an obligation for centers moving to CIS.

Using the Enron corpus as a dataset, we perform a close study of the words and phrases people send to those above them in the corporate hierarchy versus those at the same level or lower. We find that certain words and phrases are strong predictors. For example, """"thought you would"""" strongly suggests that the recipient outranks the sender, while """"let's discuss"""" implies the opposite. We also find that the phrases people write to their bosses do not demonstrate cognitive processes as often as the ones they write to others.

DOI: 10.1002/asi.20537 three fundamental components: a set of documents, a set of posed information needs, and a set of relevance judgments. Relevance judgments are the collections of documents that should be retrieved for each information need, and a posed information need is a query that may be formulated by any inquirer (user). In this paradigm, relevance is the sole effectiveness criterion and the effectiveness of a system based on relevance is measured in two dimensions: the ability to retrieve documents that are known to be relevant and the ability to suppress documents that are known to be nonrelevant. The majority of the currently used measures of relevance are based on precision and recall. Precision is the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant; recall is the proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved. This experimental design paradigm has been in use for over four decades, and it is still actively used in almost all large-scale experimental evaluation efforts. In the traditional evaluation of retrieval experiments, performances of the systems are measured over a set of queries (or information needs, or topics).1 Because a performance summary measure is necessary to compare different retrieval strategies over all predefined information needs, a final summary performance score for each retrieval strategy is calculated as the average of its performance scores observed on all topics. In particular, the mean average precision (MAP) is the most widely used summary measure. A MAP score of a particular retrieval strategy is the mean of the uninterpolated average precisions observed on all topics, and in turn, an uninterpolated average precision score of a document set retrieved by a particular retrieval strategy is the average of all precision scores that are calculated at each relevant document reached from the beginning in that document set (van Rijsbergen, 1979). For visual performance comparisons, a recall-precision graph can also be used (van Rijsbergen, 1979). To construct a recall precision graph for a number of different retrieval strategies, all individual recall-precision curves of those Statistical Principal Components Analysis for Retrieval Experiments	design of experiments;document;experiment;information needs;information retrieval;john d. wiley;performance;precision and recall;principal component analysis;programming paradigm;relevance	Bekir Taner Dinçer	2007	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20537	relevance;computer science;graphics;artificial intelligence;comparative research;data mining;law;principal component analysis	Web+IR	-36.87259113567741	-60.88364280242983	47198

Of the 58 physicians who attempted to use the AMR system, 28 continue as active users. Physicians who discontinued use of the system reported a variety of reasons for their dissatisfaction. As a result of the pilot, the AMR implementation team and physicians understand better how to fit the AMR system to a physician's specific requirements, as well as enhance the operation of the physician's practice. Armed with the experience gained during the early phases of the implementation, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation now intends a cautious expansion and continued evaluation of the AMR system, with the objective of meeting organizational needs with appropriate technical functions.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;attempt;medical records;pilot projects;requirement	Nancy Folz-Murphy;Mary Partin;Lisa Williams;C.

The end user, generally overloaded by information, can't efficiently perceive such information. It became urgent to propose new information retrieval systems able to apprehend efficiently these enormous quantities of documents. In this paper we present PQIR an information retrieval model based on user profile. The originality of our approach is a choice of indexing terms depending on the user request but also on his profile.

We investigated whether participants were able to interpret displays of their own or others' eye movements. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants observed an image under three different viewing instructions. Then they were shown static or dynamic gaze displays and had to judge whether it was their own or someone else's eye movements and what instruction was reflected. Participants were capable of recognizing the instruction reflected in their own and someone else's gaze display. Instruction recognition was better for dynamic displays, and only this condition yielded above chance performance in recognizing the display as one's own or another person's (Experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3 revealed that order information in the gaze displays facilitated instruction recognition when transitions between fixated regions distinguish one viewing instruction from another. Implications of these findings are discussed.	experiment;eye movements;movement	Margot van Wermeskerken;Damien Litchfield;Tamara van Gog	2018		10.1111/cogs.12484	psychology;computer vision;eye tracking;linguistics;communication;social psychology;eye movement	HCI	-48.9278335239457	-52.374269639801604	47484

Because the DANs are sparsely-located in the articles, we take a hierarchical approach. The HTML journal articles are first segmented into zones according to text and geometric features. The zones are then classified as DAN zones or other zones by an SVM classifier. A set of heuristic rules are applied on the candidate DAN zones to extract DANs according to their edit distances to the DAN formats. An evaluation shows that the proposed method can achieve a very high recall rate (above 99%) and a significantly better precision rate compared to extraction through brute force regular expression matching.	accession number (bioinformatics);brute-force search;compiler;edit distance;html;heuristic;machine learning;named entity;regular expression;sensitivity and specificity;statistical classification;support vector machine	Jie Zou;Daniel X.

Current search engines only return sets of documents containing the name queried, but, as several people usually share a personal name, the resulting sets often contain documents relevant to several people. It is necessary to disambiguate people in these result sets in order to to help users find the person of interest more readily. In the task of name disambiguation, effective measurement of similarities in the documents is a crucial step towards the final disambiguation. We propose a new method that uses web directories as a knowledge base to find common contexts in documents and uses the common contexts measure to determine document similarities. Experiments, conducted on documents mentioning real people on the web, together with several famous web directory structures, suggest that there are significant advantages in using web directories to disambiguate people compared with other conventional methods. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Fortunately, since the invention of the camera, an ever-increasing number of photographs capture much of this otherwise lost information. This plethora of artifacts documenting our “visual culture” is a treasure trove of knowledge as yet untapped by historians. We present a dataset of 37,921 frontal-facing American high school yearbook photos that allow us to use computation to glimpse into the historical visual record too voluminous to be evaluated manually. The collected portraits provide a constant visual frame of reference with varying content. We can therefore use them to consider issues such as a decade’s defining style elements, or trends in fashion and social norms over time. We demonstrate that our historical image dataset may be used together with weakly-supervised datadriven techniques to perform scalable historical analysis of large image corpora with minimal human effort, much in the same way that large text corpora together with natural language processing revolutionized historians’ workflow. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our dataset in dating grayscale portraits using deep learning methods.	algorithm;computation;deep learning;grayscale;natural language processing;norm (social);our world;scalability;software documentation;text corpus;trove	Shiry Ginosar;Kate Rakelly;Sarah Sachs;Brian Yin;Alexei A.

The trial protocol specifies that following initial treatment there is a 2-3 year maintenance period during which drug dosage decisions are made weekly according to a set of pre-defined rules. These rules are complex, and there is a significant frequency of error in clinical practice, which can lead to patient harm. We have built a web-based decision support system (called LISA) to address this problem. The dose alteration rules from the MRC protocol were formalised in the PROforma guideline modeling language as a state transition problem, and dose adjustment recommendations are provided into the clinical setting by a PROforma enactment engine. The design and implementation of the decision support module, the safety issues raised and the strategy adopted for resolving them are discussed. System safety is very likely to become a major professional challenge for the medical AI community and it can be addressed, in this case, with relatively straightforward techniques.	decision support system;modeling language;system safety;web application	Chris Hurt;John Fox;Jonathan Bury;Vaskar Saha	2003		10.1007/978-3-540-39907-0_22	decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;management science;modeling language;system safety	ECom	-57.513071737958505	-66.48123525526776	47785

As computing is becoming both pervasive and nomadic, workers use of computing and communication services is less limited to solitary moments at an office desk. Thus it gets more and more important to provide mobile work process support systems. This paper presents experiences related to the development, introduction and evolution of such systems through results from a case study following phone engineers. The main conclusions from the study are that that smaller terminals not necessarily does the job better, computerised systems are not always better than paper-based systems, and that supporting nomadic work must be done in agreement with the overall work context.	control theory;emergence;enterprise system;exception handling;pervasive informatics;requirement;run time (program lifecycle phase);user requirements document	Børge Haugset	2004			phone;systems engineering;workflow;desk;computer science	HCI	-59.38201840023107	-59.387397244809456	47951

When the user enters a conceptual query, that is, a specification of some information need in terms of abstract concepts, there may be many alternative ways of interpreting the query. This, in turn, affects the determination of what items are relevant for retrieval. In the MIRACLE system, these problems are tackled by combining abductive reasoning and dialogue planning. Whereas MIRACLE’s abductive retrieval engine is capable of deriving different interpretations of ambiguous queries, the dialogue planner employs a comprehensive conversational dialogue model for negotiating queries, clarifying information needs, and explaining retrieval results.	abductive reasoning;abstract data type;algorithm;chain-of-responsibility pattern;coherence (physics);color;consensus dynamics;continuation;dialog system;digital image;experience;experiment;feature extraction;html;high-level programming language;information needs;information retrieval;information seeking;multimodal interaction;natural language generation;prototype;search engine indexing;semiconductor industry;similarity measure;www	Ulrich Thiel;Jon Atle Gulla;Adrian Müller;Adelheit Stein	1995			natural language processing;information needs;abductive reasoning;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;information retrieval;abductive logic programming;human–computer information retrieval	AI	-36.030553832048675	-56.155155876555156	48095

It then associates with each user-defined activity the set of resources that the user accesses when performing that activity. In order to correctly associate resources with activities and provide useful activity-related services to the user, the system needs to know the current activity of the user at all times. It is often convenient for the user to explicitly declare which activity he/she is working on. But frequently the user forgets to do this. TaskTracer applies machine learning methods to detect undeclared activity switches and predict the correct activity of the user. This paper presents TaskPredictor2, a complete redesign of the activity predictor in TaskTracer and its notification user interface. TaskPredictor2 applies a novel online learning algorithm that is able to incorporate a richer set of features than our previous predictors. We prove an error bound for the algorithm and present experimental results that show improved accuracy and a 180-fold speedup on real user data. The user interface supports negotiated interruption and makes it easy for the user to correct both the predicted time of the task switch and the predicted activity.	activity tracker;algorithm;desktop computer;interrupt;kerrison predictor;machine learning;network switch;sensor;speedup;user interface	Jianqiang Shen;Jed Irvine;Xinlong Bao;Michael Goodman;Stephen Kolibaba;Anh Tran;Fredric Carl;Brenton Kirschner;Simone Stumpf;Thomas G.

To help users submit queries to different Web databases, the query interface matching problem needs to be addressed. To solve this problem, we propose a new complex schema matching approach, Holistic Schema Matching (HSM). By examining the query interfaces of real Web databases, we observe that attribute matchings can be discovered from attribute-occurrence patterns. For example, First Name often appears together with Last Name while it is rarely co-present with Author in the Books domain. Thus, we design a count-based greedy algorithm to identify which attributes are more likely to be matched in the query interfaces. In particular, HSM can identify both simple matching i.e., 1:1 matching, and complex matching, i.e., 1:n or m:n matching, between attributes. Our experiments show that HSM can discover both simple and complex matchings accurately and efficiently on real data sets.	holism	Weifeng Su;Jiying Wang;Frederick H.

Inter-rater agreement measurement can be used to quantify this consistency among terminology users. Increasingly, studies of SNOMED CT include inter-rater agreement measures. However, published studies do not consider distance between concepts when calculating the inter-rater agreement measures. In this paper we propose a semantic inter-rater agreement measure for use with SNOMED CT encoded data. A semantic Krippendorff's α measure is implemented using a path-length based difference function. The measure is tested using three different datasets. Results show that the proposed semantic measure is sensitive to seriousness of coding differences whereas a nominal measure is not. The proposed measure reflects the intuition that distance matters when comparing uses of SNOMED CT.	ct scan;four-dimensional computed tomography;inter-rater reliability;intuition;scientific publication;semantic interoperability;systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms;x-ray computed tomography	Daniel Karlsson;Kirstine Rosenbeck Gøeg;Håkan Örman;Anne Randorff Højen	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-432-9-151	computer science;data mining;database;information retrieval;information system	Web+IR	-44.60495605791434	-67.92283132307217	48420
032a1cd7cb2f897061cc18e20d15d68e8cfdc124	developing benchmarks: the importance of the process and new paradigms	benchmarking;datasets;audiovisual access;video hyperlinking	"""The value and importance of Benchmark Evaluations is widely acknowledged. Benchmarks play a key role in many research projects. It takes time, a well-balanced team of domain specialists preferably with links to the user community and industry, and a strong involvement of the research community itself to establish a sound evaluation framework that includes (annotated) data sets, well-defined tasks that reflect the needs in the 'real world', a proper evaluation methodology, ground-truth, including a strategy for repetitive assessments, and last but not least, funding. Although the benefits of an evaluation framework are typically reviewed from a perspective of 'research output' --e.g., a scientific publication demonstrating an advance of a certain methodology-- it is important to be aware of the value of the process of creating a benchmark itself: it increases significantly the understanding of the problem we want to address and as a consequence also the impact of the evaluation outcomes. In this talk I will overview the history of a series of tasks focusing on audiovisual search emphasizing its 'multimodal' aspects, starting in 2006 with the workshop on 'Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech' that led to tasks in CLEF and MediaEval (""""Search and Hyperlinking""""), and recently also TRECVid (""""Video Hyperlinking""""). The focus of my talk will be on the process rather than on the results of these evaluations themselves, and will address cross-benchmark connections, and new benchmark paradigms, specifically the integration of benchmarking in industrial 'living labs' that are becoming popular in some domains."""	benchmark (computing);ground truth;hyperlink;living lab;multimodal interaction;scientific literature;spontaneous order;virtual community	Roeland Ordelman	2016		10.1145/2983554.2983562	simulation;computer science;data mining;multimedia	Web+IR	-40.588509513627095	-62.909033584189004	48518

They, therefore, require reminders in a timely fashion while performing ADLs. This is a very stressful situation for the caregivers of people with dementia. In this paper we describe a pilot study where a tele-operated assistive robot helps a group of older adults with dementia (OAwD) to perform an ADL, namely making a cup of tea in the kitchen. Five OAwD along with their caregivers participated in this study which took place in a simulated-home setting. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and usability of a robotic system in assisting the OAwD to perform ADL in a home setting. The findings from this study will contribute to achieve our ultimate goal of designing a full-fledged assistive robot that assists OAwD aging in their own homes. The assistive robots designed for people with dementia mostly focus on companionship. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to design an assistive robot which will provide step-by-step guidance to people with dementia in their activities of daily living.	activities of daily living (activity);architecture description language;assistive technology;behavior;cognition disorders;dementia;home automation;in-place algorithm;limited stage (cancer stage);mental recall;mobile robot;occur (action);prototype;request - action;robot;robot (device);stage level 1;tcap gene;tea;telephone number;television;usability;user-centered design	Momotaz Begum;Rosalie Wang;Rajibul Huq;Alex Mihailidis	2013	2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)	10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650405	simulation;physical medicine and rehabilitation;engineering;communication	Robotics	-56.689753888435234	-56.042724752049594	48525

To conduct treatment disparity surveillance, we linked 2005-2009 Nebraska Cancer Registry data with Nebraska hospital discharge data. Due to the high quality of both datasets and the proposed linkage procedure, we had a linkage rate of 97 percent. We demonstrate the utilization of the linked dataset in case finding, treatment update, and treatment surveillance. The results show that the linked dataset is likely to identify up to 5 percent of potential missed cases. We investigated the use of radiation therapy in treating colorectal and breast cancers as case-finding examples. The linked dataset found 12 percent and 14 percent more treatment cases for colorectal and breast cancer patients, respectively.

82d484c392f8a6a183584bdaa512548ee9a57dde	mixed methods for evaluating user satisfaction		Evaluation is a fundamental part of a recommendation system. Evaluation typically takes one of three forms: (1) smaller lab studies with real users; (2) batch tests with offline collections, judgements, and measures; (3) large-scale controlled experiments (e.g. A/B tests) looking at implicit feedback. But it is rare for the first to inform and influence the latter two; in particular, implicit feedback metrics often have to be continuously revised and updated as assumptions are found to be poorly supported.  Mixed methods research enables practitioners to develop robust evaluation metrics by combining strengths of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. In this tutorial, we will show how qualitative research on user behavior provides insight on the relationship between implicit signals and satisfaction. These insights can inform and augment quantitative modeling and analysis for online and offline metrics and evaluation.	a/b testing;characterization test;computer user satisfaction;experiment;feedback;online and offline;recommender system	Jean Garcia-Gathright;Christine Hosey;Brian St. Thomas;Ben Carterette;Fernando Diaz	2018		10.1145/3240323.3241622	information retrieval;machine learning;multimethodology;recommender system;online and offline;artificial intelligence;computer science;qualitative research	Web+IR	-37.324761263955736	-54.3739284615365	48836

When annotations of the same data are collected from two or more coders, the reliability of the data may need to be q uantified. Two obstacles have stood in the way of applying reliability m etrics: incommensurate units across annotations, and lack of a convenient representation of the coding values. Given N coders and M cod ing units, reliability is computed from an N-by-M matrix tha t records the value assigned to unit M j by coder Nk. The solution I present accommodates a wide range of coding c hoices for the annotator, while preserving the same units across codings. As a consequ ence, it permits a straightforward application of reliabil ity measurement. In addition, in coreference annotation, disagreements can be complete or partial so I incorporate a distance metric to sca le disagreements. This method has also been applied to a quite distinct coding t ask, namely semantic annotation of summaries.	text corpus	Rebecca J.

02e5e0f3cb78ddcd4a18071beb1d9f39f7674362	a hypermedia tool to support the interaction between radiologists and clinicians.		In this work we discuss problems related to the radiological reporting process and attempt to identify the ones which emerge during clinician-radiologist communication. We propose a hyper-reporting system, which allows the clinician to share the knowledge and critical factors that prompt the radiologist's diagnostic hypothesis during the discussion of results. This is possible by creating hypermedia links among different elements: reporting text, images, comments and the graphic models library. These elements make radiological knowledge explicit and clarify to the clinician the logical-diagnostic path traveled by the radiologist. A questionnaire, a survey of clinicians' and radiologists' needs allowed us to define some aspects of a hypermedia demo interface. Finally, we describe an example of a working session with the use of a few explanatory cards.		Mariano DeSimone;Cecilia Lalle;Fabrizio L.

Ryan Companionbot prototyped in this project, is a rear-projected life-like conversational robot. Ryan is equipped with features that can (1) interpret and respond to users' emotions through facial expressions and spoken language, (2) proactively engage in conversations with users, and (3) remind them about their daily life schedules (e.g. taking their medicine on time). Ryan engages users in cognitive games and reminiscence activities. We conducted a pilot study with six elderly individuals with moderate dementia and/or depression living in a senior living facility in Denver. Each individual had 24/7 access to a Ryan in his/her room for a period of 4–6 weeks. Our observations of these individuals, interviews with them and their caregivers, and analyses of their interactions during this period revealed that they established rapport with the robot and greatly valued and enjoyed having a Companionbot in their room.

The objective of this study was to characterize the information needs of these stakeholders to inform the design of informatics tools that support wellness in older adults. We conducted four focus groups with 31 older adults and three focus groups with 10 health care providers to explore information needs, goals, and preferences for information sharing. Analysis of focus group transcripts was performed to identify and compare themes for different stakeholders. We identified four themes related to information activities: perceived goals of others, perceived information needs of others, information sharing by older adults, and role of family members. Older adults, family members and health care providers differ in their information needs. We provide recommendations to facilitate design and adoption of informatics tools that connect these stakeholders. Larger studies are needed to characterize different stakeholder goals, information needs and preferences.	clinical informatics;decision making;focus group;health care;informatics (discipline);information needs;large;transcript;women's health services	Blaine Reeder;Thai Le;Hilaire J Thompson;George Demiris	2013		10.3233/978-1-61499-289-9-18	gerontology;family medicine;medicine;nursing	HCI	-61.819255650389195	-61.87514231342492	49317

These children suffer from varying degrees of speech impediment. Current treatments include speech therapy, but such treatments are not equally accessible for children from different socio-economic backgrounds. When available, speech therapists find it difficult to evaluate the children's progress in articulation over time. Buddy is a therapy robot for CL/P children that can provide contextual speech therapy in a gamified story-building format. To improve articulation, Buddy will provide robust visual feedback during these sessions and guide the children in enunciating tough words while collecting data of speech pattern for further analysis by the speech therapist.	biconnected component;gamification;robot	Pavithra Ramamurthy;Tingyu Li	2018		10.1145/3173386.3177830	human–computer interaction;audiology;speech therapist;robot;computer science;speech impediment;human–robot interaction	HCI	-56.98702236042063	-52.52709698617268	49667

Their application has increased considerably in areas in which we are presented with a large amount of data and we have to identify an underlying pattern. This paper will look at their application to stylometry. We believe that statistical methods of attributing authorship can be coupled effectively with neural networks to produce a very powerful classification tool. We illustrate this with an example of a famous case of disputed authorship, The Federalist Papers. Our method assigns the disputed papers to Madison, a result which is consistent with previous work on the subject.	neural networks;stylometry	Fiona J. Tweedie;S. Singh;David I.

ICPs form part of local working agreements to assist co-ordination of multi-disciplinary teams to deliver evidence-based care plans to individual patients. They also document the expected progress of specific patient groups as part of clinical records. To anticipate increased use of ICPs, we have developed Healthcare@Home, a research-phase demonstrator for improving integration of information along the patient path. Healthcare@Home includes support for at-home, in-clinic and mobile wireless sensor devices feeding patient-proximal data hubs, timeline-based physiological trend analysis, data aggregation/dashboarding and individualised risk stratification. These and other decision support tools are embedded in portal designs supporting ‘end-to-end’ workflows as focused by the composite needs of a National Service Framework (NSF) for patients with diabetes. Healthcare@Home thus represents a scaleable, extensible personalised healthcare information system driven directly from national policy on disease early detection and prevention. Individual portlets have been mapped to stages in the ICP. The portal technologies employed, running on PCs, mobile phones or TVs are capable of highly cost-effective ‘end-to-end, anywhere-to-anywhere’ information integration.	data aggregation;decision support system;embedded system;end-to-end principle;ibm notes;information system;mobile phone;personal computer;portlet;timeline	Ali Shaikh Ali;Omer F.

However, designing the right metapatterns for a given application still remains a difficulty task. In this paper, we present a metapattern generator that can automatically generate metapatterns from new databases. By integrating this generator with the existing metapattern-based discovery loop, our system has now become both interactive and automatic. It can suggest new metapatterns for humans to choose and test, or pursue these metapatterns on its own. This ability not only makes the process of data mining more efficient and productive, but also provide a new method for unsupervised learning of relational patterns. We have applied this method to several simple databases and obtained some encouraging results. Introduction Metapatterns (also known as metaqueries) (Shen et al. 1995; Kero et al. 1995; Fu & Han 1995; Shen & Leng 1996) have been proposed as a new data mining approach to integrate induction, deduction, and human guidance. They are second-order expressions, such as where P, Q, and R are variables for predicates and X, Y, and 2 are variables for objects. Metapatterns are used to control the discovery loop shown in Figure 1. For the deductive part of the loop, metapatterns outline data-collecting strategies and serve as the basis for the generation of specific queries. Queries are generated by instantiating the variables in the left-hand side of metapatterns with relevant table names and column names in the database of interest and then run against the database to collect relevant data. For example, one possible query instantiated from the above metapattern is: parent(X, Y) A brother(Y, 2) * uncie(X, Z). The final results of discovered patterns are associated with probability factors to reflect how much support received from the underlying databases and provide handlers to deal with noise. For the inductive part of the loop, metapatterns serve as generic descriptions of 152 KDD-96 Bing Leng Inference Corporation 4th Fl, 8410 W Bryn Mawr Ave Chicago, IL 60631 leng@inference.com classes of pattern to be discovered: A metapattern determines which inductive action to apply, and what format the final results should be in. Furthermore, since metapatterns are declarative expressions, they serve as a search control interface between humans and systems. By examing, selecting, and executing different metapatterns, human users can expand or contract the search space and change the search direction at will. For more detailed description of metapatterns, readers are encouraged to read (Shen et al. 1995) and (Shen & Leng 1996). Although metapatterns are powerful tools for data mining and have been applied successfully to several real-world applications (Shen 1992; Shen et al. 1995; Fu & Han 1995), designing the right metapatterns for a given application is not an easy task. If a metapattern is too specific, then it may miss the interesting patterns. If a metapattern is too general, then it may exhaust the computing resources that are available. To generate the right metapatterns, one must not only understand the nature of the underlying data, but also analyze the patterns discovered from the previous metapatterns. To illustrate how productive metapatterns are generated manually, consider our experience in the chemical research domain as an example. Following a suggestion by a chemist, we initially used a metapattern to find the relationship between a set of compounds that have different percentages of the ingredients ‘A322’ and ‘B721’ and their chemical properties. However, the patterns returned based on this metapattern did not show any trends. When we showed the results to the chemist, he discovered that these compounds also contained auxiliary chemicals that may affect the properties in a different way. Given this knowledge, we constrained the metapattern so that the compounds that had such auxiliary ingredients were not considered. Sure enough, the resulting patterns showed many clear trends. We can see from this example that if domain experts can directly interact with the system (i.e., metapatterns can be automatically generated and offered to them to choose and test), then the entire discovery process can be much more efficient and proFrom: KDD-96 Proceedings.

Computerassisted textual analysis is now a well known and important facet of scholarly investigation (Potter, 1991; Burrows, 2004; Yang, 2005) however it relies heavily on statistical approaches in which the computer uses character matching to identify reoccurring strings. Although pattern recognition for image and audio search is growing more sophisticated (Downie, 2009), the techniques for annotation of multimedia are subject to the same limitations as those for text in that they cannot go beyond the shape or the waveform into the meaning that those artifacts of expression represent.	markup language;pattern recognition;text corpus;waveform;yang	K.

db94816d7e5baa81e9f873829945492435d66daf	effects on productivity and safety of map and augmented reality navigation paradigms	augmented reality;situation awareness;productivity	Navigation systems providing route-guidance and traffic information are one of the most widely used driver-support systems these days. Most navigation systems are based on the map paradigm which plots the driving route in an abstracted version of a two-dimensional electronic map. Recently, a new navigation paradigm was introduced that is based on the augmented reality (AR) paradigm which displays the driving route by superimposing virtual objects on the real scene. These two paradigms have their own innate characteristics from the point of human cognition, and so complement each other rather than compete with each other. Regardless of the paradigm, the role of any navigation system is to support the driver in achieving his driving goals. The objective of this work is to investigate how these map and AR navigation paradigms impact the achievement of the driving goals: productivity and safety. We performed comparative experiments using a driving simulator and computers with 38 subjects. For the effects on productivity, driver’s performance on three levels (control level, tactical level, and strategic level) of driving tasks was measured for each map and AR navigation condition. For the effects on safety, driver’s situation awareness of safety-related events on the road was measured. To find how these navigation paradigms impose visual cognitive workload on driver, we tracked driver’s eye movements. As a special factor of driving performance, route decision making at the complex decision points such as junction, overpass, and underpass was investigated additionally. Participant’s subjective workload was assessed using the Driving Activity Load Index (DALI). Results indicated that there was little difference between the two navigation paradigms on driving performance. AR navigation attracted driver’s visual attention more frequently than map navigation and then reduces awareness of and proper action for the safety-related events. AR navigation was faster and better to support route decision making at the complex decision points. According to the subjective workload assessment, AR navigation was visually and temporally more demanding. key words: map navigation, AR navigation, productivity, safety, driving performance and situation awareness	augmented reality;cognition;computer;driving simulator;experiment;gps navigation device;map;programming paradigm;satellite navigation;simulation	Kyong-Ho Kim;Kwang-Yun Wohn	2011	IEICE Transactions		turn-by-turn navigation;situation awareness;augmented reality;productivity;simulation;cognition;attention;decision support system;computer science;artificial intelligence;system;mobile robot navigation;eye movement	HCI	-46.74191603578883	-53.15542918032706	50316

An individual’s characteristics are compared to those of some canonical user type, and the user included in various user groups accordingly. Those user groups might be defined according to academic ability or recreational interests, but the aim is to include the user in relevant groups where appropriate. The user model described here operates on the principle of exclusion, not inclusion, and its purpose is to detect atypical behaviour, seeing if a user falls outside a category, rather than inside one. That is, it performs anomaly detection against either an individual user model or a typical user model. Such a principle can be usefully applied in many ways, such as early detection of illness, or discovering students with learning issues. In this paper, we apply the anomaly detection principle to the detection of intruders on a computer system masquerading as real users, by comparing the behaviour of the intruder with the expected behaviour of the user as characterised by their user model. This behaviour is captured in characteristics such as typing habits, Web page usage and application usage. An experimental intrusion detection system (IDS) was built with user models reflecting these characteristics, and it was found that comparison with a small number of key characteristics from a user model can very quickly detect anomalies and thus identify an intruder.	anomaly detection;categorization;computer;database;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system;machine learning;n-gram;primary source;text editor;user experience;user modeling;web page	Grant Pannell;Helen Ashman	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-13470-8_20	user;user modeling;engineering;unique user;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-43.28205202104512	-57.10547988943327	50534

We describe the design and evaluation of a computeranimated conversational agent that is used in conjunction with Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) to help individuals with chronic pain and depression manage their stress. The agent coaches patients in between group visit sessions, reviewing how to manage stress using non-pharmaceutical techniques (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, yoga self-massage). We conducted a longitudinal clinical trial with 154 participants in which patients in the intervention group interacted with the conversational agent at home on a touch screen tablet to reinforce what they learned in group medical visits. Results from the trial indicate that the conversational agent, in conjunction with medical group visits, leads to significantly more positive stress management behaviors in patients compared to outcomes that arise in usual care, after 9 and 21 weeks.	dialog system;futures studies;interactivity;kinect;population;sensor;tablet computer;touchscreen	Ameneh Shamekhi;Timothy W.

It is affected by team behaviour or cognition. Usually a team with a good shared cognition can perform better and achieve the set goal faster. Having a good team with a good shared behaviour is even more crucial in health care environments, especially for laprascopic surgery applications. Analyzing team cognition is a new area of research. In this paper, we study the team cognition between two surgeons, who performed a laparascopic simulation operation, by analyzing their eye tracking data spatially and temporally. We used Cross Recurrence Analysis (CRA) and overlap analysis to find spatio-temporal features that can be used to distinguish between a good performer team and a bad performer team. Dual eye tracking data for twenty two dyad teams were recorded during the simulation and then the teams were divided into good performer and poor performer teams based on the time to finish the task. We then analyze the signals to find common features for good performer teams. The results of this research indicates that the good performer teams show a smaller delay as well as have a higher overlap in the eyegaze signals compared to poor performer teams.

The common daily activities, such as watching television or reading a book, involve this natural activity which consists of rapidly shifting our gaze from one region to another. The identification of the main components of eye movement during visual exploration such as fixations and saccades, is the objective of the analysis of eye movements in various contexts ranging from basic neuro sciences and visual sciences to virtual reality interactions and robotics. However, many of the algorithms that detect fixations present a number of problems. In this article, we present a new fixation identification algorithm based on the analysis of variance and F-test. We present the new algorithm and we compare it with the common fixations algorithm based on dispersion. To demonstrate the performance of our approach we tested the algorithm in a group of healthy subjects.	algorithm;interaction;robotics;virtual reality	Giacomo Veneri;Pietro Piu;Pamela Federighi;Francesca Rosini;Antonio Federico;Alessandra Rufa	2010	2010 2nd International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing	10.1109/CIP.2010.5604221	computer vision;simulation;eye tracking;computer science;communication	HCI	-40.35506998637723	-53.010334365048	50651

In this paper, we report an ethnographic study that examined the institutionalization of the PL. Specifically, we explored: (1) how different groups (primary care providers, inpatient hospitalists, specialists, and emergency doctors) perceived the purposes of the PL differently; (2) how these deviated perceptions might affect their use of the PL; and (3) how the technical design of the PL facilitated or hindered the clinical practices of these groups. We found significant ambiguity regarding the definition, benefits, and use of the PL across different groups. We also found that certain groups (e.g. primary care providers) had developed effective cooperative strategies regarding the use of the PL; however, suboptimal usage was common among other user types, which could have a profound impact on quality of care and safety. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions to improve the design of the PL, particularly on strengthening its support on longitudinal and cooperative clinical practices.	cooperative mimo;documentation	Xiaomu Zhou;Kai Zheng;Mark S.

This paper presents an innovative approach to detect the main reasons causing the delay in communication between healthcare actors in a local hospital, with a special focus on communication between surgeons and physicians. The research methodology consists of using quality tools based on Six sigma principles, as fishbone diagram to identify factors affecting the communication in the surgery department, and the XY matrix to highlight the most affecting factors on patient health in terms of delay in communication. In that purpose, many dysfunctions in information exchange were noticed between surgeons, physicians, nurses, etc. As a conclusion, the study recommends the use of secured smartphones applications to access patients' records and the design of an architecture helping in reducing the current communication time for a faster service. This application aims also at securing communication between the major actors involved in the process of providing care. The use of computer applications will provide safe and efficient treatment for post-surgical patient and prevent/limit the complications after surgeries.

22f5bdd34d50f308ac5c25a5f556fcde0369b356	understanding the interaction support for mobile work in an emergency room		Typically mobile and ubiquitous software applications provide services to mobile workers to help them increase their performance, effectiveness and eventually the satisfaction while doing their jobs. These services are directly related to the characterization of the activities to be supported. Based on such a characterization the designers of these solutions can envision the services that should be provided by the new system. Few guidelines are available to characterize mobile activities from an IT support point of view, therefore the designers have to guess the services to be embedded in these solutions. This paper provides a first step to address such a problem, identifying the context variables that characterize the mobile activities. Moreover, an ontology of activity characteristics and some design guidelines are provided to determine which supporting services can be used to address activities according to their characteristics. This proposal was conceived based on the empirical observation of the work performed by the medical personnel at an emergency room of a public hospital. Further analysis is required to generalize this proposal, in order to address mobile work in other scenarios.		Sergio F.

One of the challenging factors in the application of such intelligent systems concerns the question what the operator is doing in order to optimize support and minimize automation surprises. This study questions whether eye metrics are able to determine what task the operator is engages in. We therefore examined A) if the eye-path would differ for three different ATC tasks and B) whether this effect can be quantified with six eye-metrics. In an experiment, the six eye-metrics were calculated and used as a dependent variable. The results show that some tasks can be inferred by eye movement metrics and other metrics infer workload, although none inferred by both task and workload.	advanced tactical center;artificial intelligence;automation;eb-eye	Puck Imants;Tjerk de Greef	2014		10.1145/2637248.2637274	computer vision;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;engineering;air traffic control;fixation	Robotics	-47.514207260791125	-53.10738370157313	50882

Because this evidence must also be collected in everyday life, it is a technique that can greatly benefit from automated capture technologies. These solutions, however, can raise significant concerns about privacy, control, and surveillance. In this paper, we present an analysis of these concerns with regard to evidence-based care. This analysis underscores the need to consider community-based risk and reward analyses in addition to the traditionally used analyses for individual users when designing socially appropriate technologies.	game mechanics;privacy	Gillian R.

f8d8d600a3baf039f33122f68706410aa294a741	precision and negative predictive value of links between clinicaltrials.gov and pubmed		One of the goals of translational science is to shorten the time from discovery to clinical use. Clinical trial registries were established to increase transparency in completed and ongoing clinical trials, and they support linking trials with resulting publications. We set out to investigate precision and negative predictive value (NPV) of links between ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) and PubMed. CT.gov has been established to increase transparency in clinical trials and the link to PubMed is crucial for supporting a number of important functions, including ascertaining publication bias. We drew a random sample of trials downloaded from CT.gov and performed manual review of retrieved publications. We characterize two types of links between trials and publications (NCT-link originating from MEDLINE and PMID-link originating from CT.gov).The link precision is different based on type (NCT-link: 100%; PMID-link: 63% to 96%). In trials with no linked publication, we were able to find publications 44% of the time (NPV=56%) by searching PubMed. This low NPV shows that there are potentially numerous publications that should have been formally linked with the trials. Our results indicate that existing trial registry and publisher policies may not be fully enforced. We suggest some automated methods for improving link quality.	clinicaltrials.gov;data access;disease attributes;evidence-based medicine;genetic translation process;informatics (discipline);medline;negative predictive value of diagnostic test;nucleopolyhedrovirus;policy;pubmed;random sampling;registries;translational research;value (computer science)	Vojtech Huser;James J.

Available evaluation methods are commonly based on the classical recall and precision measures. While these methods provide an evaluation of average system performance, they are not able to identify influence of other factors such as retrieval task and system user. Detailed information is hidden behind the average and no indication can be obtained from the evaluation for further improvement. Therefore, there is a need of new methods for detailed evaluation. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to the evaluation of IR results so that effects of both an IR system and the environment where the system performs on retrieval results can be examined. It aids in the identification of problems of the system and the environment with respect to retrieval effectiveness, and assists in making improvement for IR.	information retrieval;precision and recall;usability	Xiangzhu Gao;San Murugesan;Bruce W.

Icons are pictographic representations of data or processes within a computer system, which have been used to replace commands and menus as the means by which the computer supports a dialogue with the end-user. They have been applied principally to graphics-based interfaces to operating systems, networks and document-processing software.  The paper attempts to provide a more systematic treatment of icon interfaces than has hitherto been made, and to create a classification which it is hoped will be of use to the dialogue designer. The characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of icon-based dialogues are described. Metaphors, design alternatives, display structures and implementation factors are discussed, and there is a summary of some icon design guidelines drawn from a variety of sources. Some mention is also made of attempts by researchers to measure the effectiveness of icon designs empirically.

However, a substantial proportion of health research using electronic health records, data collected and generated during routine clinical care, potentially cannot reproduced. With the complexity, volume and variety of electronic health records made available for research steadily increasing, it is critical to ensure that findings from such data are reproducible and replicable by researchers. In this paper, we present some preliminary findings on how a series of methods and tools utilized in adjunct scientific disciplines can be used to enhance the reproducibility of research using electronic health records.

The game uses a positive feedback loop that penalizes fast breathing by means of a proportionalderivative control law: rapid (and/or increasing) breathing rates increase game difficulty and reduce the final score of the game. We evaluated Chill-Out against a conventional non-biofeedback game and traditional relaxation based on deep breathing. Measurements of breathing rate, electrodermal activity, and heart rate variability show that playing Chill-Out leads to lower arousal during a subsequent task designed to induce stress.	heart rate variability;linear programming relaxation;optimal control;positive feedback;video game developer	Avinash Parnandi;Beena Ahmed;Eva Shipp;Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-05452-0_18	simulation;physical therapy;multimedia	HCI	-56.450981670378475	-54.58700860957017	51292

A key type of correlation is linking medications to clinical problems; while some databases of problem-medication links are available, they are not robust and depend on problems and medications being encoded in particular terminologies. Crowdsourcing represents one approach to generating robust knowledge bases across a variety of terminologies, but more sophisticated approaches are necessary to improve accuracy and reduce manual data review requirements.   OBJECTIVE We sought to develop and evaluate a clinician reputation metric to facilitate the identification of appropriate problem-medication pairs through crowdsourcing without requiring extensive manual review.   APPROACH We retrieved medications from our clinical data warehouse that had been prescribed and manually linked to one or more problems by clinicians during e-prescribing between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2011. We identified measures likely to be associated with the percentage of accurate problem-medication links made by clinicians. Using logistic regression, we created a metric for identifying clinicians who had made greater than or equal to 95% appropriate links. We evaluated the accuracy of the approach by comparing links made by those physicians identified as having appropriate links to a previously manually validated subset of problem-medication pairs.   RESULTS Of 867 clinicians who asserted a total of 237,748 problem-medication links during the study period, 125 had a reputation metric that predicted the percentage of appropriate links greater than or equal to 95%. These clinicians asserted a total of 2464 linked problem-medication pairs (983 distinct pairs). Compared to a previously validated set of problem-medication pairs, the reputation metric achieved a specificity of 99.5% and marginally improved the sensitivity of previously described knowledge bases.   CONCLUSION A reputation metric may be a valuable measure for identifying high quality clinician-entered, crowdsourced data.	clinical decision support system;crowdsourcing;database;decision support systems, clinical;display resolution;electronic health records;electronic prescribing;knowledge base;logistic regression;patients;requirement;sensitivity and specificity;subgroup	Allison B.

The first is a corpus-based approach using feature analysis. It brings up three new ideas: 1) to employ ranked position to emphasize the significance of sentence position, 2) to reshape word unit to achieve higher accuracy of keyword importance, and 3) to train a score function by the genetic algorithm for obtaining a suitable combination of feature weights. The second approach combines the ideas of latent semantic analysis and text relationship maps to interpret conceptual structures of a document. Both approaches are applied to Chinese text summarization. The two approaches were evaluated by using a data corpus composed of 100 articles about politics from New Taiwan Weekly, and when the compression ratio was 30%, average recalls of 52.0% and 45.6% were achieved respectively.	automatic summarization;genetic algorithm;latent semantic analysis;map;text corpus	Jen-Yuan Yeh;Hao-Ren Ke;Wei-Pang Yang	2002		10.1007/3-540-36227-4_8	natural language processing;speech recognition;latent semantic analysis;computer science;artificial intelligence;automatic summarization;compression ratio;data mining;database;linguistics;language;data analysis;chinese;information extraction	NLP	-35.36827160830147	-61.19365141322812	51379

Our analysis of the semi-structured interviews, pre/post-intervention instruments, and photo-elicitation interviews suggests that participants gained a greater awareness of their own snacking practices and those of their family members. Users were empowered to adjust their own practices and beliefs around healthy eating because they were more aware of their family's snacking behaviors. We describe the unique social dynamics of how families engaged with each other and the application, which includes positive social support for healthy eating. By providing insights into family interactions and experiences with the application, we identify benefits, challenges, and strategies when designing family-level sociotechnical interventions for healthy behavior.	interaction;mobile app;scsi enclosure services;semiconductor industry;social dynamics;social support;sociotechnical system	Christopher L.

60c1e06140f304513e7865ef5f4976d9b7be7aca	a text extraction software benchmark based on a synthesized dataset		Text extraction plays an important function for data processing workflows in digital libraries. For example, it is a crucial prerequisite for evaluating the quality of migrated textual documents. Complex file formats make the extraction process error-prone and have made it very challenging to verify the correctness of extraction components. Based on digital preservation and information retrieval scenarios, three quality requirements in terms of effectiveness of text extraction tools are identified: 1) is a certain text snippet correctly extracted from a document, 2) does the extracted text appear in the right order relatively to other elements and, 3) is the structure of the text preserved. A number of text extraction tools is available fulfilling these three quality requirements to various degrees. However, systematic benchmarks to evaluate those tools are still missing, mainly due to the lack of datasets with accompanying ground truth. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First we describe a dataset generation method based on model driven engineering principles and use it to synthesize a dataset and its ground truth directly from a model. Second, we define a benchmark for text extraction tools and complete an experiment to calculate performance measures for several tools that cover the three quality requirements. The results demonstrate the benefits of the approach in terms of scalability and effectiveness in generating ground truth for content and structure of text elements.

More recently, information science researchers have turned to other, newer artificial intelligence-based inductive learning techniques including neural networks, symbolic learning, and genetic algorithms. The newer techniques have provided great opportunities for researchers to experiment with diverse paradigms for effective information processing and retrieval.In this article we first provide an overview of newer techniques and their usage in information science research. We then present in detail the algorithms we adopted for a hybrid Genetic Algorithms and Neural Nets based system, called GANNET. GANNET performed concept (keyword) optimization for user-selected documents during information retrieval using the genetic algorithms. It then used the optimized concepts to perform concept exploration in a large network of related concepts through the Hopfield net parallel relaxation procedure. Based on a test collection of about 3,000 articles from DIALOG and an automatically created thesaurus, and using Jaccard's score as a performance measure, our experiment showed that GANNET improved the Jaccard's scores by about 50 percent and it helped identify the underlying concepts (keywords) that best describe the user-selected documents."""	document retrieval;machine learning	Hsinchun Chen;Jinwoo Kim	1995	J. of Management Information Systems		document retrieval;cognitive models of information retrieval;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining;world wide web;information extraction;information retrieval;human–computer information retrieval	Web+IR	-34.61739989127337	-57.37047994139182	51707

However, ads placed in contexts where they are rarely viewed, or where users are unlikely to be interested in commercial results, may receive few clicks regardless of their quality. In this paper, we gain insight into user browsing and click behavior for the purpose of click analysis in sponsored search domain. The list of ads displayed on a page, the user's initial motivation to browse this list, and the persistence of the user are among the contextual factors considered in this paper. We propose a probabilistic model for user's browsing and click behavior using these contextual factors. To evaluate the performance of the model, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results confirm that these contextual factors can better reflect user browsing and click behavior in sponsored search.	browsing;persistence (computer science);search engine marketing;statistical model	Azin Ashkan;Charles L.

Current systems have been long criticized due to shortcomings such as lack of coverage of publications and low accuracy of the citation data. Surprisingly, incomplete or incorrect data are used to make important decisions about researchers' careers. We argue that a new approach based on the collection of citation data at the time the papers are created can overcome current limitations, and we propose a new framework in which the research community is the owner of a Global Citation Registry characterized by high quality citation data handled automatically. We envision a registry that will be accessible by all the interested parties and will be the source from which the different impact models can be applied. Introduction and motivation Research is an intrinsically social activity. We work with colleagues, sharing research projects and co-authoring papers; we agree about the utility of peer review for selecting papers for publication, cite others' works, and evaluate ourselves in terms of the impact of our work. In a community that includes supporters for both manual and automatic approaches, both with advantages and shortcomings, there seems to be an overall feeling that current citation-based impact assessment systems are used because they provide the """"least bad"""" solution to the problem of evaluating scientific output, and that people prefer one or another depending on how highly they are ranked in a particular system. And, paradoxically, these measures, obtained from incomplete or incorrect citation counts, are used to make important decisions regarding researchers' careers such as positions and grants. After years of being dominated by commercial systems, citation analysis needs an in-depth transformation. The proliferation of publications in recent years has made citation capture processes at the commercial level increasingly costly due to the need for human involvement in generating the records; this high cost, in addition to the strong business interests of companies, has led to incomplete coverage of journals and conferences in commercial databases. As an alternative to the commercial entities, several freely accessible systems have emerged that automatically extract citation information from online documents; this has led to a significant increase in publication coverage over that of fee-based systems.

Moreover, biomedical information is often compiled in developed countries and may not appropriate for use in developing countries. For example, the guidelines established by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children are not always applicable in the case of rotavirus gastroenteritis, because the concentration of sodium in oral saline solutions is too high for infants. In this context, we believe ontologies can play an important role in patient management. Semantic Web ontologies foster sharing and reuse of knowledge and facilitate collaboration between pediatricians and consultant pediatric nephrologists.

To get this goal, this work started with the investigation of lexical and semantic domain of radiological texts, followed by the design and implementation of an ontology, called RadOn, and the modeling of a database based on it. The next step was the development of a set of integrated software components, called E-Rad, based on text mining techniques, which identifies and extracts words, terms and expressions from free texts, adjusts them to the ontology structure and stores them. Finally, a query engine that works on the E-Rad structure, having a user interface, was implemented. The outcome is a computational environment that, by means of the implemented ontology and related tools, makes the data semantic explicit and allows the use of the context information in an optimal and standard way.	component-based software engineering;integrated software;text mining;user interface	Luana Peixoto Annibal;Joaquim Cezar Felipe	2009	2009 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	10.1109/CBMS.2009.5255393	upper ontology;text mining;computer science;ontology;data mining;database;ontology-based data integration;user interface;information retrieval	Robotics	-49.52028769607962	-67.6914159727826	52126
93b614fa9c6e2bf8615793ebf38e3222e2d5a7a3	tackling the term-mismatch problem in automated trace retrieval	requirements engineering;traceability;query augmentation;semantic traceability	Software systems operating in any type of safety or security critical domains must comply with an increasingly large and complex set of regulatory standards. Compliance is partially demonstrated through establishing trace links between requirements and regulatory codes. Such links can be constructed manually or through semi-automated techniques in which the text in the regulatory code is used to formulate an information retrieval query. However, trace retrieval solutions are not effective when significant vocabulary mismatches exist between regulatory codes and product level requirements. This paper describes and compares three query augmentation techniques for addressing the term mismatch problem and improving the quality of trace links generated between regulatory codes and requirements. The first trains a classifier to replace the original query with terms learned from a training set of regulation-to-requirements trace links. The second, replaces the original query with terms learned through web-mining; and the third utilizes a domain ontology to augment query terms. The ontology is constructed manually using a guided approach that leverages existing traceability knowledge. All three techniques were evaluated against security regulations from the USA government’s Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act (HIPAA) traced against ten healthcare related requirements specifications. The classification approach returned the best results; however, improvements were observed with both the classification and ontology based solutions. The web-mining technique showed improvements in only a subset of queries. The three query augmentation techniques offer tradeoffs in terms of performance, cost and effort, and usage viability within a specific project context.

A key class of measures useful in relating information systems to the quality of patient care is benefit or out-come measures, which reflect differences in the health or welfare of the patient that result from the system being utilized. A framework for describing evaluation measures is presented, definitions are discussed, and the results of a literature review are presented to indicate outcome measures used in medical informatics over several decades. The conclusion suggests that more attention should be given to the standardization of terminology and to outcome measures and methods.	informatics (discipline);information system;nomenclature;patients	Nancy K.

One possible approach to web personalization is to mine typical user profiles from the vast amount of historical data stored in access logs. In the absence of any a priori knowledge, unsupervised classification or clustering methods seem to be ideally suited to analyze the semi-structured log data of user accesses. In this paper, we define the notion of a “user session”, as well as a dissimilarity measure between two web sessions that captures the organization of a web site. To extract a user access profile, we cluster the user sessions based on the pair-wise dissimilarities using a robust fuzzy clustering algorithm that we have developed. We report the results of experiments with our algorithm and show that this leads to extraction of interesting user profiles. We also show that it outperforms association rule based approaches for this task.	algorithm;association rule learning;cluster analysis;experiment;fuzzy clustering;internet access;personalization;semiconductor industry;unsupervised learning;user profile;world wide web	Anupam Joshi;Raghu Krishnapuram	2000			the internet;a priori and a posteriori;association rule learning;fuzzy clustering;biological classification;computer science;web accessibility;data mining;personalization;database;cluster analysis;world wide web;information retrieval;information system	ML	-36.030694964209964	-57.751173171605394	52380

d7b147fd10cf7f867da6af3d2e739c6148f865a2	the impact of imaging informatics fellowships	imaging informatics;informatics training;medical;internship	Imaging informatics (II) is an area within clinical informatics that is particularly important in the field of radiology. Provider groups have begun employing dedicated radiologist-informaticists to bridge medical, information technology and administrative functions, and academic institutions are meeting this demand through formal II fellowships. However, little is known about how these programs influence graduates’ careers and perceptions about professional development. We electronically surveyed 26 graduates from US II fellowships and consensus leaders in the II community—many of whom were subspecialty diagnostic radiologists (68%) employed within academic institutions (48%)—about the perceived impact of II fellowships on career development and advancement. All graduates felt that II fellowship made them more valuable to employers, with the majority of reporting ongoing II roles (78%) and continued used of competencies (61%) and skills (56%) gained during fellowship in their current jobs. Other key benefits included access to mentors, protected time for academic work, networking opportunities, and positive impacts of annual compensation. Of respondents without II fellowship training, all would recommend fellowships to current trainees given the ability to gain a “still rare” but “essential skill set” that is “critical for future leaders in radiology” and “better job opportunities.” While some respondents felt that II fellowships needed further formalization and standardization, most (85%) disagreed with requiring a 2-year II fellowship in order to qualify for board certification in clinical informatics. Instead, most believed that fellowships should be integrated with clinical residency or fellowship training while preserving formal didactics and unstructured project time. More work is needed to understand existing variations in II fellowship training structure and identify the optimal format for programs targeted at radiologists.	board certification;experience;fellowship program;gene regulatory network;health care;imaging informatics;informatics (discipline);information sciences;occupations;procedure practitioner identifier code type - radiologist;radiology;review board;benefit;standards characteristics	Geraldine J.

Ontology is used to represent knowledge on the semantic web. Web services have been introduced to make the knowledge conveyed by the ontology on the semantic web accessible across different applications. This paper seeks to present the use of these latest advances in the context of a scholarly semantic web (or SSWeb) system, which can support advanced search functions such as expert finding and trend detection in addition to basic functions such as document and author search as well as document and author clustering search. Design/methodology/approach – A distributed architecture of the proposed SSWeb is described, as well as semantic web services that support scholarly information retrieval on the SSWeb. Findings – Initial experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective. Research limitations/implications – The work reported is experimental in nature. More work is needed, but early results are encouraging and the authors wish to make their work known to the research community by publishing this paper so that further progress can be made in this area of research. Originality/value – The work is presented in the context of scholarly document retrieval, but it could also be adapted to other types of documents, such as medical records, machine-fault records and legal documents. This is because the basic principles are the same.	cluster analysis;computer;distributed computing;document retrieval;email;experimental system;feedback;information retrieval;semantic web service;systems architecture	Thanh Tho Quan;Alvis Cheuk M.

From an experiment with 12 subjects, equivalent comfort contours were determined for vertical vibration of the hands with three grip forces. The perceived intensity of vibration on a rigid steering wheel was determined using the method of magnitude estimation at seven frequencies (4 to 250 Hz) over a range of vibration magnitudes (0.1 to 1.58 ms- 2 r.m.s). The comfort contours strongly depended on vibration magnitude, indicating that a frequency weighting for predicting sensation should be dependent on vibration magnitude. At low magnitudes, increased grip force increased sensitivity at high frequencies and enhanced the frequency-dependence of the equivalent comfort contours.

By adapting to new technologies that are available to both hospitals and government, NHCS is redefining the way agencies can collect survey data while still protecting the confidentiality of survey participants, both hospitals and patients. Creating a relationship with a base cohort of hospitals allows NHCS to make the most of future technological advances. However, challenges remain. The protection of the confidentiality of hospitals and patients is always paramount; some hospital software systems are unable to output electronic claims data in the preferred format; and some hospitals require automatic transmission of data. Nonetheless, by establishing electronic relationships with hospitals now, the National Center for Health Statistics is poised to take advantage of future technological advances, such as electronic abstraction of electronic health records for clinical data.	confidentiality;definition;mathematical optimization;software system	Shaleah Levant;Carol DeFrances	2012		10.1145/2307729.2307761	family medicine;medicine;nursing;emergency medicine	HCI	-58.66265550324245	-62.82084203796441	52677
96c37370d72c91bf360ce532fc4e178ab0b12383	the broad view of task type using path analysis		Many past research efforts have examined the relationships between observable search behaviors, the task that drives searching, and user characteristics such as search expertise and topic familiarity. These studies often look at pairwise relationships between characteristics to show that task characteristics or user characteristics can be distinguished by differences in browsing behavior. Recent work has moved toward detecting and predicting task from browsing behavior but has not additionally considered user or session characteristics that clearly affect browsing. To what extent should user characteristics and unlogged traits be considered when inferring task type from browsing behavior? This paper examines this complex relationship through the lens of path analysis, showing that such a holistic view should be considered in future task prediction research. Future task prediction work should consider direct links from task to behavior, indirect links through other factors, and other characteristics that affect browsing.	holism;observable;path analysis (statistics);sensor	Matthew Mitsui;Chirag Shah	2018		10.1145/3234944.3234951	structural equation modeling;machine learning;path analysis (statistics);pairwise comparison;observable;computer science;artificial intelligence	Web+IR	-48.759188087111255	-52.98094986841911	52760

Small changes in reach dimensions can have a considerable impact on worker productivity and comfort. Consequently, it is important to correctly determine maximum workspace reach envelopes for the design of an industrial workstation. Maynard (1934) proposed that the objective of the workplace layout should be to minimize the working area so that workers would use shorter motions and expend less effort when carrying out operations. His study recognized the need to reduce fatigue from motions by reducing the size of the work area. However, he did not offer any dimensions for his proposed work areas. The concept of the industrial workspace with its three dimensions clearly defined is attributable to Farley (1955), although his workspace was mathematically generated using only a few body dimensions of the average operator. At an industrial workplace, the maximum occupationally functional reach capability of a worker defines his or her reachable spatial volume or workspace above the work surface and in front of the worker. As people vary in physical size, it is necessary to determine the size and shape of the workspace in order to arrive at specifications for the design of an industrial workstation that can be operated by most (95%) of the industrial population with minimal postural effects. The workspace upon which the workstation design specifications are based should match the reach capability of 95% of the user population. The operator's reach is a function not only of arm length but also of body thickness, torso height, shoulder width, and body movement. Body thickness is an important factor in the measure of reach dimensions. A thin operator can reach farther than a thick operator, assuming both operators are equal in other relevant body dimensions. Thus the correct workspace dimensions for the design of workstations that can actually be operated by 95% of the user population may be obtained from a direct measurement of the maximum functional reach envelope. Direct measures of the maximum functional reach envelope have been given by Kennedy (1964), Chaffee and Emanuel (1964), Faulkner and Day (1970), Roth, Ayoub, and Halcomb (1977), and others. The experiments conducted in research studies thus far (except for the study by Faulkner & Day) for measuring and recording the data of the reach envelope of a participant did not emulate actual industrial work methods. In the study by Faulkner and Day (1970), the reach distances of the operator performing or simulating an industrial task that the operator would normally perform while seated in front of a regular workbench were also not directly measured. The measurements were made while the operator, seated on a rotating chair, grasped reach points on a fixture about 30 cm wide that was on a workbench. The participant's reach angle was adjusted by rotating the chair to the desired angle instead of positioning the fixture at the desired angle on the bench. Further, their study sample consisted of 137 women employees of a specific company (Eastman Kodak). Therefore, a direct measure of the reach envelope of operators from an actual or simulated industrial operation that an operator normally performs while in a seated or standing position in front of a regular workbench has not been determined. Das and Grady (1983a, 1983b) stressed the need to use engineering anthropometry in designing industrial workplace layouts for various percentile groups. Studies by Daniels (1952) and Hertzberg, Daniels, and Churchill (1954) suggested that human body dimensions are not proportional to one another other (low correlations). Therefore, in the spectrum of the reach envelope, an operator's reach distances, which seem to be a function of the body dimensions and their interactions, may not be proportional to one another, either. …		Biman Das;Devendra N.

In this paper, text-level structure of research papers is described with a set of typical functional components of research papers such as, background, purpose, methods, etc. and their order in a text. In order to suggest various applications, the experiments of retrieval and passage extraction were conducted using a manually structure-tagged fulltext database of research papers. As a result, we show that searching full -length texts using text-level structure achieved higher precision, compared to the searching without it. The paper also shows examples of extracted passages and suggests the application of text-level structure for text-based information systems, including passage extraction, browsing, and navigation within/across texts.	experiment;information processing;information system;level structure;text-based (computing)	Noriko Kando	1997			computer science;data science;data mining;information retrieval	NLP	-34.4740435125886	-61.95242367155879	52897

We present an approach to XML query processing that supports the specification of both textual and structural constraints in natural language. We implemented a system that supports the evaluation of both formal XPath-like queries and natural language XML queries. We present comparative test results that were performed with the INEX 2004 topics and XML collection.

69f1faad66fb57bd09b2df7f0d90c735fd10d260	hooked: a game for discovering what makes music catchy		Although there has been some empirical research on earworms, songs that become caught and replayed in one’s memory over and over again, there has been surprisingly little empirical research on the more general concept of the musical hook, the most salient moment in a piece of music, or the even more general concept of what may make music ‘catchy’. Almost by definition, people like catchy music, and thus this question is a natural candidate for approaching with ‘gamification’. We present the design of Hooked, a game we are using to study musical catchiness, as well as the theories underlying its design and the results of a pilot study we undertook to check its scientific validity. We found significant di↵erences in time to recall pieces of music across di↵erent segments, identified parameters for making recall tasks more or less challenging, and found that players are not as reliable as one might expect at predicting their own recall performance.	expect;gamification;hooking;theory	John Ashley Burgoyne;Dimitrios Bountouridis;Jan Van Balen;Henkjan Honing	2013			multimedia;salient;machine learning;empirical research;musical;artificial intelligence;recall;popular music;computer science	HCI	-44.00618150918255	-58.49632572919013	53183

Experiments with a Web directory indicate that the use of links from external pages greatly increases the quality of the results. Gains as high as 45.9 points in F 1  were obtained, when compared to a text-based classifier. Among the similarity measures tested in this work, co-citation presented the best performance in determining if two Web pages are related.

210daa1e7d1d4fd8b3c569d28ee70563b6c84295	avoiding failure for australia's digital health record: the findings from a rural e-health participatory research project		Low adoption and use of Australia's digital health record has driven the Australian Government to trial 'opt-out' registration from mid-June 2016. The assumption that automatic registration will increase use and thereby deliver benefit requires further investigation especially amongst those sections of the population in rural, regional, remote Australia living with complex chronic conditions. This paper reports on findings from a community based participatory e-health research project based on an initiative where people with complex chronic conditions and their carers attended a rural health promotion and lifestyle modification program. Through co-operative enquiry, health promotion officers and their clients were actively supported to adopt and use Australia's digital health record as an intervention. Simultaneously they were encouraged to reflect on its design and their perceptions of its overall impact on their individual ability to self-manage complex chronic conditions. The findings, ultimately contributing to a conceptual implementation and evaluation framework for Australia's digital health record that could directly avoid failure of the new 'opt-out' approach being adopted.	clients;contribution;entity name part qualifier - adopted;health promotion;the australian;health records	Helen Almond;Elizabeth Cummings;Paul Turner	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-666-8-8	community-based participatory research;public relations;knowledge management;rural health;participatory action research;health promotion;digital health;government;health informatics;medicine;nursing;population	HCI	-60.14620133094334	-62.61423337262082	53866

The system responsibilities are to mediate the communication between institutions and forensic doctors and to organize, store and archive tasks and data based on the legal regulations. Currently in Bulgaria and the Balkans there is no fully computerized solution which is the main reason for this paper. The system would allow examiners to focus on the actual medical work and not on the paper work. Key advantages of the system are the automation in the process, the communication with external systems and participants, the dynamic modelling of the processes and the security model that would keep patient privacy and data integrity.	archive;blueprint;data integrity;medical privacy	Borislav Banchev;Tsvetozar Georgiev	2015		10.1145/2812428.2812437	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;process modeling;data mining;database;management;world wide web;computer security;information extraction	Security	-53.691133590925496	-63.464365597212804	53887
70e8b775f191d85b42af6e6c51f61f01f7eb0733	evaluating implicit judgments from image search clickthrough data	web mining;relevance	The interactions of users with search engines can be seen as implicit relevance feedback by the user on the results offered to them. In particular, the selection of results by users can be interpreted as a confirmation of the relevance of those results, and used to reorder or prioritize subsequent search results. This collection of search/result pairings is called clickthrough data, and many uses for it have been proposed. However, the reliability of clickthrough data has been challenged and it has been suggested that clickthrough data are not a completely accurate measure of relevance between search term and results. This paper reports on an experiment evaluating the reliability of clickthrough data as a measure of the mutual relevance of search term and result. The experiment comprised a user study involving over 67 participants and determines the reliability of image search clickthrough data, using factors identified in previous similar studies. A major difference in this work to previous work is that the source of clickthrough data comes from image searches, rather than the traditional text page searches. Image search clickthrough data were rarely examined in prior works but has differences that impact the accuracy of clickthrough data. These differences include a more complete representation of the results in image search, allowing users to scrutinize the results more closely before selecting them, as well as presenting the results in a less obviously ordered way. The experiment reported here demonstrates that image clickthrough data can be more reliable as a relevance feedback measure than has been the case with traditional text-based search. There is also evidence that the precision of the search system influences the accuracy of click data when users make searches in an information-seeking capacity. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	image retrieval	Gavin Smith;Chris J Brien;Helen Ashman	2012	JASIST	10.1002/asi.22742	web mining;relevance;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	ML	-34.618408721673106	-53.84047030241888	53924
f2c8d14228dc57f0606a3131acae48755cd38ad8	clinical assessment of a computer system for insulin dosage adjustment		A computer system has been developed to provide advice on the day-to-day adjustment of carbohydrate intake and insulin regime in the diabetic patient. The prototype is intended to be used as a decision support system by clinical personnel in the context of day-to-day management of insulin-treated diabetic patients. It is designed for use during consultations, as a simulator of patient response following changed insulin and dietary regime and as a system to provide education on planning insulin therapy. Advice is generated by a qualitative knowledge based system which suggests what the next step in improving glycaemic control might be for a given patient, e.g. ‘decrease evening medium-acting insulin’. A clinical model is being developed to allow predictions of the patient’s blood glucose profile to be generated based on these adjustments. Clinical scenarios taken from postgraduate teaching cases have been used to compare the advice given by the computer with that of four independent diabetologists. The results of seven case studies are presented.	linc	Eldon D. Lehmann;Abdul V. Roudsari;Tibor Deutsch;Ewart R. Carson;Jonathan J. Benn;P. H.

The new database delivers significantly smaller scores for all metrics, but the rank correlations across the two databases for the h-index, g-index, AWCR, and e-index are significantly correlated, especially when the time frame is restricted to more recent years. Comparisons are also made to the Article Influence score from eigenfactor.org and to the RePEc h-index, both of which adjust for journal-level self-citations.	citation index;database;google scholar;lock (computer science);microsoft academic search;research papers in economics;roland gs;scopus;software developer	M.

However, due to the poor quality primary research uncertainty surrounding the value of prophylactic physiotherapy intervention in the management of patients following abdominal surgery persists. The Delphi process has been proposed as a pragmatic methodology to guide clinical practice when evidence is equivocal.   METHODS The objective was to develop a clinical management algorithm for the post operative management of abdominal surgery patients. Eleven draft algorithm statements extracted from the extant literature by the primary research team were verified and rated by scientist clinicians (n=5) in an electronic three round Delphi process. Algorithm statements which reached a priori defined consensus-semi-interquartile range (SIQR)<0.5-were collated into the algorithm.   RESULTS The five panelists allocated to the abdominal surgery Delphi panel were from Australia, Canada, Sweden, and South Africa. The 11 draft algorithm statements were edited and 5 additional statements were formulated. The panel reached consensus on the rating of all statements. Four statements were rated essential.   CONCLUSION An expert Delphi panel interpreted the equivocal evidence for the physiotherapeutic management of patients following upper abdominal surgery. Through a process of consensus a clinical management algorithm was formulated. This algorithm can now be used by clinicians to guide clinical practice in this population.	delphi method;embarcadero delphi;extraction;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis;morbidity - disease rate;patients;perioperative care;physical therapy;semi-thue system;semiconductor industry;algorithm;pulmonary complications	Susan D.

There are many types of relevant behavior e.g. time on page, scrolling, clickstream etc. which we will further denote as Relevant Behavior Types (RBT). RBT s varies both in quality and incidence and thus we might need different approaches to process them. In this early work we focus on how to derive user preference from each RBT separately. We selected number of common indicators, design two novel e-commerce specific RBT interpreting methods and conducted series of offline experiments. After the off-line evaluation an A/B test on the real-world users of a travel agency was conducted comparing best off-line method with simple binary feedback. The experiments, although preliminary, showed importance of considering multiple RBTs together.	a/b testing;clickstream;e-commerce;experiment;incidence matrix;online and offline;scrolling	Ladislav Peska;Peter Vojtás	2015			data mining;machine learning;artificial intelligence;scrolling;computer science;clickstream	HCI	-34.6294868723152	-52.43312070174657	54609

This manuscript describes a process for adapting published summary guides from comparative effectiveness research to render them concise, targeted to audience, and easily actionable; and a strategy for disseminating such evidence to patients and their physicians through a web-based portal and linked electronic health record. This project adapted summary guides about oral medications for adults with type 2 diabetes to a fifth-grade literacy level and modified the resulting materials based on evaluations with the Suitability Assessment of Materials instrument. Focus groups and individual interviews with patients, diabetes providers, and health literacy experts were employed to evaluate and enhance the adapted summary guide. We present the lessons learned as general guidelines for the creation of concise, targeted, and actionable evidence and its delivery to both patients and providers through increasingly prevalent health information technologies.

We use a semantic space model called hyperspace analog to language (HAL), based on word co-occurrence, to provide features for webpage classification. Adaptive k-local hyperplane (AKLH), an extension of k nearest neighbour, is then applied to training and testing data. We observe 92% classification accuracy on test cases. This combination of methods appears promising for identifying non-trivial metadata attributes of consumer health webpages, with potential use embedded in a search engine or as a meta-data coding support tool.	embedded system;hal;spaces;test case;web page;web search engine	Guocai Chen;Jim Warren;Tao Yang;Vojislav Kecman	2008	2008 21st IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems	10.1109/CBMS.2008.84	statistical classification;medical imaging;health informatics;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;adaptive system;machine learning;data mining;database;search engine	SE	-43.5731113935495	-68.8521953320261	54731

In most cases, the underlying foundational knowledge is captured in scientific publications that detail specific clinical studies or randomised controlled trials. Over the course of the last two decades, research has been performed on modelling key aspects described within publications (e.g., aims, methods, results), to enable the successful realisation of the goals of EBM. A significant outcome of this research has been the PICO (Population/Problem-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome) structure, and its refined version PIBOSO (Population-Intervention-Background-Outcome-Study Design-Other), both of which provide a formalisation of these scientific artefacts. Subsequently, using these schemes, diverse automatic extraction techniques have been proposed to streamline the knowledge discovery and exploration process in EBM. In this paper, we present a Machine Learning approach that aims to classify sentences according to the PIBOSO scheme. We use a discriminative set of features that do not rely on any external resources to achieve results comparable to the state of the art. A corpus of 1000 structured and unstructured abstracts - i.e., the NICTA-PIBOSO corpus - is used for training and testing. Our best CRF classifier achieves a micro-average F-score of 90.74% and 87.21%, respectively, over structured and unstructured abstracts, which represents an increase of 25.48 percentage points and 26.6 percentage points in F-score when compared to the best existing approaches.	abstract summary;adobe streamline;body of uterus;brill tagger;cluster analysis;conditional random field;decision making;domain-specific language;evidence-based medicine;f1 score;holism;kidney failure, chronic;lung consolidation;machine learning;morphologic artifacts;one thousand;pico;scientific publication;semiconductor consolidation;text corpus;sentence;statistical cluster	Hamed Hassanzadeh;Tudor Groza;Jane Hunter	2014	Journal of biomedical informatics	10.1016/j.jbi.2014.02.006	evidence-based medicine;natural language processing;medicine;pathology;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;database;statistics	NLP	-46.46830381236035	-69.70974220816707	54740
7b67de7fb64c6f294c706dfccfd37c729f214c35	lucid virtual dreaming: antecedents and consequents of virtual lucidity during virtual threat		Here we report the first empirical findings on virtual lucidity (VL), a new construct similar to lucidity during dreaming, but regarding awareness that one is having a virtual experience. VL concerns the depth and breadth of this awareness, as well as the extent it affords regulatory monitoring and control. To study VL, we adapted a measure from lucid dreaming research to assess whether more VL predicted lower fear, but not less enjoyment, during a virtual reality (VR) threat scenario of walking, and being asked to step off, a wooden plank seemingly high above a city. We examined predictors of VL and related outcomes across a community sample and lucid dream trainees at a meditation retreat center. In line with hypotheses, higher VL predicted less fear, more enjoyment, and greater likelihood of stepping off the plank. Moreover, a number of dispositional factors predicted greater VL and lower fear. Lucid dream retreatants, engaged in a contemplative practice called illusory form yoga, experienced more VL and less fear compared to nonretreatants, with marginally higher likelihood of stepping off the plank. Finally, VL mediated all significant relations between predictors and outcomes. Results held controlling for presence or fear of heights. We discuss the potential validity and utility of VL, its relation to presence, and examples of how it may inform the development and application of VR and related technologies.	brain–computer interface;branch predictor;dreams;existential quantification;gene regulatory network;high above;lucid;lucidity;mental state;stepping level;utility;virtual reality;virtual world	Jordan T.

Internet of things (IoT) is one of the last advances in ICT, providing a global connectivity and management of sensors, devices, users and information. Our contribution is a solution to examine drug related problems based on IoT technologies, i.e. smart phones and Web to support ubiquitous Access, 6LoWPAN technology to support ubiquitous data collection of patients, sensors and hospitals, and RFID/NFC to support global identification. These technologies offer a wide range of applications in healthcare, which improves the quality of services, reduce mistakes, and even detect health anomalies from vital signs. This paper presents how IoT technology is applied in a pharmaceutical system to examine drugs in order to detect Adverse Drugs Reaction (ADR), harmful effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, complications and contraindications related with liver and renal defects, and harmful side effects during pregnancy or lactation. Thereby, the system provides an enhanced approach assisting physicians in clinical decisions and drug prescribing. The solution presented is based on NFC (Near Field Communication) and barcode identification technologies, which have been integrated in common devices such as smart-phones, PDAs and PCs. The drug ID is matched with the Pharmaceutical Intelligent Information System to detect whether a specific drug is suitable with respect to the patient's health record or not.	barcode;information system;interaction;internet of things;knowledge-based systems;mobile device;near field communication;ontology (information science);personal digital assistant;radio-frequency identification;sensor;smartphone	Antonio J.

Fifty patients were selected for the study. We found that telemedicine was effective in terms of reducing the number of clinic visits and achieving patient satisfaction. The average number of clinic visits per month was significantly decreased from 0.64 to 0.42 (p < 0.05) after the use of telemedicine. 72% of patients were satisfied with telemedicine, but only patient location showed a significant difference for patient satisfaction (p < 0.05). Patients in their homes (82%) were more satisfied than patients in nursing homes (50%). Of four types of services provided, medical consultation (100%) was the most highly satisfactory service with telemedicine, followed by physical therapy (83.3%). Although the satisfaction scores did not indicate a significant difference in the system characteristics, the quality of verbal communication appeared to be a more important factor in influencing patient satisfaction than set-up time or quality of image. A computer-based patient record was also developed to view a patient summary and to document encounters at the patient's home. Since the system is a low-cost approach that is easy to interface with a notebook computer, it can support various other HHSs.	breast feeding;health services;home care services;home health care specialty;interface device component;laptop;medical records;patient visit;patients;telemedicine;uptime	Young Moon Chae;Joo Heon Lee;Seung Hee Ho;Hee Ja Kim;Ki Hong Jun;Jong Uk Won	2001	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/S1386-5056(01)00139-3	medicine;computer science;nursing;pediatrics;efficiency;implementation;management;medical record	HCI	-59.59481365272846	-65.53470368440819	54968

This paper presents an attempt to apply the same model to the case of judgment on an objective scale. This is a big challenge since the behavioral data are showing the opposite type of effects. Thus we have repeatedly obtained contrast effects of irrelevant information, when judging on a subjective scale. In the experiment described here we obtained an assimilation effect in exactly the same conditions except that the scale was objective. Without any changes of the model we run the corresponding simulations and there are a good and bad news. The bad news is that we did not obtain the assimilation effect, but the good news is that the contrast effect disappeared. The paper discusses possible reasons for these results and possible ways to improve the model.	computation;computational model;data assimilation;relevance;simulation	Penka Hristova;Georgi Petkov;Boicho N.

2cc6b8f35d73daf5f5469d5669405fcf928c67cf	developing a taxonomy of communication errors in heterogeneous information systems.	heterogeneous information	BACKGROUND Although established communication standards do exist in the health care domain (i.e., DICOM and HL7) the communication within heterogeneous information systems still shows a variety of errors. The complexity of these systems aggravates the identification of error reasons. A structured summary of communication errors and their reasons is essential for developing methods that support the error detection.   METHODS In order to summarize communication errors, a systematic literature review in PubMed was conducted. Selected references were filtered iteratively and analyzed by applying subsuming qualitative content analysis.   RESULTS The taxonomy currently contains 12 different problem classes that group 42 problems, with in total 130 reasons.   DISCUSSION Although, not all selected literature references are yet analyzed, we observe a saturation concerning new errors/error classes. In order to increase validity and completeness expert interviews are in planning stage. However, the first results are promising.

a531a3bf2b6f2a112e32277c0bae770131f6d52f	visualizing the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (promis) measures for clinicians and patients.		Congruent with the nationwide movement toward patient-centered healthcare, an increasing number of organizations collect and assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The standardized NIH PROMIS measures represent one of the most widely used PRO questionnaires, but organizations still face challenges with conveying PROMIS outcomes to clinicians in clinically relevant ways. Our proposed solution, the ProVis application, uses visualizations to engage heart failure patients with PROMIS questionnaires in the waiting room, and conveys PROMIS data to clinicians through longitudinal visualizations in iNYP, our institution's electronic health record (EHR) interface. Here, we discuss the design and development of ProVis, the alternative strategies we considered, the strengths and weaknesses of ProVis, and our future dissemination and evaluation plans.		Lisa V.

Any attempt of developing a web-based expert system dealing with human disease diagnosis has to overcome various difficulties. This paper describes a project work aiming to develop a web-based fuzzy expert system for diagnosing human diseases. Now a days fuzzy systems are being used successfully in an increasing number of application areas; they use linguistic rules to describe systems. This research project focuses on the research and development of a web-based clinical tool designed to improve the quality of the exchange of health information between health care professionals and patients. Practitioners can also use this web-based tool to corroborate diagnosis. The proposed system is experimented on various scenarios in order to evaluate it’s performance.

Determining the content of a string involves identifying its meaningful constituents (morphemes). One current method of identifying these constituents is to look them up in a preexisting table (lexicon). Manual construction of lexicons and grammars in complex domains such as biomedicine is extremely laborious. As an alternative to the lexico-grammatical approach, we introduce a segmentation algorithm that automatically learns lexical and structural preferences from corpora via information compression. The method is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle from classic information theory.	algorithm;biomedicine;code;compression;informatics (discipline);information theory;lexico;lexicon;machine learning;mathematical morphology;minimum description length;natural language;string (computer science);text corpus;biologic segmentation	Shamim Mollah;Stephen B.

NTTs and STTs can be used in conjunction with topical terms (TTs) to improve precision in retrieval results. In Phase I, 20 topical queries in two domains (Health and the Social Sciences) were carried out in Google and from the results of the queries, 800 pages were textually analysed. Of 1442 NTTs and STTs identified, 15% were shared between the two domains; 62% were NTTs and 38% were STTs; and approximately 64% occurred before while 36% occurred after their respective topical terms (TTs). Findings of Phase II showed that query expansion through NTTs (or STTs) particularly in the ‘exact title’ and URL search options resulted in more precise and manageable results. Statistically significant differences were found between Health and the Social Sciences vis-à-vis keyword and ‘exact phrase’ search results; however there were no significant differences in exact title and URL search results. The ratio of exact phrase, exact title, and URL search result frequencies to keyword search result frequencies also showed statistically significant differences between the two domains. Our findings suggest that web searching could be greatly enhanced combining NTTs (and STTs) with TTs in an initial query. Additionally, search results would improve if queries are restricted to the exact title or URL search options. Finally, we suggest the development and implementation of knowledge-based lists of NTTs (and STTs) by both general and specialized search engines to aid query expansion. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

f27b2b604f1593dce90bd4652305e9fa381b0c61	improving the visibility of library resources via mapping library subject headings to wikipedia articles		PurposernrnrnrnrnLinking libraries and Wikipedia can significantly improve the quality of services provided by these two major silos of knowledge. Such linkage would enrich the quality of Wikipedia articles and at the same time increase the visibility of library resources. To this end, the purpose of this paper is to describe the design and development of a software system for automatic mapping of FAST subject headings, used to index library materials, to their corresponding articles in Wikipedia.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThe proposed system works by first detecting all the candidate Wikipedia concepts (articles) occurring in the titles of the books and other library materials which are indexed with a given FAST subject heading. This is then followed by training and deploying a machine learning (ML) algorithm designed to automatically identify those concepts that correspond to the FAST heading. In specific, the ML algorithm used is a binary classifier which classifies the candidate concepts into either “corresponding” or “non-corresponding” categories. The classifier is trained to learn the characteristics of those candidates which have the highest probability of belonging to the “corresponding” category based on a set of 14 positional, statistical, and semantic features.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe authors have assessed the performance of the developed system using standard information retrieval measures of precision, recall, and F-score on a data set containing 170 FAST subject headings manually mapped to their corresponding Wikipedia articles. The evaluation results show that the developed system is capable of achieving F-scores as high as 0.65 and 0.99 in the corresponding and non-corresponding categories, respectively.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe size of the data set used to evaluate the performance of the system is rather small. However, the authors believe that the developed data set is large enough to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed approach.rnrnrnrnrnPractical implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe sheer size of English Wikipedia makes the manual mapping of Wikipedia articles to library subject headings a very labor-intensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, the aim is to reduce the cost of such mapping and integration.rnrnrnrnrnSocial implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe proposed mapping paves the way for connecting libraries and Wikipedia as two major silos of knowledge, and enables the bi-directional movement of users between the two.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current work is the first attempt at automatic mapping of Wikipedia to a library-controlled vocabulary.	wikipedia	Arash Joorabchi;Abdulhussain E.

0e07c9a8b85893755ef9693b39cc0ecb09d96a49	nlp for indexing and retrieval of captioned photographs	indexation;natural language processing;image retrieval	We present a text-based approach for the automatic indexing and retrieval of digital photographs taken at crime scenes. Our research prototype, SOCIS, goes beyond keyword-based approaches and methods that extract syntactic relations from captions; it relies on advanced Natural Language Processing techniques in order to extract relational facts. These relational facts consist of a “pragmatic relation” and the entities this relation connects (triples of the form: ARG1RELARG2). In SOCIS, the triples are used as complex image indexing terms; however, the extraction mechanism is used not only for indexing purposes but also for image retrieval using free text queries. The retrieval mechanism computes similarity scores between querytriples and indexing-triples making use of a domain-specific ontology. 1 Indexing and Retrieval of Photographs The normal practice in human indexing or cataloguing of photographs is to use a text-based representation of the pictorial record having recourse to a controlled vocabulary or to “free-text”. On the one hand, an index using authoritative sources (e.g., thesauri) ensures consistency across human indexers, but at the same time it renders the indexing task difficult due to the size of the keyword list that is used not to mention the cumbersome and unintuitive requirement imposed to the user, to become familiar with using specific wording for the subsequent retrieval of the images. On the other hand, the use of free-text association, while natural, makes the index representation subjective and error prone. Content-based Image Processing methods are used as an alternative to the manual-annotation bottleneck (Veltkamp and Tanase, 2000). Contentbased indexing and retrieval of images is based on features such as colour, texture, and shape. However, image understanding is not well advanced yet and it is very to rely upon its techniques even for the needs of a specific domain. When linguistic descriptions of the photographs are available (i.e., captions or collateral texts), they can be used as the starting point for indexing. We have focused on the development and implementation of automatic caption-based techniques for indexing and retrieval of photographs taken at scenes of crime (SOC). Researchers in information retrieval argue that detailed linguistic analysis is usually unnecessary to improve accuracy for text indexing and retrieval; however, in the case of captioned photographs, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proved to be particularly effective for the very same tasks (Rose et al., 2000; Guglielmo and Rowe, 1996). Current approaches in automatic text-based imge indexing fail in capturing semantic information expressed in the captions, which is important for the subsequent retrieval of the images (Pastra et al., 2002). Unlike traditional “bag of words” Pastra et al. (2003) – In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computational Linguistics – pp. 143-146 techniques and other methods for extracting syntactic relations from captions for indexing purposes, our prototype extracts meaning representations that capture pragmatic relations between objects depicted in the photographs. Therefore, most of the complexity of the written text is eliminated, while its meaning is retained in a simple way. The relational facts that are extracted are of the form: ARG1-RELATION-ARG2 and they are used as indexing terms for the crime scene visual records. In these triples, the arguments may be simple or complex noun phrases, whereas the relations express locative arrangements, part-of associations and other relations, all coming up to 17 different relations as indicated through the analysis of a corpus of 1000 captions. The notion of extracting structres that capture semantic relations among entities originates from early theories on text representation. Our approach bears a loose connection to the “Preference Semantics” theory (Wilks, 1975; Wilks, 1978); however, in the latter, the RELATIONs captured in semantic templates were a mixture of CASE and ACT denoting relations, whereas SOCIS focuses on “static”, pragmatic relations between tangible objects. The binary relational templates extracted by SOCIS allow for the indexing terms to capture semantic equivalences and differences that go beyond syntactic dependencies, bindings to specific wording or implied information such as the absence/presence of objects : “red substance on yellow table” vs. “yellow substance on red table”, “knife on table” vs. “blade on bar counter”, and “cable around neck” vs. “neck with cable removed” respectively. SOCIS consists of a pipeline of processing resources that perform the following tasks: (i) pre-processing (e.g., tokenisation, POS tagging, named entity recognition and classification, etc.); (ii) parsing and naive semantic interpretation; (iii) inference; (iv) triple extraction. The rest of this paper describes our method for indexing and retrieval using relational facts. 2 Ontology and Indexing Terms We have made use of the British Police Information Technology Organisation Common Data Model and a collection of formal reports produced by scene of crime officers (SOCO) to develop OntoCrime, a concept hierarchy that structures concepts relevant to SOC investigation (e.g., physical evidence, trace evidence, weapon, cutting instrument, criminal event etc.). The ontology is used during indexing-term computations. Two types of indexing terms are obtained for each caption: (i) “lexical” terms, which are canonical representations of objects mentioned in the caption; and (ii) triples of the form(Argument 1, Relation, Argument 2), where Relation is the name of the relation and Argumenti are its arguments. The arguments have the form Class : String, whereClass is the immediate hypernym the entity belongs to (according to OntoCrime), andString is of the form(Adj|Qual) ∗ Head, whereHead is the head of the noun phase and Adj andQual are adjectives and nominal qualifiers syntactically attached to the head. For example, the noun phrase “the left rear bedroom” is represented as (premises : left rear bedroom) and the full caption “neck with cable removed” is represented as (body part : neck, WITHOUT, physical	bag-of-words model;cognitive dimensions of notations;computation;computational linguistics;computer vision;controlled vocabulary;data model;domain-specific language;image processing;image retrieval;information retrieval;list of java keywords;location-based game;named entity;named-entity recognition;natural language processing;parsing;part-of-speech tagging;preprocessor;prototype;rendering (computer graphics);semantic interpretation;statistical classification;text corpus;text-based (computing);theory;thesaurus;word lists by frequency	Horacio Saggion;Katerina Pastra;Yorick Wilks	2003			natural language processing;visual word;image retrieval;computer science;data mining;information retrieval	NLP	-38.44112404072453	-71.0183930686665	56303

However, existing care administration systems do not offer sufficient support for collaboration and coordination among a heterogeneous ensemble of care providers. In this paper, we present findings from a field study of coordinative work in distributed elder care in Denmark. The purpose of this study is to further our understanding of the coordinative challenges of distributed elder care, and to inform design of new care administration systems. Overall, we found that caregivers at the care center fulfill a crucial role in prioritizing the scheduled activities in cases where opposed interests occur, which indicates a need for a care administration system, that not only supports the meticulous planning of activities, that are needed by the healthcare system, but also the work involved in balancing priorities.	field research;requirement;system administrator	Troels Mønsted;Andreas Kaas Johansen;Frederik Vahr Bjarnø Lauridsen;Vlad Manea;Konstantin Slavin-Borovskij	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.124	interview;schedule;knowledge management;management;health care;collaboration	HCI	-59.73522041327854	-61.182093442006845	56341

Results show that RF has effects on hedonic GS, and heuristic IP and systematic IP. Hedonic GS positively predicts equally both heuristic processing and systematic processing. Both heuristic processing and systematic processing predict selection style. Although selection style does not affect download app type diversity, impulsive style consumers are more likely to download the app. The study also shows college consumers in general have high likelihood in downloading an app after they considered it. Hedonic GS mediates the relation between RF and both heuristic processing and systematic processing. Systematic processing mediates hedonic GS and selection style. Hence mobile app download decision involves both heuristic and systematic processing.

1d2a4ba7be0a2b7083971f3a8bd84527681c4ef2	towards an ontology-driven clinical experience sharing ecosystem: demonstration with liver cases		Abstract Past medical cases, hence clinical experience, are invaluable resources in supporting clinical practice, research, and education. Medical professionals need to be able to exchange information about patient cases and explore them from subjective perspectives. This requires a systematic and flexible methodology to case representation for supporting the exchange of processable patient information. We present an ontology based approach to modeling patient cases and use patients with liver disease conditions as an example. To this end a novel ontology, l i co , that utilizes well known medical standards is proposed to represent liver patient cases. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated with semantic queries and reasoning using data collected from real patients. The preliminary results are promising in regards to the potentials of ontology based medical case representation for building case-based search and retrieval systems, paving the way towards a Clinical Experience Sharing platform for comparative diagnosis, research, and education.	ecosystem	María del Mar Roldán García;Suzan Uskudarli;Neda Barzegar Marvasti;Burak Açar;José Francisco Aldana Montes	2018	Expert Syst.

9c343aa9e412bb975d4727da4e0e8c8cc5cc8665	weird: an approach to concept-based information retrieval	information retrieval	WEIRD is an automatic document retrieval system designed and implemented at Syracuse University, which attempts to advance the art of computerized retrieval from word-matching to judging conceptual similarity. WEIRD uses a vector space model to represent the relations among terms and documents. Items in the space are located according to their -&-ldquo;meaning-&-rdquo;, which is their proximity to all other items in the data base as measured by co-occurrence frequencies. This is done without manipulating large matrices. The dimensions of the space are not used to define relations; items are defined solely by their position relative to the other items. Retrieval is determined by Euclidean distance from the plotted query. In the first section of the paper the basic characteristics of WEIRD are described. Second, the results of a preliminary evaluation are reported. Alternatives for further development of WEIRD are then considered.	database;document retrieval;euclidean distance;information retrieval	Matthew B.

Due to a large amount of data that exists in digital library systems, including text and multimedia resources, with different cohorts of users, and the challenges with existing digital library systems in terms of maintaining privacy and confidentiality, it is very difficult to provide personalised library services and improved user experience. However, novel data mining algorithms based on automatic user segmentation and borrowing behaviour modelling can leverage the relationship between users and borrowing records, to improve the library services. In this paper, we present an automatic approach for personalising the resources by segmenting the users and their preferences, based on a data mining strategy, involving, the classification based on Na&#xef;ve Bayes, J48 and K-Nearest Neighbours Classification (K-NN) and using open source technology tools for evaluating the personalisation and improved user experience with digital library services.	confidentiality;data mining;digital library;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;library (computing);open-source software;personalization;testbed;user experience	Maram Abdulrahman Almaghrabi;Girija Chetty	2017	2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on e-Science (e-Science)	10.1109/eScience.2017.58	information system;data mining;personalization;market segmentation;c4.5 algorithm;digital library;user experience design;computer science;data modeling;testbed	HPC	-44.28797834252559	-65.04969294386972	56553
ccc4151e36e8c784239a825d054de27dd19f7419	design and implementation of a standardized framework to generate and evaluate patient-level prediction models using observational healthcare data		"""Objective To develop a conceptual prediction model framework containing standardized steps and describe the corresponding open-source software developed to consistently implement the framework across computational environments and observational healthcare databases to enable model sharing and reproducibility.   Methods Based on existing best practices we propose a 5 step standardized framework for: (1) transparently defining the problem; (2) selecting suitable datasets; (3) constructing variables from the observational data; (4) learning the predictive model; and (5) validating the model performance. We implemented this framework as open-source software utilizing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to enable convenient sharing of models and reproduction of model evaluation across multiple observational datasets. The software implementation contains default covariates and classifiers but the framework enables customization and extension.   Results As a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the transparency and ease of model dissemination using the software, we developed prediction models for 21 different outcomes within a target population of people suffering from depression across 4 observational databases. All 84 models are available in an accessible online repository to be implemented by anyone with access to an observational database in the Common Data Model format.   Conclusions The proof-of-concept study illustrates the framework's ability to develop reproducible models that can be readily shared and offers the potential to perform extensive external validation of models, and improve their likelihood of clinical uptake. In future work the framework will be applied to perform an """"all-by-all"""" prediction analysis to assess the observational data prediction domain across numerous target populations, outcomes and time, and risk settings."""	addresses (publication format);best practice;computation;conceptual schema;condylion mediale;data model;databases;default;depressive disorder;journal of the american medical informatics association;open-source software;paper;patients;population;predictive modelling;published database;research grants	Jenna M.

Technological developments may provide adequate solutions to support care provision. The principles of user centred design and development, traditionally used in the development of assistive technology, may provide powerful tools to support care provision. Interdisciplinary research will be needed to take full benefit. Educational programs to support this development are lacking. Main content of this paper: Six organisations of higher education have taken the initiative to organize a training program to support professionals active in the care or in the technology domain that enables them to become involved in interdisciplinary research and development.   RESULTS a European program to educate a professional master in Care and Technology has been developed and is described in this paper. Accreditation of the program is initiated.   CONCLUSION Alumni of such a program may form a European network of professionals that are active in developing new solutions to support people with special needs and contribute to the generation of new business.

Social support is a crucial factor for achieving adaptive self-help life skills. In this paper we describe the results of a formative design exercise with young adults with autism and their caregivers to uncover opportunities for social networks to promote independence and facilitate coordination. We propose the concept of SocialMirror, a device connected to an online social network that allows the young adult to seek advice from a trusted and responsive network of family, friends and professionals. Focus group discussions reveal the potential for SocialMirror to increase motivation to learn everyday life skills among young adults with autism and to foster collaboration among a distributed care network. We present design considerations to leverage a small trusted network that balances quick response with safeguards for privacy and security of young adults with autism.	focus group;social network;social support	Hwajung Hong;Jennifer G.

We have enhanced our interactive bibliometric explorer ( iBEX) to visualise the distribution of phrases over such bibliometric maps. Assuming that generic (non-content-bearing) phrases occur in most of the papers in the map, those phrases confined to a specific part of the map will probably be more content-bearing than those distributed all over the map. Such knowledge can eventually be used to evaluate a selection of words and phrases.	bibliometrics;color;map	R. K. Buter;Ed C. M.

However, this “rigid” framework has several disadvantages when used in natural language processing, especially for non-alphabetical languages. The solution is to systematically introduce polymorphic programming techniques that are adapted to particular cases. In this paper we describe the structure of a morphological dictionary implemented with finite-state automata using variable or polymorphic node formats. Each node is assigned a format from a predefined set reflecting its utility in corpora processing as measured by a number of graph theoretic metrics and statistics. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach permits a 52% increase in the performance of dictionary look-up.	automata theory;data dictionary;finite-state machine;graph theory;linear search;lookup table;morphological dictionary;natural language processing;text corpus	Alexander Troussov;Brian O'Donovan;Seppo Koskenniemi;Nikolay Glushnev	2003		10.1007/3-540-36456-0_22	linear search;natural language processing;polymorphism;search engine indexing;computer science;artificial intelligence;finite-state machine;natural language;programming language;algorithm	NLP	-35.65708848028333	-64.10027028341968	56947
bb3184c92fee1f8cfe7d3e281c79cf489790fa9a	selection of online databases using switching vocabularies		Currently, hundreds of bibliographic online databases are available for searching. The novice user of an online information retrieval system must first determine which of these databases is appropriate for the information being sought. There are several directories which contain brief descriptions of the contents of various databases which may be useful for an initial determination of the major databases in the subject area of interest. One can then examine more detailed descriptions of the contents, years of coverage, and the structure of individual databases. Once the major databases have been identified, the user must then determine which of these databases contain the appropriate search terms for the information sought. The user can consult various thesauri and lists of subject headings, published by some of the database producers. For example, only approximately one third of the databases available on DIALOG have published thesauri and only about one dozen have online thesauri [ 11. However, each database has its own vocabulary and there is very little compatibility among these vocabularies even in similar subjects [2]. For example, the following terms were used by different vocabularies to denote the same concept: activation analysis, radiochemical analysis, radiometric analysis, chemical analysis by nuclear reactions, and scatter. Database vendors have provided the users with search terms postings through the use of online indexes. However, none of these tools provides information to the user concerning the relationships among the search terms or the equivalent terms. Another alternative for the user is to use free-text terms to search the database. However, many novice users do not realize that the free-text search only retrieves those references which contain exact match of the search terms. The user must think of all the synonyms and equivalent terms that might be used to designate the search terms. This is difficult for novice users, especially if they are not familiar with the terminology and there are no thesauri for that database. The number of databases which are produced without the use of thesauri or controlled vocabularies, seems to be increasing because it is less expensive to produce a free-text database than one using controlled vocabularies. However, the retrieval of information from these free-text databases will be more difficult, time consuming, and expensive for the user in the long run. Switching languages have the potential for resolving some of the problems caused by the lack of compatibility among the terminology used to designate a concept. A switching language could be used as an interface to transform a user’s search terms into the appropriate search terms of the vocabularies or databases to be used. The use of one experimental switching language for identifying the appropriate search terms of various vocabularies and the use of this information to determine the appropriate databases has been investigated [ 11. This switching language was the Vocabulary Switching System (VSS) developed by Battelle Institute [3]. VSS is an integrated vocabulary of twelve existing vocabularies. It can be considered a thesaurus of thesauri. The entire vocabularies for all the databases were merged and the linguistic or thesaural relationships existing in each thesaurus were preserved. A thesaural relationship model was developed to measure the degree of compatibility and switching capability of thesauri or vocabularies. This model, designated as the Compatibility and Switching Values (CSV), was tested using a variety of search terms. Groups of terms were matched with VSS to determine whether compatible and switching terms could be found in the different vocabularies. The CSV for each vocabulary was then calculated using the sum of the weighted values for each of the thesaural relationships identified as compatibility, hierarchical, or associative relationships. The VSS vocabularies were then ranked on the basis of their CSV for each group of terms. The following example illustrates the use of the switching vocabulary and the determination of the Compatibility and Switching Values (CSV) for six of the VSS vocabularies: CA, Chemical Abstracts Concept Edit File used for the CA Search online database; DOE, Department of Energy	computerized system validation;controlled vocabulary;database;information retrieval;thesaurus (information retrieval);dialog	Alice Y.

The corresponding meaningful use criteria proposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates use of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. Yet, adoption in the US and other Western countries is low and descriptions of successful implementations are primarily from the inpatient setting; less frequently the ambulatory setting. We describe prescriber and staff perceptions of implementation of a CPOE system for medications (electronic- or e-prescribing system) in the ambulatory setting.   METHODS Using a cross-sectional study design, we conducted eight focus groups at three primary care sites in an independent medical group. Each site represented a unique stage of e-prescribing implementation - pre/transition/post. We used a theoretically based, semi-structured questionnaire to elicit physician (n = 17) and staff (n = 53) perceptions of implementation of the e-prescribing system. We conducted a thematic analysis of focus group discussions using formal qualitative analytic techniques (i.e. deductive framework and grounded theory). Two coders independently coded to theoretical saturation and resolved discrepancies through discussions.   RESULTS Ten themes emerged that describe perceptions of e-prescribing implementation: 1) improved availability of clinical information resulted in prescribing efficiencies and more coordinated care; 2) improved documentation resulted in safer care; 3) efficiencies were gained by using fewer paper charts; 4) organizational support facilitated adoption; 5) transition required time; resulted in workload shift to staff; 6) hardware configurations and network stability were important in facilitating workflow; 7) e-prescribing was time-neutral or time-saving; 8) changes in patient interactions enhanced patient care but required education; 9) pharmacy communications were enhanced but required education; 10) positive attitudes facilitated adoption.   CONCLUSIONS Prescribers and staff worked through the transition to successfully adopt e-prescribing, and noted the benefits. Overall impressions were favorable. No one wished to return to paper-based prescribing.	attitude;chart;computerized physician order entry system;cross-sectional data;description;documentation;efficiency;electronic health records;electronic prescribing;emoticon;focus group;gain;interaction;medical records systems, computerized;medicare;order management system;patients;primary health care;semiconductor industry;benefit;impression (attitude)	Emily Beth Devine;Emily C.

This data could support personalized medicine; however, there are pitfalls that must be avoided. We discuss an example, longitudinal medical tracking, in which traditional methods of evaluating machine learning algorithms fail and present the opportunity for false conclusions.

Twenty people explored a virtual environment (VE) that depicted a virtual bar scenario. The experiment was divided into a training and an experimental phase. During the experimental phase breaks in presence (BIPs) in the form of whiteouts of the VE scenario were induced for 2 s at four equally spaced times during the approximately 5 min in the bar scenario. Additionally, five virtual characters addressed remarks to the subjects. Physiological measures including electrocardiagram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) were recorded throughout the whole experiment. The heart rate, the heart rate variability, and the event-related heart rate changes were calculated from the acquired ECG data. The frequency response of the GSR signal was calculated with a wavelet analysis. The study shows that the heart rate and heart rate variability parameters vary significantly between the training and experimental phase. GSR parameters and event-related heart rate changes show the occurrence of breaks in presence. Event-related heart rate changes also signified the virtual character utterances. There were also differences in response between participants who report more or less socially anxious.	emergentism;frequency response;galvanic isolation;graphics;heart rate variability;interaction;linear programming;multistage interconnection networks;programming paradigm;social engineering (security);virtual reality;wavelet	Mel Slater;Christoph Guger;Günter Edlinger;Robert Leeb;Gert Pfurtscheller;Angus Antley;Maia Garau;Andrea Brogni;Doron Friedman	2006	PRESENCE: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments	10.1162/pres.15.5.553	wavelet;frequency response;heart rate variability;simulation;computer science;virtual machine;skin conductance;operating system;space time	HCI	-49.599542190474274	-52.300004192001666	57331

The ability for a system to detect the presence of safety and efficacy (S&E) concerns early on could not only protect consumers from injuries due to safety hazards, but could also mitigate financial damage to the manufacturer. Prior studies in the field of automated defect discovery have found industry-specific techniques appropriate to the automotive, consumer electronics, home appliance, and toy industries, but have not investigated pain relief medicines and medical devices. In this study, we focus specifically on automated discovery of S&E concerns in over-the-counter (OTC) joint and muscle pain relief remedies and devices.   METHODS We select a dataset of over 32,000 records for three categories of Joint & Muscle Pain Relief treatments from Amazon's online product reviews, and train """"smoke word"""" dictionaries which we use to score holdout reviews, for the presence of safety and efficacy issues. We also score using conventional sentiment analysis techniques.   RESULTS Compared to traditional sentiment analysis techniques, we found that smoke term dictionaries were better suited to detect product concerns from online consumer reviews, and significantly outperformed the sentiment analysis techniques in uncovering both efficacy and safety concerns, across all product subcategories.   CONCLUSION Our research can be applied to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry in order to detect safety and efficacy concerns, reducing risks that consumers face using these products. These findings can be highly beneficial to improving quality assurance and management in joint and muscle pain relief."""	amazona;angular defect;aspartate transaminase;atrial septal defects;automotive occupations;categories;cessation of life;color vision defect;conditional (computer programming);consultation;cumulative trauma disorders;dictionaries as topic;dictionary;dosage forms;drug industry;drugs, non-prescription;durability (database systems);exhibits as topic;experience;fault (technology);feces;hazard (computer architecture);hip pain;information needs;internal medicine specialty;liver damage;losing weight (question);mental suffering;money;multiple of the median;my vision;myalgia;off topic;over-the-counter (finance);pain relief;pharmacovigilance;positive feedback;remote manipulator;review [publication type];safety engineering;sentiment analysis;shoutbox;silo (dataset);smell perception;social media;social capital;software bug;software defect indicator;specification;tracer;type safety;ventricular septal defects;wrist pain;buying;methylsulfonylmethane	David Z.

Moreover, few examples of the formative process used to develop and evaluate evidence-based health videogame interventions exist in the scientific literature. The following paper provides valuable insight into the lessons learned during the process of developing the risk reduction and HIV prevention videogame intervention for young adolescents, PlayForward: Elm City Stories.

Despite the increasing use of information and communication technologies, social isolation remains an issue amongst older people. Assistive technologies address important health needs, but there is a lack of social technologies that adequately deal with social isolation. This paper contributes to knowledge about the everyday life of older people for the purpose of designing appropriate social technology. We present an overview of the findings of a three-stage study---an expert survey, a field study and a design workshop---and describe a set of needs to inform the design of technology for ameliorating the social isolation of older people.	assistive technology;baseline (configuration management);field research	Sonja Pedell;Frank Vetere;Lars Kulik;Elizabeth Ozanne;Alan Gruner	2010		10.1145/1952222.1952255	information and communications technology;field research	HCI	-61.88382575436091	-53.429596058277596	57483

Not only does this lead to unnecessary suffering for the patients but also incurs a great financial cost to the society. A medicine decision support system in a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), with a barcode reader, can provide an overview of the patients' complete medicine use, and detect unsuitable drugs and drug combinations. Focusing on the elderly, our aim was to evaluate if a mobile medicine decision support system with a barcode reader is useful and user-friendly for nurses in home care. The participants received a comprehensive overview from the patients' medicine use and noted drug-drug interactions, therapeutic duplications and warnings for drugs unsuitable for elderly people. The nurses regarded that the decision support system increased prevention and safety, was useful and user-friendly. Our findings suggest that most of the content and functions were regarded as important. Therefore, this decision support system might be a useful tool for district nurses.		Pauline E.

Forty-eight participants took part in a series of twelve tasks with a dialogue system presented either in the written or the spoken mode during the first six dialogues. The next six dialogues were then presented either in the same interaction mode or in another mode. The analysis of the results showed a changing of interaction mode reduced efficiency. Moreover, beginning by oral mode had a positive effect on the next interactions with both oral and written modes.

(linguistic temporality: defining the contours of an object of analysis and the purposes of such an analysis)		What is at issue when one addresses the question of temporality in texts? In the computational linguistics paradigm, temporality appears to be always related to certain specific purposes, whereas in the linguistics paradigm temporality is usually defined as an analytical object. It seemed extremely fruitful to us in this exploratory study of the field to attempt to combine these two approaches in order to achieve an operational description of the concept. Investigating temporality via the categories of Tense, Aspect and Modality on the one hand, and the Enunciative Dimension on the other, is a ‘classical’ approach, in particular within enunciative linguistics. Studies are confined however to the sentence level, and describing the modus operandi these four analytical dimensions on the textual level still remains to be accomplished. This is the research avenue we explore here. Our aim is to clarify the principle of a certain dynamics at work in temporal reference in texts. We here present an initial modeling of this dynamics in which we distinguish different levels of temporal reference and possible navigational paths between them. A longer-term challenge, both theoretical and applied, of this research is to posit that an essential part of the modeling process is to characterize the needs of the end-users. We currently envisage this via the development of interactive tools to enable different forms of ‘temporal readings’ of a text.

Traditional criteria for evaluating CCBR performance by precisionand efficiencyprovide useful information, but are limited by their focus on the single point at which a case is selected at the end of the system dialogue, and by their dependence on a model of the user’s case selection criteria. This paper begins by revisiting issues in the evaluation of CCBR systems, arguing for the value of assessing the quality of the intermediate dialogue before case selection. It then proposes an evaluation approach based on rank qualityto provide a fuller picture of system performance, and illustrates with an empirical study the use of rank quality to illuminate characteristics of similarity assessment strategies for partially-specified cases.	association rule learning;case-based reasoning;common criteria;computer user satisfaction;software quality assurance;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Steven Bogaerts;David B.

An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information.   METHODS The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects' conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was tested on simulated EHR databases generated from microbiology laboratory data.   RESULTS A requirements list that a syndromic and disease surveillance system should meet, and an open source system, """"The Snow Agent system"""", has been developed. The Snow Agent system is a distributed system for monitoring the status of a population's health by distributing processes to, and extracting epidemiological data directly from, the electronic health records (EHR) system in a geographic area.   CONCLUSIONS Syndromic and disease surveillance tools should be able to operate at all levels in the health systems and across national borders. Such systems should avoid transferring patient identifiable data, support two-way communications and be able to define and incorporate new and unknown diseases and syndrome definitions that should be reported by the system. The initial tests of the Snow Agent system shows that it will easily scale to national level in Norway."""	centralisation;communicable diseases;distributed computing;electronic health records;epidemiology;open-source software;paget's disease, mammary;patients;programming paradigm;published database;requirement;software propagation;software testing;specification	Johan Gustav Bellika;Toralf Hasvold;Gunnar Hartvigsen	2007	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2006.02.007	simulation;epidemiology;medicine;pathology;computer science;data mining	SE	-54.547526659139756	-65.16326548736873	58343

The ubiquity of this activity has naturally affected many information systems; the only goal of some is the presentation of textual information. One concrete task often performed on a computer and involving reading is finding relevant parts of text. In the current study, we investigated if word-level relevance, defined as a binary measure of an individual word being congruent with the reader's current informational needs, could be inferred given only the text and eye movements of readers. We found that the number of fixations, first-pass fixations, and the total viewing time can be used to predict the relevance of sentence-terminal words. In light of what is known about eye movements of readers, knowing which sentence-terminal words are relevant can help in an unobtrusive identification of relevant sentences.	information system;relevance	Tomasz D.

Social media offers opportunities for people to share opinions and experiences freely in online communities, which may contribute information beyond the knowledge of domain professionals. This paper describes the development of a novel semantic web platform called PREDOSE (PREscription Drug abuse Online Surveillance and Epidemiology), which is designed to facilitate the epidemiologic study of prescription (and related) drug abuse practices using social media. PREDOSE uses web forum posts and domain knowledge, modeled in a manually created Drug Abuse Ontology (DAO--pronounced dow), to facilitate the extraction of semantic information from User Generated Content (UGC), through combination of lexical, pattern-based and semantics-based techniques. In a previous study, PREDOSE was used to obtain the datasets from which new knowledge in drug abuse research was derived. Here, we report on various platform enhancements, including an updated DAO, new components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content analysis, trend detection and emerging patterns exploration, which enhance the capabilities of the PREDOSE platform. Given these enhancements, PREDOSE is now more equipped to impact drug abuse research by alleviating traditional labor-intensive content analysis tasks.   METHODS Using custom web crawlers that scrape UGC from publicly available web forums, PREDOSE first automates the collection of web-based social media content for subsequent semantic annotation. The annotation scheme is modeled in the DAO, and includes domain specific knowledge such as prescription (and related) drugs, methods of preparation, side effects, and routes of administration. The DAO is also used to help recognize three types of data, namely: (1) entities, (2) relationships and (3) triples. PREDOSE then uses a combination of lexical and semantic-based techniques to extract entities and relationships from the scraped content, and a top-down approach for triple extraction that uses patterns expressed in the DAO. In addition, PREDOSE uses publicly available lexicons to identify initial sentiment expressions in text, and then a probabilistic optimization algorithm (from related research) to extract the final sentiment expressions. Together, these techniques enable the capture of fine-grained semantic information, which facilitate search, trend analysis and overall content analysis using social media on prescription drug abuse. Moreover, extracted data are also made available to domain experts for the creation of training and test sets for use in evaluation and refinements in information extraction techniques.   RESULTS A recent evaluation of the information extraction techniques applied in the PREDOSE platform indicates 85% precision and 72% recall in entity identification, on a manually created gold standard dataset. In another study, PREDOSE achieved 36% precision in relationship identification and 33% precision in triple extraction, through manual evaluation by domain experts. Given the complexity of the relationship and triple extraction tasks and the abstruse nature of social media texts, we interpret these as favorable initial results. Extracted semantic information is currently in use in an online discovery support system, by prescription drug abuse researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) at Wright State University.   CONCLUSION A comprehensive platform for entity, relationship, triple and sentiment extraction from such abstruse texts has never been developed for drug abuse research. PREDOSE has already demonstrated the importance of mining social media by providing data from which new findings in drug abuse research were uncovered. Given the recent platform enhancements, including the refined DAO, components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content, trend and emerging pattern analysis, it is expected that PREDOSE will play a significant role in advancing drug abuse epidemiology in future.	addictive behavior;adverse reaction to drug;algorithm;cns disorder;data access object;data mining;drug abuse;entity;epidemiologic studies;epidemiology;experience;informatics (discipline);information extraction;lexicon;mathematical optimization;named-entity recognition;online community;pattern recognition;pharmacology;prescription drugs;scraping;semantic web;side effect (computer science);silo (dataset);social media;top-down and bottom-up design;user-generated content;web application;web crawler;webplatform	Delroy Cameron;Gary A.

To realize preventive and personalized medicine, large numbers of consumers must pool health information to create datasets that can be analyzed for wellness and disease trends. Incorporating this information will not only empower consumers, but also enable health systems to improve patient care. To date, consumers have been reluctant to share personal health information for a variety of reasons, but attitudes are shifting. Results from an online survey demonstrate a strong willingness to share health information for research purposes. Building on these results, the authors present a framework to increase health information sharing based on trust, motivation, community, and informed consent.	biobank;computer cluster;institute for operations research and the management sciences;next-generation network;personalization;portable document format;sim lock;simpson's rule	K.

Owing to their busy schedules, however, clinicians typically find it challenging to locate these relevant resources out of the rapidly growing number of journals and articles currently being published. The literature-recommender system may provide a possible solution to this issue if the individual needs of clinicians can be identified and applied.   METHODS We thus collected from the CiteULike website a sample of 96 clinicians and 6,221 scientific articles that they read. We examined the journal distributions, publication types, reading times, and geographic locations. We then compared the distributions of MeSH terms associated with these articles with those of randomly sampled MEDLINE articles using two-sample Z-test and multiple comparison correction, in order to identify the important topics relevant to clinicians.   RESULTS We determined that the sampled clinicians followed the latest literature in a timely manner and read papers that are considered landmarks in medical research history. They preferred to read scientific discoveries from human experiments instead of molecular-, cellular- or animal-model-based experiments. Furthermore, the country of publication may impact reading preferences, particularly for clinicians from Egypt, India, Norway, Senegal, and South Africa.   CONCLUSION These findings provide useful guidance for developing personalized literature-recommender systems for clinicians.	experiment;informatics;journal;medline;medical subject headings;paper;personalization;randomness;recommender system;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;schedule (computer science);schedule (document type);scientific publication;scientific literature;web site	Boshu Ru;Xiaoyan Wang;Lixia Yao	2017		10.1186/s12911-017-0463-z	knowledge management;data mining;schedule;health informatics;medicine	HCI	-57.762026691471355	-67.64937149046665	58565

A field study showed that interface cues on a food-ordering website signaling the amount of food other users consume could trigger an anchoring heuristic and induce individuals to model that amount when deciding their own consumption volume. A laboratory experiment further showed that the anchoring cue tends to induce the modeling behavior of individuals without them being aware of its influence, and such an influence was especially pronounced when resources for cognitive deliberation were limited. Altogether, this research suggests that interface cues could function as nudges and influence decisions at a relatively automatic level.

A typical evaluation of a system involves computing a performance metric, e.g., Average Precision (AP), for each topic and then using the average performance metric, e.g., Mean Average Precision (MAP) to express the overall system performance. However, averages do not capture all the important aspects of system performance, and used alone may not thoroughly express system effectiveness, i.e., average of performance can mask large variance in individual topic effectiveness. The author hypothesis is that, in addition to the average of overall performance, attention needs to be paid to how a system performance varies across topics. This variability can be measured by calculating the standard deviation (SD) of individual performance scores. We refer to this performance variation as Volatility.	best, worst and average case;document-oriented database;information retrieval;relevance;spatial variability;text corpus;volatility	Mehdi Hosseini	2009		10.1145/1571941.1572174	volatility;prediction;computer science;evaluation;data mining;computer performance;standard deviation;information retrieval;statistics	Web+IR	-37.93791537978606	-61.83074551564041	58696

Our ultimate goal is to better define the role of bio-health information in clinical practice and in biological research. This paper reports our first step, which is to compare different web-based resources that describe cystic fibrosis. The resources came from PubMed, Nucleotide, EMBL-EBI, DDBJ, OMIM, MeSH, ICD-10, and the Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database. We found obvious differences in terms of scope and purpose. However, while there were obvious similarities between related resources in terms of content, we also found differences among these resources in terms of display form, specificity of qualifiers, file format and the potential for computer processing. While our work is in its early stages, this study has clarified the nature of bio-health information resources and has allowed us to begin to characterize these resources in terms of their suitability in clinical practice and in biological research.

With that goal, this paper has illustrated two approaches to the analysis and display of three fundamental emotional tone scores. The first is the production of a combined score, tension, which has been derived from previous studies of literary text and criterion passages. The second approach is the generation of transition graphs which identify the emotional state of passages of text according to the categories proposed in Mehrabian's theoretical system.		C. W.

The next paper, by Faloutsos, addresses the other end of the search problem — how to efficiently search a large number of documents. The paper is focused on one particular text access technique, namely, the signature file. Variants of the signature file technique are presented and analyzed. Abstract The Smart information retrieval project was started in 1961. During the past 30 years methods have been developed for the automatic term assignment to natural-language texts (automatic indexing), automatic document clustering, collection searching, and the automatic reformulation of search queries using relevance feedback. Many of these procedures have been incorporated into prac tical retrieval settings. Although there is no hope of solving the content analysis problem for natural-language texts completely satisfactorily, the possibility of automatically analyz ing very large text samples offers new approaches for automatic text processing and information retrieval. Some methods for the massive analysis of natural language text are outlined together with applications in information retrieval. Conventional information retrieval systems are based on Boolean query formu lations where keywords are used together with connecting Boolean operators. By constructing large so-called inverted indexes that contain for each allowable keyword the lists of addresses of all documents indexed by that keyword, it is possible to determine the set of documents corresponding to a given Boolean query formulation from the information stored directly in the index. This im plies that rapid responses can be provided in a conventional retrieval setting using standard Boolean processing methods. The conventional Boolean search system does, however suffer from a number of serious disadvantages: First, the Boolean logic remains inaccessible to many be delegated by the end user to trained search intermediaries; second, the con ventional Boolean logic does not accommodate weighted terms used as part of the query formulations; third, the output produced by a Boolean search is not ranked in any decreasing order of presumed usefulness; finally, the size of the output produced by Boolean searches is difficult to control by untrained per sonnel. Typically, a search could retrieve far more documents than the user can tolerate, or too few items might be retrieved to satisfy the user needs. In any case, the unranked retrieved materials are difficult …	boolean algebra;cluster analysis;information retrieval;inverted index;logical connective;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;natural language;ply (game theory);relevance feedback;search problem;utility;web search query	W.

The present study investigates such inferences while watching a narrative film and aims at clarifying the role of the musical leitmotif in supporting this process. Participants watched short segments from James Bond movies, which depicted situations that were likely to elicit a particular emotion in the main protagonist. The emotional reaction was not directly expressed by the protagonist but was shown on screen in a respective target sentence. In one condition (concordant), this statement matched the situation. In the other condition (nonconcordant), the statement indicated an antagonistic emotion. The reading times of the emotional target sentences were measured. After reading the target sentence, participants continued to watch the film clip by pressing a button. The results show that emotionally nonconcordant target-sentences led to longer reading times, whereas the musical leitmotif had no significant impact.	video clip	Jörn Töpper;Stephan Schwan	2008	J.

These terminologies are not static, because change in health care is inevitable. To share data and applications in health care, we need standards not only for terminologies and concept representation, but also for representing change. To develop a principled approach to managing change, we analyze the requirements of controlled medical terminologies and consider features that frame knowledge-representation systems have to offer. Based on our analysis, we present a concept model, a set of change operations, and a change-documentation model that may be appropriate for controlled terminologies in health care. We are currently implementing our modeling approach within a computational architecture.	documentation;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;health care;knowledge representation and reasoning;name;requirement;standards characteristics	Diane E.

Hybrid eHealth support was given, with electronic support plus a multi-disciplinary health support team. Regarding the pilot goal of long term healthy lifestyle adoption in senior DM2 patients, challenges were: low ICTand health literacy. This exploratory design analysis formulates design lessons based on 50 weeks follow up. The first 12 weeks contained intensive face-to-face and eSupported coaching. After that, patient selfmanagement and eTools were key. After 50 weeks, attractiveness and feasibility of the intervention were perceived as high: recommendation 9,5 out of 10 and satisfaction 9,6 out of 10. TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) surveys showed high usefulness and feasibility. Acceptance and health behaviours were reinforced by the prolonged health results: Aerobic and strength capacity levels were improved at 50 weeks, plus Health Related Quality of Life (and biometric benefits and medication reductions, reported elsewhere). We draw three types of conclusions. First, patients’ health literacy and quality of life improved strongly, which both supported healthy behaviours, even after 50 weeks. Second, regarding eHealth theory, iterative growth cycles are beneficial for long term adoption and e-relationships. Third, a design analysis was conducted regarding long term service mix efficacy in relation to key requirements for designing ICT-enabled lifestyle interventions. Several suggestions for long term lifestyle eSupport are given.		Luuk P. A. Simons;Hanno Pijl;John Verhoef;Hildo J. Lamb;Ben van Ommen;Bas Gerritsen;Maurice B.

07569e6dbdde07f33e4f556308fb036d040d83ba	exploring individual care plan for a good sleep		This paper focuses on care plans (i.e., rough schedules) in care houses and evaluates them from the viewpoint of a deep and stable sleep which contributes to provide comfortable and healthy life for aged persons. For this purpose, this paper investigates the care plans which are basically based on the current care plans but change a small part of a schedule as an aged person desires. Through the human subject experiments in the actual care house, the following implications have been revealed: (1) the proposed care plan decreases the time of the light sleep; and (2) the proposed care plan provides the deep sleep (i.e., 9 years younger sleep in our experiment).

Relevance Feedbackplays a key role in this task, and is typically based only on the information extracted from documents judged by the user for a given query. We propose to make use of a thesaurus to complement this information to improve RF. This must be done by means of a Word Sense Disambiguation process that correctly identifies the suitable information from the thesaurus WordNet. The results of our experiments show that the utilisation of a thesaurus requires Word Sense Disambiguation, and that with this process, Relevance Feedback is substantially improved.	algorithm;experiment;information access;information overload;information retrieval;lexical database;radio frequency;relevance feedback;thesaurus;web services for devices;word sense;word-sense disambiguation;wordnet	Luis Alfonso Ureña López;José María Gómez Hidalgo;Manuel de Buenaga Rodríguez	2000		10.1007/3-540-45323-7_16	natural language processing;relevance;semeval;computer science;concept search;feedback;database;world wide web;radio frequency;information retrieval	NLP	-35.6886641061708	-62.178216070907	59716

In principle, participants have two strategic dimensions in social search systems: (1) Interaction selection, i.e., forwarding/processing incoming requests (or not), and (2) contact selection, i.e., adding or dropping contacts. In systems with these strategic dimensions, it is unclear whether nodes cooperate, and if they form efficient network structures. To shed light on this fundamental question, we have conducted a study to investigate human behavior in interaction selection and to investigate the ability of humans to form efficient networks. In order to limit the degree of problem understanding necessary by the study participants, we have introduced the problem as an online game. 193 subjects joined the study that was online for 67 days. One result is that subjects choose contacts strategically and that they use strategies that lead to cooperative and almost efficient systems. Surprisingly, subjects tend to overestimate the value of cooperative contacts and keep cooperative but costly contacts. This observation is important: Assisting agents that help subjects to avoid this behavior might yield more efficiency.	aardvark;social search;yahoo! answers	Björn-Oliver Hartmann;Klemens Böhm;Christian Hütter	2011	2011 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/WI-IAT.2011.23	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;human factors and ergonomics;machine learning;data mining;user interface;management;world wide web	HCI	-52.64187543642968	-55.19069431906496	59743

099bc2541aa29db1a6cf2e2dd3cdc954236eeba8	a nationwide medication incidents reporting system in the netherlands	information technology;article letter to editor;general practitioner	OBJECTIVE Many Dutch hospitals have established internal systems for reporting incidents. However, such internal systems do not allow learning from incidents that occur in other hospitals. Therefore a multicenter, information technology (IT) supported reporting system named central medication incidents registration (CMR) was developed. This article describes the architecture, implementation and current status of the CMR in The Netherlands and compare it with similar systems in other countries.   SYSTEM DESCRIPTION Adequate IT is required to sufficiently support a multicenter reporting system. The CMR system consists of a website, a database, a web-based reporting form, an application to import reports generated in other reporting systems, an application to generate an overview of reported medication incidents, and a national warning system for healthcare providers.   CURRENT STATUS From the start of CMR 90 of all 93 (96.8%) hospitals and 872 of 1948 (44.8%) community pharmacies participated. Between March 2006 and March 2010 the CMR comprised 15,694 reports of incidents. In the period from March 2010 to March 2011, 1642 reports were submitted by community pharmacies in CMR and the hospitals submitted 2517 reports. CMR is similar to various systems in other countries, but it seems to use more IT applications.   DISCUSSION The CMR is developing into a nationwide reporting system of medication incidents in The Netherlands, in which hospitals, community pharmacies, mental healthcare organizations and general practitioners participate.   CONCLUSION The architecture of the system met the requirements of a nationwide reporting system across different healthcare providers.	assisted living;cns disorder;database;hospitals, community;information sciences;name;objective-c;pharmacy facility;primary health care;requirement;revision procedure;web application	Ka-Chun Cheung;Patricia M.

Besides – currently limited– pharmaceutical treatments, psychosocial interventions play a major role in ensuring the life quality for people with dementia. Among these is reminiscence therapy, which helps people to remember episodes of their past life and maintain their identity, while the disease progresses. The research presented in this paper explores the role of a tangible multimedia artifact to support reminiscence sessions. We describe the development of an interactive book that was tested in a care home with people with dementia and caregivers. We present findings on the interaction with the book, its potential to mediate reminiscence and communication, and on the perspective of caregivers using the book in the sessions.

The first approach takes inspiration from human processes of personality attribution, whereby humans deploy knowledge about personality to attribute traits to other people, even those they never met before and even on the basis of very short sequences (down to a few seconds) of expressive behavior (so-called thin slices). The human attribution process can be described by means of Brunswick's lens model, as modified by Scherer. In this model, personality traits are externalized or made manifest in behavior by means of objectively measurable variables called distal cues, which the perceiver represents him/ herself as subjective/proximal percepts; the latter are then subjected to inferential processes leading to attribution. For instance, a distal cue (an externalization) of the extraversion trait can be the voice pitch, which the observer represents as loudness (the proximal percept) that he/she uses in the course of the inferential process.	depth perception;inferential theory of learning	Fabio Pianesi	2013	IEEE Signal Processing Magazine	10.1109/MSP.2012.2219671	alternative five model of personality;behavioural sciences;predictive modelling;personality;personality development	Web+IR	-51.28842345612155	-52.21050749326097	59874

There is limited congruence between the care preferred by patients and the treatment actually delivered to patients during their end-of-life. The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment Paradigm has been endorsed or is in development in all but three states and the District of Columbia in an effort to ensure that patients are provided with adequate opportunities to specify their end-of-life care preferences. However, most states are using paper forms to document these preferences which may be inaccessible when needed. We have developed an electronic end-of-life care registry that allows authorized users to store and retrieve information pertaining to patients' end-of-life care preferences.

However, although objective measures exist for task outcome, most affective measures are subjective. This study represented an investigation into the speed of mouse-click as a possible measure in human-computer interaction, and was based principally on the suggestions that a relationship exists between stress and motor activities involved in the operation of the fingers. Two groups of 30 subjects were exposed to different sets of human-computer interaction conditions, and the speed of mouse-click and state anxiety were examined. No correlation was found between the speed of mouse-click and state anxiety. However, a significant difference was found in the speed of mouse-click between the groups and the different human-computer interaction situations.

0288640b4d4e7f857c64160effdcc95e0fe7778b	the virtual environment for body-image modification (vebim): development and preliminary evaluation	body image;virtual environment	The Virtual Environment for Body Image Modification (VEBIM) is a set of tasks aimed at treating body-image disturbances and body dissatisfation associated with eating disorders. Two methods are commonly used to treat body-image disturbance: (1) a cognitive-behavioral therapy to influence patients' feelings of dissatisfaction and (2) a visual-motorial therapy, with the aim of influencing the level of bodily awareness. VEBIM tries to integrate these two therapeutical approaches within an immersive virtual environment. The choice of VEBIM would not only make it possible to intervene simultaneously on all of the forms of bodily representations but also to use for therapeutical purposes the psychophysiological effects provoked on the body by the virtual experience. The paper describes the VEBIM theoretical approach and its characteristics; it also presents a study on a preliminary sample (72 normal subjects) to test the efficacy of this approach.	image editing;virtual reality	Giuseppe Riva	1997	Presence: Teleoperators & Virtual Environments	10.1162/pres.1997.6.1.106	simulation;computer science;virtual machine;operating system	Visualization	-54.938440251921676	-52.34895044604905	59936

This is often a complex and daunting process for adolescents, requiring significant adjustment and increased autonomy to manage illness within the context of young people's daily lives. The ubiquitous nature of mobile phones facilitates novel communication channels to engage, support and empower young people to take greater control of their illness management and to improve health outcomes during this crucial period. In this paper, we present a novel mobile phone application aimed at supporting self-management and transition in young people with chronic illness. Nine participants completed a pilot study using the application, and we discuss the outcomes of the study in this paper.	mobile app;mobile phone;self-management (computer science)	Yu Zhao;Rafael Alejandro Calvo;Abelardo Pardo;Harriet Gunn;Katharine Steinbeck	2015		10.1145/2838739.2838805	simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;mobile technology;ubiquitous computing	HCI	-59.363890651647175	-55.83483402897211	59999

De nombreuses informations cliniques sont contenues dans le texte des dossiers électroniques de patients et ne sont pas directement accessibles à des fins de traitement automatique. Pour pallier cela, nous préparons un large corpus annoté de documents cliniques. Une première étape de ce travail consiste à séparer le contenu médical des documents et les informations administratives contenues dans les en-têtes et pieds de page. Nous présentons un système d’identification automatique de zones dans les documents cliniques qui offre une F-mesure de 0,97, équivalente à l’accord inter-annoteur de 0,98. Notre étude montre que le contenu médical ne représente que 60% du contenu total de notre corpus, ce qui justifie la nécessité d’une segmentation en zones. Le travail d’annotation en cours porte sur les sections médicales identifiées. Abstract. Much clinical information is contained in the free text of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and is not available for automatic processing. To advance Natural Language Processing of the French clinical narrative, we are building a richly annotated large-scale corpus of French clinical documents. To access the most medically relevant content of EHRs we develop an automatic system to separate the core medical content from other document sections, such as headers and footers. The performance of automatic content extraction achieves 96.6% F-measure, on par with human inter-annotator agreement of 98%. We find that medically relevant content covers only 60% of clinical documents in our corpus. Future annotation work will focus on these sections.	automatic identification and data capture;bibliothèque de l'école des chartes;inter-rater reliability;linear algebra;natural language processing;text corpus	Louise Deléger;Aurélie Névéol	2014				NLP	-34.355051437008946	-71.95230214785056	60017
af1d928b6a33c46742c2a2db8d3197f79122ca24	a publication-based popularity index (ppi) for healthcare dataset ranking		Data are critical in this age of big data and machine learning. Due to their inherent complexity, health-related data are unique in that the datasets are usually acquired for specific purposes and with special designs. As more and more healthcare datasets become available, of which many are public, choosing a quality dataset that is suitable for specific research inquiries is becoming a challenging question for health informatics researchers, especially the learners of this field. On the other hand, from the data provider's perspective, it is important to identify features of datasets that make some datasets more valuable than others so as to improve the design and acquisition of future datasets. To address these questions, we need to develop formal mechanisms to measure the goodness of datasets according to certain criteria. In this study, we propose one way of measuring the value of healthcare datasets that is based on how often the datasets are used and reported by researchers, which we call the Publication-based Popularity Index (PPI). In this article, we describe the design of the PPI and discuss its properties. We demonstrate the utility of the PPI by ranking 14 representative healthcare datasets. We believe that the PPI can enable an overall ranking of all healthcare datasets and thus provide an important dimension to sort search results for dataset integration systems as well as a starting point for identifying and examining the design of the most valuable healthcare datasets so that features of these datasets can inform future designs.	big data;informatics;machine learning;pixel density	Jingyi Shi;Mingna Zheng;Lixia Yao;Yaorong Ge	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)	10.1109/ICHI.2018.00035	market research;data mining;big data;informatics;data integrity;popularity;ranking;health informatics;computer science;data quality	DB	-48.547201463530996	-65.63311170020611	60148

One barrier preventing widespread adoption is the potential detrimental impact on workflow. We used time-motion techniques to compare prescribing times at three ambulatory care sites that used paper-based prescribing, desktop, or laptop e-prescribing. An observer timed all prescriber (n = 27) and staff (n = 42) tasks performed during a 4-hour period. At the sites with optional e-prescribing >75% of prescription-related events were performed electronically. Prescribers at e-prescribing sites spent less time writing, but time-savings were offset by increased computer tasks. After adjusting for site, prescriber and prescription type, e-prescribing tasks took marginally longer than hand written prescriptions (12.0 seconds; -1.6, 25.6 CI). Nursing staff at the e-prescribing sites spent longer on computer tasks (5.4 minutes/hour; 0.0, 10.7 CI). E-prescribing was not associated with an increase in combined computer and writing time for prescribers. If carefully implemented, e-prescribing will not greatly disrupt workflow.	clinic;desktop computer;electronic prescribing;home care services;laptop;time and motion study;ambulatory care services	William Hollingworth;Emily Beth Devine;Ryan N.

In this paper, we focus solely on the Mongolian language using the Cyrillic alphabet, in which a content word can be inflected when concatenated with one or more suffixes. Identifying the original form of content words is crucial for natural language processing and information retrieval. We propose a lemmatization method for Mongolian. The advantage of our lemmatization method is that it does not rely on noun dictionaries, enabling us to lemmatize out-of-dictionary words. We also apply our method to indexing for information retrieval. We use newspaper articles and technical abstracts in experiments that show the effectiveness of our method. Our research is the first significant exploration of the effectiveness of lemmatization for information retrieval in Mongolian.	information retrieval;lemmatisation	Badam-Osor Khaltar;Atsushi Fujii	2009	Inf.

In our experiment, people play a Prisoner’s Dilemma Game with a partisan audience watching the choice. Two groups of the same size (6-10 persons) participated in each session; these groups could be both all-male, both all-female, or one allmale and one all-female. Groups were separated into two rooms. Each person in the group played the game once with an audience of the same group (“at home”) and once with audience of the other group (“away”). Participants additionally received a 1/3 share of the active group member’s payoffs in games in which they made no choices. Behavior is significantly affected by the interaction of gender and place: males cooperate substantially more often when away, while females cooperate substantially more often when at home. At home, females cooperate significantly more than males, and when away the cooperation rates are similar. We confirm the established result in the literature that there is no gender difference in aggregate cooperation rates in Prisoner’s Dilemma, but in our environment this is an artifact produced by the balance of two opposing forces. We discuss a possible explanation for this pattern: Males and females wish to signal their ingroup peers, but males wish to signal their formidability and females wish to signal their cooperativeness.	aggregate data;experiment;prisoner's dilemma	Gary Charness;Aldo Rustichini	2011	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2010.07.006	social behavior;cooperation;group dynamics	HCI	-51.239328574270104	-56.15241771328176	60707

The method is designed to collect different types of empirical data, i.e. cognitive data as well as traditional systems performance data. The method is based on the novel concept of a 'simulated work task situation' or scenario and the involvement of real end users. The method is also based on a mixture of simulated and real information needs, and involves a group of test persons as well as assessments made by individual panel members. The relevance assessments are made with reference to the concepts of topical as well as situational relevance. The method takes into account the dynamic nature of information needs which are assumed to develop over time for the same user, a variability which is presumed to be strongly connected to the processes of relevance assessment.	heart rate variability;information needs;information retrieval;relevance;strongly connected component	Pia Borlund;Peter Ingwersen	1997	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/EUM0000000007198	computer simulation;information needs;simulation;computer science;evaluation;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-44.73529135529242	-56.242779087582754	60795
5a41e8ae106e5908d47aafe920847d239f0aecd4	evaluating collaboration effectiveness of patient-to-doctor interaction in a healthcare territorial network		The emerging crucial point of healthcare organizations is to involve patients in autonomous monitoring their own health status by using personal ICT-based systems to manage data, and to ask for an effective cooperation with the doctor, if necessary. Two motivations urge this innovation: the growing costs of healthcare services, and the need to promote patients’ education. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to outline a Patient Guidance System (PGS) architecture to allow the patients an ubiquitous and secure management of personal health data and an easy call to the doctor in case of a critical or suspicious health situation. The PGS architecture will support an effective cooperation between the patient and the doctor in such a way to assure to the patient – either at home, or moving and/or being monitored by wearable devices – a clear interaction to get an easily understandable healthcare service.	autonomous robot;wearable technology	Dario Antonelli;Dario Bellomo;Giulia Bruno;Agostino Villa	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32775-9_13	public relations;simulation;knowledge management	HCI	-59.780477556336216	-58.48284803959018	60879

It is therefore recognized that the capability to automatically extract key concepts and their relationships from such data will allow systems to properly understand the content and knowledge embedded in the free text which can be of great value for applications such as information extraction and question & answering. This paper gives a brief presentation of such textual data and its semantic annotation, and discusses the set of semantic relations that can be observed between  diseases  and  treatments  in the sample. The problem is then designed as a supervised machine learning task in which the relations are tried to be learned using pre-annotated data. The challenges designing the problem and empirical results are presented.

Based on questionnaires, measurement logs, and interviews, we examined participants' perceptions and attitudes to-wards BP variability and their associations of BP with aspects of their lives. We found that participants modi-fied their use of BP devices in response to BP variabil-ity, made associations with stress, food, and daily rou-tines, and revealed challenges with the design of current BP devices for personal use. We present design recom-mendations for BP use in everyday contexts and de-scribe strategies for re-framing BP capture and reporting.	field research;fluctuat;framing (world wide web);heart rate variability;snapshot (computer storage);wearable technology	Logan Kendall;Dan Morris;Desney S.

Indirect effects are effects that occur in an experiment due to the units which are adjacent (spatially or temporally) to the unit being observed. Spatial indirect effects arise due to the treatments applied to the adjacent neighbouring units/plots and the designs so developed are called Neighbour Balanced Designs (NBDs). Whereas temporal indirect effects occur because of the carryover or residual effects in the periods following the periods of their direct application and the designs considering temporal effects are called Crossover Designs. A large number of such designs have been developed in the literature. For ready referencing and potential use of these designs, online software for generation of randomized layout of these designs is highly desirable. This paper describes the development of a web solution for generation of NBDs and Crossover Designs using client-server architecture along with an online catalogue of the designs within a permissible range. Designs generated through this software have wide applications in agricultural experiments, forestry and agro-forestry trials, polycross nurseries, serological experiments, animal nutritional trials, sensory evaluations, clinical trials, etc. WEB-DBIE is accessible any time from arbitrary platforms through internet.

3ad32994582ca0dbc17075f02b7c92a5f6031c91	comparing the document representations of two ir-systems: clarit and topic	databases;indexing;information retrieval;comparative analysis	The discipline of information retrieval may well be as old as the written word. With the advent of big libraries much effort was put into systems enabling people to retrieve information (or rather, documents containing that information) from those collections. Nevertheless, the IR community is not very enthusiastic when it talks about the performance of current systems. Cleverdon’s observations on the subject of human indexing (Cleverdon, 1984) and the famous Blair/Maron experiment in full test retrieval (Blair/Maron, 1985) still loom darkly over all attempts to substantially alter the effectiveness of information retrieval techniques. The probabilistic and vector models that have been perfected over the last ten years, however sophisticated, cannot claim to imply a real understanding of the documents, and AI approaches are hampered by the fact that the creation and maintenance of involved knowledge representations only works in very small domains. And, as Cleverdon observed, human indexing just is not consistent enough to guarantee acceptable recall and precision over sizeable databases. But the ever increasing number of articles, documents, and books in libraries and elsewhere will not disappear just because there is no unified paradigm in which to solve the retrieval problem. Therefore, widely different schemes and systems have been developed to solve that problem, and this fact has placed an increasing importance on strategies for testing such schemes and systems.	book;database;information retrieval;library (computing);loom;precision and recall;programming paradigm	Hans Paijmans	1993	JASIS	10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199308)44:7%3C383::AID-ASI3%3E3.0.CO;2-L	qualitative comparative analysis;search engine indexing;document processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;comparative research;data mining;database;information retrieval	Web+IR	-40.004841270506176	-61.58932287487059	61475

While such acceptance has received fairly extensive attention from previous research, additional efforts are needed to examine or validate existing research results, particularly those involving different technologies, user populations, and/or organizational contexts. In response, this paper reports a research work that examined the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (ΤΑΜ) in explaining physicians' decisions to accept telemedicine technology in the health-care context. The technology, the user group, and the organizational context are all new to IT acceptance/adoption research. The study also addressed a pragmatic technology management need resulting from millions of dollars invested by healthcare organizations in developing and implementing telemedicine programs in recent years. The model's overall fit, explanatory power, and the individual causal links that it postulates were evaluated by examining the acceptance of telemedicine technology among physicians practicing at public tertiary hospitals in Hong Kong. Our results suggested that ΤΑΜ was able to provide a reasonable depiction of physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology. Perceived usefulness was found to be a significant determinant ofattitude and intention but perceived ease of use was not. The relatively low R-square of the model suggests both the limitations of the parsimonious model and the need for incorporating additional factors or integrating with other IT acceptance models in order to improve its specificity and explanatory utility in a health-care context. Based on the study findings, implications for user technology acceptance research and telemedicine management are discussed.	causality;hyperlink;occam's razor;population;sensitivity and specificity;usability	Paul Jen-Hwa Hu;Patrick Y.

ff355db98c5350a8c3671e40ddee9bb7fd1153ef	stance classification of social media users in independence movements		Social media and data mining are increasingly being used to analyse political and societal issues. Characterisation of users into socio-demographic groups is crucial to improve these analyses. Here we undertake the classification of social media users as supporting or opposing ongoing independence movements in their territories. Independence movements occur in territories whose citizens have conflicting national identities; users with opposing national identities will then support or oppose the sense of being part of an independent nation that differs from the officially recognised country. We describe a methodology that relies on users’ self-reported location to build datasets for three territories – Catalonia, the Basque Country and Scotland – and we test language-independent classifiers using four types of features. We show the effectiveness of the approach to build large annotated datasets, and the ability to achieve accurate, language-independent classification performances ranging from 85% to 97% for the three territories under study.	data mining;language-independent specification;performance;social media	Arkaitz Zubiaga;Bo Wang;Maria Liakata;Rob Procter	2017	CoRR		natural language processing;artificial intelligence;public relations;politics;social issues;computer science;ranging;social media;national identities	ML	-40.51706428176383	-71.90172706470841	61939
fa7149fab936446a50e0696900c4fd11542cee19	understanding resistance towards electronic patient health data in south australian family practice		This paper reports the results from a survey of 131 medical practitioners in South Australian General Practice concerning adoption of a computerised system for storing and potentially amalgamating health information from several practices. Practitioners were primarily influenced by the positively perceived potential for such technology use to improve patient health and well-being outcomes and secondarily by the negatively perceived potential for unwanted change in the status, control and autonomy of their professional role. Practitioner attitude reflected how they resolved the competing influences. The data suggest that strategies for implementing such systems should address individual perceptions by increasing belief in the potential for patient improvement or by decreasing belief of the inevitability of unwanted role change.

Key PHEP activities involved in supporting this cycle include planning; surveillance; alerting; resource assessment and management; data-driven decision support; and intervention for prevention and control of disease or injury in populations. Information systems supporting these activities are most effective in assuring optimal response to an emergent health event when they are integrated within an informatics framework that supports routine (day to day) information exchange within the health information exchange community. In late April 2009, New York State (NYS) initiated a statewide PHEP response to the emergence of Novel Influenza A (H1N1), culminating in a statewide vaccination campaign during the last quarter of 2009. The established informatics framework of integrated information systems within NYS conveyed significant advantages and flexibility in supporting the range of PHEP activities required for an effective response to this health event. This chapter describes, and provides, performance metrics to illustrate how a public health informatics framework can enhance the efficacy of all phases of a public health emergency response. It also provides informatics lessons learned from the event.	informatics;information system	Ivan J. Gotham;Linh H. Le;Debra L. Sottolano;Kathryn J. Schmit	2015	Inf. Syst.

02fb7d39c6d49af5faea8167516a7523f42291c7	a case study of the international niemann-pick disease registry (inpdr)		Clinical research registries need to be driven by data quality to improve the outcome of clinical trials and to provide the possibility to facilitate new research initiatives. The International Niemann-Pick Disease Registry (INPDR) is one such example of a clinical research registry. Unlike other registries where data quality is largely based around best effort manual data entry, the INPDR registry supports ongoing data completeness evaluation and feedback to those entering data. To assess the efficiency of this feedback, a research framework evaluating data completeness with different types of user feedback was applied. In this paper we consider the impact on data quality and user activity over time. Data accuracy and data completeness was measured by participating centers and combined into an overall data quality score. The results show that clinical research registries can benefit from an ongoing data quality assurance framework with targeted data quality feedback. This has implications for future clinical trials and clinical databases more generally.	best-effort delivery;data quality;database	Stephan Gloeckner;Salla E.

c40cb994baed9c89d00166722ca2b4a06189cbd5	re-structuring and specific similarity computation of electronic medical records		Electronic medical records (EMRs) have high value for research, as they contain the patient's personal information, medical history, clinical examination, treatment process, and other information. Analysis based on EMRs can effectively assist doctors in clinical decision-making, provide data support for clinical research as well as personalized healthcare service for patients. We introduce a novel approach for EMR similarity computation by re-structuring and filtering some parts of physical examination result. Our approach is motivated by observations that it is easier to distinguish disease bias special part than bias the whole EMR which maybe contain some ineffective information. Assuming the check parts are independent, we split them and select effective parts. Then, we apply Deep NLP, converting the word to vectors which can be used to measure syntactic and semantic word similarities better. In addition, We replace traditional Euclidean distance with Word Mover's Distance(WMD), a novel distance function between text documents. Finally, KNN cluster is been used to evaluate the similarity between EMRs. Compared with traditional method such as LDA and LSI, our proposed method achieved higher recall value of disease classification problem.	ct scan;computation;effective method;euclidean distance;excalibur: morgana's revenge;experiment;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;natural language processing;personalization;personally identifiable information;semantic analysis (compilers);systematized nomenclature of medicine;terminology extraction;text corpus	Yunxuan Zhang;Ziping He;Ji-Jiang Yang;Qing Wang;Jianqiang Li	2017	2017 IEEE 41st Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	10.1109/COMPSAC.2017.200	filter (signal processing);metric (mathematics);euclidean distance;syntax;computation;structuring;information retrieval;computer science;data warehouse;personally identifiable information	ML	-48.321027521160815	-68.24247387650831	62391

This may be of benefit in diagnosing and treating patients in emergency situations where specialized medical expertise is not locally available. We conducted an experimental evaluation, simulating an emergency medical situation and examining the interaction between the attending paramedic and remote, consulting physician. Post-questionnaire data illustrate that the information provided by the consulting physician was perceived to be more useful by the paramedic in the 3D condition than the 2D condition. However, the data pertaining to the quality of interaction and trust between the consulting physician and paramedic showed mixed results. The implications of these results are discussed. Introduction Trauma is a significant health problem, frequently referred to as the ‘hidden epidemic of modern society’ because it is responsible for more productive years lost than heart disease, cancer and stroke combined (Meyer, 1998; Coates & Goode, 2001). 3D telepresence technology, an emergent information and communications technology that may ultimately provide dynamic 3D views of remote scenes, has the potential to provide richer visual information than current 2D video conferencing techniques and increase a physician's knowledge about a remote patient, the trauma scene, and actions performed by remote medical personnel. Using 3D technology may provide people in rural, catastrophic and hazardous areas, as well as disabled and elderly people who can not be easily transported, access to experts at large medical care facilities. As indicated in the National Academy’s report on telemedicine evaluation (Field, 1996), it is of critical importance to examine the acceptability and practicality of technology in medicine. Today only prototype demonstrations of the 3D telepresence technology exist; the technology is not sufficiently developed to be evaluated using standard usability methods. However, research funding agencies would like to know today whether the technology has potential to improve health care in emergency medical care situations. The funding agencies would like to avoid spend millions of dollars developing yet another technology that does not have a positive impact on medical care. This poses a complex challenge. How can we evaluate the potential impact of a technology within complex, dynamic work contexts when the technology does not yet exist? 1 All correspondence should be addressed to Diane H.

Many challenges, including finding an adequate clone definition and scalability to industrial size systems, must be overcome to create good oracles. This paper presents an original method to construct clone oracles based on the Levenshtein metric. Although other oracles exist, this is the largest known oracle for type-3 clones that was created by an automated process on massive data sets. The method behind the creation of the oracle as well as actual oracles characteristics are presented. Discussion of the results in relation to other ways of building oracles is also provided along with future research possibilities.	bibliographic database;duplicate code;oracle machine;performance evaluation;scalability	Thierry Lavoie;Ettore Merlo	2011		10.1145/1985404.1985411	computer science;data mining;database;algorithm	SE	-40.766438375146954	-68.62469287297321	62527

King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center decided to improve efficiency and enhance patient flow through improving patient discharge and reducing length of stay. Eight interventions were implemented; dedicating slots in diagnostic services for discharges, improving communication, eliminating pending exams, identifying discharges the day before, prioritizing laboratory tests, coordinating discharge medication processing and utilizing case management. 14.1% of discharges after improvement, compared to 21.7% before, experienced delays. Discharge cycle duration was reduced from 17.9 to 9.2 hours. 4.1% of discharges after improvement, compared to 14.8% before, experienced procedures delays. Procedure turnaround time was reduced from 46.9 to 15.3 hours. Average length of stay (ALOS) was reduced from 12 days to less than 10. Improving hospital efficiency is an integrated process and the responsibility of all hospital staff.

Various Web sites offer a great variety of such information. However, lay people might have difficulties to assess whether a certain article or Web site fits their individual level of understandability. Hence, they might get overwhelmed with the delivered complexity of medical information.

To help access and recall these recommendations, electronic Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have been developed. This study examined the use and sensibility of two CDSS designed for emergency physicians. CDDS for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and neutropenic fever (NF) were developed by multi-disciplinary teams and have been accessed via an intranet-based homepage (eCPG©) for several years. Sensibility is a term coined by Feinstein that describes common sense aspects of a survey instrument. It was modified by emergency researchers to include four main headings: (1) Appropriateness; (2) Objectivity; (3) Content; and (4) Discriminative Power. Sensibility surveys were developed using an iterative approach for both the CAP and NF CDSS and distributed to all 25 emergency physicians at one Canadian site. The overall response rate was 88%. Respondents were 88% male and 83% were less than 40; all were attending EM physicians with specialty designations. A number reported never having used the CAP (21%) or NF (33%) CDSS; 54% (CAP) and 21% (NF) of respondents had used the respective CDSS less than 10 times. Overall, both CDSS were rated highly by users with a mean response of 4.95 (SD 0.56) for CAP and 5.62 (SD 0.62) for NF on a seven-point Likert scale. The majority or respondents (CAP 59%, NF 80%) felt that the NF CDSS was more likely than the CAP CDSS to decrease the chances of making a medical error in medication dose, antibiotic choice or patient disposition (4.61 vs. 5.81, p = 0.008). Despite being in place for several years, CDSS for CAP and NF are not used by all EM clinicians. Users were generally satisfied with the CDSS and felt that the NF was more likely than the CAP CDSS to decrease medical errors. Additional research is required to determine the barriers to CDSS use.	accident and emergency department;autonomic nervous system;cap computer;clinical decision support system;ecpg;febrile neutropenia;home page;intranet;iterative method;medical transcription;norm (social);objectivity/db;physiological sexual disorders;rating (action);vii;community acquired pneumonia;emergency medicine (field);teams	Timothy A.

Harnessing such search experiences facilitates collaborative querying that in turn may help users of digital libraries and other information systems to better meet their information needs. Since similarity is fundamental to the definition of a cluster, measures of similarity between two queries are essential to the query clustering procedure. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of different similarity measures. A set of experiments was carried out to study the impact of different similarity measures on the quality of query clusters. The results show that different similarity measures outperform each other in different query cluster quality criteria.

Recruitment decisions based on case-based reasoning, i.e. using past cases rather than explicit rules, could dispense with the need for translating eligibility criteria and could also be implemented largely independently from the terminology of the EHR's database. We evaluated the feasibility of predictive modeling to assess the eligibility of patients for clinical trials and report on a prototype's performance for different system configurations.   METHODS The prototype worked by using existing basic patient data of manually assessed eligible and ineligible patients to induce prediction models. Performance was measured retrospectively for three clinical trials by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves and comparing the area under the curve (ROC-AUC) for different prediction algorithms, different sizes of the learning set and different numbers and aggregation levels of the patient attributes.   RESULTS Random forests were generally among the best performing models with a maximum ROC-AUC of 0.81 (CI: 0.72-0.88) for trial A, 0.96 (CI: 0.95-0.97) for trial B and 0.99 (CI: 0.98-0.99) for trial C. The full potential of this algorithm was reached after learning from approximately 200 manually screened patients (eligible and ineligible). Neither block- nor category-level aggregation of diagnosis and procedure codes influenced the algorithms' performance substantially.   CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that predictive modeling is a feasible approach to support patient recruitment into clinical trials. Its major advantages over the commonly applied rule-based systems are its independency from the concrete representation of eligibility criteria and EHR data and its potential for automation.	area under curve;auditory recruitment;case-based reasoning;code;electronic health records;eligibility determination;forests;nomenclature;patients;predictive modelling;projection screen;prototype;random forest;receiver operator characteristics;receiver operating characteristic;rule (guideline);rule-based system;support system;algorithm	Felix Köpcke;Dorota Lubgan;Rainer Fietkau;Axel Scholler;Carla Nau;Michael Stürzl;Roland Croner;Hans-Ulrich Prokosch;Dennis Toddenroth	2013		10.1186/1472-6947-13-134	health informatics;medicine;data science;nursing;predictive value of tests;data mining;management science	AI	-55.677004131653014	-67.48983642011518	63680

MATERIALS AND METHODS Text from 4409 clinical encounters for 33 men enrolled in a 15-year longitudinal clinical/molecular autopsy study of metastatic prostate cancer (Project to ELIminate lethal CANcer) was subjected to natural language processing (NLP) using Unified Medical Language System-based terms. A four-tiered pain scale was developed, and logistic regression analysis identified factors that correlated with experience of severe pain during each month.   RESULTS NLP identified 6387 pain and 13 827 drug mentions in the text. Graphical displays revealed the pain 'landscape' described in the textual records and confirmed dramatically increasing levels of pain in the last years of life in all but two patients, all of whom died from metastatic cancer. Severe pain was associated with receipt of opioids (OR=6.6, p<0.0001) and palliative radiation (OR=3.4, p=0.0002). Surprisingly, no severe or controlled pain was detected in two of 33 subjects' clinical records. Additionally, the NLP algorithm proved generalizable in an evaluation using a separate data source (889 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) discharge summaries).   DISCUSSION Patterns in the pain experience, undetectable without the use of NLP to mine the longitudinal clinical record, were consistent with clinical expectations, suggesting that meaningful NLP-based pain status monitoring is feasible. Findings in this initial cohort suggest that 'outlier' pain phenotypes useful for probing the molecular basis of cancer pain may exist.   LIMITATIONS The results are limited by a small cohort size and use of proprietary NLP software.   CONCLUSIONS We have established the feasibility of tracking longitudinal patterns of pain by text mining of free text clinical records. These methods may be useful for monitoring pain management and identifying novel cancer phenotypes.	cancer pain;cessation of life;data sources;discharger;graphical user interface;imagery;informatics (discipline);languages;logistic regression;medical records;metastatic prostate carcinoma;natural language processing;pain management;patients;phenotype;prostatic neoplasms;severe extremity pain;text mining;algorithm	Norris H.

Many attempts to introduce state-of-the-art standardized systems for electronic record keeping have met with limited success in these settings. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of C4G BLIS, a system that tracks patients, laboratory samples, test results, and generates customized reports and trends for patients, physicians and health officials. The system was designed and deployed based on two major principles: (1) an Iterative Cooperative Design (ICD) methodology (2) immediate and continuous benefits for day-to-day users of the system. C4G BLIS is currently in use in many large hospital laboratories in Africa, and we report on the experience and results from these deployments, including improved turn-around times, reduced error rates and user satisfaction.	blis/cobol;iterative method	Santosh Vempala;Naomi Chopra;Aishwarya Rajagopal;John N Nkengasong;Sidney Akuro	2016		10.1145/2909609.2909657	simulation;medical laboratory;developing country;management science;biological engineering;economic growth;health care	HCI	-58.427332971493385	-61.5647385073515	63908

Copying other people is considered as serious offence that needs to be checked. There are many plagiarism detection systems such as turn-it-in that has been developed to provide this checks. Most, if not all, discard the figures and charts before checking for plagiarism. Discarding the figures and charts results in look holes that people can take advantage. That means people can plagiarized figures and charts easily without the current plagiarism systems detecting it. There are very few papers which talks about flowcharts plagiarism detection. Therefore, there is a need to develop a system that will detect plagiarism in figures and charts. This paper presents a method for detecting flow chart figure plagiarism based on shape-based image processing and multimedia retrieval.

98839a9165bf0896907b5630fa0253edec493931	managing learner's affective states in intelligent tutoring systems		Recent works in Computer Science, Neurosciences, Education, and Psychology have shown that emotions play an important role in learning. Learner’s cognitive ability depends on his emotions. We will point out the role of emotions in learning, distinguishing the different types and models of emotions which have been considered until now. We will address an important issue concerning the different means to detect emotions and introduce recent approaches to measure brain activity using Electroencephalograms (EEG). Knowing the influence of emotional events on learning it becomes important to induce specific emotions so that the learner can be in a more adequate state for better learning or memorization. To this end, we will introduce the main components of an emotionally intelligent tutoring system able to recognize, interpret and influence learner’s emotions. We will talk about specific virtual agents that can influence learner’s emotions to motivate and encourage him and involve a more cooperative work, particularly in narrative learning environments. Pushing further this paradigm, we will present the advantages and perspectives of subliminal learning which intervenes without conscious perception. Finally, we conclude with new directions to emotional learning. 17.1 Emotions and Learning Learning involves mainly two processes: reasoning and memorizing. Reasoning is developed during cognitive tasks in which a learner tries to solve a problem using deductions or inductions. If a new knowledge (fact, rule) is obtained then the knowledge will be memorized in long term memory. Memorizing is also triggered when a learner tries to remember a previously acquired element using several means such as similarity, imagery, case-based analysis, etc. The two processes work alternatively and can be considered as a “Cartesian” approach of brain functions. Recent researches in neurosciences, education, and psychology have shown that emotions play an important role in learning. People often separate emotions and reason, believing that emotions are an obstacle in rational decision making or 340 C. Frasson and P. Chalfoun reasoning but recent work have shown that in every case the cognitive process of an individual is strongly dependent on his emotions which can drastically influence performance (Damasio 1994; Spering et al. 2005). Numerous students submitted to an examination have been faced to stress and anxiety and by consequence to the “memory blank”, a situation in which they are unable to neither retrieve any information nor make any deductions. Generally, negative emotions reduce or block thought processes, slow down the decisions and memory capacity (Idzihowski and Baddeley 1987). Positive emotions provide better conditions for problem solving and improve innovation. Students expressing anxiety or showing hyperactivity will not store knowledge efficiently (Isen 2000; Pekrun 2008). The learning process involves in particular three cognitive processes, namely attention, memorization, and reasoning, with respect to each of which the learner’s cognitive ability depends on his emotions. Attention means focusing. Learning can take place only if the student listens. A necessary condition for successful learning is hence to gain the attention of the student (Gagné 1985) depending on the learner’s emotions, this first step can be more or less difficult. In fact, strong emotions, particularly if they are negative, disturb any kind of attention and concentration and prevent the learner from focusing on a subject. Moreover, negative emotions lead to difficulties in switching the attention to a new focus (Compton 2000). Memory is one of the most important concepts in learning. Knowledge memorization represents a principal objective of instruction and is necessary for the major complex cognitive tasks of learning process (Bloom 1994). Memorizing is a process which involves the storage of information as well as the retrieval of knowledge and the following properties (Bower 1992): • The effectiveness of the memorization process is narrowly linked to someone’s emotions: Whereas positive emotions enhance the memory performance in general, unrelated and negative emotions disturb in particular the retrieval process. • On the other hand, emotions which are related to the content to be memorized help in storing it. • The retrieval process is improved when the emotional state is closest to the one at the time the desired information to retrieve was memorized. Reasoning is the subsequent task attached to memory in which the learner is supposed to reason with the acquired knowledge. The process of reasoning enables a learner to perform more complex cognitive tasks – such as comprehension, classification, application of knowledge, analysis, and problem solving – which represent the ultimate goal of the learning process (Bloom 1994): • Positive emotions improve any kind of reasoning since relations can be made more easily between objects or ideas (Isen 2000). In general, such emotions lead to a more creative, flexible, and divergent thinking process, whereas negative emotions cause a more linear, convergent, and sequential thinking (a step by step process) (Lisetti and Schiano 2000). • Positive emotions promote efficiency and thoroughness in decision making and problem solving (Isen 2000). Managing Learner’s Affective States in Intelligent Tutoring Systems 341 Emotions can be used in the learning content to increase learner’s attention and improve his memory capacity. In the following section we examine what types of different emotions can be considered. 17.2 The Different Types of Emotions In the literature, there is sometimes confusion between the terms emotions, feelings, and affects. Although there is no common agreement on the definitions, it is important to make a distinction (Shouse 2005). A feeling is an internal perception of a situation (or sensation) which is compared with previous experiences. Feelings (and ability to feel) differ from an individual to another as the volume and variety of previous sensations is different. They need an evaluation of a given situation. An emotion is the consequence and display of a feeling. Emotions are comprised in a set of emotional states which can trigger different reactions (heart rate, transpiration, skin conductivity, muscle tension, blood pressure). It is a visible or measurable consequence of a feeling. Emotion is an immediate reaction to a feeling. An affect is a stimulation state, or instinct able to change or provoke affective situations or experiences; affects are unconscious, without individual control. Successive affects will create different feelings according to the time. It is a physiological property of the body to generate intensities of affective situations. An individual can affect or be affected. Fig. 17.1 Tree like taxonomy of Philipp Shaver Thus affects will create feelings, which will be displayed as emotions. For instance, as babies have no previous history of feelings their emotions will be direct expression of the affective stimulations (Shouse 2005). Different models of emotions have been determined and hence different ways to represent them. Commonly, researchers have defined several types of emotions, called basic emotions. The first computational model of emotions was established by Ortony, Clore and Collins (Ortony et al. 1988), known since that time as the OCC model. This model specifies 22 types of emotions: fortunes of others (happy-for, resentment, gloating, pity), well-being (joy, distress), Prospect-Based (satisfaction, fear-confirmed, relief, disappointment), Attribution (pride, shame, admiration, reproach), Attraction (love, hate), Well-Being/Attribution compounds (gratification, remorse, gratitude, 342 C. Frasson and P. Chalfoun anger). This model might be too complex for the development of emotional characters, so Philipp Shaver in (Parrott 2001) asked college students to rate 213 emotional terms on how much emotion they conveyed. This study conducted to the definition of 5 or 6 clusters of basic emotions: love, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, fear and each emotion leading to secondary and tertiary emotions. With the objectives to proceed to a facial recognition of emotions, Ekman (Ekman et al. 2002) distinguished then six different basics emotions: sadness, happiness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger. The faces help to moderate and choreograph conversations, and conveyed information. Even if all emotions are not perceived easily and clearly on a human face, we believe that each emotion has a specific facial expression with flagrant or subtle modifications. An example: sad, mournful expressions: use eyebrow depression, eye narrowing, nasal muscle elevation, lip compression, and mouth lowering (turned down at edges). As emotions can have an impact on the voice, Juslin and Sherer (Juslin and Scherer 2005) has shown how different emotions can change the tone, articulation and intensity of the voice. Elliot (Elliot 1992) built a computing system combining facial expression and voice tones, based on 13 couples of opposed emotions. This system produced emotions which were better recognized by users than emotions expressed by humans. Table 17.1 Elliot’s set of emotions Joy Distress Sorry-for Gloating Satisfaction Disappointment Pride Shame Liking Disliking Gratification Remorse Happy-for Resentment Hope Fear Relief Fear-confirmed Admiration Reproach Gratitude Anger Love Hate Jealousy non-Jealousy However, we must be conscious that on some learner faces, we may not see facial expressions, because of impassive faces or cultural barriers and this represents a limitation of this method. Ochs (Ochs and Frasson 2004) built a system called Case Based Emotioning System (CBE), enabling any user to indicate on a scale how he would feel in a given hypothetic situation. After a period of data acquisition the Case Base Reasoning System was able to make rather accurate predictions using	biconnected component;c. thomas elliott;cartesian closed category;cognition;computation;computational model;computer science;data acquisition;distress (novel);electroencephalography;experience;facial recognition system;fear, uncertainty and doubt;humans;intelligent agent;memory management;optimistic concurrency control;pitch (music);problem solving;process (computing);programming paradigm;rationality;reasoning system;sadness;semantic similarity;taxonomy (general);word lists by frequency	Claude Frasson;Pierre Chalfoun	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14363-2_17		AI	-53.12404511779299	-53.31775642053957	64569

In order to better understand how KT tracking compares with visual tracking, both a critical tracking and a stationary single-axis tracking task were conducted with and without velocity quickening. In the critical tracking tasks, the visual displays were superior; however, the quickened KT display was approximately equal to the unquickened visual display. In stationary tracking tasks, subjects adopted lag equalization with the quickened KT and visual displays, and mean-squared error scores were approximately equal. With the unquickened displays, subjects adopted lag-lead equalization, and the visual displays were superior.	apache axis;approximation;kosterlitz–thouless transition;mean squared error;stationary process;velocity (software development);video tracking	Richard J.

The objective was to characterize qualitatively elements of task-related situations that were meaningful for orienteers. The results showed that the participants continuously made judgments about the reliability of their estimations about whether they were on “the right route” on the course. When the participants judged that they were only approximately on the right route or were unable to locate themselves, elements of the situation other than map and terrain features became meaningful for them. These results demonstrate that, for novice orienteers, navigation activity must extend beyond navigation as logical, computational way-finding problem to include embodied, social, cultural and situated dimensions.	cognitive dimensions of notations;embodied cognition;enactivism;phenomenological model;situated	Martin Mottet;David W.

We optimized the txt2MEDLINE search technique by parsing queries for MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) terms and searching MEDLINE for articles containing these terms in their titles or abstracts. We compared our results to the existing txt2MEDLINE tool by compiling benchmark queries from low-income and low-middle-income countries, and asking doctors and nurses with practice experience in low-resource areas to evaluate them. The median scores on a 5-point Likert scale were 2.9 for the existing txt2MEDLINE vs. 3.8 for the modified version (p=0.015). This reached our predefined criterion for clinical significance, a difference of 0.5 standard deviations. Improving this technology could improve clinical information resources in the world's most medically underserved communities.	abstract summary;benchmark (computing);clinical decision support system;community;decision support techniques;internet access;medline;optimizing compiler;parsing	Lincoln Sheets;Fang Liu;Raymond Francis Sarmiento;Alex Gavino;Paul A.

BACKGROUND Auditory and tactile cuing provides an effective means of improving both the speed and accuracy of participants' performance in a variety of laboratory-based visual target detection and identification tasks.   METHOD A low-fidelity air traffic simulation task was used in which participants monitored and controlled aircraft.The participants had to ensure that the aircraft landed or exited at the correct altitude, speed, and direction and that they maintained a safe separation from all other aircraft and boundaries. The performance measures recorded included en route time, handoff delay, and conflict resolution delay (the performance measure of interest). In a baseline condition, the aircraft in conflict was highlighted in red (visual cue), and in the experimental conditions, this standard visual cue was accompanied by a simultaneously presented auditory, vibrotactile, or audiotactile cue.   RESULTS Participants responded significantly more rapidly, but no less accurately, to conflicts when presented with an additional auditory or audiotactile cue than with either a vibrotactile or visual cue alone.   CONCLUSION Auditory and audiotactile cues have the potential for improving operator performance by reducing the time it takes to detect and respond to potential visual target events.   APPLICATION These results have important implications for the design and use of multisensory cues in air traffic management.	area striata structure;baseline (configuration management);cuedc2 gene;conflict (psychology);optic nerve glioma, childhood;simulation	Mary K.

We outline the current use and adequacy for CLTR of such resources, focusing on the participants and experiments performed in the CLEF 2000 evaluation. Our discussion is based on a survey conducted on the CLEF participants, as well as the descriptions of their systems that can be found in the present volume. We also discuss how the usefulness of the CLEF evaluation campaign could be enhanced by including additional tasks which would make it possible to distinguish between the effect on the results of the resources used by the participating systems, on the one hand, and the retrieval strategies employed, on the other.	cross-language information retrieval;database;dictionary;document retrieval;emoticon;experiment;information retrieval;lexical analysis;machine translation;mined;parallel text;snapshot (computer storage);text corpus;vocabulary	Julio Gonzalo	2000		10.1007/3-540-44645-1_4	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;database;information retrieval	NLP	-34.64314829950879	-63.551350456017644	65065

7117cc378b43fe6aa203a86e95f4cbf208edb8b0	a model for predicting utilization of mhealth interventions in low-resource settings: case of maternal and newborn care in kenya	behaviour science;design science;fit;predictive modeling;self-efficacy;short message service (sms);structural equation modeling;utilization;mhealth	BACKGROUND In low-resource settings, there are numerous socioeconomic challenges such as poverty, inadequate facilities, shortage of skilled health workers, illiteracy and cultural barriers that contribute to high maternal and newborn deaths. To address these challenges, there are several mHealth projects particularly in Sub-Sahara Africa seeking to exploit opportunities provided by over 90% rate of mobile penetration. However, most of these interventions have failed to justify their value proposition to inspire utilization in low-resource settings.   METHODS This study proposes a theoretical model named Technology, Individual, Process-Fit (TIPFit) suitable for user-centred evaluation of intervention designs to predict utilization of mHealth products in low-resource settings. To investigate the predictive power of TIPFit model, we operationalized its latent constructs into variables used to predict utilization of an mHealth prototype called mamacare. The study employed single-group repeated measures quasi-experiment in which a random sample of 79 antenatal and postnatal patients were recruited from a rural hospital. During the study conducted between May and October 2014, the treatment involved sending and receiving SMS alerts on vital signs, appointments, safe delivery, danger signs, nutrition, preventive care and adherence to medication.   RESULTS Measurements taken during the study were cleaned and coded for analysis using statistical models like Partial Least Squares (PLS), Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (RM-ANOVA), and Bonferroni tests. After analyzing 73 pretest responses, the model predicted 80.2% fit, and 63.9% likelihood of utilization. However, results obtained from initial post-test taken after three months demonstrated 69.1% fit, and utilization of 50.5%. The variation between prediction and the actual outcome necessitated improvement of mamacare based on feedback obtained from users. Three months later, we conducted the second post-test that recorded further drop in fit from 69.1 to 60.3% but utilization marginally improved from 50.5 to 53.7%.   CONCLUSIONS Despite variations between the pretest and post-test outcomes, the study demonstrates that predictive approach to user-centred design offers greater flexibility in aligning design attributes of an mHealth intervention to fulfill user needs and expectations. These findings provide a unique contribution for decision makers because it is possible to prioritize investments among competing digital health projects.	cessation of life;cleaning (activity);epilepsies, partial;hospitals, rural;infant, newborn;investments;latent variable;mhealth;name;partial least squares regression;patients;prototype;random sampling;sms 201-995;sample variance;seventy nine;statistical model;theory;user-centered design	Stephen Mburu;Robert Oboko	2018		10.1186/s12911-018-0649-z	poverty;knowledge management;functional illiteracy;environmental health;socioeconomic status;mhealth;health services research;self-efficacy;health informatics;medicine;psychological intervention	HCI	-62.70538255654473	-62.72383307265221	65312

The potential importance of human affect during human – computer interaction (HCI) is becoming increasingly well recognised. However, measuring and analysing affective behaviour is problematic. Physiological indicators reveal only some, sometimes ambiguous information. Video analysis and existing coding schemes are notoriously lengthy and complex, and examine only certain aspects of affect. This paper describes the development of a practical methodology to assess user affect, as displayed by emotional expressions. Interaction analysis techniques were used to identify discrete affective messages 'affectemes' and their components. This paper explains the rationale for this approach and demonstrates how it can be applied in practice. Preliminary evidence for its efficacy and reliability is also presented.	design rationale;human–computer interaction;primary source	Lesley Axelrod;Kate S.

Researchers have validated their work using ad hoc experiments that may not reflect real-world workloads. We illustrate the wide deviation in existing evaluations and present an evaluation framework designed to validate the next decade of research in this field. Our comparison of 9 state-of-the-art keyword search systems contradicts the retrieval effectiveness purported by existing evaluations and reinforces the need for standardized evaluation. Our results also suggest that there remains considerable room for improvement in this field. We found that many techniques cannot scale to even moderately-sized datasets that contain roughly a million tuples. Given that existing databases are considerably larger than this threshold, our results motivate the creation of new algorithms and indexing techniques that scale to meet both current and future workloads.	database;experiment;hoc (programming language);search algorithm;web search engine	Joel Coffman;Alfred C.

This can be modelled as the outcome of a feedback system that accumulates experience. In this paper we investigate such a feedback system, following an iterative research approach. A feedback loop is specified that is detailed using contemporary ideas on human behaviour. The resulting model is investigated in an empirical study. Finally, we consider a computational mechanism to explain the results. This approach is aimed at understanding how a feedback mechanism might work rather than at observing its outcomes. In this paper, we study the approach through adjustments in card selections in a game consisting of repeated card choices. Playing this game, participants do not know what rules determine gains and losses. Therefore there is some tension between exploring the options and achieving immediate profit. To decide in such situations it is argued that often evaluations below the level of conscious awareness, such as affect, play an important role. The results support the hypothesis that participants would draw better cards as the game progressed. There is some evidence that emotions are involved, since the hypothesis that profit and emotions are correlated is confirmed. Further evidence that formal logic is not sufficient follows from the observed effects of music on card selections. In the second part of the paper the aim is to understand the results from a computational point of view. Four possible ways of integrating feedback into a decision criterion are compared. Using one of these mechanisms, a computational model is investigated that might describe the role of music in card selection. Although there are limitations to both the empirical and computational findings, the chosen approach indicates that computational modelling of experiential appraisal, at a preconscious level, and the effect of external factors, such as music, is in principle feasible, and can lead to a research agenda aimed at understanding such phenomena.	computational model;feedback;iterative method;model of computation	Arnout R.

Many avoidable shortcomings in the health sector that result in poor quality are due to inaccessible data, information, and knowledge. A national health information infrastructure (NHII) offers the connectivity and knowledge management essential to correct these shortcomings. Better health and a better health system are within our reach.   DISCUSSION A national health information infrastructure for the United States should address the needs of personal health management, health care delivery, public health, and research. It should also address relevant global dimensions (e.g., standards for sharing data and knowledge across national boundaries). The public and private sectors will need to collaborate to build a robust national health information infrastructure, essentially a 'paperless' health care system, for the United States. The federal government should assume leadership for assuring a national health information infrastructure as recommended by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. Progress is needed in the areas of funding, incentives, standards, and continued refinement of a privacy (i.e., confidentiality and security) framework to facilitate personal identification for health purposes. Particular attention should be paid to NHII leadership and change management challenges.   SUMMARY A national health information infrastructure is a necessary step for improved health in the U.S. It will require a concerted, collaborative effort by both public and private sectors.	advisory committees;confidentiality;delivery of health care;editorial;federal government;global serializability;health information exchange;health services;knowledge management;manuscripts;privacy;refinement (computing);steen rasmussen;citation;standards characteristics	Don E.

3b94d9bf7bd5bd4b093e7c6d41c13c0eb6e38a1d	electronic prescribing: criteria for evaluating hand-held prescribing systems and an evaluation of a new, hand-held, wireless wide area network (wwan) prescribing system	biomedical research;text mining;bioinformatics	OBJECTIVE The objectives of this study were: 1) to establish criteria for evaluating handheld computerized prescribing systems; and 2) to evaluate out-of-box performance and features of a new, Palm Operating System (OS)-based, handheld, wireless wide area network (WWAN) prescribing system. The system consisted of a Palm Vx handheld organizer, a Novatel Minstrel V wireless modem, OmniSky wireless internet access and ePhysician ePad 1.1, the Palm OS electronic prescribing software program.   DESIGN A dermatologist familiar with healthcare information technology conducted an evaluation of the performance and features of a new, handheld, WWAN electronic prescribing system in an office practice during a three-month period in 2000. System performance, defined as transmission success rate, was determined from data collected during the three-month trial. Evaluation criteria consisted of an analysis of features found in electronic prescribing systems.   METHODS All prescriptions written for all patients seen during a three-month period (August - November, 2000) were eligible for inclusion. Prescriptions written for patients who intended to fill them at pharmacies without known facsimile receiving capabilities were excluded from the study. The performance of the system was evaluated using data collected during the study. Criteria for evaluating features of electronic prescribing systems were developed and used to analyze the system employed in this study.   RESULTS During this three-month trial, 200 electronic prescriptions were generated for 132 patients included in the study. Of these prescriptions, 92.5 percent were successfully transmitted to pharmacies. Transmission failures resulted from incorrect facsimile numbers and non-functioning facsimile machines. Criteria established for evaluation of electronic prescribing systems included System (Hardware & Software), Costs, System Features, Printing & Transmission, Formulary & Insurance, Customization, Drug Safety and Security.   CONCLUSION This study is the first effort to establish comprehensive criteria for evaluating handheld prescribing systems and to evaluate the performance and features of a handheld, electronic prescribing system. The results demonstrated that the evaluated system: 1) was simple to install; 2) successfully interfaced with a commonly used practice management system; 3) was user-friendly and easy to operate; 4) offered a robust variety of standard features; and, 5) resulted in a high rate of success for transmitting electronic prescriptions. The criteria established for the evaluation of features of an electronic prescribing system can be used to critically evaluate the performance and features of other handheld and personal computer-based electronic prescribing systems.	computer program;electronic prescribing;electronic organizer;exclusion;facsimile machine;formulary (model document);handheld game console;hypothalamic area, lateral;internet access;mobile broadband modem;modem device component;operating system;out of the box (feature);palm os;patients;personal computer;pharmacy facility;portable electronic apps;printing;transmitter;usability;disease transmission	Orin M.

Therefore, we developed a rule-based expert system (LabScanner) that analyzes clinical laboratory drug concentration data from a laboratory information system to identify a subset ofpatients enriched in those who could benefit from expert follow-up.' LabScanner identifies patients based on four rule categories that detect variability, frequency, value and trend patterns, respectively, in clinical laboratory data.

For instance, concepts for the terms """"paroxysmal cough"""" and """"nocturnal cough"""" might be aggregated in a kidney disease study, but should be left separate in a pneumonia study. Determining whether two concepts are similar enough to be aggregated can help build better datasets for data mining purposes and avoid signal dilution. Quantifying the similarity among concepts is a difficult task, however, in part because such similarity is context-dependent. We propose a comprehensive method, which computes a similarity score for a concept pair by combining data-driven and ontology-driven knowledge. We demonstrate our method on concepts from SNOMED-CT and on a corpus of clinical notes of patients with chronic kidney disease. By combining information from usage patterns in clinical notes and from ontological structure, the method can prune out concepts that are simply related from those which are semantically similar. When evaluated against a list of concept pairs annotated for similarity, our method reaches an AUC (area under the curve) of 92%."""	aggregate data;area under curve;body of uterus;ct scan;chronic kidney diseases;context-sensitive language;coughing;data mining;knowledge-based systems;note (document);ontology;open research;patients;pneumonia;prunes;systematized nomenclature of medicine	Rimma Pivovarov;Noémie Elhadad	2012	Journal of biomedical informatics	10.1016/j.jbi.2012.01.002	natural language processing;semantic similarity;integral;systematized nomenclature of medicine;computer science;bioinformatics;ontology;artificial intelligence;nursing;machine learning;snomed ct;data mining;database;semantics;information retrieval;dishin	AI	-48.051687207954465	-67.41506715476166	66060

Internet and Social Media can be used to promote a prudent use of antibiotics.   OBJECTIVE To establish the extent of Internet and Social Media use to search for antibiotic related information and the potential implications in health care among adult population in Italy.   METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 2017, among a sample of parents of public school students. A 2-stage cluster sample design was planned. An informed consent form and a questionnaire were given to selected students to deliver to their parents. The questionnaire included questions on knowledge, attitudes, and behavior toward antibiotic use, and questions about Internet use to gather information about antibiotics.   RESULTS A total of 913 parents completed the questionnaire, with a 67.4% response rate; 22.1% did not know when it was appropriate to use antibiotics. 32.3% of parents reported self-medication with antibiotics. 73.4% of respondents used the Internet to search for information about antibiotic use. Among social networks users, 46.5% reported the use of these media to get information about antibiotics and 45% of instant messaging app users share information about antibiotics. The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Internet use to search for antibiotic-related information was higher among females, younger subjects, with a higher level of education, in those who reported self-medication with antibiotics and in those who needed additional information on side effects of antibiotics from the GP compared with those who did not need any additional information. Internet use was significantly less likely in participants with cardiovascular diseases and cancer compared with those without chronic conditions, and in those who reported to strongly agree/agree, or were uncertain about antibiotic use without a GP prescription, compared with those who reported to be disagree/strongly disagree.   CONCLUSIONS Internet and social media are widely used for antibiotic-related information seeking in the Italian population. Health organizations must consider social media within their communication strategy to promote the appropriate Web use for antibiotic-related information seeking in the general population, although more evidence is needed regarding the optimal mix of communication interventions.	attitude;cardiovascular diseases;consent forms;cross-sectional studies;cross-sectional data;information seeking;instant messaging;internet;logistic regression;patient self-report;self medication;social media;social network	Rossella Zucco;Francesco Lavano;Rosa Anfosso;Aida Bianco;Claudia Pileggi;Maria Pavia	2018	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.12.005	response rate (survey);knowledge management;informed consent;health care;the internet;population;social network;family medicine;medicine;information seeking;social media	HCI	-62.34216945311526	-64.78290164167713	66100

The purpose of our research is to refine this idea by exploring how different aspects of the user model are salient for different question types. Our methodology follows tradition in studying real intermediary elicitations for clues about what aspects of the user model are important, except that we analyze how this differs across question types. We find that there are more elicitations about the background of the user’s task and about the relevance of particular information for longer-answer questions than for short-answer questions, but surprisingly, no more elicitations regarding the sufficiency of particular information. The practical application of our research is to guide human or automated respondents to focus on the user details that are most important for different types of question.	relevance;user modeling	David Bodoff	2012				NLP	-40.28974846437637	-55.88143800132369	66109
8c6dd009bac650f376e160083560d6c251efcfd2	constructing consumer-oriented medical terminology from the web a supervised classifier ensemble approach		Increasingly, people turn to the Web for health related questions and even medical advice. Despite this rising demand, it remains non-trivial to access reliable consumer-oriented medical information for self-diagnosis, especially when presenting with multiple symptoms. In this project, we apply information extraction techniques to build a relational graph database of clinical entities, visualising and retrieving the relationships between symptoms and conditions. Since there are no readily available taxonomies on consumer-oriented medical terminology, accuracy of the classification is of paramount importance. To ensure medical terms on the Internet can be reliably classified into proper semantic categories, we develop a method to identify best performed classifiers across multiple feature sets, and assess the effectiveness of combining these features using ensemble learning techniques. Experiment results confirm that the classifier ensemble, when intelligently configured, can provide significant increases in performance. An interactive web-based graph interface and a mobile app are developed to demonstrate the potential use of this consumer-oriented terminology.	machine learning	Wei Liu;Harrison J.

5df6dfa1e56853be0264e0afc3116cc2ba591bd8	introduction and overview		The overall aim of this book is to set out the main changes needed in the field of economic and regulatory conditions as a consequence of these rapid developments in oncology. The traditional approaches of health economics, like health economic evaluation, health technology assessment (HTA), modeling methods, assessing value, pricing techniques, are bound to be altered in the contributions to this book. It is understandable that with the life-threatening diagnosis of cancer the new treatment options need to be accompanied by the best available health economic tools. This pertains to well-implemented decision rules concerning willingness to pay, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio thresholds, equity, patient access, end of life criteria, etc. Their application differs with regard to the usual health economic analyzes implemented in other treatment areas. Overstating a bit one could ask whether we need a strongly modified concept of oncology economics?		Willian Bill Rouse;Kenneth R. Boff;Penelope M.

While textual data can be easily de-identified, patient data in medical images implies a more elaborate approach. In this work we present a solution for sensitive word identification in medical images based on a combination of two machine-learning models, achieving a F1-score of 0.94. Three experts evaluated the system performance. They analyzed the output of the present methodology and categorized the studies in three groups: studies that had their sensitive words removed (true positive), studies with complete patient identity (false negative) and studies with mistakenly removed data (false positive). The experts were unanimous regarding the relevance of the present tool in collaborative medical environments, as it may improve the exchange of anonymized patient data between institutions.	categorization;dicom;de-identification;digital imaging and communications in medicine (dicom);f1 score;machine learning;medical imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);outline of object recognition;patients;pixel;preprocessor;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;text corpus;anonymized	Eriksson J.

We investigated why individuals respond this way. In Study 1, participants judged that identity would change more after changes to memories and widely shared moral beliefs (e.g., about murder) versus preferences and controversial moral beliefs (e.g., about abortion). The extent to which participants judged that changes would affect their relationships predicted identity change (Study 2) and mediated the relationship between type of moral belief and perceived identity change (Study 3). We discuss the role that social relationships play in judgments of identity and highlight implications for psychology and philosophy.	identity change;judgment;philosophy;psychology	Larisa Heiphetz;Nina Strohminger;Liane Young	2017	Cognitive science	10.1111/cogs.12354	psychology;cognitive psychology;social cognition;sociology;social psychology;cognitive science	HCI	-52.271780020155575	-53.57716699188009	66680

This tool - MetaMap (and its java version MMTx) has been used extensively for biomedical text mining applications. We have developed a module for MetaMap which has a high performance in terms of processing speed. We evaluated our module independently against MetaMap for the task of identifying UMLS concepts in free text clinical radiology reports. A set of 1000 sentences from neuro-radiology reports were collected and processed using our technique and the MMTx Program. An evaluation showed that our technique was able to identify 91% of the concepts found by MMTx in 14% of the time taken by MMTx. An error analysis showed that the missing concepts were largely those which were not direct lexical matches but inferential matches of multiple concepts. Our method also identified multi-phrase concepts which MMTx failed to identify. We suggest that this module be implemented as an option in MMTx for real-time text mining applications where single concepts found in the UMLS need to be identified.

Although CPGs gather all evidence available on concrete medical problems, their direct application has been proved to have some limitations. One of these limitations occurs when they have to be applied on co-morbid patients suffering from several simultaneous and mutually related diseases. In such cases, health-care professionals have to follow the indications of multiple CPGs and solve their interactions as they appear in the treatment of concrete patients. Clinical Algorithms (CA) are schematic models of the procedures appearing in a CPG. They are used to organize and summarize the recommendations contained in CPGs. Here, we extend a knowledge-based algorithm to merge CAs with a machine learning procedure to relax the knowledge dependence of that algorithm. The resulting algorithm has been tested on health-care date provided by the SAGESSA Group on hypertension patients. The results obtained prove that it is a good approach to the generation of CA from data though several improvements at the levels of prediction and medical interpretation are possible.	algorithm;central pattern generator;heart rate variability;interaction;machine learning;refinement (computing);schematic	Francis Real;David Riaño	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03262-2_2	knowledge base;medicine;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data mining;procedural knowledge;health care	ML	-52.54912420564965	-67.83018868775905	66866

However, few studies address the antecedent factors of physicians' intentions to use EMR exchange. Based on institutional trust and perceived risk integrated with the decomposed theory of planned behavior (TPB) model, we propose a theoretical model to explain the intention of physicians to use an EMR exchange system.   METHODS We conducted a field survey in Taiwan to collect data from physicians who had experience using the EMR exchange systems. A valid sample of 191 responses was collected for data analysis. To test the proposed research model, we employed structural equation modeling using the partial least squares method.   RESULTS The study findings show that the following five factors have a significant influence on the physicians' intentions to use EMR exchange systems: (a) attitude; (b) subjective norm; (c) perceived behavior control; (d) institutional trust; and (e) perceived risk. These five factors are predictable by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and compatibility, interpersonal and governmental influence, facilitating conditions and self-efficacy, situational normality and structural assurance, and institutional trust, respectively. The results also indicate that institutional trust and perceived risk integrated with the decomposed TPB model improve the prediction of physician's intentions to use EMR exchange.   CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that our research model effectively predicts the intention of physicians to use EMR exchange, and provides valuable implications for academics and practitioners.

Annotating emotion tags is known to suffer from problems with instability. These are caused by the lack of non-linguistic expressions (e.g. speech and facial expressions) in the text dialog. We aimed to construct a stable, usable text-dialog corpus with emotion tags. We first focused on facial expression in comics. Some comics contain many text dialogs that are similar to everyday conversation, and it is worth analyzing their text. We therefore extracted 29,538 sentences from 10 comic books and annotated face tags and emotion tags. Two annotators independently placed “temporary face/emotion tags” on stories and then decided what the “correct face/emotion tags” were by discussing them with each other. They acquired 16,635 correct emotion tags as a result. We evaluated the stability and usability of the corpus. We evaluated the correspondence between temporary and correct tags to assess stability, and found precision was 83.8% and recall was 78.8%. These were higher than for annotation without facial expressions (precision = 56.2%, recall = 51.5%). We extracted emotional suffix expressions from the corpus using a probabilistic method to evaluate usability. We could thus construct a text-dialog corpus with emotion tags and confirm its stability and usability.

ba4e044343ffc60f16742d1608d7d150b782517e	interpreting data of serious games for health using decision support systems		In order to empower the influence and usage of Serious Games for Health (SGFH) in science as well as application, a decision-support-system (DSS) based approach for interpreting game data should be developed. This DSS would allow users (patients, physicians) to interpret medical data, gathered by various serious games, as well as the game-scores of these games. The usage of DSSs implies the requirement for a standardized data model, for both medical data as well as game-proprietary data, such as meta-data or game-scores. This publication presents a framework proposal, which covers the requirements to interpret data of various health- and game-sources and create recommendations to users. Authors identified challenges and experiments to be done: to provide a ubiquitous data model for SGFH, a set of existing games will be analysed and evaluated. Further, a SDK for game developers will be created. This would enable the developers to gain access to the DSS based approach with reasonable effort. Finally, a DSS, consisting of two sub-DSS, should be implemented on top of the previous results.	decision support system	Konrad Peters;Fares Kayali;Marisa Silbernagl;Anita Lawitschka;Helmut Hlavacs	2017	Int.

In this study, we proposed a method to apply an institutional clinical data warehouse (CDW) to address this issue in a real-world setting. A case-control study was conducted by using the CDW in Osaka University Hospital from 2000/01/01/-2005/12/31. We randomly selected the steady-state outpatients who were under warfarin mono-therapy as Group A and those who were on the pre-existing warfarin therapy but with only the added medication X as Group B. The difference between the PT-INR values on one-month interval in Group A and those before and after taking medication X for one month in Group B was compared. The warfarin-Allopurinol interaction was illustrated as one example. We identified 25 cases in Group A and 15 cases in Group B respectively. The difference of the PT-INR values on one-month interval between the two groups was not significant (P=0.394,Mann-Whitney test), indicating that no warfarin- Allopurinol interaction was present. This method can be used as an alternative approach to assess drugwarfarin interactions.

15a6051a7d6a1ac40b8f93b269c1f377199f0dea	the prevalence of using social media among healthcare professionals in saudi arabia: a pilot study		Keeping up-to-date with new health information is a necessity for healthcare professionals. Today, social media platforms such as Twitter, among others, are important sources for healthcare professionals. Within the Arab world, little is known about how healthcare professionals use social media to update their healthcare information. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of healthcare professionals, primarily physicians, in seeking online health information in Saudi Arabia. We conducted a web-based survey among Twitter participants between February 1 and March 10, 2015. The primary outcome measures were the self-reported rates of Twitter use, perceived effects, and the influence of Twitter information on clinical practice. Our results revealed that the prevalence rate of physician's seeking online health information was 79% (n=166); the majority of them (71.4%, n=150) reported that Twitter had a significant impact in increasing their medical knowledge and in improving their clinical practice. Over half of the survey participates reported the need for investment in establishing trustworthy and credible health Twitter accounts. The participants reported that their preference for social media health accounts that focus on women's health, non-communicable disease and psychotherapy (20%, 18.1% and 14.5% respectively). The findings showed clearly that seeking web-based medical information through social media is popular among physicians, in general, but especially among younger physicians in Saudi Arabia. The study findings indicate to the necessity for further research on designing and implementing a national social media based educational outreach program to provide evidence-based healthcare information and improve healthcare providers' knowledge and skills in Saudi Arabia.	crew resource management, healthcare;seventy nine;social media;trust (emotion);web application;women's health	Sarah Almaiman;Salwa Bahkali;Ali Al Farhan;Samera Bamuhair;Mowafa Said Househ;Khaled Alsurimi	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-538-8-263	social media;health care;medicine;nursing	HCI	-62.19722130007584	-63.08091374963914	67458
3b7e4d98c30c060ebc3a925c668185714ce5016b	comparing different knowledge sources for the automatic summarization of biomedical literature	biomedical knowledge sources;automatic summarization;unified medical language system;semantic graph	OBJECTIVE Automatic summarization of biomedical literature usually relies on domain knowledge from external sources to build rich semantic representations of the documents to be summarized. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the knowledge source used on the quality of the summaries that are generated.   MATERIALS AND METHODS We present a method for representing a set of documents relevant to a given biological entity or topic as a semantic graph of domain concepts and relations. Different graphs are created by using different combinations of ontologies and vocabularies within the UMLS (including GO, SNOMED-CT, HUGO and all available vocabularies in the UMLS) to retrieve domain concepts, and different types of relationships (co-occurrence and semantic relations from the UMLS Metathesaurus and Semantic Network) are used to link the concepts in the graph. The different graphs are next used as input to a summarization system that produces summaries composed of the most relevant sentences from the original documents.   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Our experiments demonstrate that the choice of the knowledge source used to model the text has a significant impact on the quality of the automatic summaries. In particular, we find that, when summarizing gene-related literature, using GO, SNOMED-CT and HUGO to extract domain concepts results in significantly better summaries than using all available vocabularies in the UMLS. This finding suggests that successful biomedical summarization requires the selection of the appropriate knowledge source, whose coverage, specificity and relations must be in accordance to the type of the documents to summarize.

Radiologists could interpret PET images more effectively if they were able to share their PET expertise. To realize this goal, our recent efforts have designed a PET information model that represents the process of interpreting PET images; we have implemented the Whole-Body PET Database (WB-PET DB). The PET information model defines the WB-PET DB schema. WB-PET DB stores findings along with a region of interest (ROI), thereby allowing ROI image retrieval by keys that radiologists use when writing findings. Regarding WB-PET DB, we have shown its conceptual model in recent works, but have revealed little about its system architecture. In this study, we designed and implemented the WB-PET DB System. This system contains the user interface to insert ROI into WB-PET DB and the component that outputs results of retrieval. This component outputs them in a DICOM file format; thereby users can view stored ROIs using 3D visualization software such as AmiraTM. Results of this study demonstrated a model to retrieve an image of body functionality as a PET image.	ct scan;color balance;dicom;database;image retrieval;information model;interpretation (logic);legacy system;polyethylene terephthalate;prototype;radiology;region of interest;systems architecture;tomography;user interface;visualization software	Kazunori Sunako;Tetsuya Ishie;Masaru Ueda;Takashi Tomii	2005	21st International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW'05)	10.1109/ICDE.2005.234	computer vision;visualization;image retrieval;computer science;multimedia;user interface;computer graphics (images)	DB	-51.13021024833942	-62.15235802909893	67588

In this research, Kinect depth images are being used to capture shadow-like images of the patient and their room to resolve concerns about patients' privacy. As a result of our previous research, a fall detection system has been developed and installed in hospital rooms, and fall alarms are generated if any falls are detected by the system. Then nurses will go through the stored depth videos to investigate for possible injury as well as the reasons and events that may have caused the patient's fall to prevent future occurrences. This paper proposes a novel web application to ease the process of search and reviewing the videos by means of new visualization techniques to highlight video frames that contain potential risk of fall based on our previous research.	accidental falls;digital video;extraction;frame (physical object);imagery;kinect;media controls;patients;review [publication type];sensor;thumbnail;used quit cigarette smoking videos;user interface device component;web application;web framework;algorithm;videocassette	Moein Enayati;Tanvi Banerjee;Mihail Popescu;Marjorie Skubic;Marilyn Rantz	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944626	simulation;medicine;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;multimedia;computer security	Robotics	-56.460356192046866	-58.622135797746786	67820

Understanding how learning occurs in OSNs is necessary to better support this type of learning. Through a cross-sectional survey, this study found that learning interaction in OSNs is low in general, with a small number of active users. Some health professionals actively used OSNs to support their practice, including sharing practical and experiential knowledge, benchmarking themselves, and to keep up-to-date on policy, advanced information and news in the field. These health professionals had an overall positive learning experience in OSNs.	cross reactions;cross-sectional data;phobia, social;social network	Xin Li;Karin M.

The aim of this study is to improve indexing by gaining knowledge about users preferred search terms. One clip is from a news program, and two clips come from a literature program. The search terms are categorized according to The Panofsky-Shatford mode/facet matrix. The study shows that specific search terms like named entities are used the most for both genres, and that generic and abstract terms are more important in the literature clips than the news clip. The search terms provided by users were matched with text from the subtitles from the clip, and the results showed that 17%, 32% and 40% of the terms were found for literature clip 1, literature clip 2 and news clip respectively. The percentage was higher when the terms were matched with subtitles from the whole program, and would have been even higher if additional on-screen text was included.	archive;categorization;named entity	Anne-Stine Ruud Husevåg	2017		10.1145/3020165.3022143	computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-33.74973795966649	-62.374691889278836	67886

Shared-control guidance is distinct from more traditional guidance controllers, such as virtual fixtures, in that it provides novices with real-time visual and haptic feedback from a real or virtual expert. Previous studies have shown varying levels of training efficacy using shared-control guidance paradigms; it is hypothesized that these mixed results are due to interactions between specific guidance implementations (“paradigms”) and tasks. This work proposes a novel guidance paradigm taxonomy intended to help classify and compare the multitude of implementations in the literature, as well as a revised proxy rendering model to allow for the implementation of more complex guidance paradigms. The efficacies of four common paradigms are compared in a controlled study with 50 healthy subjects and two dynamic tasks. The results show that guidance paradigms must be matched to a task's dynamic characteristics to elicit effective training and low workload. Based on these results, we provide suggestions for the future development of improved haptic guidance paradigms.	advance directive - proxy;controllers;haptic device component;haptic technology;interaction;missile guidance;programming paradigm;real-time locating system;revision procedure;taxonomy;virtual fixture	Dane Powell;Marcia Kilchenman O'Malley	2012	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2012.40	robot;dynamics;text mining;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia;force	Visualization	-44.39290748805393	-52.30766133907136	67890

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a special type of exocortex used to interact with the environment via neural signals. Uses for BCI range from medical applications and rehabilitation to operation of assistive devices. They can also be used for marketing, gaming, and for entertainment, where BCIs are used to provide users with a more personalized experience. BCI-enabled technology carries great potential to improve and enhance the quality of human lives. This technology, however, is not without risk. The article addresses a specific class of privacy issues, brain spyware, shown to be feasible against currently available non-invasive BCIs. To help us understand the severity of potential privacy threats when BCIs are being used, and to inform development of possible prevention strategies, we turn to Value Sensitive Design, a systematic approach to accounting for human values in technology design. Influenced by Value Sensitive Design (VSD) and by Norbert Wiener's computer ethics work, we propose a set of principles regarding appropriate use of exocortex.	assistive technology;brain–computer interface;cognition;cybernetics;exocortex;high- and low-level;microsoft visio;personalization;privacy;spyware;value (ethics);value sensitive design;wearable computer	Tamara Bonaci;Jeffrey Herron;Charles Matlack;Howard Jay Chizeck	2014	2014 IEEE Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century (21CW)	10.1109/MTS.2015.2461152	brain–computer interface;stakeholder;cybernetics;human–computer interaction;feature extraction;computer science;information security;data mining;privacy;computer security	HCI	-57.071399586147855	-56.77651538119872	67918

OBJECTIVES To investigate the relationship between provider characteristics and their response to medication alerts in the outpatient setting.   DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective observational study using a prescription log from the automated electronic outpatient system for each of 478 providers using the system at primary care practices affiliated with 2 teaching hospitals, from 2009 to 2011 for six types of alerts. Provider characteristics were obtained from the hospital credentialing system and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine.   MAIN MEASURES Override rates per 100 prescriptions and 100 alerts.   RESULTS The providers' mean override rates per 100 prescriptions and per 100 alerts were 0.52 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.46-0.58) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.38-0.44) respectively. The physicians (n=422) on average overrode drug alerts with rates of 0.48 per 100 drugs and 0.44 per 100 warnings. Univariate analysis revealed that six physician characteristics (physician type, age, number of encounters, medical school ranking, residency hospital ranking, and acceptance of Medicaid) were significantly related to the override rate. Multiple regression showed that house staff were more likely to override than staff physicians (p<0.001), physicians with fewer than 13 average daily encounters were more likely to override than others with more than 13 encounters (p (range), <0.001-0.05), and graduates of the top 5 medical schools were more likely to override than the others (p=0.04). All six predictors together explained 30% and 50% of the variance in override rates, respectively.   CONCLUSIONS Consideration of six specific physician characteristics may help inform interventions to improve prescriber decision-making.		Insook Cho;Sarah Patricia Slight;Karen C. Nanji;Diane L.

Then, we suggest and discuss dedicated systems exploiting intelligent environments to support physical and mental health, prevent falls and alert, multiply social contacts, and ensure self-esteem. Besides, proper design of arbitrary services must incorporate safety, integration, variability, senses, acceptance, and memory. Our most significant contribution is to provide the first overview of older adults' specific needs in intelligent environments.	cognition;heart rate variability;intelligent environment;word sense	Sébastien Duval;Christian Hoareau;Hiromichi Hashizume	2008	22nd International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Workshops (aina workshops 2008)	10.1109/WAINA.2008.99	intelligent network;mental health;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;user interface;informatics;ubiquitous computing;intelligent sensor	Robotics	-58.43731892530552	-54.44959867798842	68053

In this paper eye-movement analysis has been used for understanding the mechanism of visual search of drivers. For the aim, two experiments in which the subjects drove the driving simulators have been conducted. We analyzed the relationship between the eye movement of drivers and the characteristics of their front scenes while driving in driving conditions. In the first experiment it was confirmed that the frequency of saccade became higher and fixation time became shorter in case of the turn event condition among three driving events, where the pixel difference extracted as the visual information from the driver's front scene became larger. In the second experiment the same relationship between the characteristics of eye movements and the driver's front scenes were confirmed by considering the three driving events, running straight, turning corners at a crossing and prediction task of hazard in the urban course. The pixel difference of the driver's front scene influenced the eye movements while driving. These results of experiments about driver's cognitive processing while driving suggested that eye movements depends on the amount of information contained in the front scene defined by the pixel difference.	cognition;device driver;driving simulator;experiment;pixel;simulation	Tetsuya Miyoshi;Hidetoshi Nakayasu	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)	10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007706	safety engineering;computer vision;simulation;cognition;visualization;visual search;visual perception;hazard;visual servoing;eye movement;computer graphics (images)	Vision	-46.35306692911076	-53.047601796342626	68118

This population is under-represented in healthcare research and have health inequalities relative to most people. The work discussed here concerns how to adapt research processes to suit people with these difficulties when developing smartphone apps to give access to health promotion information, an area in which health inequalities arise. Strategies are identified to assist participants to understand the proposed area of work, to give consent to participation and be involved with activities such as evaluation. A combination of adaptations is proposed to engage people who would otherwise be excluded. It is clear that strategies used to make research participation accessible can assist people with cognitive and communication impairments to influence and inform the development of technology for their use.	mhealth;mobile app;smartphone	John L.

These databases provide an excellent opportunity for the application of statistical text analysis techniques to infer useful quantitative information about how funding patterns have changed over time. In this paper we analyze data from the National Cancer Institute (part of National Institutes of Health) and show how text classification techniques provide a useful starting point for analyzing how funding for cancer research has evolved over the past 20 years in the United States.	database;document classification;ibm notes;linear discriminant analysis;scientific literature;software documentation;topic model	Jihyun Park;Margaret Blume-Kohout;Ralf Krestel;Eric T.

3384fd01a8c31eb647fbbb9bd801005403deaf88	erratum to: using immersive virtual reality and anatomically correct computer-generated characters in the forensic assessment of deviant sexual preferences		Penile plethysmography (PPG) is the gold standard for the assessment of sexual interests, especially among sex offenders of children. Nonetheless, this method faces some ethical limitations inherent to the nature of its stimuli and could benefit from the improvement of its ecological validity. The use of computer-generated characters (CGC) in virtual immersion for PPG assessment might help address these issues. A new application developed to design made-to-measure anatomically correct virtual characters compatible with the Tanner developmental stages is presented. The main purpose of this study was to determine how the virtual reality (VR) modality compares to the standard auditory modality on their capacity to generate sexual arousal profiles and deviance differentials indicative of sexual interests. The erectile responses of 22 sex offenders of children and 42 non-deviant adult males were recorded. While both stimulus modalities generated significantly different genital arousal profiles for sex offenders of children and non-deviant males, deviance differentials calculated from the VR modality allowed for significantly higher classification accuracy. Performing receiver operating characteristic analyses further assessed discriminant potential. Auditory modality yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (SE = 0.059) while CGC in VR yielded an AUC of 0.90 (SE = 0.052). Overall, results suggest that the VR modality allows significantly better group classification accuracy and discriminant validity than audio stimuli, which provide empirical support for the use of this new method for PPG assessment. Additionally, the potential use of VR in interventions pertaining to selfregulation of sexual offending is addressed in conclusion.	brain–computer interface;computer-generated holography;computer-mediated reality;discriminant;distortion;emergence;emotion recognition;facial recognition system;harris affine region detector;homeostasis;hudson;immersion (virtual reality);inline linking;modality (human–computer interaction);modulation;neurofeedback;real-time clock;receiver operating characteristic;simulation;tanner graph;virtual reality;word lists by frequency	Dominique Trottier;Patrice Renaud;Joanne L.

We are interested in a related question: do expert rankings of real-world entities correlate with search engine rankings of corresponding web resources? For example, each year US News & World Report publishes a list of (among others) top 50 graduate business schools. Does their expert ranking correlate with the search engine ranking of the URLs of those business schools? To answer this question we conducted 9 experiments using 8 expert rankings on a range of academic, athletic, financial and popular culture topics. We compared the expert rankings with the rankings in Google, Live Search (formerly MSN) and Yahoo (with list lengths of 10, 25, and 50). In 57 search engine vs. expert comparisons, only 1 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. In 42 inter-search engine comparisons, only 2 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. The correlations appeared to decrease with the size of the lists: the 3 strong correlations were for lists of 10, the 8 moderate correlations were for lists of 25, and no correlations were found for lists of 50.	entity;experiment;search engine optimization;web page;web resource;web search engine	Michael L.

ca07a46c233a279655d54218950d6a8b206e08c7	assessing use of cognitive heuristic representativeness in clinical reasoning		We performed a pilot study to investigate use of the cognitive heuristic Representativeness in clinical reasoning. We tested a set of tasks and assessments to determine whether subjects used the heuristics in reasoning, to obtain initial frequencies of heuristic use and related cognitive errors, and to collect cognitive process data using think-aloud techniques. The study investigates two aspects of the Representativeness heuristic - judging by perceived frequency and representativeness as causal beliefs. Results show that subjects apply both aspects of the heuristic during reasoning, and make errors related to misapplication of these heuristics. Subjects in this study rarely used base rates, showed significant variability in their recall of base rates, demonstrated limited ability to use provided base rates, and favored causal data in diagnosis. We conclude that the tasks and assessments we have developed provide a suitable test-bed to study the cognitive processes underlying heuristic errors.	base rate;causal filter;cognition disorders;evaluation procedure;heart rate variability;mental processes;reasoning - publishing subsection;testbed	Velma L.

But there is widespread dissatisfaction with the technologies that are currently available in the market place. Our hypothesis is that EMR vendors and the market place alone cannot solve the issue of poor technology. We propose an architecture for the next generation of electronic records that solves current concerns of end users and addresses the needs of additional stakeholders, including health system funders, patients, researchers and guideline implementers. By including additional stakeholders, we believe that additional resources, competencies and functionality can be unleashed to solve the larger problems of the current generation of EMRs. The architecture also addresses future requirements that are likely to arise from technological developments such as mobile apps and PHRs and from innovations in medicine, including genomics, artificial intelligence and personalized medicine. The paper makes a call to action for informatics researchers to play a greater role in R&D on EMRs.

In a source identification task, a stimulus was presented from 1 of 20 loudspeakers arrayed in a semicircular arc, and participants stated which loudspeaker emitted the sound. Each participant was tested in 8 conditions involving various combinations of wearing a Kevlar army helmet and two types of earplugs. Testing was conducted at each of 2 orientations (frontal and lateral). In the frontal orientation, overall error was slightly greater in all protected conditions than in the bare-head control condition. In the lateral orientation, overall error score in the protected conditions was substantially and significantly greater than in the bare-head control conditions. Most errors in the lateral orientation were accounted for by front-back confusions, indicating that the protective devices disrupted high-frequency spectral cues that are the basis for discriminating front from back sound sources. The results have practical implications for the use of protective headgear and earplugs in industrial or military environments where localization of critical sounds is important.		Nancy L. Vause;D.

Current approaches that evaluate the effectiveness of aggregated search systems are based on rewarding systems that return highly relevant verticals for a given query, where this relevance is assessed under different assumptions. It is difficult to evaluate or compare those systems without fully understanding the relationship between those underlying assumptions. To address this, we present a formal analysis and a set of extensive user studies to investigate the effects of various assumptions made for assessing query vertical relevance. A total of more than 20,000 assessments on 44 search tasks across 11 verticals are collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk and subsequently analysed. Our results provide insights into various aspects of query vertical relevance and allow us to explain in more depth as well as questioning the evaluation results published in the literature.	amazon mechanical turk;programming paradigm;relevance;the turk;usability testing;web search engine	Ke Zhou;Ronan Cummins;Mounia Lalmas;Joemon M.

The problem of obesity and overweight is caused mainly by an increase in physical inactivity, for which one of the main reasons is the long hours spent every day in front of the TV. The system proposed in this paper targets individuals who are overweight or subjects for whom doctors have prescribed a minimum physical activity. The MPEG-V standard [1] is used in this work in order to control home actuators as a motivation for individuals to transform exercise intention into exercise activity. To evaluate our system, we conducted an experiment with 31 subjects, and the results are promising as they show that our system was successful at motivating subjects to perform physical exercise while watching TV.	home automation;moving picture experts group;television;unintended consequences	Fedwa Laamarti;Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA)	10.1109/MeMeA.2017.7985846	gerontology;obesity;physical exercise;multimedia;home automation;exercise activity;overweight;medicine	Embedded	-58.49384033605733	-55.7268649078962	69190

Therefore, it is very important to stimulate physical activity. One of the simplest types of physical activity is walking on regular basis. It was shown that regular walking allows to reduce the risk of different diseases and disabilities, has positive effect on immune system, emotional status and quality of life. One of the possible approaches to motivate people to go walking is dog walking. The fact that the dog needs to be walked everyday at the same time periods makes dog walking a good and effective sort of physical activity. However, acquiring a dog brings some restrictions in the dog owner's life and requires the owner to take care and responsibility of the dog. These restrictions can be overcome with a mobile applications that emulate dog's need for a walk provoking user to go walking. Moreover, such kind of application can be very useful for other use cases. For example, in a case when a kid asks his or her parents to acquire a dog and parents want to be sure that their kid will take care and responsibility for that.	cloud computing;emulator;mobile app;model-driven engineering;personalization;play store	Denis Laure;Oleg Medvedev;Sergey Balandin;Ksenia Lagutina	2015	2015 17th Conference of Open Innovations Association (FRUCT)	10.1109/FRUCT.2015.7117980	simulation;engineering;physical therapy;communication	HCI	-58.43450645666224	-55.31496336698398	69281
5a27ed20afeb2e8f93e933e4f5cc0c6247a1a0bc	a comprehensive survey of a-prefixing in southern appalachia		This article reviews research on so-called a-prefixing (sheu0027s a-making good money now), attested among certain dialect speakers in Southern Appalachia. Sociolinguistic investigations of Southern Appalachian dialect speakers, beginning in the 1970s, found an interesting interplay of social and linguistic factors implicated in the variable production of the a-prefix (Hackenberg, 1972; Wolfram, 1976; Wolfram and Christian, 1975, 1976; Feagin, 1979). Subsequent studies have confirmed many of these social and linguistic factors and have further shown generational differences in contextual uses of the form (narrative vs. nonnarrative contexts; Burkette, 2007). Additionally, researchers have employed case-study methods, looking carefully at sociolinguistic interviews among members of the same family (Burkette, 2001, 2007, 2013, 2014, 2016; Hazen, 2006; Hamilton and Hazen, 2009; Hazen and Hamilton, 2008). These studies show effects for age and speaker education in use of the a-prefix and further reveal how speakers draw on the form as a vernacular resource in identity work and stance-taking.rnrnIt is the interplay of these variegated factors that makes a-prefixing a rich topic for linguistic inquiry: a-prefixing allows analysts to probe not only the grammatical interfaces (i.e., phonology–morphology, morphology–syntax), but also the role of social and stylistic factors in a process involving these interfaces. Here, I review characteristics of existing studies, including methods of data collection, geographic locales investigated, informant characteristics (sex, age, and socioeconomic status), properties of the data (number of speakers, tokens, etc.), and types of analyses. Additionally, I survey social, stylistic, pragmatic, syntactic, and phonological factors that license or condition variable realization of the a-prefix.

66858148cfa42e147c78a30b9d882bbb69202659	clinical predictive modeling development and deployment through fhir web services		Clinical predictive modeling involves two challenging tasks: model development and model deployment. In this paper we demonstrate a software architecture for developing and deploying clinical predictive models using web services via the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. The services enable model development using electronic health records (EHRs) stored in OMOP CDM databases and model deployment for scoring individual patients through FHIR resources. The MIMIC2 ICU dataset and a synthetic outpatient dataset were transformed into OMOP CDM databases for predictive model development. The resulting predictive models are deployed as FHIR resources, which receive requests of patient information, perform prediction against the deployed predictive model and respond with prediction scores. To assess the practicality of this approach we evaluated the response and prediction time of the FHIR modeling web services. We found the system to be reasonably fast with one second total response time per patient prediction.	conceptual schema;condylion mediale;deploy;electronic health records;fast healthcare interoperability resources;health level 7;international components for unicode;patients;predictive modelling;published database;response time (technology);score;silo (dataset);software architecture;synthetic intelligence;web service	Mohammad Khalilia;Myung Choi;Amelia Henderson;Sneha Iyengar;Mark L.

Notably, constructing rule-based clinical diagnosis criteria has become one of the goals in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 revision. However, few studies have been done in building a unified architecture to support the need for diagnostic criteria computerization. In this study, we present a modular architecture for enabling the creation of rule-based clinical diagnostic criteria leveraging Semantic Web technologies. The architecture consists of two modules: an authoring module that utilizes a standards-based information model and a translation module that leverages Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). In a prototype implementation, we created a diagnostic criteria upper ontology (DCUO) that integrates ICD-11 content model with the Quality Data Model (QDM). Using the DCUO, we developed a transformation tool that converts QDM-based diagnostic criteria into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) representation. We evaluated the domain coverage of the upper ontology model using randomly selected diagnostic criteria from broad domains (n = 20). We also tested the transformation algorithms using 6 QDM templates for ontology population and 15 QDM-based criteria data for rule generation. As the results, the first draft of DCUO contains 14 root classes, 21 subclasses, 6 object properties and 1 data property. Investigation Findings, and Signs and Symptoms are the two most commonly used element types. All 6 HQMF templates are successfully parsed and populated into their corresponding domain specific ontologies and 14 rules (93.3 %) passed the rule validation. Our efforts in developing and prototyping a modular architecture provide useful insight into how to build a scalable solution to support diagnostic criteria representation and computerization.	algorithm;class;clinical use template;computable function;content model;data model;diagnosis, clinical;first draft of a report on the edvac;information model;international classification of diseases;logic programming;modular programming;ontology (information science);parsing;patients;population;prototype;randomness;rule (guideline);scalability;semantic web rule language;surgical revision;upper ontology;diagnostic criteria;standards characteristics;subclass	Na Hong;Guoqian Jiang;Jyotishman Pathak;Christopher G.

In this line, the main goal of our study was to develop a virtual platform in order to induce cravings in smokers. Sixty undergraduate students were randomly assigned to two different virtual environments (high-arousal cues and low-arousal cues). Both environments were based on a three-room apartment with commercial music playing and virtual characters interacting in a social event. The assessment was carried out before and after exposure through psychophysiological activation and self-report data for craving and nicotine dependence levels. No statistical differences were observed between smokers and non-smokers in psychophysiological activation. As far as self-report data is concerned, smokers revealed a significant increase in craving after the VR exposure to high arousal environments. Overall results were in line with previous studies suggesting the use of virtual environments as a tool for the existing smoking cessation programs.	arousal;cessation of smoking;craving;interaction;nicotine dependence;personnameuse - assigned;personality character;randomness;smoke;vr - veterans rand health survey;virtual machine;virtual reality	Pedro Gamito;Jorge Oliveira;André Baptista;Edgar Pereira;Diogo Morais;Tomaz Saraiva;Nuno Santos;Fábio Soares	2011	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-60750-766-6-63	knowledge management;psychotherapist;nicotine;craving;virtual reality;medicine	Visualization	-54.24675514138184	-52.15859885484491	69638

Specifically, we have designed a layer oriented to process the different types of temporal questions. In the first approach, complex temporal questions are decomposed into simple questions, according to the temporal relations expressed in the original question. In the same way, the answers of each resulting simple question are recomposed, fulfilling the temporal restrictions of the original complex question. In the second approach, temporal information is added to the sub-questions before being processed.

However, the role of context has been widely acknowledged in natural language processing research and in linguistic studies of spatial language. There are a large number of different aspects of context that may be important in automated interpretation of location descriptions. In this paper, we present a summary of the contextual factors that have been discussed in the literature, and also describe and test a methodology for identifying contextual factors that respondents consider important in the use of specific spatial relations. We combine these sources to present a broad typology of contextual factors in the interpretation of geospatial natural language to set the scene for future research.	natural language	Kristin Stock;Mark Hall	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-63946-8_40	data mining;geospatial analysis;natural language processing;natural language;spatial relation;computer science;semantic interpretation;artificial intelligence;typology	NLP	-37.03194740471635	-74.96029396390924	69835
cc4361c46d0485844f8b7cc0e7c04749e64e0d1e	virtual reality mri: playful reduction of children's anxiety in mri exams		Many people, especially children, perceive MRI exams as threatening. They experience anxiety and stress during the procedure. Often this results in premature termination of the scan or low image quality. To avoid these adverse effects, it is common to sedate anxious patients. We present a playful virtual reality (VR) application for children (8 - 15 years) to counter anxiety and avoid sedation. Our approach uses a realistic virtual MRI scanner for desensitization and habituation to the MRI exam. To compensate the limited amount of profound knowledge about the design of child-tailored VR applications, we pursued a child-centered design process. Starting with expert interviews, we iterated through several development cycles and carried out focus group testings to evaluate prototypes of the VR application. Then, we conducted a field study with 13 patients under real life clinical conditions. Although results were non-significant, tendencies indicate a drop in the anxiety level after using the application. Furthermore, the application received strong support of the participating children, and medical professionals.	desensitization (telecommunications);field research;focus group;image quality;iteration;premature convergence;real life;virtual reality	Stefan Liszio;Maic Masuch	2017		10.1145/3078072.3079713	multimedia;focus group;anxiety;physical therapy;sedation;social psychology;virtual reality;psychology;habituation	HCI	-57.25704065062632	-54.47362097040654	69855

Case engineering is among the most complicated and costly tasks in implementing a case-based reasoning system. This is especially so for process-oriented case-based reasoning, where more expressive case representations are generally used and, in our opinion, actually required for satisfactory case adaptation. In this context, the ability to acquire cases automatically from procedural texts is a major step forward in order to reason on processes. We therefore detail a methodology that makes case acquisition from processes described as free text possible, with special attention given to assembly instruction texts. This methodology extends the techniques we used to extract actions from cooking recipes. We argue that techniques taken from natural language processing are required for this task, and that they give satisfactory results. An evaluation based on our implemented prototype extracting workflows from recipe texts is provided.	automatic differentiation;brill tagger;care-of address;case-based reasoning;dictionary;natural language processing;part-of-speech tagging;process modeling;prototype;reasoning system;requirement	Valmi Dufour-Lussier;Florence Le Ber;Jean Lieber;Emmanuel Nauer	2014	Inf.

This is accompanied by a matching number of novel algorithms for the surgical domain. To garner all benefits of surgical data science it is necessary to have an unambiguous, shared understanding of algorithms and data. This includes inputs and outputs of algorithms and thus their function, but also the semantic content, i.e. meaning of data such as patient parameters. We therefore propose the establishment of a new ontology for data and algorithms in surgical data science. Such an ontology can be used to provide common data sets for the community, encouraging sharing of knowledge and comparison of algorithms on common data. We hold that this is a necessary foundation towards new methods for applications such as semantic-based content retrieval and similarity measures and that it is overall vital for the future of surgical data science.	algorithm;data science;global variable;matching (graph theory);ontology (information science)	Darko Katic;Maria Maleshkova;Sandy Engelhardt;Ivo Wolf;Keno März;Lena Maier-Hein;Marco Nolden;Martin Wagner;Hannes Kenngott;Beat Peter Müller-Stich;Rüdiger Dillmann;Stefanie Speidel	2017	CoRR		computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	ML	-48.74288362869449	-65.72674281393753	69965
05a58f26e6e0842249fbe945f5ebbd0e035bffe9	design and development of an online support system for elder care		An important issue in healthcare nowadays is the tremendous increase in the elder population worldwide. A consequence of this is that a significant amount of care to elders is provided by informal caregivers, such as family members, rather than health professionals. It is vital, therefore, to provide support to informal caregivers in a manner that makes them more effective while, at the same time, easing the burden of constant caregiving. This work presents a prototype of an online support system for informal caregivers to the elderly and its evaluation. The prototype has multiple modules which provide services including patient and caregiver profile management, care recommendation and planning, treatment notification, an information archive, as well as social interaction with other caregivers. Our prototype is web-based and caregivers may access it through a computer or a smartphone. Our evaluation of the prototype indicates more than 70% user satisfaction.

e22df3f3fd6d86a4ed666ab7381054ba41f2dccd	towards automatic generation of short summaries of commits		"""Committing to a version control system means submitting a software change to the system. Each commit can have a message to describe the submission. Several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate the content of such messages. However, the quality of the automatically generated messages falls far short of what humans write. In studying the differences between auto-generated and human-written messages, we found that 82% of the human-written messages have only one sentence, while the automatically generated messages often have multiple lines. Furthermore, we found that the commit messages often begin with a verb followed by an direct object. This finding inspired us to use a """"verb+object"""" format in this paper to generate short commit summaries. We split the approach into two parts: verb generation and object generation. As our first try, we trained a classifier to classify a diff to a verb. We are seeking feedback from the community before we continue to work on generating direct objects for the commits."""	control system;diff utility;error message;statistical classification;version control	Siyuan Jiang;Collin McMillan	2017	2017 IEEE/ACM 25th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)		real-time computing;data mining;programming language;software;revision control;commit;classifier (linguistics);duck typing;verb;computer science;program comprehension;sentence	SE	-40.11627985094925	-75.97008187459814	70099

Performance of clinical workflows depends not only on how various steps are carried out but also on when certain information items are collected. We report the results of a long-term empirical study that looked at the implementation of a radiology information system (RIS) at a large regional network of radiology clinics. We find that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to hang over, with a significant impact on the total turnaround time of diagnostic reports. We show that information systems can solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and relocating that task upstream in the workflow. We argue that such unbundling can lead to shorter report turnaround times even if it significantly increases the utilization of the bottleneck server. These results have broader implications for the optimal design of other clinical workflows, such as the process of filling prescriptions in pharmacies or the typical surgical preanesthesia evaluation in hospitals. Finally, we explain why the impact of addressing hang-over is often nonuniform across clinical modalities, providers, and patient types.

BACKGROUND Feedback is widely acknowledged to affect task performance. However, the extent to which feedback display mode and its impact on timing decisions is moderated by task difficulty remains largely unknown.   METHOD Participants repeatedly engaged a zero-sum game involving silent duels with a computerized opponent and were given visual performance feedback after each engagement. They were sequentially tested on three different levels of task difficulty (low, intermediate, and high) in counterbalanced order. Half received relatively simple """"inside view"""" binary outcome feedback, and the other half received complex """"outside view"""" hit rate probability feedback. The key dependent variables were response time (i.e., time taken to make a decision) and survival outcome.   RESULTS When task difficulty was low to moderate, participants were more likely to learn and perform better from hit rate probability feedback than binary outcome feedback. However, better performance with hit rate feedback exacted a higher cognitive cost manifested by higher decision response time.   CONCLUSION The beneficial effect of hit rate probability feedback on timing decisions is partially moderated by task difficulty.

However, the data and bibliometric indicators offered by Google’s products can be easily manipulated. In order to alert the research community, we present an experiment in which we manipulate the Google Citations’ profiles of a research group through the creation of false documents that cite their documents, and consequently, the journals in which they have published, modifying their H-index. For this purpose we created six documents authored by a faked author and we uploaded them to a researcher’s personal website under the University of Granada’s domain. The result of the experiment meant an increase of 774 citations in 129 papers (six citations per paper) increasing the authors and journals' H-index . We analyse the malicious effect this type of practices can cause to Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics. Finally, we conclude with several deliberations over the effects these malpractices may have and the lack of control these tools offer.	bibliometrics;google scholar;granada;malware;personal web page	Emilio Delgado López-Cózar;Nicolas Robinson-Garcia;Daniel Torres-Salinas	2012	CoRR		google panda;google hacking;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Security	-38.70901821191589	-55.61134205268368	70485

A review of the literature reveals that IT in hospitals is a vastly under researched area, although anecdotal evidence reveals that the efficiency of IT usage in German hospitals offers room for improvement. Therefore we ask the research question: What are the salient factors influencing the efficient usage of IT in hospitals? To answer this question we set up a research project combining technology acceptance models, social cognitive theory and perceived risk theory to frame the perceived risk of liability for medical malpractice due to incorrect system usage. This research in progress paper presents the theoretically derived research model and gives an overview of the research project. The project is scheduled to start in July 2011 and is carried out in conjunction with two hospitals and a leading provider of IT and services for the health care sector. Anticipated findings are not only insights into the antecedents of user behavior but also an instrument to measure efficiency of IT usage and a framework to positively influence IT usage in German hospitals.

We performed a preliminary evaluation of the classification based on 100 guidelines randomly selected from the NGC collection. We found that 89 of the 100 guidelines could be assigned to a single guideline category. To test interobserver agreement, twenty guidelines were also categorized by a second investigator. Agreement was found to be 40–90% depending on the axis, which compares favorably with agreement among MeSH indexers (30–60%). We conclude that categorization is feasible. Further research is needed to clarify axes with poor inter-observer agreement. Background The NGC classification is primarily concerned with retrieval of guidelines from a large, heterogeneous collection. In a previous paper, we presented a proposed expansion of the NGC guideline classification scheme that classifies guidelines with respect to their modeling, authoring and executability characteristics in addition to retrieval. Our project is motivated by the desire to encourage electronic sharing and delivery of computer-based guideline advice. Objective To assess the degree to which: (1) guidelines could be categorized using the proposed classification, (2) raters agreed with each other and (3) to identify axes that need further clarification. Methods 100 guidelines were randomly selected from the NGC collection (Oct. 2000). One investigator (EB) categorized these according to the proposed classification system. A second investigator (NA) independently categorized the first twenty guidelines that were available in their entirety to assess interobserver agreement. Results Of 100 guidelines selected for categorization, 85 were available for review. The remaining 15 could not be obtained in their entirety and were categorized on the basis of the NGC data sheets. Data sheets had been approved by the guideline developer. Of the 100 guidelines, 89 could be assigned to a single guideline category. Eight could be assigned to two categories equally well and 3 could not be assigned to any category. The top three guideline categories were: Care of clinical condition (35), Appropriate use of a technology (27) and Screening (15). Inter-Observer Agreement (based on 20 guidelines) Parameter % Agree # / 20 # categories Organization type 90% 18/20 15 + d Clinical field 85% 17/20 66 + d Time frame 65% 13/20 3 + d Guideline Category 65% 13/20 8 + d Number of encounters 65% 13/20 2 + d Intended users 65% 13/20 28 + d Computability 45% 9/20 3 Setting 40% 8/20 8 + d (+d = multiple selections allowed, agreement = all terms agree) Conclusions Our evaluation suggests that current guidelines from a variety of clinical fields can be assigned to a small group of guideline categories with reasonable inter-observer agreement. Work remains to better define other axes of our classification (e.g. computability, setting) in order to improve interobserver agreement and to define the utility of our categorization with respect to modeling, authoring and execution of shareable electronic guidelines.

d391bcfb05a2d0103aa252af9e28a92a7222d9bb	why dissect a frog when you can simulate a lion?		We are concerned with creating computer-based learning environments which provide students with opportunities to develop causal explanations of complex phenomena through experimentation and observation. We combine video and simulation to facilitate such exploration in high school biology classrooms. Specifically, we focus on issues in behavioral ecology and the predation behaviors of the Serengeti lion. The question explored by students concerns the effectiveness of the lion’s hunting strategies. Although popularized as a skilled predator, only 1530% of the hunts attempted by lions result in the successful capture of prey (Schaller 1972). Explaining the causal factors underlying this statistic requires an understanding of cooperative behavior, optimality, resource competition, and variation. The conjecture is that active explanation will result in a greater understanding of these concepts than passive lecture/textbook teaching approaches. Students first watch a collection of video clips showing lions employing various hunting strategies. Their task is to create narratives by explaining and comparing features of the videos. Video is useful for detecting dynamic features such as speed or use of cover, but factors that are “implicit” (e.g., time of day), invisible (e.g., wind direction), or ob scured (e.g., spatial positioning of predator/prey) in the film can be difficult to isolate and understand. To highlight such salient events, we are building a simulation of the lion hunt called the Animal Landlord. Animals are behavioral agents possessing perceptual, motor, and action selection routines. Students observe an aerial view of the creatures and can manipulate parameters influencing their behaviors (e.g., number of predators, vegetation density). Thus, the simulation provides a setting in which further data can be collected to investigate questions raised during the video exercise. Students require assistance in open-ended experimentation tasks, so unlike similar systems (e.g., Resnick 1994), we provide domain-specific guidance. We monitor the progress of agents to structure a debriefing episode (Johnson 1994) upon completion of a hunt. The rule system and logic-based truth maintenance system described in (Everett & Forbus 1996) records logical dependencies between aspects of the environment, creatures and their actions, and justifications for these actions. Agents can be queried about all actions taken during the hunt through a multimedia interface.

Timetables of health centers are usually divided into time slots whose duration is equal to time required for clinical attendance. However doctors perform a series of tasks that are not always clinical in nature: issuing prescriptions or prescribing sick leave certificates. In this sense the time spent in attending a clinical or an administrative matter is different. This last required less time to attend the patient. This study is focused in the administrative task. A predictive model is generated to provide daily information on how many patients will go to the health center for an administrative issue. The accuracy of the model is less than 4,6 % absolute error and the improvement in scheduling appointments is a time saving of 21,73 %.	approximation error;certificate (record artifact);crew scheduling;data mining;goto;mathematical optimization;patients;predictive modelling;primary health care;schedule (project management);scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;women's health services;citation	Juan José Cubillas;M.

The objective of this study was to examine specific usability barriers to patient portal engagement among a diverse group of patients and caregivers.   Materials and Methods We conducted interviews using performance testing and think-aloud methods with 23 patients and 2 caregivers as they first attempted to use features of a newly launched patient portal.   Results In navigating the portal, participants experienced basic computer barriers (eg, difficulty using a mouse), routine computer barriers (eg, mistyping, navigation issues), reading/writing barriers, and medical content barriers. Compared to participants with adequate health literacy, participants with limited health literacy required 2 additional minutes to complete each task and were more likely to experience each type of navigational barrier. They also experienced more inaccuracies in interpreting a test result and finding a treatment plan within an after-visit summary.   Discussion When using a patient portal for the first time, participants with limited health literacy completed fewer tasks unassisted, had a higher prevalence of encountering barriers, took longer to complete tasks, and had more problems accurately interpreting medical information.   Conclusion Our findings suggest a strong need for tailored and accessible training and support to assist all vulnerable patients and/or caregivers with portal registration and use. Measuring the health literacy of a patient population might serve as a strong proxy for identifying patients who need the most support in using health technologies.	attempt;electronic health records;health literacy;patients;personal health information;population;portals;software performance testing;think aloud protocol;usability	Lina Tieu;Dean Schillinger;Urmimala Sarkar;Mekhala Hoskote;Kenneth J.

We have performed some experiments using parsing of text an a test collection of documents and queries to try and find out exactly if and how parsing could contribute to an overall improvement in retrieval effectiveness. Investigating this topic has led us to the definition of a retrieval strategy which incorporates parsing of query text and a more “shallow” parsing of document texts, whose retrieval effectiveness is investigated and described. Our results indicate that significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness can be obtained by incorporating such linguistic processing into an overall retrieval strategy.	document retrieval;experiment;shallow parsing	Alan F.

Experts reviewed 150 cases using an online website designed to facilitate their interaction and efforts to reach agreement on the need for a referral for post-discharge care and the appropriate site for such care. In contrast to an average of eight weeks to complete just 50 cases using the traditional mail method, the first online Delphi round for 150 cases were completed in six weeks. Data provided by experts suggest that online Delphi is a time efficient and acceptable methodology for reaching group consensus. Other benefits include instant access to Delphi decision results, live knowledge of the time requirements and progress of each expert, and cost savings in postage, paper, copying, and storage of paper documents. This online Delphi methodology is highly recommended.	breast feeding;discharger;embarcadero delphi;informatics (discipline);patient referral;requirement;web site;benefit	Kathryn H. Bowles;John H.

6de50d445d6e090aa66747a3bae1f6112a72c1f4	letter to the editor: reply to atreja et al		Atreja et al. affirm that no evidence-based data exist supporting annual testing of serum potassium levels in patients receiving diuretics. This issue has, in fact, been addressed, and periodic potassium testing has been recommended outside of the pharmaceutical industry. Clearly, in the absence of specific testing frequency guidelines, clinical judgment should remain the main determinant of testing frequency. This is not to say that no testing is required. The computergenerated potassium reminder was introduced in Maccabi Healthcare Services due to the ubiquity of prescriptions for diuretics in our middle-aged and older population combined with an unexpectedly large proportion of patients not having a potassium level determined either before or after the institution of diuretic therapy. Atreja et al. suggest that some physicians might not want to test their patients for hypokalemia because their levels have been stable for years, while others test just to avoid further reminders.

It has been applied to marketing, healthcare, sustainability, political campaigns, and public policy. Traditionally, there has been a separation between physical (offline) and cyber (online) worlds. While persuasion methods in the physical world focused on strong interpersonal trust and design principles, persuasion methods in the online world were rich on data-driven analysis and algorithms. Recent trends including Internet of Things, “big data,” and smartphone adoption point to the blurring divide between the cyber world and the physical world in the following ways. Fine grained data about each individual's location, situation, social ties, and actions are collected and merged from different sources. The messages for persuasion can be transmitted through both worlds at suitable times and places. The impact of persuasion on each individual is measurable. Hence, we posit that the social persuasion will soon be able to span seamlessly across these worlds and will be able to employ computationally and empirically rigorous methods to understand and intervene in both cyber and physical worlds. Several early examples indicate that this will impact the fundamental facets of persuasion including who, how, where, and when, and pave way for multiple opportunities as well as research challenges.	algorithm;big data;embedded system;internet of things;online and offline;smartphone;social network	Vivek K.

In order to represent narrative information accurately, medical natural language processing (MLP) systems need to correctly identify and interpret temporal information. To promote research in this area, the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) project developed a temporally annotated corpus of clinical narratives. This corpus contains 310 de-identified discharge summaries, with annotations of clinical events, temporal expressions and temporal relations. This paper describes the process followed for the development of this corpus and discusses annotation guideline development, annotation methodology, and corpus quality.

To enhance their autonomy and solve future financial issues, we propose an adaptive game based on a non-intrusive shoe-mounted accelerometer able to recognize daily activities and errors. By solving puzzles, the user can train himself his erroneous activities, and re-learn a few. The main goal behind this game is to delay the cognitive decline while creating an evaluation tool for the health-care professional by the computation of a score taking into account the correctitude and the perseverance.

57d4900d3308b8f8dd836dec06dc1d8934525e5d	unlocking data for statistical analyses and data mining: generic case extraction of clinical items from i2b2 and transmart		In medical science, modern IT concepts are increasingly important to gather new findings out of complex diseases. Data Warehouses (DWH) as central data repository systems play a key role by providing standardized, high-quality and secure medical data for effective analyses. However, DWHs in medicine must fulfil various requirements concerning data privacy and the ability to describe the complexity of (rare) disease phenomena. Here, i2b2 and tranSMART are free alternatives representing DWH solutions especially developed for medical informatics purposes. But different functionalities are not yet provided in a sufficient way. In fact, data import and export is still a major problem because of the diversity of schemas, parameter definitions and data quality which are described variously in each single clinic. Further, statistical analyses inside i2b2 and tranSMART are possible, but restricted to the implemented functions. Thus, data export is needed to provide a data basis which can be directly included within statistics software like SPSS and SAS or data mining tools like Weka and RapidMiner. The standard export tools of i2b2 and tranSMART are more or less creating a database dump of key-value pairs which cannot be used immediately by the mentioned tools. They need an instance-based or a case-based representation of each patient. To overcome this lack, we developed a concept called Generic Case Extractor (GCE) which pivots the key-value pairs of each clinical fact into a row-oriented format for each patient sufficient to enable analyses in a broader context. Therefore, complex pivotisation routines where necessary to ensure temporal consistency especially in terms of different data sets and the occurrence of identical but repeated parameters like follow-up data. GCE is embedded inside a comprehensive software platform for systems medicine.	attribute–value pair;column-oriented dbms;data mining;data quality;database dump;embedded system;embedding;extractor device component;follow-up report;generic drugs;google compute engine;informatics (discipline);information privacy;list of statistical packages;nonketotic hyperglycinemia;patients;population parameter;randomness extractor;rapidminer;requirement;research data archiving;sas;spss;solutions;systems medicine;weka	Daniel Firnkorn;Sebastian Merker;Matthias Ganzinger;Thomas Muley;Petra Knaup-Gregori	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-678-1-567	data mining;data science;computer science	DB	-52.95835612682649	-66.1416682075612	72452

Furthermore, there are more and more cases of pathologies in which diagnosis and treatment can be only carried out by using medical imaging techniques. With an ever-increasing prevalence, medical images are directly acquired in or converted into digital form, for their storage as well as subsequent retrieval and processing. Similarly, text interpreting medical image with other associated patient information, are included into or acquired directly in digital form and stored. It is easy to note that greater is the amount of clinical data available to the specialists, acquired for example on previously treated cases, and better is the quality and the rapidity of diagnosis and treatment. It is therefore important, if not essential, to share easily and quickly data and clinical experiences. However, such sharing among different entities, whether public or private, is a non-trivial task, since such information are always subjected to restrictions related to privacy laws and to health insurance regulations. To the best of our knowledge, in literature there are no systems which allows the rapid and secure sharing of clinical experiences among different entities. We propose a fully distributed system which allows secure sharing of all information (both medical and not) necessary for patients management. With our system, each node belonging to it, can access quickly, easily and in a secure way to a considerable amount of data, thereby improving the speed and quality of clinical evaluation performed by the physician.	distributed computing;entity;medical imaging;privacy law;relevance	Arcangelo Castiglione;Ciriaco D'Ambrosio;Alfredo De Santis;Aniello Castiglione;Francesco Palmieri	2013	2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2013.120	communications protocol;image retrieval;computer science;access control;data mining;internet privacy;privacy laws of the united states;computer security;health care	DB	-52.985421376018756	-62.4893189297345	72473

While specific mobile applications are becoming available for patients to manage their own care, most treatment processes support healthcare professionals and offer little support for patient centered care. In order to address this problem, federal regulations require providers to become """"meaningful users"""" of Health Information Technology (HIT) in an effort to encourage patient centered care through the assessment of health outcomes. This paper contends that addressing meaningful use practices for patient centered care involves the activation of knowledge, which means bringing knowledge into action. A survey of 73 health care providers sought to discover how their knowledge activation affects patient centered care. The results suggest that current HIT usage by providers has limited knowledge activation. The contribution of this research is in that it identifies areas that would to bring about improvements in patient centered care and a model that shows how mobile access to patient records could potentially streamline the patient care process."""	adobe streamline;mobile app	Sajda Qureshi;Cherie Noteboom;Alice Schumaker	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.389	mobile telephony;computer science;knowledge management;law;information technology;encoding	HCI	-59.50520585731822	-61.9958544991239	72722

It targets people over 65 years who require needs assessment for access to long term publicly funded services. There is limited research on the barriers to adoption for interRAI electronic assessment tools, and none relating to the New Zealand health sector. This research qualitatively explored clinicians' perceptions and experience of using interRAI electronic assessment tools using semi-structured interviews guided by constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model [9]. Analysis was conducted using thematic analysis. Three major barriers to adoption of interRAI tools emerged from the research: 1) lack of ready access to individual laptops/computers with consistent network connectivity, 2) need for ongoing training for interRAI assessors, and, 3) lack of understanding of what information is being collected and for what reasons. The growth in aging populations will see greater use of interRAI electronic assessment tools, and therefore more clinicians required to learn and use the technology. Addressing these barriers to adoption is therefore vital.	computer;computers;entity name part qualifier - adopted;laptop;needs assessment;population;semiconductor industry;user experience	Joanne Smith;Richard J.

The general aggression model, social cognitive theory, and character identification offered the theoretical framework. A random sample of 102 male college students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: video game playing, recorded game-play watching, or movie watching. The results indicated that video game players (mediated enactive experience) experienced greater increases in aggressive affect, aggressive cognition, and physiological arousal than participants who watched recorded game play or comparable movie scenes (mediated observational experience). The study indicated that media interactivity in video game exacerbated the violent effect on short-term, aggressive responses. Character identification did not mediate the effect of media interactivity on aggression. Future studies should incorporate more comprehensive measures of character identification to investigate inconsistent findings regarding media interactivity and identification. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, judges write appellate opinions by including a summary of the facts of the case, identification of the issues of law raised in arguments by counsel for each of the parties, pronouncement of the legal propositions supported by the controlling authorities, and declaration of a decision that resolves the issues by applying the legal propositions to the facts of the case. The cited legal propositions are often concise summaries of certain aspects of previous cases or federal or state codes, which are applicable to the particular case in consideration. In this paper, we describe how a text discourse analysis program can be used to categorize each sentence in the appellate decisions as one or more of the discourse categories such as 'facts', 'issues', 'legal propositions', and/or 'decisions'. We also show how an information extraction program is applied to the sentences belonging to the 'legal proposition' category to build a visually browsable legal knowledge base. We expect the browsable knowledge base to aid both counsels and judges finding supporting legal propositions for their arguments during the early stage of preparing court briefs or the appellate decisions.

Recently, video games with affordable motion-based input devices have been proposed as a part of therapy to help people recover lost range of motion and motor control. While researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of therapeutic games through controlled studies, relatively little work has explored their long-term home-based use. We conducted a six-week home study with a 62-year-old woman who was seventeen years post-stroke. She played therapeutic games for approximately one hour a day, five days a week. Over the six weeks, she recovered significant motor abilities, which is unexpected given the time since her stroke. We explore detecting such improvements early, using game logs for daily measurements of motor ability to complement the standard measurements that are taken less often. Through observations and interviews, we present lessons learned about the barriers and opportunities that arise from long-term home-based use of therapeutic games.	input device;sensor;virtual world	Gazihan Alankus;Rachel Proffitt;Caitlin Kelleher;Jack R.

In a safely operated NPP, the performance of the MCR personnel is critical. The full height range of the users and the size they exhibit depend primarily on age, gender, body physical characteristics and other data within a population of people. In this case, properly designing MCR and human-system interface (HSI) is central to safe and efficient operations of the plant, since it reduces the occurrence of incidents, accidents and the risks of human related errors.	anthropometry	Shengyuan Yan;Jean Luc Habiyaremye	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58463-8_8	simulation;engineering;mechanical engineering	HCI	-52.87611155656452	-57.29493872115746	73116
c02f8f96ffd1e4807815f556fa8028b2e056b535	third generation teleassistance: intelligent monitoring makes the difference		Elderly people aim to preserve their independence and autonomy at their own home as long as possible. However, as they get old the risks of disease and injuries increase making critical to assist and provide them the right care whenever needed. Unfortunately, neither relatives, private institutions nor public care services are viable long-term solutions due to the large amount of required time and cost. Thus, smart teleassistance solutions must be investigated. In particular, IoT paradigm helps in designing third generation teleassistance systems by relying on sensors to gather the more data as possible. Moreover, we claim that providing IoT solutions of intelligent monitoring improves the overall efficacy. In this paper, we presents an intelligent monitoring solution, fully integrated in a IoTbased teleassistance system, showing how it helps in giving better support to both end-users and carers. Thanks to intelligent monitoring, carers can instantly access to the relevant information regarding the status of the end-user, also receiving alarms in case of any anomaly or emergency situations have been detected.	activity recognition;anomaly detection;autonomy;pervasive informatics;positive feedback;programming paradigm;sensor;software deployment	Xavier Rafael Palou;Carme Zambrana;Stefan Dauwalder;Enrique de la Vega;Eloisa Vargiu;Felip Miralles	2016			business	Robotics	-60.00428187648404	-56.397783869398395	73184

Our study showed that textual and concept-based reproducible recording of reusable data is hampered due to incorrect or incomplete modeling of associations between disorders in SNOMED CT. A possible solution for this is to record constituting characteristics of concepts directly into the record, instead of only being represented in the terminology.

fbe5f1587de705be23aacbeb3f31cd73c0da7e02	qwerty: the effects of typing on web search behavior		Typing is a common form of query input for search engines and other information retrieval systems; we therefore investigate the relationship between typing behavior and search interactions. The search process is interactive and typically requires entering one or more queries, and assessing both summaries from Search Engine Result Pages and the underlying documents, to ultimately satisfy some information need. Under the Search Economic Theory model of interactive information retrieval, differences in query costs will result in search behavior changes. We investigate how differences in query inputs themselves may relate to Search Economic Theory by conducting a lab-based experiment to observe how text entries influence subsequent search interactions. Our results indicate that for faster typing speeds, more queries are entered in a session, while both query lengths and assessment times are lower.	information needs;information retrieval;interaction;typing;web search engine;words per minute	Kevin Ong;Kalervo Järvelin;Mark Sanderson;Falk Scholer	2018		10.1145/3176349.3176872	typing;information retrieval;computer science;data mining;information needs;search engine	Web+IR	-34.136804927483375	-53.231861918603684	73524

Top ten lists exist for everything from movie stars to scary animals. Ambiguities (i.e., ties) naturally occur in the process of ranking when people feel they cannot distinguish two items. Human reported rankings derived from star ratings abound on recommendation websites such as Yelp and Netflix. However, those websites differ in star precision which points to the need for ranking systems that adapt to an individual user's preference sensitivity. In this work we propose an adaptive system that allows for ties when collecting ranking data. Using this system, we propose a framework for obtaining computer-generated rankings. We test our system and a computer-generated ranking method on the problem of evaluating human attractiveness.

The University of Botswana was used as a case study. Personal observation and interviews were used to elicit information from the staff and students of the University. The rate of adoption of ICT was very high in the University. Most daily routines of academic and administrative duties were done through the Webct and network connection to mopipi. ub.bw. However, a serious gap was discovered in ergonomic practices because design of workstations did not perfectly match the standard expected to facilitate functionality and usability. It is imperative for the university to adopt the provisions of occupational health and safety policy to harmonize the environment, tools, and workers to achieve maximum efficiency and optimal performance.	ergonomic hazard;human factors and ergonomics;imperative programming;usability;workstation	Ayodeji Akinlolu Agboola	2011	IJIDE	10.4018/jide.2011040105	information and communications technology;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;occupational safety and health;management;world wide web	HCI	-60.41338172321293	-59.56056852671592	73609

The glances for this condition showed similar gaze parameters, as a working system. The subjective ratings of the test subjects after this malfunction dropped significantly.  The gathered gaze data are compared to three former studies (two in a driving simulator and another study in real road driving).

Recent international guidelines encourage more prominent placement of patient-generated information about medications on the pharmacovigilance information landscape. Online platforms where patients share medication experiences with one another and with healthcare professionals are one possible avenue to accomplishing this goal. Public reports of medication-related events posted on the web, however, are under-utilized in the pharmacovigilance community. Moreover, little is known about who writes such reviews, what information is shared and how this information can be used by authorities.

Adopting a healthy lifestyle often requires behavior change. This paper presents a computational model of behavior change that describes formal relations between the determinants of behavior change, based on existing psychological theories. This model is developed to function as the core of a reasoning mechanism of an intelligent support system that is able to create theory-based intervention messages. The system first tries to determine the reason of the occurrence of the unwanted behavior by asking short questions via a mobile phone application and by gathering information from an online lifestyle diary. The system then attempts to influence the user using tailored information and persuasive motivational messages.	computation;computational model;mobile app;mobile phone;persuasive technology;theory	Michel C.

The DICOM movies from the PACS server of the catheterization laboratory are uploaded by secured 128 bit Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection without compression by a “send to DICOM node” command to a mini PACS hosting the OCS. After then the php modul checked the AETITLE + IP source, the communication is taking place on the TCP/IP 104 port. The uploads of the images of one patients takes 1-15 minutes depending on the bandwidth and the size of the DICOM files. After the upload, the movies can be downloaded by a real-time-like speed from any Internet connected place. The secured connection is performed by SSL protocol (https) which identifies the “receiver”. The viewer is based html5, therefore it runs in any browser program without the need for further application; however it is also possible to download the original DICOM files for further evaluations. Tablets and mobiles with the usual platforms can also be used for the consultations, the latter has the advantage in urgent cases, because sending an SMS or E-mail containing the link of the uploaded urgent coronary angiography enables the consultant invasive cardiologist to see immediately the movies on his/her smartphone or tablet or PC. The OCS can integrate the consultations of cardiac imaging modalities (echocardiography, CT, MR, IVUS, OCT) in DICOM forms. Using the OCS also for ECG trace transmission, the system is also useful for prehospital consultations during the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.	128-bit;acute coronary syndrome;atrial premature complexes;compression;consultation;coronary angiography;dicom;download;echocardiography;evaluation;html5;https;internet protocol suite;intravascular ultrasound;node - plant part;original chip set;php;patients;personal computer;picture archiving and communication system;real-time transcription;server (computer);server (computing);smartphone;tablet dosage form;tablet computer;the movies;transport layer security;upload;virtual private network;angiogram	Csaba Jenei;Tamas Ivanfai;Balint Koszegi;Zsolt Koszegi	2013	Computing in Cardiology 2013		embedded system;medicine;multimedia;dicom;picture archiving and communication system;computer security	Networks	-51.51307287941428	-60.920700677518205	74095

Nowadays we have very large knowledge graphs that organize common-sense knowledge about the world. They have been successfully deployed in many areas, but the quality and relevance of the contained knowledge varies greatly, and diverse knowledge domains are unpredictably intertwined. This paper summarizes our preliminary efforts at exploiting knowledge graphs to build digestible and reliable Description Logic ontologies for specific common-sense topics. We describe a simple yet effective approach to building smallto middle-sized topic ontologies with moderate efforts. It is implemented in a proof-of-concept tool with a command-line interface for quickly creating axioms by selecting from suggestions extracted from the ConceptNet knowledge graph. To illustrate the kind of ontologies that can be built, we describe a few example ontologies, which contain up to a few hundred concepts and roles, and were built in a couple of hours.	command-line interface;description logic;knowledge graph;knowledge management;ontology (information science);open mind common sense;relevance	Katinka Böhm;Magdalena Ortiz	2018			natural language processing;ontology (information science);computer science;graph;artificial intelligence	AI	-35.73455454125692	-67.49251847204631	74198

It proposes a novel editable text method to represent the multidimensional tree-like information structure of the Kunqu libretto literature and a musical semantic annotation method based on numbered musical notation to accommodate the musical features of Kunqu librettos. To maintain the characteristics of the original Kunqu musical notation, it proposes a method to reconstruct Kunqu libretto on the Web based on scalable vector graphics. Some Kunqu librettos were randomly selected for experiments, and the results demonstrated that the editable text method and the musical semantic annotation method were able to fully represent the effective information of the Kunqu libretto literature and that the method to reconstruct librettos on the Web was able to reflect the writing characteristics of the musical notation in the original librettos. Finally, it discusses the primary future research directions related to digital Kunqu, including Kunqu libretto metadata research, corpus construction for the librettos and Qupai (the unique ancient Chinese tune mode), libretto music information disambiguation research, libretto image segmentation and pattern recognition, digital Kunqu roles, digital Kunqu stages, digital Kunqu costume suitcases, virtual Kunqu, digitization and restoration of Kunqu cultural relics, and Kunqu's application prospects in conventional media such as animation, anime, and movies.	circuit restoration;experiment;image segmentation;pattern recognition;randomness;scalable vector graphics;word-sense disambiguation;world wide web	Gen-Fang Chen	2014	JOCCH	10.1145/2583114	multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-38.34216974185471	-68.64857945760012	74257

As part of digital access and information retrieval on heritage databases it is becoming increasingly important that date descriptors are not matched as strings but that their semantics are properly understood and interpreted by man and machine alike. This paper describes a prototype system designed to resolve temporal expressions from English language cultural heritage records to ISO 8601 compatible date expressions. The architecture we advocate calls for a two stage resolution with a “semantic layer” between the input and ISO 8601 output. The system is inspired by a similar system for German language records and was tested on real world data from the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin. Results from an evaluation with two senior art and metadata experts from the gallery are reported.	database;iso 8601;information retrieval;prototype;temporal expressions	Daniel Isemann;Gerard Lynch;Raffaella Lanino	2014		10.3115/v1/W14-6206	geography;data mining;multimedia;communication	NLP	-34.794605713726355	-76.1904248713205	74261

Our proposal is based on the contextualization of the access, providing the user with the most important information for the assistance act in which he/she is involved. To do this, we define the set of possible contexts and consider different aspects of the pertinence of the documents to each context. We do it by using fuzzy logic and pay special attention to the efficiency, due to the huge size of the involved databases. Our proposal does not limit the access to the EHR, but establishes a prioritization based on the access needs, which provides the system with an additional advantage, easily enabling the use of new terminals and devices like tablet PCs and PDAs, which have great limitations in the interfaces.	cardiology discipline;data item;database;fuzzy logic;medical specialities;occupational health services;paper;personal digital assistant;relevance;tablet dosage form;tablet computer;health records	Belén Prados-Suárez;Carlos Molina;Maria Carmen Peña Yáñez;Miguel A.

ca4dcbeda6f28bb67b511cd6b4c569e726884a88	challenges of measuring the impact of software: an examination of the lme4 r package		The rise of software as a research object is mirrored in the increasing interests towards quantitative studies of scientific software. However, due to the inconsistent practice of citing software, most of the existing studies analyzing the impact of scientific software are based on identification of software name mentions in full-text publications. Despite its limitations, citation data have a much larger quantity and broader coverage of scientific fields than full-text data and thus could support findings in much larger scopes. This paper presents an analysis aiming to evaluate the extent to which citations data can be used to reconstruct the impact of software. Specifically, we identified the variety of citable objects related to the lme4 R package and examined how the package’s impact is scattered across these objects. Our results reveal a littlediscussed challenge of using citation data to measure the impact of software, that even within the category of formal citation, there might be different forms in which the same software object is cited. This challenge can be mitigated by more carefully selecting objects as the proxy of software. However, it cannot be fully solved until we have one-software-one-proxy policy for software citation.	text corpus	Kai Li;P. Chen;Erjia Yan	2018	CoRR			SE	-40.09742467353952	-64.69504836353495	74377

In this research proposal, we plan to develop tools and techniques for pre-processing and extracting information from documents of the military dictatorship period that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. The data to be analyzed consists of digitized images of records from DEOPS/SP (São Paulo State Department of Political and Social Order), an emblematic police agency which have monitored (and in some cases, harassed and tortured) hundreds of thousands Brazilian citizens during that period. The idea is to use state-of-the-art powerful artificial intelligence algorithms in conjunction with crowd sourcing techniques to pre-process and extract information from this important period of the Brazilian History.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;big data;crowdsourcing;interaction;preprocessor;printing	Daniel de Moraes Navarro;Ronaldo C.

There are some fields of application in which the best known wearable device could simplify daily life, such as car navigation or reading recipes. But does this also apply for medicine and health care? This paper will at first explain what Google Glass is and how it works. Afterwards, diabetes mellitus (DM), is discussed. Moreover, we try to answer the question whether a Glass-like device could support and improve people with DM. Therefore, several use cases for Glass-enabled chronic disease care are outlined.	automotive navigation system;chimeric antigen receptor;chronic disease;diabetes mellitus;glass;health care;scientific publication;wearable technology	Christian Hetterich;Monika Pobiruchin;Martin Wiesner;Daniel Pfeifer	2014	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-432-9-298	knowledge management;gerontology;physical therapy;medicine;diabetes mellitus	HCI	-58.41697451330344	-57.33840394318562	74446

In this paper we present a study carried out for native and non native English language taggers, with the objective of providing user support depending on the detected language skills and characteristics of the user. In order to do this, we analyze the differences between how users tag objectively (using what we call ‘see’ type tags) and subjectively (by what we call ‘evoke’ type tags). We study the data using bivariate correlation, visual inspection and rule induction. We find that the objective/subjective factors are discriminative for native/non native users and can be used to create a data model. This information can be utilized to help and support the user during the tagging process.	bivariate data;data model;internet;rule induction;subject (philosophy);text-based (computing);visual inspection;web content	David F.

This paper with the focus of Functional Analysis (FA) of AHLTA explores operationalizable methods to study functions supported by user interfaces. A system hierarchy was created to map and uniquely identify all items on the interfaces. These items were then classified independently by 2 evaluators as Operations or Objects. Operations were further classified as either Domain or Overhead function. With acceptable inter-rater agreement, of the 1996 items in the interfaces, 61% were operations, around one fourth of which were Overhead functions. Overhead functions are hypothesized to be targets to be redesigned for improvements in usability.	application domain;classification;electronic health records;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;inter-rater reliability;representation (action);task analysis;usability;user interface;functional analysis	Zhen Zhang;Muhammad F.

a743fca4cd7b6f345b02dae8d71a1883bd21af9a	eeg, hrv and psychological correlates while playing bejeweled ii: a randomized controlled study		Stress related medical disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety are serious medical issues that can cause disability and death. Interventions to prevent their development and exacerbation are needed. Casual video games (CVGs) are fun, easy to play, spontaneous and tremendously popular. People report that they play these games because they decrease their stress and improve their mood. This study tested this theory by comparing people playing Bejeweled II a popular CVG with control subjects measured under similar conditions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes after playing Bejeweled II were consistent with increased mood and corroborated with similar findings on psychological reports. Moreover, heart rate variability (HRV) changes consistent with autonomic nervous system relaxation or decreased physical stress were also recorded. It is concluded, therefore, that playing a CVG like Bejeweled II can increase mood and decrease stress. These finding have broad implications and include the potential development of prescriptive interventions using Bejeweled II to prevent and treat stress related medical disorders. Finally, these findings demonstrate a method using EEG, HRV and psychological correlates to understand the psychophysiological or cybernetic interconnection between participant and video game.	anxiety disorders;autonomic computing;autonomic nervous system;cardiovascular diseases;cessation of life;cybernetics;depressive disorder;diabetes mellitus;electroencephalography;heart rate variability;interconnection;linear programming relaxation;nervous system structure;randomness;spontaneous order;video games	Carmen V.

3dbdb755b336fe19624552adf2786f5c89c640aa	assessing a novel application of web-based technology to support implementation of school wellness policies and prevent obesity	web based technology;obesity;school;wellness policy	Childhood obesity is one of the most pressing public health concerns in the United States. Because schools are a critical site to promote wellness and prevent obesity, extensive policy and legislative efforts have focused on school-based food services, nutrition education, physical education, and overall physical activity. Unfortunately, research indicates that most of these policies prove ineffective due to insufficient implementation. A small number of web-based programs have emerged that are designed to support the implementation of school wellness policies. The purpose of the current study is to present and interpret findings from an evaluation of the web-based portion of a program implemented throughout the state of Pennsylvania. In total, 192 registered users completed a survey designed to evaluate their utilization and perceptions of the web-based features of the Health eTools for Schools program. Participants represented the following stakeholder groups: school nurses, teachers, wellness coordinators, administrators, and food service directors. Findings indicate the web-based portion of the Health eTools for Schools program is comprehensive, well-designed, and has the potential to support implementation of school wellness policies geared toward obesity prevention. At present, the web-based features are most effective in providing school nurses with tools and resources to execute their roles related to obesity prevention. Applications supporting other groups such as teachers and food service directors require further development to be equally effective. The number of programs with this focus is likely to increase and further research is needed to address other aspects of these programs as well as their impact on student level outcomes such as eating habits, body mass index, physical activity levels, and physical fitness.	human body weight;web application	Paul M.

DESIGN A set of free-text eligibility criteria from clinical trials on two representative diseases, breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases, was sampled to identify disease-specific eligibility criteria CDEs. In this proposed approach, a semantic annotator is used to recognize Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLSs) terms within the eligibility criteria text. The Apriori algorithm is applied to mine frequent disease-specific UMLS terms, which are then filtered by a list of preferred UMLS semantic types, grouped by similarity based on the Dice coefficient, and, finally, manually reviewed.   MEASUREMENTS Standard precision, recall, and F-score of the CDEs recommended by the proposed approach were measured with respect to manually identified CDEs.   RESULTS Average precision and recall of the recommended CDEs for the two diseases were 0.823 and 0.797, respectively, leading to an average F-score of 0.810. In addition, the machine-powered CDEs covered 80% of the cardiovascular CDEs published by The American Heart Association and assigned by human experts.   CONCLUSION It is feasible and effort saving to use a human-computer collaborative approach to augment domain experts for identifying disease-specific CDEs from free-text clinical trial eligibility criteria.

One of the main topic in personal digital libraries is allowing people to select interesting information among all the different digital formats available today (pdf, html, tiff, etc.). Moreover the increasing availability of these on-line libraries, as well as the advent of the so called Semantic Web [1], is raising the demand for converting paper documents into digital, possibly semantically annotated, documents. These motivations drove us to design a new system which could enable the user to interact and query documents independently from the digital formats in which they are represented. In order to achieve this independence from the format we consider all the digital documents contained in a digital library as images. Our system tries to automatically detect the layout of the digital documents and recognize the geometric regions of interest. All the extracted information is then encoded with respect to a reference ontology, so that the user can query his digital library by typing free text or browsing the ontology.	digital data;digital library;html;library (computing);online and offline;personal digital assistant;portable document format;region of interest;semantic web;upper ontology	Luigi Cinque;Alessio Malizia;Roberto Navigli	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-28640-0_4	availability;digital library;html;computer science;document structure description;semantic web;database;data analysis;world wide web;type theory;information retrieval;digital image;region of interest	Web+IR	-38.70699699542149	-58.99002482044576	75068

One notable opportunity for reducing these barriers is improved usefulness and usability of electronic medical consultation order forms. The cognitive systems engineering (CSE) design approach focuses on supporting humans in managing cognitive complexity in sociotechnical systems. Cognitive complexity includes communication, decision-making, problem solving, and planning.   OBJECTIVE The objective of this research was to implement a CSE design approach to develop a template that supports the cognitive needs of referring clinicians and improves referral communication.   METHODS We conducted interviews and observations with primary care providers and specialists at two major tertiary, urban medical facilities. Using qualitative analysis, we identified cognitive requirements and design guidelines. Next, we designed user interface (UI) prototypes and compared their usability with that of a currently implemented UI at a major Midwestern medical facility.   RESULTS Physicians' cognitive challenges were summarized in four cognitive requirements and 13 design guidelines. As a result, two UI prototypes were developed to support order template search and completion. To compare UIs, 30 clinicians (referrers) participated in a consultation ordering simulation complemented with the think-aloud elicitation method. Oral comments about the UIs were coded for both content and valence (i.e., positive, neutral, or negative). Across 619 comments, the odds ratio for the UI prototype to elicit higher-valenced comments than the implemented UI was 13.5 (95% CI = [9.2, 19.8]), p < .001.   CONCLUSION This study reinforced the significance of applying a CSE design approach to inform the design of health information technology. In addition, knowledge elicitation methods enabled identification of physicians' cognitive requirements and challenges when completing electronic medical consultation orders. The resultant knowledge was used to derive design guidelines and UI prototypes that were more useful and usable for referring physicians. Our results support the implementation of a CSE design approach for electronic medical consultation orders.		April W. Savoy;Laura G. Militello;Himalaya Patel;Mindy E. Flanagan;Alissa L.

643436d0254536f4392ab1218d75891f9147543b	a systematic review of the methodologies used to evaluate telemedicine service initiatives in hospital facilities	telemedicine;telehealth;planning;evaluation;hospital services	"""BACKGROUND The adoption of telemedicine into mainstream health services has been slower than expected. Many telemedicine projects tend not to progress beyond the trial phase; there are a large number of pilot or project publications and fewer 'service' publications. This issue has been noted since 1999 and continues to be acknowledged in the literature. While overall telemedicine uptake has been slow, some services have been successful. The reporting and evaluation of these successful services may help to improve future uptake and sustainability. The aim of this literature review was to identify peer-reviewed publications of deployed telemedicine services in hospital facilities; and to report, and appraise, the methodology used to evaluate these services.   METHODS Computerised literature searches of bibliographic databases were performed using the MeSH terms for """"Telemedicine"""" and """"Hospital Services"""" or """"Hospital"""", for papers published up to May 2016.   RESULTS A total of 164 papers were identified, representing 137 telemedicine services. The majority of reported telemedicine services were based in the United States of America (n=61, 44.5%). Almost two thirds of the services (n=86, 62.7%) were delivered by real time telemedicine. Of the reviewed studies, almost half (n=81, 49.3%) assessed their services from three different evaluation perspectives: clinical outcomes, economics and satisfaction. While the remaining half (n=83, 50.6%) described their service and its activities without reporting any evaluation measures. Only 30 (18.2%) studies indicated a two-step implementation and evaluation process. There was limited information in all reported studies regarding description of a structured planning strategy.   CONCLUSION Our systematic review identified only 137 telemedicine services. This suggests either telemedicine service implementation is still not a part of mainstream clinical services, or it is not being reported in the peer-reviewed literature. The depth and the quality of information were variable across studies, reducing the generalisability. The reporting of service implementation and planning strategies should be encouraged. Given the fast paced technology driven environment of telemedicine, this may enable others to learn and understand how to implement sustainable services. The key component of planning was underreported in these studies. Studies applying and reporting more rigorous methodology would contribute greatly to the evidence for telemedicine."""	automated planning and scheduling;bibliographic database;cognitive function: planning;health services;hospitals;paper;scientific publication;systematic review;telemedicine;trial phase	Sharifah AlDossary;Melinda G.

51273fc9fc1b8edd49713eb39f87971479ef2503	social media and games as self-management tools for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus		INTRODUCTION: Insufficient treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) can cause unpleasant and dangerous short-term complications, and disabling long-term complications. Children and adolescents are often associated with poor blood glucose regulation and poor treatment adherence. Motivating this group into achieving better illness knowledge, self-management and treatment adherence is difficult through ordinary diabetes education methods, which necessitates the need for alternate methods. METHODS: Health educational video games and social media are investigated as potential platforms for providing diabetes education and motivation. Publications were reviewed in order to estimate clinical and personal effects. RESULTS: 6 publications on children and adolescents’ use of health educational video games displayed increased patients knowledge regarding their illness and treatment hereof, improved treatment adherence and positive clinical results. Social media is identified in 2 publications as a promising platform for online communities, where patients and next of kin can seek advise, help others and share experiences. DISCUSSION: Video games and social media constitute platforms that children and adolescents are familiar with, engage in and enjoy and are for diabetes educational purposes. Tromsø Telemedicine Laboratory propose that by combining these platforms to make a social game experience that educates children and adolescents and motivates them conduct self-management and achieve better clinical results, thereby lowering their risk of diabetes complications.	chomsky hierarchy;experience;informatics;microsoft kin;online community;scientific literature;self-management (computer science);social media;social network game;video game design;video game development	J.

At the Resource Centre for Healthcare Technologies (SANTEC) department, we focus our research activities on healthcare technologies. Our mission consists primarily in improving healthcare by developing methods, tools, services and solutions that can be applied by healthcare professionals, patients and citizens on a daily basis. In this research work, we present an approach to combining search results using data fusion techniques. The focus of the 2014 Clinical Decision Support Track was the retrieval of relevant biomedical articles for answering generic clinical questions about medical records. Each question consists of a case report and one of three generic clinical question types, such as “What is the patient’s diagnosis?”. Retrieved articles are judged relevant if they provide information of the specified type that is relevant to the given case. The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief description about the CDS Task. Section 3 describes our methodology for combining search results. Our submitted runs and the official results of TREC CDS Track are described in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws our conclusions and outlining directions for future work.	bilateral filter;cds isis;clinical decision support system;experiment;hoc (programming language);query expansion;semantic similarity;text retrieval conference	Duy Dinh;Asma Ben Abacha	2014			decision support system;computer science;operations research;world wide web	NLP	-52.271318196476344	-68.92353070986366	75437

Data warehouses can help providing researchers with data and the opportunity to find eligible participants for clinical trials.   OBJECTIVES To define an information platform for healthcare and biomedical research based on requirements by clinicians and researchers.   METHODS Interviews with clinicians, researchers, data privacy officers, IT and hospital administration combined with a questionnaire sent to 60 medical departments at our hospital were conducted.   RESULTS Resulting requirements were grouped and a platform architecture was designed based on the requirements.   CONCLUSION Requirements lead to a single platform supporting both, patient care and biomedical research.	biomedical research;holism;information privacy;neoplasm metastasis;requirement	Gerd Schneider;Björn Schreiweis;Raluca Pahontu;Theresia Eichner;Bjoern Bergh	2016	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-645-3-54	knowledge management;architecture;health information exchange;health administration;data warehouse;information privacy;health care;medicine;information dissemination	HCI	-58.77236419084289	-63.28845851431399	75458
49c86af9f64dfa00d3cb7e484d15051a1c048f3b	meaningful use of data in care coordination by the advanced practice registered nurse: the telefamilies project		According to the American Nurses Association (ANA), wisdom is the appropriate use of knowledge to manage and solve human problems between types of information1. In clinical practice, the application of experience, intelligence, creativity, and knowledge enables the nurse to make timely clinical decisions based on wisdom, recognizing which information is most important to the plan of care2. This paper describes an innovative model of care that engages an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) in high-intensity care coordination for children with complex special health care needs (SHCN). The value of this intervention is in matching the enhanced skills and role of the APRN with the level of complexity of data and information involved in coordination of care for this population. Through this intervention, the APRN applies wisdom to manage a complex plan of care.rnrnThe Affordable Care Act recognizes the value of coordinated care as essential for cost-effective delivery of health care in the United States3. There is also support for using electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate coordination of care across systems and at transitions of care, and EHRs are widely expected to improve provider decisions and patient outcomes4. The HITECH portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act mandated that incentives should be offered for meaningful use of EHRs5. Meaningful use of EHRs refers to the ability to transmit information, use decision support, and generate information that is important to patients, health care practice, and public health6. While policy development is essential in driving health care improvements, providers’ experiences do not match policy-makers’ expectations of the role of EHRs in care coordination7. A limitation of these expectations is an assumption that meaningful use of data is independent of the practitioner’s role, educational preparation, and ability to use knowledge to manage human problems.rnrnEvidence suggests that while EHRs facilitate within-office communication, they are less useful in supporting coordination across settings and have limited ability to capture dynamic planning and the medical decision-making process7. Another limitation of expectations for EHRs in care coordination is the time required to monitor, update, and interpret data in the EHR for patients with complex, chronic health conditions. This is particularly true for children who have special health care needs. Approximately 14% of all children have a special health care need (SHCN), defined as having a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and requiring more services than typical children8. A subset of these children has unique needs due to the complexity of their chronic conditions. Because of the higher need for and use of health care services, the costs per capita of healthcare for children with complex SHCN are significantly higher than for children in the general population9.rnrnHealth records for individuals with SHCN differ from those for children with periodic health needs or single chronic conditions. Children with complex health issues have numerous providers across multiple systems, frequent changes in health status, and multiple medications and problem lists that fluctuate, resulting in data spread across multiple EHR systems. Coordination of care for children with complex SHCN requires the practitioner to have an advanced scope of knowledge and practice as well as dedicated time devoted to the care coordinator role. There is evidence that healthcare charges for typically high-cost patient groups are lower when advanced practice nurses (APRNs) have the autonomy to act upon their knowledge and clinical judgment, and that savings are proportional to nurse dose (time and contacts)10. These factors, along with our experience with a pilot project designed to coordinate care for a cohort of children with complex SHCN11, were the catalysts for the on-going TeleFamilies project.

dd265175c6d5c9c9ad7826649ef6a5fe1b76ecfc	case study of a highly automated layout analysis and ocr of an incunabulum: 'der heiligen leben' (1488)		This paper provides the first thorough documentation of a high quality digitization process applied to an early printed book from the incunabulum period (1450-1500). The entire OCR related workflow including preprocessing, layout analysis and text recognition is illustrated in detail using the example of 'Der Heiligen Leben', printed in Nuremberg in 1488. For each step the required time expenditure was recorded. The recognition rate was excellent both on character (97.97%) and word (91.58%) level. Furthermore, a comparison of a highly automated (LAREX) and a manual (Aletheia) method for layout analysis was performed. By substantially automating the segmentation the required human effort was reduced considerably from 39 hours to around eight hours, without any significant drop in OCR accuracy. Realistic estimates for the human effort necessary for full text extraction from incunabula can be derived from this study. The printed pages of the complete work together with the OCR result are available online1 ready to be inspected and downloaded.	book;circa;display resolution;document layout analysis;documentation;ocropus;optical character recognition;preprocessor;printing	Christian Reul;Marco Dittrich;Martin Gruner	2017		10.1145/3078081.3078098	speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence	HCI	-39.84784076222094	-74.34486492890913	75832

While statistical learning based techniques have shown promising results for de-identification purposes, few such systems are publicly available. It remains a challenge for practitioners to build an accurate and efficient system as it involves a significant amount of feature engineering, i.e. creation and examination of new features used in the system. A comprehensive evaluation is needed to thoroughly understand the effects of different feature sets and potential impacts of sampling and their trade-offs between the often conflicting goals of precision (or positive predictive value), recall (or sensitivity), and efficiency.  In this paper, we present the Health Information DE-identification (HIDE) framework and evaluate the open- source software. We present an evaluation of various types of features used in HIDE, and introduce a window sampling technique (only the terms within a specified distance from personal health information are used to train the classifier) and evaluate its effect on both quality and efficiency. Our results show that the context features (previous and next terms) are particularly important and the sampling technique can be used to increase recall with minimal impact on precision. We obtained token-level label precision of 0.967, recall of 0.986 and F-Score of 0.977 when not including true negatives. The overall HIDE system achieves token-level precision of .998, recall of .999, and f-score of .999 on the previous i2b2 challenge task.	de-identification;f1 score;feature engineering;informatics;machine learning;precision and recall;sampling (signal processing);window function	James J.

feb5a3fb4b2ba2a16991b059cc190242cd25de18	a new procedure for advancing telemedicine using the hololens		The it relates to healthcare delivery to remote and under-served areas. This is evident in the emergence of many Bluetooth or Wi-Fi-enabled medical devices, such as infusion pumps, smart beds, magnetic resonance imaging scanners, and HoloLens devices, inter alia, currently in use in various hospitals and health facilities. However, the shortage of competent operators and lack of specialized physicians and other health workers, especially in rural and remote areas that lack specialist medical services and major hospitals, still poses a great challenge to high-quality health delivery. This research project was to develop a proof-of-concept system by implementing an E-consultation system leveraged on holographic and augmented reality systems, in a typical intensive care unit (ICU) environment, for the prompt and safe delivery of remote consultancy services. The overall system was implemented as a data center controlling a network of devices and a HoloLens consulting system. This E-Consultation approach created an interactive platform between a patient and a doctor and was tested at the surgical ICUs of Buddhachinaraj Hospital, Phitsanulok, Thailand, with six cardiothoracic patients and 14 other accident patients, participating in the study. The adaptability of the system was tested developmentally over a period of one month. Analysis of the results of a satisfaction survey of the collaboration amongst the medical practitioners (doctors and nurses) and the development team showed that the average satisfaction was 4.37 for system usability and 4.5 for the benefits identified and average satisfaction with the development team was 3.87, both out of a maximum score of 5 points. The findings from this research demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of deploying HoloLens and Hologram devices and justify their use in E-Consulting systems in ICU centers.	augmented reality;bluetooth;data center;emergence;holography;international components for unicode;microsoft hololens;resonance;usability	Sirikasem Sirilak;Paisarn Muneesawang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875558	emergency medicine;computer network;economic shortage;adaptability;augmented reality;computer science;usability;health care;data center;intensive care unit;telemedicine	HCI	-58.00789940173297	-60.57193656273454	76276

BACKGROUND To reduce the currently large number of indoor wheelchair accidents, assistance systems with a high level of automation were developed. It was proposed to adapt the wheelchair's level of automation to the user's ability to steer the device to avoid drawbacks of highly automated wheelchairs. The state of the art, however, lacks an empirical identification of those abilities.   METHOD A study with 23 participants is described. The participants drove through various sections of a course with a powered wheelchair. Repeatedly measured criteria were safety (numbers of collisions) and efficiency (times required for reaching goals). As covariates, the participants' fine motor abilities were assessed.   RESULTS A random coefficient modeling approach was conducted to analyze the data,which were available on two levels as course sections were nested within participants.The participants' aiming, precision, and armhand speed contributed significantly to both criteria: Participants with lower fine motor abilities had more collisions and required more time for reaching goals.   CONCLUSION Adapting the wheelchair's level of automation to these fine motor abilities can improve indoor safety and efficiency. In addition, the results highlight the need to further examine the impact of individual differences on the design of automation features for powered wheelchairs as well as other applications of automation.   APPLICATION The results facilitate the improvement of current wheelchair technology.

37cf41d0efa622ad7d896bf1cc3d5fbd49bf507e	synchronization issues in surgical training		Surgical training systems allow novel surgeons to acquire the required skills to successfully carry out an operation without harming a real patient. These systems emulate the situation of a real operation, replicating the information gathered by sensors, movements of the surgeon, patient response, etc. All this information must be synchronized to provide an experience to the novel surgeon as closest to reality as possible. A special case of information synchronization is when using video images from the operation. In this paper, we analyze these synchronization issues —video, movements, sensors, etc. — and show a particular case that bring all together: an endoscopic video-surgery learning system.	bluetooth;complex system;data synchronization;mock object;requirement;sensor;synchronization (computer science)	Álvaro Marco;Héctor J.

This paper presents a case study of a real-world application of chat analysis in support of team training exercise in the military. It compares the results of an unsupervised learning approach with those of a supervised classification approach. The paper also discusses some of the specific challenges presented by this domain. Analyzing microtexts for topic identification has many applications such as gauging the current topics that are capturing our collective attention, or discovering what people are saying about products, for example. While most of the focus of microtext analysis has been in the service of business intelligence, it has pretty powerful applications in the educational domain. Topic identification can be used to analyze chat messages exchanged in context of an educational application to track the focus and depth of student interactions. Chat analysis is also a powerful tool for assessing team communications when used in a training or operational context. Unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering are very popular for analyzing text for topic identification (Anjewierden,, Kollöffel and Hulshof 2007; Adams and Martel 2008). These techniques have several attractive features, the most significant being that they do not require labeled training examples. This however is also a disadvantage under some circumstances. Without the guidance of labels and supervised learning algorithms, clustering approaches can discover concepts that, while distinct, are not relevant to the analysis objectives. One way around this is to carefully engineer the features used to represent the data in order to guide the discovery. However, whatever you might have gained by not having  Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). to label examples you might have lost in feature engineering. Supervised learning algorithms for chat analysis (Banerjee and Rudnicky 2006; Herring 2006; Shi 2006) on the other hand can be guided towards concepts of interest via labeled training examples, but typically labeling the examples requires considerable human input. If the concepts being learned are expected to be stable over time and generally applicable to a wide range of analysis domains or areas of analysis, the upfront cost of hand labeling examples may be acceptable. When this is not the case, these costs can be prohibitive. Such was the case in the analysis problem we are considering. We are currently developing a chat analysis tool called IDA (Intelligent Diagnosis Assistant) for use with simulation exercises for training operational planners in the Air Operations Center. The purpose of the tool is to help trainers analyze chat communications between among team members to assess how closely they followed the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures). The trainers specifically required that the tool be able to separate the messages in the chat logs by topics (what topic means in this context will be explained later in this section). This analysis problem falls in the space that presents challenges to both the supervised and unsupervised paradigms. On the one hand there is a pre-determined set of topics that is of interest and therefore the analysis has to be directed. On the other hand, these topics are not stable and likely to change from one exercise to another. The costs of hand labeling training data for every exercise would more or less nullify the benefits of automated analysis. There are few options here; one can either try to find ways to constrain unsupervised algorithms towards the concepts of interest or you can find other sources of data labels. We got lucky; typically the planners mention the mission name explicitly in a small subset of their chat messages. This gave us our set of labeled training examples. Additionally, there is an exercise database where the planners record important decisions with respect to a mission. Often they will cut and paste messages as annotations. While this constitutes a small fraction of the chat database, they were still useful as training examples and contain high information content. While this particular analysis context problem was able to provide us with low-cost labeled training examples, this presents a space of problems with unique challenges. These conditions are likely to be manifested in similar contexts in other domains. In this paper, we will report on techniques for automatically identifying topic threads in chat-based conversations. This work is in support of the research at the Air Force Research Lab at Mesa, AZ and is aimed at improving team training outcomes by developing exercise visualization and debriefing tools that will help trainees and trainers. The Training Research Exercise (T-REX) environment at the Air Force Research Laboratory allows mission-ready warfighters to practice their assigned duties using realworld systems in a scenario designed to test the full spectrum of decisions and coordination required in operational planning. The suite of systems includes collaborative planning tools such as chat rooms and shared databases. T-REX addresses the task of operation planning and execution within a Dynamic Effects Cell. The initiator for planning is normally a problem statement in the form of intelligence data or operational data reported to the team. The team then examines the problem in sequence with other planning tasks or a sub-team may be tasked to examine the issue in parallel with other team activities. Most of the team communication occurs via chat. Since the team handles multiple planning problems simultaneously, conversations regarding these missions are concurrent and highly interleaved. At the end of each training session, instructors lead a group after-action review (AAR) session to reflect on performance. The main factors to consider are how the team addressed each planning task or mission separately, and how the team handled multi-tasking. The ability to evaluate chatlogs during the review is important. Additionally, it becomes necessary to isolate and view the chat messages according to the topic/mission. Since each training session can run for four hours and generate on the order of a thousand chat messages spread across twenty five chat rooms, tools to filter and navigate the data to quickly zoom in on relevant bits of communication is of critical importance. Intelligent Diagnostic Assistant (IDA) is a chat visualization and analysis tool to support team AAR during team training exercises such as T-REX. Based on a requirement analysis, we have determined that classification of chat data according to missions is an important analysis capability for IDA. While visualization is also a key aspect of objectives of IDA, we will focus on the analysis problem in this paper. The Baseline The problem we are addressing is: Given: A database of chatlogs from a T-REX training session and other data logged/generated during training, Produce: For each chat message, identify the mission to which it refers. To get an insight into developing an automated solution, we interviewed an SME to understand how a human expert would perform this classification. These interviews led to the formulation of a 4-step process, each step implementing a rule. This forms the baseline approach. Rule 1: In this domain, each mission is assigned a unique identification number (ID). Trainees sometimes, but not always, will refer to this ID while talking about a mission. When they do, it becomes easy to associate those chat messages with a mission. IDA makes one pass through the data set to identify those messages that have explicit references. These messages form the core set upon which subsequent rules build. Rule 2: The next pass uses mission-specific keywords to classify chat messages. SMEs typically use their knowledge of the exercise events and examine associated exercise data to come up with a set of unique keywords for each mission. They would leverage these to tag chat messages. We automated this by having SMEs input mission-specific keywords via a configuration file. IDA uses these keywords to tag messages. Rule 3: There are some types of temporal patterns that can be detected with reliable accuracy without the need to understand the content of utterances. An example is recognizing the pattern of a turn-by-turn interaction between two people in the same room (e.g. A says something to B and 3 minutes later B says something to A) and inferring that they belong to the same topic thread. Making an assumption of dialog coherence, one can say with some degree of confidence (represented in IDA by a weight that varies inversely with the distance between the pair) that such conversation dyads refer to the same topic thread. The message classifications identified using the keyword-based approach are used as the basis to further identify and tag such messages pairs. Rule 4: Finally, locality influence is used to attempt to classify remaining unclassified chat lines. For each such line, IDA examines its neighboring messages and finds the most common mission association, weighted by distance of the neighbor from the line. If the combined influence of all the messages within that window that are associated with this mission is over a threshold, the chat line is also assigned to that mission. This rule was not found to have any significant influence on classification accuracy and we will drop it from future versions of IDA. While the baseline approach mimics the analysis of a human expert, it has the disadvantage of requiring manually provided keywords. These might vary by training sessions; requiring SMEs to provide keywords before each and every after-action review will place an undue burden on them.

dffd07a5549fec579f33004437387108a85854e7	a semantic approach for digital long-term preservation of electronic health documents		Long-term preservation of electronic patient health information is a key issue for life-long electronic health records, however, it is poorly implemented in healthcare institutions and little attention is given to problems like obsolescence of formats and EHR applications or changing regulations, which jeopardize reusability of information after decades of preservation. We present in this paper an ontology driven approach to digital preservation and related metadata management which seems to be superior to conventional concepts of the digital library world.	biologic preservation;digital library;electronic health records;ontology;patients;regulation	Stephan Kiefer;Michael Schaefer;Jochen Rauch	2012	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-101-4-265	data mining;information retrieval;medicine	HCI	-51.61569819806292	-64.87269505000764	77015

Some larger music rights holders (record companies and music publishers) organise their catalogues to allow online searching. These digital libraries are organised by various subjective musical facets as well as by artist and title metadata. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of written queries relating to creative music search, contextualised and discussed within the findings of text analyses of a larger research project whose aim is to investigate meaning making in this search process. A facet analysis of a collection of written music queries is discussed in relation to the organisation of the music in a selection of bespoke search engines. Subjective facets, in particular Mood, are found to be highly important in query formation. Unusually, detailed Music Structural aspects are also key. These findings are discussed in relation to disintermediation of this process. It is suggested that there are barriers to this, both in terms of classification and also commercial/legal factors.	bespoke;digital library;disintermediation;faceted classification;library (computing);web search engine	Charles Inskip;Andrew MacFarlane;Pauline Rafferty	2012	International Journal on Digital Libraries	10.1007/s00799-012-0084-1	computer science;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-35.84600562019872	-55.25061441510515	77146

According to data from the Survey [1] of Taiwanese Epidemiology in 1999, residents have a 0.4% chance of developing gout disease with a rise of about 7.5% every year in Taiwan. In the UK, Gout affects about 1 in 200 adults. Men are more commonly affected than women and first attack of gout typically develops in middle age and there is a family history of gout in about 1 in 5 cases. In spite of being unacceptable in style, rocker-bar is always an effective treatment, this research is, therefore, focused on a universal design concept and fitting assessment in relation to the design of orthopaedic rocker-bar with new universal hidden built-in construction, which provides the best way to improve the appearance, comfort and strength, it is suitable not only for gout disorders, but also for those patients with standing, walking or shoe-fitting corrective requirements.

Empathy, one of the key skills of social situation awareness (SSA), was found to be altered in stressful situations. Challenging and surprising events lead to a decrease in empathic accuracy in both pilot flying and pilot monitoring. Stress therefore significantly impacts SSA and modifications in training, procedures and system design could help crews better manage their workload during surprising and challenging situations, leading to increased empathic accuracy and better crew interaction.	systems design	Irene Stepniczka;Livia Tomova;Dominik Niedermeier;Markus F.

Inconsistent data occur when more than one set of exclusive alternative questions are answered. One objective of this study was to identify and eliminate inconsistent data as an important data mining preprocessing step. We define three types of incomplete data: missing data due to skip pattern (SPMD), undetermined missing data (UMD), and genuine missing data (GMD). Identifying the type of missing data is another important objective as all missing data types cannot be treated the same. This goal cannot be achieved manually on large data of complex surveys since each subject should be processed individually. The analyses are accomplished in a mathematical framework by exploiting graph theoretic structure inherent in the questionnaire. An undirected graph is built using mutually inconsistent responses as well as its complement. The responses not in the largest maximal clique of complement graph are considered inconsistent. This guarantees removing as few responses as possible so that remaining ones are mutually consistent. Further, all potential paths in questionnaire’s graph are considered, based on the responses of subjects, to identify each type of incomplete data. Experiments are conducted on MESA data. Results show 15.4 % GMD, 9.8 % SPMD, 12.9 % UMD, and 0.021 % inconsistent data. Further utility of the approach is using a) the SPMD for data stratification, and b) inconsistent data for noise estimation. Proposed method is a preprocessing prerequisite for any data mining of clinical survey data.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);clique (graph theory);complement graph;data mining;directed acyclic graph;emoticon;experiment;general material designation;geo-imputation;golm metabolome database;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;maximal set;mesa;missing data;polynomial;preprocessor;spmd;simulation;stratified sampling;time complexity;universal media disc	Suzan Arslanturk;Mohammad-Reza Siadat;Theophilus Ogunyemi;Kim Killinger;Ananias Diokno	2015	Knowledge and Information Systems	10.1007/s10115-015-0850-7	missing data;computer science;graph theory;data mining;database;statistics	DB	-53.09206511365572	-70.35813075566098	77551

It is based on a program that processes the information present in patient's history in relation to an independent knowledge base. Its potential domain is internal medicine, although the present knowledge base includes 110 infectious diseases only and a dictionary of nearly 3500 terms. After completion of patient's history, the user can request the differential diagnosis suggested by the system and a list of further investigations to discriminate among the diseases in differential diagnosis. The main distinctive features of the system are: 1) The D-LOG language, which has been created to allow sufficient flexibility in disease and patient's history description; 2) Implementation of key-elements of temporal reasoning; 3) Advanced explaination capabilities; 4) Knowledge base consultable as a hypertext. At present, the compilation of a wide and reliable knowledge base remains the most relevant problem to tackle.	personal computer	Antonio Muscari	1991		10.1007/978-3-642-93503-9_42	simulation;medicine;pathology;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;database	Vision	-49.69583598949145	-65.8661410194437	77586

Traditional usability testing using scripted scenarios with think-aloud protocol analysis provide a useful but incomplete assessment of how new CDS tools interact with users and clinical workflow. """"Near-live"""" clinical simulations are a newer usability evaluation tool that more closely mimics clinical workflow and that allows for a complementary evaluation of CDS usability as well as impact on workflow.   METHODS This study employed two phases of testing a new CDS tool that embedded clinical prediction rules (an evidence-based medicine tool) into primary care workflow within a commercial electronic health record. Phase I applied usability testing involving """"think-aloud"""" protocol analysis of 8 primary care providers encountering several scripted clinical scenarios. Phase II used """"near-live"""" clinical simulations of 8 providers interacting with video clips of standardized trained patient actors enacting the clinical scenario. In both phases, all sessions were audiotaped and had screen-capture software activated for onscreen recordings. Transcripts were coded using qualitative analysis methods.   RESULTS In Phase I, the impact of the CDS on navigation and workflow were associated with the largest volume of negative comments (accounting for over 90% of user raised issues) while the overall usability and the content of the CDS were associated with the most positive comments. However, usability had a positive-to-negative comment ratio of only 0.93 reflecting mixed perceptions about the usability of the CDS. In Phase II, the duration of encounters with simulated patients was approximately 12 min with 71% of the clinical prediction rules being activated after half of the visit had already elapsed. Upon activation, providers accepted the CDS tool pathway 82% of times offered and completed all of its elements in 53% of all simulation cases. Only 12.2% of encounter time was spent using the CDS tool. Two predominant clinical workflows, accounting for 75% of all cases simulations, were identified that characterized the sequence of provider interactions with the CDS. These workflows demonstrated a significant variation in temporal sequence of potential activation of the CDS.   CONCLUSIONS This study successfully combined """"think-aloud"""" protocol analysis with """"near-live"""" clinical simulations in a usability evaluation of a new primary care CDS tool. Each phase of the study provided complementary observations on problems with the new onscreen tool and was used to refine both its usability and workflow integration. Synergistic use of """"think-aloud"""" protocol analysis and """"near-live"""" clinical simulations provide a robust assessment of how CDS tools would interact in live clinical environments and allows for enhanced early redesign to augment clinician utilization. The findings suggest the importance of using complementary testing methods before releasing CDS for live use."""		Alice C. Li;Joseph L. Kannry;André Kushniruk;Dillon Chrimes;Thomas G.

In this article, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based approach is proposed to explore a promising solution to the Web image retrieval (IR). Compared with other image retrieval methods, this new approach has the following characteristics. First of all, the Content-Based features have been combined with Text-Based features to improve retrieval performance. Instead of solely relying on low-level visual features and high-level concepts, we also take the textual features into consideration, which are automatically extracted from image names, alternative names, page titles, surrounding texts, URLs, etc. Secondly, the Kohonen neural network model is introduced and led into the image retrieval process. Due to its self-organizing property, the cognitive knowledge is learned, accumulated, and solidified during the unsupervised training process. The architecture is presented to illustrate the main conceptual components and mechanism of the proposed image retrieval system. To demonstrate the superiority of the new IR system over other IR systems, the retrieval result of a test example is also given in the article.	artificial neural network;cognition;digital image;high- and low-level;image retrieval;network model;organizing (structure);self-organization;self-organizing map;text-based (computing);world wide web	Chase Qishi Wu;S.

To achieve this purpose, these texts should have a strong argumentation content and should adapt to emotional, as well as to rational attitudes of the Addressee. This paper describes how Rhetorical Sentence Planning can contribute to this aim: the rule-based plan discourse revision is introduced between Text Planning and Linguistic Realization, and exploits knowledge about the user personality and emotions and about the potential impact of domain items on user compliance and memory recall. The proposed approach originates from analytical and empirical evaluation studies of computer generated explanation texts in the domain of drug prescription.	belief revision;logic programming	Fiorella de Rosis;Floriana Grasso;Dianne C.

As a test case, we considered four languages: Russian, French, Hungarian and Hebrew. For each of these languages we tested three general search engines: Alta Vista, FAST and Google and some local search engines. Our results indicate that in the examined cases the general search engines ignore the special characteristics of non-English languages, and sometimes they do not even handle diacritics well. These findings are rather disturbing, since for example Google is very popular in non-English speaking countries as well, and users are either not aware of what they miss when using search tools that do not take into account the structure and the special characteristics of the specific language or have no alternatives but to use these search engines.

This paper explores the success of the HRRS system.   METHOD This study employed an augmented version of the DeLone and McLean IS success model. Seven variables (system quality, information quality, system use, user satisfaction, mobile healthcare anxiety, impact on the individual and impact on the organization) were used to evaluate the success of the HRRS system. The interrelationships between the seven variables were hypothesized and the hypotheses were empirically tested.   RESULTS The results indicate that the information quality of the HRRS system is positively associated with both system use and user satisfaction. In addition, system use is positively associated with user satisfaction, which is also positively associated with mobile healthcare anxiety. Moreover, results indicate that impact on the individual is positively associated with both user satisfaction and mobile healthcare anxiety. Finally, the impact of the organization is positively associated with impact on the individual.   CONCLUSION The results of the study provide an expanded understanding of the factors that contribute to mobile patient safety information system (IS) success. Implications of the relationship between system use and physician mobile healthcare anxiety are discussed.	angela mclean (biologist);anxiety disorders;cellular phone;computer user satisfaction;information quality;information system;information systems success model;mobile phone;multistage interconnection networks;patients;radiology;message	Wen-Yuan Jen;Chia-Cheng Chao	2008	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.03.003	simulation;medicine;knowledge management;empirical research;computer security	HCI	-61.29187236050699	-64.01784034605687	77804

DESIGN A cross-sectional survey of 129 clinicians.   MEASUREMENTS Satisfaction was measured using a multi-item satisfaction index. Perceived effectiveness of the training was measured by assessing self-reported improvements in efficiency in CIS.   RESULTS Response rate of 80%. The one-on-one method was significantly preferred over any other teaching methods (p<.0001). Improvement in use of the electronic medical record was greatest following one-on-one training when compared to other CIS components. Major improvements (i.e., >3 on 5 point Likert scale) in use of the electronic medical record were reported by 61.4% of the clinicians. Overall satisfaction was significantly higher among women (p<.05).   CONCLUSION The findings support the assumption that one-on-one training is of value to clinicians and that this training modality is valued above other methods.	cross-sectional studies;cross-sectional data;eighty;electronic health records;electronics, medical;information system;medical information systems;medical records;modality (human–computer interaction);numerous;objective-c;teaching method	Michael Kirshner;Herbert Salomon;Homer L.

17718b4f260bfa1fa8fd5a967dc5680421aefe23	evaluating contextual suggestion		As its primary evaluation measure, the TREC 2012 Contextual Suggestion Track used precision@5. Unfortunately, this measure is not ideally suited to the task. The task in this track is different from IR systems where precision@5, and similar measures, could more readily be used. Track participants returned travel suggestions that included brief descriptions, where the availability of these descriptions allows users to quickly skip suggestions that are not of interest to them. A user’s reaction to a suggestion could be negative (“dislike”), as well as positive (“like”) or neutral, and too many disliked suggestions may cause the user to abandon the results. Neither of these factors are handled appropriately by traditional evaluation methodologies for information retrieval and recommendation. Building on the time-biased gain framework of Smucker and Clarke, which recognizes time as a critical element in user modeling for evaluation, we propose a new evaluation measure that directly accommodates these factors.	critical graph;edmund m. clarke;information retrieval;norm (social);user modeling	Adriel Dean-Hall;Charles L.

The situated context of an instance of a behavior phenomenon informs its analysis. Starting with some initial (user-supplied) descriptive model of a phenomenon, accessing and studying instances in the data that are matches or near matches to the model is essential to refine the model to account for variations in the phenomenon. This inquiry requires viewing the instances within-context to judge their relevance. In this paper, we propose an automatic processing approach that supports this need for situated analysis in multimodal data. We process events on a semi-interval level to provide detailed temporal ordering of events with respect to instances of a phenomenon. We demonstrate the results of our approach and how it facilitates and allows for situated multimodal analysis.	institute for operations research and the management sciences;level of measurement;multimodal interaction;relevance;semiconductor industry;situated	Chreston A.

04f6e0dc3d928e51d6c110005c1ee7870eb1377f	migrating language resources from sgml to xml: the text encoding initiative recommendations	standard generalized markup language;standardisation	The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), established in 1987, has been the largest effort in the area of standardisation of computer encoding of language resources. TEI chose SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) as its underlying standard, and in the years before the inception of XML, a number of projects encoded their data according to some SGML DTD, TEI compliant, or otherwise. These projects could now benefit from migrating their data to XML. Apart from validation, the most compelling reason for migration is the scarcity of SGML-aware software and the abundance of XML-based tools and related recommendations. However, despite the fact that XML is a subset of SGML, migration is not a trivial process, especially in the case of large holdings of legacy language resources. This is why in 2002 the TEI Consortium established a Task Force on SGML to XML migration. The TF has now produced a number of reports that simplify and make explicit the conversion of SGML TEI (version P3) to XML TEI (version P4) documents. The reports are also relevant for a general audience of SGML users that are considering migrating their language resources to XML. This paper presents the recommendations made by the TF, concentrating on strategic considerations, the practical guide, and one case study, the conversion of the British National Corpus.	british national corpus;consortium;franz lisp;hadamard transform;powell's method;standard generalized markup language;text encoding initiative;xml	Syd Bauman;Alejandro Bia;Lou Burnard;Tomaz Erjavec;Christine Ruotolo;Susan Schreibman	2004			ruleml;artificial intelligence;document type definition;xml;natural language processing;pcdata;collaborative application markup language;xhtml;markup language;database;computer science;sgml	Web+IR	-33.72591002796811	-74.75532550651477	78312

Information, communication and technology have greatly transformed healthcare practice the world over. Nursing is continually exposed to a variety of changes. Variables including age, educational level, years worked in nursing, computer knowledge and experience have been found to influence the attitudes of nurses towards computerisation. The purpose of the study was to determine the attitudes of nurses towards the use of computers and the factors that influence these attitudes.   METHODS This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted among staff nurses working at one public hospital (Kenyatta National Hospital, (KNH) and one private hospital (Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). A convenience sample of 200 nurses filled the questionnaires. Data was collected using the modified Nurses' Attitudes Towards Computerisation (NATC) questionnaire.   RESULTS Nurses had a favorable attitude towards computerisation. Non-users had a significantly higher attitude score compared to the users (p = 0.0274). Statistically significant associations were observed with age (p = 0.039), level of education (p = 0.025), duration of exposure to computers (p = 0.025) and attitudes towards computerisation.   CONCLUSION Generally, nurses have positive attitudes towards computerisation.This information is important for the planning and implementation of computerisation in the hospital as suggested in other studies.	accident and emergency department;amiga advanced graphics architecture;aspartylglucosaminuria;attitude;computer;convenience sampling;description;fill;hospitals, private;hospitals, public;illness (finding);knowledge acquisition;questionnaire domain	Mathew K.

79d7e4c17150b8fd54edc1bb9ddf5d7b12858fda	your activities of daily living (yadl): an image-based survey technique for patients with arthritis		Healthcare professionals use Activities of Daily Living (ADL) to characterize a patient’s functional status and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment plans. ADLs are traditionally measured using standardized text-based questionnaires and the only form of personalization is in the form of question branching logic. Pervasive smartphone adoption makes it feasible to consider more frequent patient-reporting on ADLs. However, asking generic sets of questions repeatedly introduces user burden and fatigue that threatens to interfere with their utility. We introduce an approach called YADL (Your Activities of Daily Living) which uses images of ADLs and personalization to improve survey efficiency and the patient-experience.

The system is linked to a documentation program via a medical data dictionary and allows an on-line application of knowledge modules to clinical data. Different rule sets were generated by automatic rule generation (C4.5) from a prospective database. The rule sets and two published diagnostic scores were evaluated on a test set, resulting in a diagnostic accuracy of 57% for a general knowledge module and between 44 and 88% for specific knowledge modules. The program is fully functioning and has been evaluated carefully in 14 German hospitals.	expert system	Hans-Peter Eich;Christian Ohmann;Konrad Lang	1997		10.1109/CBMS.1997.596400	decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining	HCI	-54.3709944351218	-66.17215360867702	78635
8d678c648b8626a96fdadb8c066b6b86c81aab88	research and applications: automatic lymphoma classification with sentence subgraph mining from pathology reports	automatic lymphoma classification;natural language processing;pathology reports;sentence subgraph mining	OBJECTIVE Pathology reports are rich in narrative statements that encode a complex web of relations among medical concepts. These relations are routinely used by doctors to reason on diagnoses, but often require hand-crafted rules or supervised learning to extract into prespecified forms for computational disease modeling. We aim to automatically capture relations from narrative text without supervision.   METHODS We design a novel framework that translates sentences into graph representations, automatically mines sentence subgraphs, reduces redundancy in mined subgraphs, and automatically generates subgraph features for subsequent classification tasks. To ensure meaningful interpretations over the sentence graphs, we use the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus to map token subsequences to concepts, and in turn sentence graph nodes. We test our system with multiple lymphoma classification tasks that together mimic the differential diagnosis by a pathologist. To this end, we prevent our classifiers from looking at explicit mentions or synonyms of lymphomas in the text.   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We compare our system with three baseline classifiers using standard n-grams, full MetaMap concepts, and filtered MetaMap concepts. Our system achieves high F-measures on multiple binary classifications of lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma, 0.8; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 0.909; follicular lymphoma, 0.84; Hodgkin lymphoma, 0.912). Significance tests show that our system outperforms all three baselines. Moreover, feature analysis identifies subgraph features that contribute to improved performance; these features agree with the state-of-the-art knowledge about lymphoma classification. We also highlight how these unsupervised relation features may provide meaningful insights into lymphoma classification.	accident and emergency department;b-cell lymphomas;baseline (configuration management);burkitt lymphoma;classification;clinical data;conflict (psychology);consent forms;diffuse large b-cell lymphoma;encode;exception handling;exponential hierarchy;grams;graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;ground truth;interpretation process;leukemia, b-cell;lymphoma, follicular;lymphoma, large-cell, follicular;machine learning;manuscripts;mined;n-gram;national library of medicine (u.s.);neoplasms;netware loadable module;patients;ps (unix);redundancy (engineering);rule (guideline);supervised learning;switch statement;waiver;gram;pathology report;sentence	Yuan Luo;Aliyah R.

Although patients have expressed greater desire to participate in decision-makings of their healthcare, it can be problematic for them to accumulate large amount of information and using it for making an optimal choice in hospital selection. The aim of this research is to develop a decision engine for hospital selection (DEHS) to support patients while accessing healthcare resources. DEHS applied the analytic hierarchy process and the geographic information system to aggregate different decision factors and spatial information. The results were evaluated through investigating the consistency of the preferences that users inputted, the degree that the results match patient choices, the satisfactions of users, and the helpfulness of the results. Data were collected for 3 months. One hundred and four users visited DEHS and 85.5 % of them used DEHS more than once. Recommendations of the institutes (36 %) was ranked as the primary decision factor that most users concerned. Sixty-seven percent of the sessions searched for hospitals and 33 % for clinics. Eighty-eight percent of the results matched the choices of patients. Eighty-three percent of the users agreed that the suggested results were satisfactory, and 70 % agreed that the information were helpful. The DEHS provides the patients with simple measurements and individualized list of suggested medical institutes, and allows them to make decisions based on credible information and consults the experiences of others at the same time. The suggested results were considered satisfactory and helpful.	aggregate data;analytical hierarchy;choice behavior;clinic;consultation;decision making;decision support system;experience;genetic selection;geographic information system;patients;recommender system;satisfaction	Lichin Chen;Chih-Min Chan;Hung-Chang Lee;Yu-Fang Chung;Feipei Lai	2014	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-014-0059-4	analytic hierarchy process;medicine;computer science;knowledge management;nursing;data mining;geographic information system;management;computer security	HCI	-58.8275782393393	-67.11509031446577	78819

A new health care paradigm with focus on chronic treatment and care will actualize the need for interoperable standards based services due to the complexity of care where different health levels and professions are involved. Given the complexity of the domain, we argue the need for a systematic and formal approach to the development of interoperable information systems if there shall be any real support of the cooperating actors. We describe our work on technical interoperability done in the Linkcare project addressing new models of care and technology to support them in the domain of the chronically ill using concrete results from an architecture built using the MAFIIA architecture framework and the UML 2.0 profile for software services, and argue that building formal architectural descriptions on the basis of shared interface descriptions and profiles are an important part of achieving continuity of care based on sustainable health systems.	architecture framework;chronic disease;description;health care;information systems;information system;interface device component;interoperability;occupations;programming paradigm;scott continuity;unified modeling language;standards characteristics	Marius Mikalsen;Ståle Walderhaug;Per Håkon Meland;Ole Martin Winnem	2007	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-58603-774-1-3	library science;medicine;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-55.50876489634883	-61.275093268734054	79771

The study tests a perceptual cycle model in which motorcycles are detected less frequently because they fall lower on the attentional hierarchy for driving.   METHOD A driving-related IB task with photographs of driving situations investigated whether an additional stimulus, a taxi or motorcycle, would be more likely to be missed by participants. In Experiments 2 and 3, the """"threat value"""" of objects in the scene were varied to determine the degree to which this influences participants' tendency to notice motorcycles.   RESULTS Participants were twice as likely to miss a motorcycle compared with a taxi. Moreover, participants reported that they would expect to miss a motorcycle on the road. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants modulated their attention to accommodate motorcycles when necessary, suggesting that motorcycles are afforded the lowest level of attentional bandwidth.   CONCLUSION Inattentional blindness forms a good psychological framework for understanding LBFTS crashes, particularly in the context of attentional set, such that LBFTS crashes occur because motorcycles do not feature strongly in a typical driver's attentional set for driving.   APPLICATION The findings here are important because LBFTS crashes can be reduced if we can change the expectations of road users around the presence of motorcycles on the road."""	banner blindness;deaf-blind disorders;experiment;modulation;motorcycles;night blindness;physical object;taxi;insurance cost due to aodu;photograph	Kristen Pammer;Stephanie Sabadas;Stephanie Lentern	2018	Human factors	10.1177/0018720817733901		HCI	-46.547384749825916	-52.91880009445835	79878

Users have problems understanding the operations of a pervasive computing solution, and therefore they should trust that the solution works properly and according to their expectations. Nevertheless, the concept of trust is already framed in a specific use within the ecosystem of applications that can populate a smart space. To take this concept of trust to the whole space, we propose to study and define the concept of confidence. In contrast to the concept of trust, confidence has deeper psychological implications.

Such “documents born digital” range from plain text documents such as emails to more sophisticated forms such as PDF documents and Web documents. On the one hand, the existence of the digital encoding of documents eliminates the need for scanning, image processing, and character recognition in most situations (a notable exception being the prevalent use of text embedded in images for Web documents, as elaborated upon in section “Analysis of Text in Web Images”). On the other hand, many higher-level processing tasks remain due to the fact that the design purpose of almost existing digital document encoding systems (i.e., HTML, PDF) is for display or printing for human consumption, not for machine-level information exchange and extraction. As such, significant amount of processing is still required for automatic information extraction, indexing, and content repurposing from such documents, and many challenges exist in this process. This chapter describes in detail the key technologies for processing documents born digital, with a focus on PDF and Web document processing.	document processing;email;embedded system;html;image processing;information exchange;information extraction;optical character recognition;portable document format;printing;web page	Jianying Hu;Ying Liu	2014		10.1007/978-0-85729-859-1_26	image processing;information extraction;information retrieval;encoding (memory);born-digital;information exchange;search engine indexing;plain text;computer science;repurposing	Web+IR	-38.80002917832015	-59.05750984671688	79939

The matching algorithm, by comparing the document structure against the one the DTD requires, is able to identify commonalities and differences. Differences can be due to the presence of extra elements with respect to those the DTD requires and to the absence of required elements. The evaluation of commonalities and differences gives raise to a numerical rank of the structural similarity. Moreover, in the paper, some applications of the matching algorithm are discussed. Specifically, the matching algorithm is exploited for the classification of XML documents against a set of DTDs, the evolution of the DTD structure, the evaluation of structural queries, the selective dissemination of XML documents, and the protection of XML document contents.	algorithm;numerical analysis;structural similarity;xml	Elisa Bertino;Giovanna Guerrini;Marco Mesiti	2004	Inf.

50dc8124d81c55cfff791ca21ea678381fe02560	evaluating the impact of a new interactive digital solution for collecting care quality information for residential homes	qa75 electronic computers computer science;hm sociology	Collecting and analysing timely and accurate information about the quality of care that is delivered to older people in residential homes is a challenge. Most current approaches to collecting this information are manual, and add time, cost and human error to them. Interactive digital technologies have the potential to reduce the time consumed, cost and errors in these processes, which in turn can support resolution of an important social challenge. However, designing these interactions can be problematic. In this paper we report the use of a new interactive digital solution that was designed to improve the completeness and timeliness of care quality data that was collected from 233 residential nursing and care homes for older people in and around London. Use of the digital solution led to a significant increase in the numbers of residential homes that submitted the correct care quality information by each quarterly deadline. However, qualitative evidence from the residential homes revealed low-level usability problems experienced by care staff that might be indicative of continuing usability issues in the care sector. The paper ends with lessons drawn to improve uptake of digital technologies in residential care.		Max Schubmann;Rebecca Sulley;Michael McHugh;Alex Lai;Neil A. M.

a94ecdee97871fa0528954a33bbbd164805695bb	supervised methods to support online scientific data triage		This paper presents machine learning approaches based on supervised methods applied to triage of health and biomedical data. We discuss the applications of such approaches in three different tasks, and evaluate the usage of triage pipelines, as well as data sampling and feature selection methods to improve performance on each task. The scientific data triage systems are based on a generic and light pipeline, and yet flexible enough to perform triage on distinct data. The presented approaches were developed to be integrated as a part of web-based systems, providing real time feedback to health and biomedical professionals. All systems are publicly available as open-source.	supervised learning	Hayda Almeida;Marc Queudot;Leila Kosseim;Marie-Jean Meurs	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59041-7_13	data science;machine learning;data mining	HPC	-48.401871745876214	-65.33499354801721	80443
13c1b68566d7a1cf69f030c904b7869e02517a84	building an effective ontology for assistive technology		The aim of this paper was to develop and validate an ontology for one class of assistive technology (AT), namely physically controllable pointing devices, using the Delphi method. Six occupational therapists with AT expertise identified important items and categories to the pointing device prescription through a three-round, structured process consisting of responses to a series of questionnaires. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the interrater reliability of items included in categories related to the pointing devices and to the user profile. During the first round, the ICC ranged from 0.19 to 0.97; this improved to ICCs ranging from 0.72 to 1.0 during the second round. A full consensus was reached by the experts during the final round which included 218 items, divided into five categories, for the pointing device list, and 168 items, divided into six categories, for the user profile list. This ontology is expected to help achieve a more systematic regulation of the AT field, leading to greater standardization and increased knowledge sharing.	assistive technology;categories;coefficient;correlation study;delphi method;inter-rater reliability;ontology;pointing device;test-retest reliability;user profile	Alexandra Danial-Saad;Tsvi Kuflik;Patrice L.

However, due to the limitation of mobile devices, there is a need to develop new technologies to facilitate the browsing of large pictures on the small screen. In this paper, we propose a set of novel approaches which are able to aid or automate common image browsing tasks on mobile devices. All of these approaches are based on an image attention model which is employed to illustrate the information structure within an image. An efficient algorithm to generate the optimal browsing path based on the information foraging theory is presented.

Patients with previous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations were invited to participate in a 6-month randomized telemedicine trial. For eligible patients, reasons for refusal were registered. Of 560 eligible patients, 279 (50%) declined to participate in the trial, 257 (92%) reported a reason: 53 (20.6%) technical concerns, 164 (63.8%) personal reasons, 17 (6.6%) preferred outpatient clinic visits, and 23 (8.9%) did not want to participate in clinical research. Compared to consenting patients, subjects declining participation were significantly older, more often female, had higher lung function (%predicted), lower body mass index, higher admission-rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the previous year, and were more often diagnosed with osteoporosis. Many eligible patients decline participating in a controlled tele-healthcare trial and, furthermore, a tailored approach for recruiting females and elderly patients appears appropriate.	body mass index;chronic obstructive airway disease;human body weight;lung diseases, obstructive;lung diseases;osteoporosis;patient visit;patients;randomized algorithm;refusal to participate;registration;respiratory physiology;telemedicine;telephone number;television	Eva Broendum;Charlotte Suppli Ulrik;Thorbjorn Gregersen;Ejvind Frausing Hansen;Allan Green;Thomas Ringbaek	2018	Health informatics journal	10.1177/1460458216667166	medicine;decision support system;physical medicine and rehabilitation;computer science;physical therapy;nursing;ehealth;medical emergency	ML	-59.46797644172831	-65.05492310070017	80701
95cb5fe0c73c0beecf46944a41fe298886804318	synthesizing analytic evidence to refine care pathways		Care pathways play significant roles in delivering evidence-based and coordinated care to patients with specific conditions. In order to put care pathways into practice, clinical institutions always need to adapt them based on local care settings so that the best local practices can be incorporated and used to develop refined pathways. However, it is knowledge-intensive and error-prone to incorporate various analytic insights from local data sets. In order to assist care pathway developers in working effectively and efficiently, we propose to automatically synthesize the analytical evidences derived from multiple analysis methods, and recommend modelling operations accordingly to derive a refined care pathway for a specific patient cohort. We validated our method by adapting a Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Ambulatory Care Pathway for patients with additional condition of COPD through synthesizing the results of variation analysis and frequent pattern mining against patient records.	cognitive dimensions of notations;congestive heart failure;gene regulatory network;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;patients;variable rules analysis	Haifeng Liu;Xiang Li;Yiqin Yu;Jing Mei;Guo Tong Xie;Adam Perer;Fei Wang;Jianying Hu	2015	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-512-8-70	data mining;ambulatory care;cohort;medicine	ML	-53.91590869304094	-68.98650623614469	80932

Our first contribution is that we developed an algorithm that incorporates a comprehensive set of heuristics, some of which are novel, in a single unified framework. The second contribution is that we conducted a relatively large-scale experiment, and analysis of our results revealed the characteristics of the problem of finding movedWeb pages. We demonstrated empirically that the problem of searching for moved pages is different from typical information retrieval problems. First, it is impossible to identify the final destination until the page is moved, so the index-server approach is not necessarily effective. Secondly, there is a large bias about where the new address is likely to be and crawler-based solutions can be effectively implemented, avoiding the need to search the entire Web. We analyzed the experimental results in detail to show how important each heuristic is in real Web settings, and conducted statistical analyses to show that our algorithm succeeds in correctly finding new links for more than 70% of broken links at 95% confidence level.	algorithm;dynamic web page;experiment;heuristic (computer science);information retrieval;link rot;locality of reference;relocation (computing);server (computing);unified framework;web crawler;web server	Atsuyuki Morishima;Akiyoshi Nakamizo;Toshinari Iida;Shigeo Sugimoto;Hiroyuki Kitagawa	2009		10.1145/1557914.1557921	simulation;confidence interval;computer science;data mining;operations research;world wide web	Web+IR	-37.99603743084543	-59.455307927921375	81035
b02dd7f0bb1b33597700c2a2e94f12cab1d83b81	the use of a filemaker pro database in evaluating sign language notation systems		In this paper, FileMaker Pro has been used to create a database in order to evaluate sign language notation systems used for representing hand configurations. The database cited in this paper focuses on child acquisition data, particularly the dataset of one child and one adult productions of the same American Sign Language (ASL) signs produced in a two-year span. The hand configurations in selected signs have been coded using Stokoe notation (Stokoe, Casterline & Croneberg, 1965), the Hamburg Notation System or HamNoSys (Prillwitz et al, 1989), the revised Prosodic Model Handshape Coding system or PM (Eccarius & Brentari, 2008) and Sign Language Phonetic Annotation or SLPA, a notation system that has grown from the Movement-Hold Model (Johnson & Liddell, 2010, 2011a, 2011b, 2012). Data was pulled from ELAN transcripts, organized and notated in a FileMaker Pro database created to investigate the representativeness of each system. Representativeness refers to the ability of the notation system to represent the hand configurations in the dataset. This paper briefly describes the design of the FileMaker Pro database intended to provide both quantitative and qualitative information in order to allow the sign language researcher to examine the representativeness of sign language notation systems.	filemaker	Julie Hochgesang	2014			natural language processing;computer science;database;programming language	NLP	-35.82276385974828	-76.63023804211768	81042

A number of active ageing initiatives are being developed nowadays to foster healthy habits in the population. This paper presents our contribution to these initiatives in the form of a conversational agent that acts as a coach for physical activities. The agent can be developed as an Android app running on smartphones and coupled with cheap widely available sport sensors in order to provide meaningful coaching. It can be employed to prepare exercise sessions, provide feedback during the sessions, and to discuss the results after the exercise. It incorporates an affective component that informs dynamic user models to produce adaptive interaction strategies.	mhealth;sentience;sentient computing	Zoraida Callejas Carrión;David Griol;Michael F.

e88d6832990283b22f8be737fa87776ab0636736	sb simulator: a method to estimate how relation develops	agent simulation;balance theory;human relation;socion theory	People spend their everyday life while expecting social relations between them and the others. However, the expectation causes a trouble or a misunderstanding because they grasp the relations from their subjective viewpoint. It is useful that a computer software assists people to grasp the relations by showing the possible variations of the relation. This paper proposes a simulator named SB Simulator that accepts current relations which a user grasps and simulates the course of the development of relations between them based on Heider`s balance theory and Socion theory. The aim of SB Simulator is to make the user know what changes in the relations happen if s/he takes an action. In particular, SB Simulator generates possible initial relations before starting the simulation, which compensate for the possibility that the user grabs the current relations incorrectly from her/his subjective viewpoint. The function of generating the initial relations has a role in raising a user's awareness of the other possibilities of relations. Moreover, since SB Simulator employs Socion Theory to express the relations, it can distinguish relations which people recognize subjectively from the ones existing objectively, and simulate possible relations based on dynamics between the subjective and objective relations. The paper evaluates SB Simulator in terms of whether the results of the simulation are acceptable in contrast to the typical course of relation development. The result indicated that SB Simulator simulated the relations properly based on the initial relations.	algorithm;balance theory;game theory;sandy bridge;simulation	Taichi Sono;Toshihiro Osumi;Michita Imai	2014		10.1145/2658861.2658885	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	AI	-51.78275493824401	-52.824560874243154	81092

Although it seems self-evident that this should be so, this experiment was intended to verify this and to provide some time comparisons for the two methods. The experiment consisted of randomly selecting ultrasound and computed tomography cases and determining how long it took to retrieve files at a PACS workstation or in person from the file room. To simulate actual retrieval volumes, a total of 40 cases from current to 6 months old, 20 cases from the past year, and 10 cases more than 1 year old was selected. Results indicate that PACS retrieval can indeed be faster than file room retrieval. However, the difference is less for recent cases than for older cases. For cases 6 or fewer months old, the workstation retrieval was approximately 2.5 minutes faster per case than the film file room. This time difference increased markedly when extended to the 1-year and older-than-1-year groups. This report details the results of this study and provides information about the reliability of the two archives.	archive;ct scan;picture archiving and communication system;randomness;simulation;workstation;x-ray computed tomography	Steven C.

GO annotation is a major activity in most model organism database projects and annotates gene functions using a controlled vocabulary. As a first step toward automatic GO annotation, we aim to assign GO domain codes given a specific gene and an article in which the gene appears, which is one of the task challenges at the TREC 2004 Genomics Track. We approached the task with careful consideration of the specialized terminology and paid special attention to dealing with various forms of gene synonyms, so as to exhaustively locate the occurrences of the target gene. We extracted the words around the gene occurrences and used them to represent the gene for GO domain code annotation. As a classifier, we adopted a variant of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) with supervised term weighting schemes to improve the performance, making our method among the top-performing systems in the TREC official evaluation. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our proposed framework is successfully applied to another task of the Genomics Track, showing comparable results to the best performing system.	categorization;code;controlled vocabulary;document classification;gene ontology;jargon	Kazuhiro Seki;Javed Mostafa	2005		10.1145/1076034.1076060	natural language processing;controlled vocabulary;computer science;bioinformatics;machine learning;data mining;world wide web;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;information retrieval	Comp.	-35.057596786762154	-69.74007027261854	81125

The use of the universally recognized standards for the information and knowledge transmission and storage can be an excellent instrument to develop innovative eHealth solution. A EN13606 compliant telemonitoring solution is described in this paper; it is based on a collection and a semantic organization of sensor data, a standardized information transmission and storage within an internal repository during the monitoring period. This solution represents an example of care continuum concretization completely integrated with European Health System directives.	information system;triune continuum paradigm	Roberta Gazzarata;Fabio Vergari;Jan-Marc Verlinden;Francesco Morandi;Simone Naso;Viola Parodi;Tullio Salmon Cinotti;Mauro Giacomini	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-30779-9_14	semantic interoperability;telecommunications;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;ehealth;standardization	AI	-54.9991112388303	-62.1671522175652	81161

One of the leading causes of maternal death in the developing world is pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy condition that is characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. In an effort to drastically reduce cases of pre-eclampsia, Italy-based Giunti Labs is helping the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology and the Oxford Maternal & Perinatal Health Institute (Green Templeton College) at the University of Oxford in the U.K. develop educational material on maternal health for midwives, nurses, and doctors in developing countries, notably India, Mexico, and Nigeria.

Eye tracking performance was recorded as participants viewed banner ads of different information complexity. High median thinking participants were characterized by a flexible perceptual processing style. Their eye tracking performance showed that they responded to information complexity of the banner ads and attempted to integrate information spatially for low complexity banners. Less effortful (and more fluent) eye tracking performance was associated with more positive banner evaluation and the relationship was mediated by experienced fluency in high median thinkers. Information complexity also guided eye tracking. These findings demonstrated the potential of eye tracking measures in predicting effects of culture (and design) related factors on banner evaluation.	eye tracking;information;web banner	Man-Ying Wang;Da-Lung Tang;Chih-Tung Kao;Vincent C.

Several papers detail scenarios in which these technologies may support clinicians in their daily work processes, but their specific characteristics suggest such technologies also could be useful for surveillance and subsequent control of employees. Until now, only little attention has focused on resolving such issues. On the basis of 16 in-depth interviews with medical staff from three German hospitals, this study identifies a reserved attitude and several acceptance problems among interviewees. The qualitative data indicate 10 hypotheses, tested using a questionnaire study of 215 nurses in training from Germany and India. The investigation of the quantitative data relies on partial least squares modeling to identify and categorise problems with user acceptance of ambient intelligence and mobile systems on various levels. The results of this mixed methods study mainly indicate that German participants assess ambient intelligence much more critically. Consequently, specific strategies for implementing such technologies should be adopted.	ambient intelligence;categorization;partial least squares regression	Tyge-F.

The platform introduces a novel approach to annotation by providing annotators immediate feedback whether the data they mark are substantiated: for positive entailment pairs, the system uses the annotations to search for a formal logical proof that validates the entailment relation; for negative pairs, the system verifies that a countermodel can be constructed. By integrating a web-based user-interface, a formal lexicon, a lambda-calculus engine and an offthe-shelf theorem prover, this platform facilitates the creation of annotated corpora of textual entailment. A corpus of several hundred annotated entailments is currently in preparation using the platform and will be available for the research community.	automated theorem proving;finite-state machine;formal proof;item unique identification;lambda calculus;lexicon;proof (truth);text corpus;textual entailment;user interface;web application	Assaf Toledo;Stavroula Alexandropoulou;Sophie Chesney;Robert Grimm;Pepijn Kokke;Benno Kruit;Kyriaki Neophytou;Antony Nguyen;Yoad Winter	2014		10.3115/v1/E14-2020	natural language processing;computer science;data mining;information retrieval	NLP	-36.38513968895398	-76.39300394759225	81394

More recently therapeutic robots have been proposed as a solution. However, there is limited research on the efficacy of deploying therapeutic robots to provide socio-emotional support to older adults. This study investigates the potential of the Paro robot seal to support older adults' needs while avoiding some of the limitations of current pet therapy approaches.

A question answering system heavily depends on the effectiveness of a retrieval system: If a retrieval system fails to find any relevant documents for a question, further processing steps to extract an answer will inevitably fail, too. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of some common retrieval techniques with respect to their usefulness for question answering.	baseline (configuration management);document retrieval;precision and recall;question answering;stemming	Christof Monz	2003		10.1007/3-540-36618-0_44	lemmatisation;relevance;question answering;vector space;computer science;artificial intelligence;comparative research;stemming;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-35.84687278127748	-62.40344053585388	81587

A suite of computer technologies delivering speech, image, and natural language understanding can automatically derive descriptive metadata for such resources. Difficulties for end users ensue, however, with the tremendous volume and varying quality of automated metadata for multimedia information systems. This lecture surveys automatic metadata creation methods for dealing with multimedia information resources, using broadcast news, documentaries, and oral histories as examples. Strategies for improving the utility of such metadata are discussed, including computationally intensive approaches, leveraging multimodal redundancy, folding in context, and leaving precision-recall tradeoffs under user control. Interfaces building from automatically generated metadata are presented, illustrating the use of video surrogates in multimedia information systems. Traditional information retrieval evaluation is discussed through the annual National Institute of Standards and Technology TRECVID forum, with experiments on exploratory search extending the discussion beyond fact-finding to broader, longer term search activities of learning, analysis, synthesis, and discovery.	experiment;exploratory search;information retrieval;information system;internet;multimodal interaction;natural language understanding;refinement (computing);surrogates;user interface	Michael G.

BACKGROUND The NASA-TLX has been used extensively to demonstrate that vigilance tasks impose a high level of workload on observers. However, this instrument does not specify the information-processing resources needed for task performance. The MRQ offers a tool to measure the workload associated with vigilance assignments in which such resources can be identified.   METHOD Two experiments were performed in which factors known to influence task demand were varied. Included were the detection of stimulus presence or absence, detecting critical signals by means of successive-type (absolute judgment) and simultaneous-type (comparative judgment) discriminations, and operating under multitask vs. single-task conditions.   RESULTS The MRQ paralleled the NASA-TLX in showing that vigilance tasks generally induce high levels of workload and that workload scores are greater in detecting stimulus absence than presence and in making successive as compared to simultaneous-type discriminations. Additionally, the MRQ was more effective than the NASA-TLX in reflecting higher workload in the context of multitask than in single-task conditions. The resource profiles obtained with MRQ fit well with the nature of the vigilance tasks employed, testifying to the scale's content validity.   CONCLUSION The MRQ may be a meaningful addition to the NASA-TLX for measuring the workload of vigilance assignments.   APPLICATION By uncovering knowledge representation associated with different tasks, the MRQ may aid in designing operational vigilance displays.	adenosine 0.008 g in 20 g topical patch [aqua collagen solu tion coenzyme q10 hydroge l mask];cd46 protein, human;complement system proteins;computer multitasking;dimensions;entity;experiment;grams;high-level programming language;information processing;interference (communication);judgment;knowledge representation and reasoning;lens (device);multiple personality disorder;nasa (plant);numerous;opera (web browser);sensor;united states national aeronautics and space administration;gram;methanol-com methyltransferase complex;observers;v-sis genes	Victor S.

Allowing the crew to control aircraft systems through display unit by using keyboard and cursor control unit is one of the main novelties in the new generation cockpits based on ARINC 661 standard. Currently only secondary aircraft systems are managed using such interactive cockpits. Generalisation to other aircraft systems would require introducing mechanisms aiming at ensuring the fault-tolerance of such interaction in cockpits. Such mechanisms would allow designers to take into account the new functions' safety requirement. However, it is possible that such mechanisms may have consequences (positive and/or negative ones) on the crew activities. This paper reports studies that have been performed on fault-tolerance mechanisms in the domain of ARINC 661 interactive cockpits. More precisely this paper focuses on interactive systems, showing how these fault-tolerance mechanisms (mainly redundancy as segregation and diversity are not exemplified here) could affect the usability of the interactive system, making both the tasks of the crew members and their training more complex. We propose a generic approach to analyse the trade-offs between dependability and usability in a software interactive cockpit environment.	arinc 661;control unit;cursor (databases);dependability;fault tolerance;interactivity;usability	Camille Fayollas;Célia Martinie;Philippe A.

b4055e18c501582aab01f08044d6422b0cd0e5a0	term-mouse-fixations as an additional indicator for topical user interests in domain-specific search		Models in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) are grounded very much on the user's task in order to give system support based on different task types and topics. However, the automatic recognition of user interests from log data in search systems is not trivial. Search queries entered by users a surely one such source. However, queries may be short, or users are only browsing. In this paper, we propose a method of term-mouse-fixations which takes the fixations on terms users are hovering over with the mouse into consideration to estimate topical user interests. We analyzed 22,259 search sessions of a domain-specific digital library over a period of about four months. We compared these mouse fixations to user-entered search terms and to titles and keywords from documents the user showed an interest in. These terms were found in 87.12% of all analyzed sessions; in this subset of sessions, per session on average 11.46 term-mouse-fixations from queries and viewed documents were found. These terms were fixated significantly longer with about 7 seconds than other terms with about 4.4 seconds. This means, term-mouse-fixations provide indicators for topical user interests and it is possible to extract them based on fixation time.	digital library;field research;infinite impulse response;information retrieval;information source;personalization;session (web analytics);web search query	Daniel Hienert;Dagmar Kern	2017		10.1145/3121050.3121088	data mining;digital library;information retrieval;computer science	Web+IR	-33.738107170040266	-53.20467732639515	82055

However, lack of physical and mental fitness threatens their effectiveness is making them to drain the community resources instead of positive and productive contributions. Our studies show the need for a massive large-scale boost in two main dimensions of physical and mental health enhancement. In order to solve this problem, in this paper we propose a new low-cost and innovative adoption of augmented reality (AR) functions through an agile deployment of mobile-based augmented reality (mAR) embedded in massively available intelligent smartphones. In our proposed method a set of downloadable AR-enabled embedded learning and exercising programs, designed upon users’ historical and habitual improvement data would enable a collective sequence of required activities and individually optimized. At the system design level upon the individually recorded data in various databases select and configure the most suitable set of downloadable programs—a combination of mental and physical activities. From our experiment we provide some of our statistical results for two distinct application areas of mAR: ‘exercising-rehab’ and ‘lifelong learning’. Three sets of results show the age related results for three user critical features of ‘ease of use’, ‘usefulness’ and ‘user attitude’. Further analysis of data through modeling helps us to provide a systematic design procedure based on user’s age in conjunction with other variables.	agile software development;augmented reality;data modeling;database;embedded system;general computer corporation;mhealth;mind;mind–body problem;population;smartphone;software deployment;systems design	Kuei-Fang Hsiao;Habib F.

It is a comparative study of the results between the traditional training where students go directly from the classroom to real machine operation in the woods and a new VR augmented training. The results indicate that the addition of 25 hours of hands-on VR training increases by 23% the volume of wood harvested and reduces by 26% the repair and maintenance costs during the first month of operation in forest. The use of VR also allowed precise recording and monitoring of the evolution of trainees' performance during their training sessions, showing learning curves that decrease with time for all the defined performance criteria (execution time, error rate and precision). The field trials were held in a training center with four classes of eleven students in wood harvesting and are the first known experiments concerning the use of virtual reality technologies for the training of students in forestry.	experiment;graphical user interface;hands-on computing;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;virtual reality	Jean-François Lapointe;Jean-Marc Robert	2000	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1012045305968	human performance technology;simulation;computer science;virtual reality;multimedia	HCI	-54.18925245913832	-57.75214439498903	82121

The method of the research stared by selecting purposive sampling with three selected resources; labor vocabulary from law dictionary, vocabulary from 75 posts in the page of Ministry of Labor and vocabulary from the Labor Protection Act, BE 2541 (1998). The methodology divided into three parts. The first part is data analysis that divided into two steps, words grouping and the semantics concept and its relations analysis. The second part is a structure of Protection Act analysis and the third part is data link to create ontology. The result of data analysis shows that the words could be grouped into nineteen roughly categories. For the result of text structure analysis on Protection Act, it is easy to construct ontology with three hierarchical level of semantic concepts those are Protection Act, section and CHAPER. Then it can create ontology by linking eighteen vocabulary sets together with internal and external data linking by using five types of relation: synonym, antonym, hypernym, hyponym and meronym..	dictionary;sampling (signal processing);vocabulary;xslt/muenchian grouping	Mukda Suktarachan;Pacharagorn Jukhamsri	2018		10.1145/3281375.3281410	knowledge management;christian ministry;natural language processing;data link;synonym;nonprobability sampling;semantics;ontology;computer science;artificial intelligence;vocabulary	NLP	-38.40867662488321	-71.04070141115032	82156
8d7621b631a0d615b9b3f700bf84159869fc81a1	user interface for customizing patents search: an exploratory study		Prior art searching is a critical and knowledge-intensive step in the examination process of a patent application. Historically, the approach to automated prior art searching is to determine a few keywords from the patent application and, based on simple text frequency matching of these keywords, retrieve published applications and patents. Several emerging techniques show promise to increase the accuracy of automated searching, including analysis of: named entity extraction, explanations of how patents are classified, relationships between references cited by the examiner, weighing words found in some sections of the patent application differently than others, and lastly using the examiners’ domain knowledge such as synonyms. These techniques are explored in this study. Our approach is firstly, to design a user interface that leverages the above-mentioned processing techniques for the user and secondly, to provide visual cues that can guide examiner to fine tune search algorithms. The user interface displays a number of controls that affect the behavior of the underlying search algorithm—a tag cloud of the top keywords used to retrieve patents, sliders for weights on the different sections of a patent application (e.g., abstract, claims, title or specification), and a list of synonyms and stop-words. Users are provided with visual icons that give quick indication of the quality of the results, such as whether the results share a feature with the patent-at-issue, such as both citing to the same reference or having a common classification. This exploratory study shows results of seven variations of the search algorithm on a test corpus of 100500 patent documents.	exploratory testing;user interface	Arthi M.

The German Vascoda project provides this service for dozens of information sources. Its ultimate goal is to provide search quality close to the ranking of a central database containing documents from all participating libraries. Currently, however, the Vascoda portal is based on a non-cooperative metasearch approach, where results from sources are merged randomly and ranking quality is sub-optimal. In this paper, we describe a Lucene-based plugin which replaces this method by a truly federated search across different search engines, where the exchange of document statistics improves document ranking.

A Cochrane systematic review identified 15 included studies. A critique of these studies, using the eight components of the STIN framework, illustrated very clearly the different assumptions made about the purpose of home uterine monitoring, and helped to explain the different outcomes. The final mapping stage suggested that systems architecture choices included that of the role of monitoring support, to complement patient education or to enhance education for provider and patient. A similar choice concerned the type and extent of patient-care-provider contacts to be used. Using the STIN framework provided a useful perspective on the telemedicine aspects of home uterine monitoring, providing value beyond the systematic review conclusions alone.	choice behavior;cochrane library;complement system proteins;health informatics journal;health services;information system;interaction;liver failure, acute;patients;philosophy;radiology information systems;review [publication type];scientific publication;sociotechnical system;systematic review;systems architecture;telemedicine;universities;uterine monitoring;uterus;benefit	Christine Urquhart;Rosemary Currell	2010	Health informatics journal	10.1177/1460458210377481	interaction network;intensive care medicine;systematic review;medicine;systems architecture	HCI	-57.65040016458371	-63.998819071944446	82278

Biofeedback is an emerging technology being used as a legitimate preventive health care technique for achieving higher levels of well-being and can also be used for stress management. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for personalizing relaxation techniques for stress management. The model considers both physiological reactions to various relaxation techniques and contextual information to optimize relaxation effectiveness. The long term objective is to teach users about what actually works best for them among several relaxation techniques. A case study for ubiquitous stress management application is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to provide users with feedback about what relaxation techniques work best for them as well as adapt to various environmental conditions.	iteration;linear programming relaxation;mathematical model;personalization;real life;simulation;usability testing	Mohamad A.

However, reorganizing data in this fashion may have unexpected consequences for the clinical decision-making process. To determine what these consequences might be, we conducted a pilot study using verbal protocols and video screen capture to characterize physician subjects' use of a traditional laboratory data display while reviewing unfamiliar inpatient cases. We found that subjects navigated to the laboratory display primarily to seek evidence confirming a result or problem identified elsewhere in the case. Additionally, 22% of the time subjects spontaneously reviewed anomalous findings and results related to other known problems. These results suggest that physicians have learned complex data acquisition behaviors for efficient interaction with source-oriented displays, and further study is needed to ensure that problem-oriented medical records do not lose the benefits of these behaviors.	behavior;computer monitor;data acquisition;decision making;electronic health records;electronics, medical;medical records, problem-oriented;protocols documentation;review [publication type];screencast;unintended consequences;benefit;inpatient	Andrew R.

The high volume of publications in the microbiology domain provides a rich source of up-to-date information on bacteria biotopes. This information, as found in scientific articles, is expressed in natural language and is rarely available in a structured format, such as a database. This information is of great importance for fundamental research and microbiology applications (e.g., medicine, agronomy, food, bioenergy). The automatic extraction of this information from texts will provide a great benefit to the field. We present a new method for extracting relationships between bacteria and their locations using the Alvis framework. Recognition of bacteria and their locations was achieved using a pattern-based approach and domain lexical resources. For the detection of environment locations, we propose a new approach that combines lexical information and the syntactic-semantic analysis of corpus terms to overcome the incompleteness of lexical resources. Bacteria location relations extend over sentence borders, and we developed domain-specific rules for dealing with bacteria anaphors. We participated in the BioNLP 2011 Bacteria Biotope (BB) task with the Alvis system. Official evaluation results show that it achieves the best performance of participating systems. New developments since then have increased the F-score by 4.1 points. We have shown that the combination of semantic analysis and domain-adapted resources is both effective and efficient for event information extraction in the bacteria biotope domain. We plan to adapt the method to deal with a larger set of location types and a large-scale scientific article corpus to enable microbiologists to integrate and use the extracted knowledge in combination with experimental data.	biomedical text mining;body of uterus;database;f1 score;fork bomb;habitat;information extraction;large;ninl gene;natural language processing;rule (guideline);scientific literature;semantic analysis (compilers);negative regulation of defense response to bacterium, incompatible interaction	Zorana Ratkovic;Wiktoria Golik;Pierre Warnier	2012		10.1186/1471-2105-13-S11-S8	biology;ecosystem;dna microarray;bacteria;biotechnology;computer science;bioinformatics;microbial ecology	NLP	-35.056220044739796	-69.83358589381365	82938

A scheme in three-dimensional space (barycentric plot) is used for a graphical representation of scientific research text correlations between the number of characters, the number of words, and the number of complex syllable words for sentences of several monolingual corpuses. The barycentric plots do not only drastically increase the visual information content in a given corpus, but at equal conditions of text-based corpus, they also contribute to the comparative analysis of different kinds of subject, section, author-style, journal, field, etc. As illustrated in present study, the proposed graphical approach can have broad implications and practical applications not only in scientometric field, but also in statistical linguistics, stylistic text research, and informetric research. This article explores the interdisciplinary approach research and applications of different areas of knowledge.	amazon web services;barycentric subdivision;diagram;faceted classification;graphical user interface;information retrieval;information science;informetrics;poincaré plot;qualitative comparative analysis;scientometrics;self-information;syllable;text corpus;text-based (computing)	Edoardo Magnone	2013	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-013-1074-9	natural language processing;speech recognition;computer science;data mining;linguistics;world wide web	NLP	-36.83915843087482	-71.65367654149512	82949

A corpus of 45.3 million pathology HL7 messages (including 119,581 histology and cytology reports) from a Queensland pathology repository for the year of 2009 was analysed by Medtex for cancer notification. Reports analysed by Medtex were consolidated at a patient level and compared against patients with notifiable cancers from the Queensland Oncology Repository (QOR). A stratified random sample of 1,000 patients was manually reviewed by a cancer clinical coder to analyse agreements and discrepancies. Sensitivity of 96.5% (95% confidence interval: 94.5-97.8%), specificity of 96.5% (95.3-97.4%) and positive predictive value of 83.7% (79.6-86.8%) were achieved for identifying cancer notifiable patients. Medtex achieved high sensitivity and specificity across the breadth of cancers, report types, pathology laboratories and pathologists throughout the State of Queensland. The high sensitivity also resulted in the identification of cancer patients that were not found in the QOR. High sensitivity was at the expense of positive predictive value; however, these cases may be considered as lower priority to Cancer Registries as they can be quickly reviewed. Error analysis revealed that system errors tended to be tumour stream dependent. Medtex is proving to be a promising medical text analytic system. High value cancer information can be generated through intelligent data classification and extraction on large volumes of unstructured pathology reports.	body of uterus;coder device component;confidence intervals;http 404;health level 7;information system;laboratory;neoplasms;non-small cell lung carcinoma;patients;positive predictive value of diagnostic test;quality of results;registries;sensitivity and specificity;stratified sampling;text corpus;text mining;treatment related secondary malignancy;message;notification;pathology report	Anthony N.

While these studies enabled better understanding of search result examination, their findings might not generalize for the tasks and search interfaces in other domains such as Shopping or Social Media. In this paper we present, to best of our knowledge, the first cross-domain comparison of search examination behavior and patterns of aggregated attention across Web Search, News, Shopping and Social Network domains. We investigate how domain of the search and the scope of the information need affect search examination, and find significant differences beyond those arising from natural disparities between individuals. For example, we find that the mean fixation duration, a common indicator of cognitive load, varies significantly across domains (e.g., mean fixation duration in the Social Network domain exceeds that of general Web Search by over 30%). We also find large differences in the aggregate patterns of user attention on the screen, especially in the Shopping and Social Network domains compared to the Web Search domain, emphasizing the need for domain specific user models and evaluation metrics.	aggregate data;evaluation function;information needs;information seeking;social media;social network;web search engine;world wide web	Dmitry Lagun;Eugene Agichtein	2014		10.1145/2600428.2609516	simulation;semantic search;computer science;multimedia;search analytics;world wide web	Web+IR	-34.91297516278052	-52.90388720963859	83081

The user understands the full semantics of the task: they know, for example, what the robot should search for in a cupboard, or that it should be more careful when moving near a glass of water than near a box of tissues. Since the robot might not have this knowledge, allowing it to operate fully autonomously may be risky; its model is incomplete and its policy might be wrong. On the other hand, teleoperating the robot through every motion is slow and tiresome, especially on difficult tasks. Between these two extremes lies a spectrum, from almost no assistance at all (very timid) to full autonomy (very aggressive). So what is the appropriate level of assistance? And how do factors like task difficulty and policy correctness affect this decision?	assistive technology;autonomous robot;autonomy;correctness (computer science)	Anca D. Dragan;Siddhartha S.

Existing work has mostly focused on studying how to improve retrieval accuracy by automatically resolving word sense ambiguity. However, fully automatic sense identification and disambiguation is a very challenging task. In this work, we propose to involve a user in the process of disambiguation through interactive sense feedback and study the potential effectiveness of this novel feedback strategy. We propose several general methods to automatically identify the major senses of query terms based on global analysis of document collection and generate concise representations of the discovered senses to the users. This feedback strategy does not rely on initial retrieval results, and thus can be especially useful for improving the results of difficult queries. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed methods for sense identification and presentation through simulation experiments and user studies, which both indicate that sense feedback strategy is a promising alternative to the existing interactive feedback techniques such as relevance feedback and term feedback.	archive;experiment;interactivity;relevance feedback;simulation;usability testing;word sense;word-sense disambiguation	Alexander Kotov;ChengXiang Zhai	2011		10.1145/2063576.2063605	natural language processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;data mining;database;global analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-34.49794696867916	-54.18166713721129	83104

Yet many trainees may face real-world situations where hearing is compromised. In these cases, the hindrance caused by impaired or lost hearing is a significant stressor that may affect performance. Because this phenomenon is hard to simulate without actually causing hearing damage, trainees are largely unpracticed at operating with diminished hearing. To improve the match between training scenarios and the real-world situation, this effort aims to add simulated hearing loss or impairment as a training variable. Stated briefly, the goal is to effect everything users hear — including non-simulated sounds such as their own and each other's voices — without damaging their hearing, being overtly noticeable, or requiring the donning of headphones.	augmented reality;headphones;simulation;virtual reality	Amy Sadek;David M.

Yet, crowd workers have wide-ranging levels of expertise. Large worker populations are heterogeneous and comprise a significant amount of faulty workers. As a consequence, quality insurance for crowd answers is commonly seen as the Achilles heel of crowdsourcing. Although various techniques for quality control have been proposed in recent years, a post-processing phase in which crowd answers are validated is still required. Such validation, however, is typically conducted by experts, whose availability is limited and whose work incurs comparatively high costs. This work aims at guiding an expert in the validation of crowd answers. We present a probabilistic model that helps to identify the most beneficial validation questions in terms of both improvement in result correctness and detection of faulty workers. By seeking expert feedback on the most problematic cases, we are able to obtain a set of high-quality answers, even if the expert does not validate the complete answer set. Our approach is applicable for a broad range of crowdsourcing tasks, including classification and counting. Our comprehensive evaluation using both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our techniques save up to 60% of expert efforts compared to baseline methods when striving for perfect result correctness. In absolute terms, for most cases, we achieve close to perfect correctness after expert input has been sought for only 15% of the crowdsourcing tasks.	baseline (configuration management);correctness (computer science);crowdsourcing;human-based computation;information retrieval;population;stable model semantics;statistical classification;statistical model;synthetic intelligence;video post-processing	Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung;Chi Thang Duong;Nguyen Thanh Tam;Matthias Weidlich;Karl Aberer;Hongzhi Yin;Xiaofang Zhou	2017	The VLDB Journal	10.1007/s00778-017-0484-3	data mining;data integration;database;web application;statistical model;correctness;human computation;computer science;crowdsourcing software development;crowdsourcing	DB	-46.42610855424244	-69.74140018243415	83170

This situation results in accelerated cognitive decline and the suffering associated with loneliness and confusion. Health services cannot keep up with the demand for home visits and day care centres that can alleviate this problem. Incorporating new healthcare technologies for proactive health and elder care into everyday living environments can contribute significantly to support the elderly and their carers and is to become a major priority over the next decade. The approach followed in the AGNES project is to keep the elderly mentally and socially stimulated and in contact with others by combining state detection and social network technologies. This paper provides some scientific background for the chosen approach and describes the technological concept of the project.	cognition;networked society;social network	John A.

However, while some research shows facets are important, other research found facets are only moderately used. Therefore, in this exploratory study we compare two search interfaces; one where the facets panel is always visible and one where the facets panel is hidden by default. Our main research question is “Is folding the facets panel in a digital library search interface beneficial to academic users?” By performing an eye tracking study with N=24, we measured search efficiency, distribution of attention and user satisfaction. We found no significant differences in the eye tracking data nor in usability feedback and conclude that collapsing facets is neither beneficial nor detrimental.	digital library;eye tracking;library (computing);usability	Max Kemman;Martijn Kleppe;Jim Maarseveen	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40501-3_47	self-efficacy;digital library;usability;human–computer interaction;eye tracking;computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-36.20716267954343	-52.41630941628498	83538

Sleep disorders may introduce severe physical effects, e.g. cognitive impairments and mental health complications. So being able to measure and evaluate sleep behavior is important for health practitioners and the users themselves. In this paper, we present the implementation of the Sleep Lifestyle Reasoner part of AAL platform which allows detection of minor or major deviations in the sleeping patterns in MCI and COPD patients indicating changes in their health status. The output of the reasoner is fed to the My Sleep Web Application that provides recommendations to improve sleep hygiene and coaches the users into a healthy sleeping behavior, based on their personal rhythms and problems. It also supports the informal caregiver by providing insights on the sleeping behavior of the patient.	atm adaptation layer;semantic reasoner;web application	Krasimir Tonchev;Georgi Tsenov;Valeri M.

The time-based factor was manipulated by the target rate and scanning rate while the intensity-based factor was manipulated by the difference between a simple reaction task and a physical matching (choice reaction) task. Nine participants tracked the scanning line at two different scanning rates and were required to respond to two designated targets presented singly at two different temporal frequencies. The results indicated that task difficulty (the intensity-based factor) had a significant effect on the reaction time. Target rate and scanning rate were integrated as one time-based factor in terms of three sweeping angles. The time-based factor was found to have a significant effect on the fixation time, saccade amplitude, fixation frequency, eye movement speed, reaction time and hit rate. No interaction effect was found between time-based and intensity-based factors. The time pressure (defined by the time required divided by the time available) based on a model human processor was positively related to scanning rate, target rate and task difficulty. It was found to be the most objective and reliable if time required can be reliably predicted based on a predictive model approach.	entity–relationship model;human processor model;information processing;local interconnect network;nl (complexity);performance;predictive modelling;scan line;video tracking	Chia-Fen Chi;Yen-Hui Lin;Woei-Shuoh Lan	2003	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/01449290310001593621	psychology;mental chronometry;interaction;simulation;information processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;predictive modelling;intensity;communication;user interface;eye movement	HCI	-45.3639223136052	-55.50822100255215	83924

Biomedical informatics (BMI) is the emerging discipline that aims to put these two worlds together so that the discovery and creation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods is fostered. The INFOBIOMED network is a new approach that aims to set a durable structure for this collaborative strategy in Europe, mobilising the critical mass of resources necessary for enabling the consolidation of BMI as a crucial scientific discipline for future healthcare. The specific objectives of INFOBIOMED aim at enabling systematic progress in clinical and genetic data interoperability and integration and advancing the exchange and interfacing of methods, tools and technologies used in both MI and BI. Moreover, it intends to enable pilot applications in particular fields that demonstrate the benefits of a synergetic approach in BMI, as well as to create a robust framework for education, training and mobility of involved researchers in BMI for the creation of a solid European BMI research capacity.	bioinformatics;brain–computer interface;community informatics;interoperability;scott continuity;semiconductor consolidation;synergy	Ferran Sanz;Carlos Díaz;Fernando Martín-Sánchez;Julio Bonis	2004	Proceedings.

Nursing personnel were accompanied over three weeks and transfer techniques between bed and chair were recorded with a stopwatch. The total transfer time of a patient transfer is divided into three segments: preparation, transfer and dismantling time. The nursing staff at the residential nursing home makes use of three transfer techniques: the ubiquitous manual transfer, transfers with slide sheets and transfers using floor lifts. These transfer techniques have been analyzed and compared showing that floor lifts require significantly more time in all three segments (311 s) than slide sheets (115 s) and manual transfers (74 s), while slide sheets only slightly increase the time taken to accomplish a comfortable repositioning of the patient. The manual transfer is still by far the most popular method, despite numerous studies that have evaluated such methods hazardous. New devices are necessary that must accommodate a safe transfer and be as fast as a manual transfer in order to be accepted among nursing staff as the demand for professional nursing staff continues to rise.	characteristic impedance;slide projector;slide rule	Samuel M.

The objective is a generic system of tools, including a core English lexicon, grammar, and concept representations, for building natural language processing (NLP) systems for text understanding. Systems built with PAKTUS are intended to generate input to knowledge based systems or data base systems. Input to the NLP system is typically derived from an existing electronic message stream, such as a news wire. PAKTUS supports the adaptation of the generic core to a variety of domains: JINTACCS messages, RAINFORM messages, news reports about a specific type of event, such as financial transfers or terrorist acts, etc., by acquiring sublanguage and domain-specific grammar, words, conceptual mappings, and discourse patterns. The long-term goal is a system that can support the processing of relatively long discourses in domains that are fairly broad with a high rate of success.

58bac5a270e89aa681339592e3122643481ed269	training operational monitoring in future atcos using eye tracking: extended abstract		Improved technological possibilities continue to increase the significance of operational monitoring in air traffic control (ATC). The role of the air traffic controller (ATCO) will change in that they will have to monitor the operations of an automated system for failures. In order to take over control when automation fails, future ATCOs will need to be trained. While current ATC training is mainly based on performance indicators, this study will focus on the benefit of using eye tracking in future ATC training. Utilizing a low-fidelity operational monitoring task, a model of how attention should be allocated in case of malfunction will be derived. Based on this model, one group of ATC novices will receive training on how to allocate their attention appropriately (treatment). The other group will receive no training (control). Eye movements will be recorded to investigate how attention is allocated and if the training is successful. Performance measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training.

Since children feel more anxiety and fear in a hospital, it is necessary to reduce their perceived waiting time by disturbing their awareness of time and dispersing their attention. We present the D-Aquarium, a computer-based digital aquarium that provides psychological stability to pediatric patients and reduces their perceived waiting time by using distractions to alleviate their psychological anxiety and interfere with their perception of time.

This trend is evident in gastrointestinal endoscopy which makes up the largest percentage of ambulatory surgical center claims in Medicare. In response to these pressures, the Duke University Health System plans to shift a majority of low-risk, endoscopic procedures to a lower-cost Ambulatory Surgical Center within the next year. In this paper, we describe our efforts partnering with Duke University Health System to develop a discrete event simulation model of this ambulatory surgical center and use the model to predict the impact of this case-shift. Furthermore, we use modeling to help guide systems redesign efforts by focusing on appointment template design. Through modeling, we uncover a number of operationally meaningful findings that are currently under consideration within the health system.	purchasing;simulation	Javad Taheri;Ziad Gellad;Dariele Burchfield;Kevin Cooper	2013	2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)		simulation;computer science;discrete event simulation;biological engineering;health care	Robotics	-60.57974800031008	-64.87564883749782	84363

This study investigated the effects of specific list presentation format on visual search performance and subjective satisfaction in e-commerce listing pages. At first, we found seven important commodity features for consumers through pre-study. Then, an eye tracking study was conducted to record the visual search for target items and cognitive workload based on three different list formats (Vertical Format/T Format/Block format) in e-commerce websites. The results suggested that list format could significantly influence the visual search performance and satisfaction. The efficiency of Vertical format and T format is higher than block format. Designers could get some valid references from this result when they are designing listing pages.	e-commerce;eye tracking;usability	Fan Zhang;Yingbin Shuai;Siyuan Lin;Xuan Li;Hao Jiang;Cheng Yao;Fangtian Ying;Minneng Lin	2017		10.1145/3041021.3054247	visual search;data mining;workload;world wide web;computer science;information retrieval;eye tracking;usability;cognitive load;cognition	HCI	-37.200854151457996	-52.14873423400996	84479

Materials and Methods We analyzed the impact of EHR implementation on bond ratings and net income from service to patients (NISP) at 32 hospitals that recently implemented a new EHR and a set of controls.   Results After implementing an EHR, 7 hospitals had a bond downgrade, 7 had a bond upgrade, and 18 had no changes. There was no difference in the likelihood of bond rating changes or in changes to NISP following EHR go-live when compared to control hospitals.   Discussion Most hospitals in our analysis saw no change in bond ratings following EHR go-live, with no significant differences observed between EHR implementation and control hospitals. There was also no apparent difference in NISP.   Conclusions Implementation of an EHR did not appear to have an impact on bond ratings at the hospitals in our analysis.		Dustin McEvoy;Michael L.

We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal five-year follow-up study and also interviewed both health care professionals and administrative staff, altogether n=43 and patients, n=10. We gathered both qualitative and quantitative data. Both statistical analysis and content analysis were used. Background There are demands to evaluate how beneficial different information systems are like e.g. the Regional Health Information System (RHIS). To get a broader understanding we used the Mixed Methods approach, however having both conceptual and practical challenges. Furthermore, measurements of the impact of RHIS on health outcomes should be part of the implementation process. 1 Examining the improvements in healthcare can be derived from RHIS investment and through providing information that supports health decision-makers at consumer, service provider, regional and national levels. 1-3 Objective The purpose of this paper is to describe how to evaluate the spread, sustainability and impact of RHIS during its five years use in one hospital district area of those 20 district areas in Finland. Material and Methods The utilization rates of RHIS (to measure the spread and sustainability) were collected yearly based on retrospectively from implementation period 2004 to 2008 in primary and special health in all municipalities of the hospital district. We conducted also a retrospective, longitudinal five-year follow-up study based on few selected outcomes for all the federations of municipalities in the selected hospital district in Finland. Additionally, to measure the impact of RHIS the outcomes received were evaluated by interviewing both health care professionals and administrative staff (altogether n=43) and patients (n=10). Both statistical analysis and content analysis were used. Results We got data both qualitative and quantitative one, numerical cut point data from each of the five years the RHIS has been in used and also verbal data after the system has been in use for five years. Conclusion The use of mixed methods through the research process is not just collecting qualitative and quantitative data. The challenge is to understand when you can really say that you used Mixed Methods. References 1. Shapiro JS. Evaluating public health uses of health information exchange.

More than two thirds of Americans and more than one third of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. Physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle are contributing factors of overweight and obesity. Increasing physical activity in overweight and obese individuals can potentially improve health status and lower the risk of major health problems. Based on the theoretical frameworks of behavioral change models, health information technologies, and pervasive interactive technologies, a conceptual model has been developed. The proposed model is an intervention method combining a behavior change model and a personalized Health IT system using an interactive accelerometer-based pervasive technology component, to increase physical activity potentially in an overweight and obese population. The accelerometer automatically synchronizes with the personal health record database over wireless networks; the decision engine utilizes the theory of planned behavior model to form a feedback; and; proper interactive feedback is provided directly to the users in the personal health record interface. A prototype was developed based on the conceptual model. The prototype measures and stores the number of steps, type of steps and caloric consumption on a daily basis with an interval of 20 minutes by an advanced accelerometer that can simply be attached to any footwear. The accelerometer synchronizes automatically the stored data with a central database as soon as the participant enters a designated wireless area. Virtual characters that are embedded inside a personal health record system convey the feedback to the users. The feedback is generated based on the theory of planned behavior decision model utilizing the stored daily physical activity data. The interface prompts knowledge-based information, presents self-monitoring trend lines, and shows virtual character changes over time such as becoming obese, to reflect the tailored feedback message. In addition, the interface is integrated in a popular social-networking website where users can review other virtual characters and generate peer pressure. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of implementing a behavioral change intervention using pervasive health information technology among overweight and obese population. This research explains the development of the conceptual model, integration of wireless physical activity self-monitoring devices into personal health records, and the application of rich interactive media to convey messages to the users. The final prototype will be presented and preliminary findings will be discussed.	exploratory testing;pervasive informatics	Hadi Kharrazi;Lynn Vincz	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21657-2_39	simulation;engineering;multimedia;communication	HCI	-59.06112981887666	-55.384166731110234	84944

Interfaces which enable the expert, a professional and/or scientific practitioner, to create, refine and evaluate rules about the constituent elements of their knowledge provide a means of circumventing some of the current barriers to successful knowledge encapsulation. The critical feature of the design of such systems is the provision of facilities for the automatic conversion of the expert's rules into code. In a study of scientific work involving the capture of phonetics expertise in a knowledge-based system, key aspects of a speech scientist's working practice were identified. This paper discusses that use of the Speech Knowledge Interface system (SKI) in the context of investigations into the construction of an enhanced model of speech production for a speaker independent, continuous speech recognizer. Evidence that providing the expert with an appropriate interface to a knowledge-based system stimulates questions about existing knowledge and gives rise to new insights into the scope of the investigations, was found. Thus, the process of knowledge externalization, both of knowledge which was only partially realized and knowledge that was perceived as """"new"""" by the expert, was facilitated by the interaction with the system."""	expert system;knowledge-based systems	Linda Candy;Stella M.

While the improved availability increases personal flexibility—reducing rigidity in time and place of communication—it comes at a price. The ‘anytime, anyplace’-accessibility, which has become the norm in today's (working) society, can cause adverse effects to an individual's mood and emotions, and especially raise the stress level. Consequently, in this paper, we discuss methods for measuring stress via mobile devices, analyzing their pros and cons. Subsequently, we analyze which situational information— comprising the prevailing context of the users and their usage of communication devices—is useful for the quantification of the psychological stress perceived by users. Based on a field study with 27 participants, we observe that, while longer working hours and higher number of appointments have a positive correlation with an increased stress level, there is no one-fits-all method for stress measurement. In turn, we take the first steps towards non-intrusive methods to identify stressful situations and thus, lay the foundation for future research on stress mitigation.	anytime algorithm;causality;fits;feedback;field research;mobile app;mobile device;situational application;smartphone;stress testing;usability	Svenja Neitzel;Frank Englert;Rahul Chini Dwarakanath;Katharina Schneider;Kathrin Reinke;Gisela Gerlach;Christoph Rensing;Doreen Böhnstedt;Ruth Stock-Homburg	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917584	simulation;sensor;stress;computer security	HCI	-59.56201249241245	-54.139713905247696	85018

The convergence of life sciences, healthcare, and information technology is now driving research into the fundamentals of disease causation and toward tailoring individualized treatment. The Molecular Medicine Informatics Model (MMIM) is a 'virtual' research repository of clinical, laboratory and genetic data sets. Integrated data, physically located within independent hospital and research organisations can be searched and queried seamlessly via a federated data integrator. Researchers must gain authorisation to access data, and obtain permission from the data owners before the data can be accessed. The legal and ethical issues surrounding the use of this health data have been addressed so data complies with privacy requirements. The MMIM platform also record links individual cases across multiple institutions and multiple clinical specialties.

41ddec2f6ff730ce63004e232eeddb4df2e99fb8	contextual question answering for the health domain	text processing;information seeking	Studies have shown that natural language interfaces such as question answering and conversational systems allow information to be accessed and understood more easily by users who are unfamiliar with the nuances of the delivery mechanisms (e.g., keyword-based search engines) or have limited literacy in certain domains (e.g., unable to comprehend health-related content due to terminology barrier). In particular, the increasing use of the Web for health information prompts us to re-examine our existing delivery mechanisms. We present enquireMe, which is a contextual question answering system that provides lay users with the ability to obtain responses about a wide range of health topics by vaguely expressing at the start and gradually refining their information needs over the course of an interaction using natural language. enquireMe allows the users to engage in ‘conversations’ about their health concerns, a process that can be therapeutic in itself. The system uses community-driven question-answer pairs from the Web together with a decay model to deliver the top scoring answers as responses to the users’ unrestricted inputs. We evaluated enquireMe using benchmark data from WebMD and TREC to assess the accuracy of system generated answers. Despite the absence of complex knowledge acquisition and deep language processing, enquireMe is comparable with the state of the art question answering systems such as START as well as those interactive systems from TREC.	aggregate data;algorithm;benchmark (computing);brill tagger;enquire;experiment;information needs;information seeking;interaction;keyword extraction;knowledge acquisition;natural language;part-of-speech tagging;positive feedback;question answering;regular expression;speech synthesis;text retrieval conference;trust (emotion);veracity;web search engine;world wide web	Wilson Wong;John Thangarajah;Lin Padgham	2012	JASIST	10.1002/asi.22733	question answering;computer science;data mining;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-33.78561980777851	-53.66201855563115	85149
3fc478039ddd2b4ad2bcbb0e617f915905b701ae	using sequence package analysis as a new natural language understanding method for mining government recordings of terror suspects		Three years after 9/11, the Justice Department made the astounding revelation that more than 120,000 hours of potentially valuable terrorismrelated recordings had yet to be transcribed. Clearly, the government’s efforts to obtain such recordings have continued. Yet there is no evidence that the contents of the recorded calls have been analyzed any more efficiently. Perhaps analysis by conventional means would be of limited value in any event. After all, terror suspects tend to avoid words that might alarm intelligence agents, thus “outsmarting” conventional mining programs, which heavily rely on wordspotting techniques. One solution is the application of a new natural language understanding method, known as Sequence Package Analysis, which can transcend the limitations of basic parsing methods by mapping out the generic conversational sequence patterns found in the dialog. The purpose of this paper is show how this new method can efficiently mine a large volume of government recordings of the conversations of terror suspects – with the goal of reducing the backlog of unanalyzed calls.	data mining;natural language understanding;parsing;dialog	Amy Neustein	2006			computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web	ML	-41.634641595366354	-70.74351577997912	85189

These evaluations are intended to advance our understanding of the merits of current text analysis techniques, as applied to the performance of a realistic information extraction task. The latest one is also intended to provide insight into information retrieval technology (document retrieval and categorization) used instead of or in concert with language understanding technology. The inputs to the analysis/extraction process consist of naturally-occurring texts that were obtained in the form of electronic messages. The outputs of the process are a set of templates or semantic frames resembling the contents of a partially formatted database.

Long delays have been shown to reduce information search, but less is known about the impact of more modest âacceptableâ delays â delays that do not reduce user satisfaction. Prior research suggests that as the time and effort required to complete a task increases, decision-makers tend to minimize effort by reducing information search activities and let decision quality slip rather than increase effort to maintain a consistent level of decision quality. In this study, we examined the effects of an acceptable time delay (seven seconds) on information search and decision making behavior. We found that the increased time and effort caused by acceptable delays provoked increased information search.	broadcast delay;decision quality;information foraging;persistence (computer science);world wide web	Alan R.

The development of an interoperable medical information system requires facilities that allow services to be queried, chosen, set up, and executed. In this paper, we propose a service registry design of an interoperable medical information system. As the core element of a medical information system, the service registry allows cooperative hospitals and medical institutions to publish their services to the central server, which users can then access to search for and utilize the registered services. To ensure that the registered service is valid and that the service information is correct, service registry monitors actively gets the latest information about services. The service registry design proposed in this study is based on the Microsoft.NET platform. The service registry's website is published by Internet information services (IIS), thereby allowing non-local users to access the services through the Internet.	information system;internet information services;interoperability;server (computing)	Long Guo;Xiaoguang Zhang;Yu Wang;Pengfei Li;Jing-song Li	2012	2012 5th International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/BMEI.2012.6513072	the internet;data mining;database;law;world wide web	HPC	-53.536508949789145	-62.37669866075793	85302

The existing literature suggests that social robots have the potential to improve wellbeing in the elderly, but existing robots focus more on healthcare and healthy behaviour among the elderly. This work describes a new investigation based on focus groups and home studies, in which we produced a set of requirements for social robots that reduce loneliness and improve psychological wellbeing among the elderly. The requirements were validated with the participants of our study. We anticipate that the results of this work will lead to the design of a new social robot more suited to improving wellbeing of the elderly.	feedback;focus group;prototype;requirement;social robot	Suzanne Hutson;Soo Ling Lim;Peter J.

In order to develop a better understanding of student online search process especially in academic contexts, an online tool (SCOOP) is developed for tracking mouse behavior on the web to build a more extensive account of student web search processes. Over 100 university students' search activities with SCOOP were recorded as they searched for answers to assigned questions. The primary use of the SCOOP dataset is thus to provide the raw data for the development of online information search models. Further complications will arise because other personal and contextual factors affect the search process for different students with different personalities, learning styles or types of tasks. Hence, the dataset is also for testing the relationship between other factors and online search processes.	database;online search;scoop	Mingming Zhou	2015	BJET	10.1111/bjet.12290	the internet;simulation;computer science;multimedia;law;world wide web;peripheral	DB	-35.838693882750356	-52.9522452839059	85442

No specific search guidelines were delivered to the students prior to the first exercise. Prior to the second exercise students received a lecture based on the internet search instructions developed by the authors. The results of the two searches were analyzed and compared. Findings – As a result of the lecture students significantly improved the search results. There were a certain number of problematic search behavior patterns and obstacles uncovered, which proved to have a critical impact on the search results, such as: difficulties in acquiring new or alternative vocabulary during the search process, perception of the task as the ultimate source of keywords, and perception of commercial sources as unavailable. Research limitations/implications – In order to understand the effect of the internet search instructions, the experiment has to be repeated with other groups of users. If the results consistently show that search behavior improves, the authors recommend systematic training of internet users. Originality/value – The paper might be particularly interesting for information specialists and search instructors mostly because it reveals connection between the way the problem was stated and initial search strategy – a connection that to our knowledge has not been deeply explored yet.	nl (complexity);search algorithm;search problem;session (web analytics);unavailability;vocabulary;web search engine	Elena Barsky;Judit Bar-Ilan	2005	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684520510583954	the internet;simulation;design methods;search problem;computer science;search analytics;law;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-37.71245110229207	-59.522636175156	85455

This study uses Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to improve the accuracy of credibility assessments through combining automated and participatory decision support. Participatory decision support is also proposed to encourage acceptance of the decision aid’s recommendation. A new hybrid decision aid is designed to perform automated linguistic analysis and elicit and analyze perceptual cues (i.e., indirect cues) from an observer. The results suggest that decision aids that collect both linguistic and indirect cues perform better than decision aids that collect only one type of cue. Users of systems that collect linguistic cues experience improved credibility assessment accuracy; yet, users of systems that collect both types of cues or only indirect cues do not experience higher accuracy. However, collecting indirect cues increases the user’s acceptance of decision-aid recommendations.	decision support system;detection theory;service description table	Matthew L.

The present study seeks to update current knowledge of the perceptions and experiences of PHI competencies proposed by the U.S. Council on Linkage in Public Health specifically for mid-tier PH practitioners and researchers. The results were collected and analyzed by using a Web-based survey (WBS) method administered among both practitioners and researchers. Researchers first compiled a draft list of candidate competency set by incorporating existing competency areas provided by: 1) the Council on Linkage; and by 2) those proposed by the USA's Centers for Disease Control CDC Public Health Informatics Work Group. Nine sets of competency statements with 120 competency items and demographic information of respondents were included in the WBS. The online survey instruments were pilot-tested accordingly to incorporate feedback from respondents of the pilot. Fifty-six subjects were recruited from PH experts who were: 1) members of the Health Informatics Information Technology (HIIT) group of American Public Health Association; and, 2) members from the Community of Science (COS) Website who were the first authors published in the PHI field from PubMed. The sample included diverse backgrounds of PHI workers. They expressed an increased need for training to improve their PHI competencies. Respondents agreed that four competency sets should be adequately represented, including Leadership and System Thinking Skills (82%), followed by Financial Planning and Management Skills (79%), Community Dimensions of Practice Skills (77%), and Policy Development/Program Planning Skills (63%). The findings parallel current literature indicating that there exists an expressed need for clarification of the public health practitioner's job-specific informatics competency. Findings of expressed needs for basic computer literacy training and community-based practice were consistent with those of the literature. Additional training and resources should be allocated to address the competency of leadership, management, community-based practice and policy advocacy skills for mid-tier public health practitioners to perform their jobs more effectively. Only when healthcare organizations properly identify PHI competency needs will public health practitioners likely improve their overall informatics skills while improving diversification for contribution across multiple settings.	cos;clarify;clinical informatics;compiler;computer literacy;diversification (finance);experience;feedback;informatics (discipline);instrument - device;job stream;linkage (software);multitier architecture;occupational health services;occupations;pubmed;public health informatics;scientific publication;seventy nine;united states public health service;work breakdown structure;peptide phi, phe(4)-	Chiehwen Ed Hsu;Kim Dunn;Hsin-Hsuan Juo;Rick Danko;Drew Johnson;Francisco Soto Mas;Jiunn-Jye Sheu	2012	Health informatics journal	10.1177/1460458211424000	computer literacy;health informatics;public health informatics;family medicine;working group;medicine;public health;computer science;knowledge management;nursing;data mining;management;information technology;financial plan;systems thinking	HCI	-61.52582486673789	-64.05364593485201	85479

Clinical decision support could assist general practitioners with prescribing but is underused. This article aims to investigate the attitudes of general practitioners towards using decision support systems. A survey was distributed among 500 Dutch general practitioners. Virtually all 184 respondents indicated having a clinical information system, while only 21 percent indicated having a decision support plug-in; this correlated with their use of medical formularies. Only use of one of the medical formularies correlated with the number of recognized underprescription problems. General practitioners' attitudes toward a newly proposed system aiding them with polypharmacy prescribing were mainly positive (57%); the perceived usefulness correlated with output quality (p = .000), time investment (p = .000), and financial stimuli (payability: p = .000 and reimbursement: p = .015) but not with job relevance. Dutch general practitioners are thus likely to adopt the proposed system under the conditions that it improves prescription quality and does not require extensive investments of time or money.	attitude;clinical decision support system;formularies as topic;information system;investments;patients;plug (physical object);plug-in (computing);primary health care;relevance	Michiel Meulendijk;Marco R.

In pure display conditions all indicators within a display were of the same type, and in mixed conditions display type varied across indicators. Subjects performed either integration tasks, which required responses based on information contained in two indicators, or nonintegration tasks, in which responses could be made based on a single indicator value. Results replicated previous findings of the superiority of analog indicators in tasks of this type and also indicated that the integration/nonintegration task distinction is not an important variable to take into account when designing displays. It is suggested that detailed analyses of decision task demands are required in designing visual displays.		David G. Payne;Virginia A. Lang;Jason M.

91a3396a32aeac70a1a05938fe631baac73dd641	establishing semantic interoperability of biomedical metadata registries using extended semantic relationships		Achieving semantic interoperability is critical for biomedical data sharing between individuals, organizations and systems. The ISO/IEC 11179 MetaData Registry (MDR) standard has been recognized as one of the solutions for this purpose. The standard model, however, is limited. Representing concepts consist of two or more values, for instance, are not allowed including blood pressure with systolic and diastolic values. We addressed the structural limitations of ISO/IEC 11179 by an integrated metadata object model in our previous research. In the present study, we introduce semantic extensions for the model by defining three new types of semantic relationships; dependency, composite and variable relationships. To evaluate our extensions in a real world setting, we measured the efficiency of metadata reduction by means of mapping to existing others. We extracted metadata from the College of American Pathologist Cancer Protocols and then evaluated our extensions. With no semantic loss, one third of the extracted metadata could be successfully eliminated, suggesting better strategy for implementing clinical MDRs with improved efficiency and utility.	composite video;diastole;extraction;iso/iec 11179;isoproterenol;memory data register;neoplasms;registries;semantic interoperability;weight-loss agents;emotional dependency	Yu Rang Park;Young Jo Yoon;Hye Hyeon Kim;Ju Han Kim	2013	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-289-9-618	semantic interoperability;data mining;semantic equivalence;metadata repository;metadata;semantic grid;iso/iec 11179;metadata registry;data element;computer science	Web+IR	-50.042492328412024	-66.15657223515274	85720

Among these individuals, there are 39 million who are totally blind. There have been several systems designed to support visually-impaired people and to improve the quality of their lives. Unfortunately, most of these systems are limited in their capabilities. In this paper, we present a comparative survey of the wearable and portable assistive devices for visuallyimpaired people in order to show the progress in assistive technology for this group of people. Thus, the contribution of this literature survey is to discuss in detail the most significant devices that are presented in the literature to assist this population and highlight the improvements, advantages, disadvantages, and accuracy. Our aim is to address and present most of the issues of these systems to pave the way for other researchers to design devices that ensure safety and independent mobility to visually-impaired people.	assistive technology;heart-assist devices;wearable computer;world health organization	Wafa M.

65aa059ad311d0c654c4a4509f2f4a419801ead7	is evoking negative meanings the unique feature of adjective metaphors? : through the comparison with nominal metaphors and predicative metaphors		Previous metaphor studies have paid much attention to nominal and predicative metaphors and little attention has been given to adjective metaphors. Although some studies have focused on adjective metaphors, they have only examined how the acceptability of adjective metaphors can be explained by the pairing of adjective modifier’s and head noun’s modalities and little attention has been given to meanings evoked by adjective metaphors. Sakamoto & Utsumi (2009) showed that adjective metaphors, especially those modified by color adjectives, tend to evoke negative meanings. Thus, our study examines whether evoking negative meanings is the unique feature of adjective metaphors through the comparison with nominal and predicative metaphors for the Japanese language. Our psychological experiments revealed that meanings of metaphors are basically affected by meanings of vehicles. However, when a vehicle itself has the neutral meaning, negative meanings are evoked more frequently for adjective metaphors among the other types of metaphors.	cave story;experiment;impredicativity;modifier key	Miho Sumihisa;Hiroya Tsukurimichi;Akira Utsumi;Maki Sakamoto	2011				HCI	-50.830723329035386	-53.49229982411049	86058

50e890a43256711d5e8a8002d94fda8c99ca8939	health information literacy of senior citizens - a review		The objective of this paper is to analyze the available literature on health information literacy of senior citizens from around the world and outline the major findings from this literature. A systematic review of literature from 2004 to 2014 was conducted using nine relevant databases, which yielded 42 quantitative studies, which were analyzed. The analysis revealed that information seeking behavior varied by age, gender, health status, education, socio-economic status and technology literacy. Over time, there has been a gradual increase in the use of the Internet by senior citizens seeking health information. Also, there has been a corresponding increase in a number of intervention studies in e-health literacy for senior citizens. Shortcomings in the literature include compromised methodological issues of inadequately powered sample size, absence of longitudinal and theory-based studies, and dearth of research on relevant outcomes. The article ends with a discussion of the relevance of the findings to IL researchers and practitioners, and suggestions for further research.	information literacy	Venkata Ratnadeep Suri;Yun-Ke Chang;Shaheen Majid;Schubert Foo	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-14136-7_14	library science;medicine;management science;pedagogy	HCI	-62.11930792195725	-59.51930608562027	86259

Mapping concepts in the Gene Ontology (GO) to the UMLS may help further this integration and allow for more efficient information exchange among researchers. Using a gold standard of GO term--UMLS concept mappings provided by the NCI, we examined the performance of various published and combined mapping techniques, in order to maximize precision and recall. We found that for the previously published techniques precision varied between (0.61-0.95), and recall varied from (0.65-0.90), whereas for the hybrid techniques, precision varied between (0.66-0.97), and recall from (0.59-0.93). Our study reveals the benefits of using mapping techniques that incorporate domain knowledge, and provides a basis for future approaches to mapping between distinct biomedical vocabularies.	biological science disciplines;controlled vocabulary;gene ontology;information exchange;nc (complexity);precision and recall;scientific publication;unified medical language system;benefit	Michael N.

It is the most common cause of cancer death and almost reaches 20% of the total. The incidence of lung cancer has significantly increased from the early 19th century. In this manuscript we have discussed various data mining techniques that have been utilised for cancer diagnosis. The lung cancer pathologic staging is set based on the pathology report to describe the size and/or the extent of the original tumour and whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). Being aware of the lung cancer pathologic staging is important because it can be used to estimate a patient’s prognosis and also can help physicians plan a suitable treatment. A sample of tissue from the patient’s lung is required in order to complete the pathology report for the lung cancer pathologic staging diagnosis. In this procedure, a surgery biopsy is necessary but it may put the patient’s health in jeopardy. Therefore, this study focuses on taking the clinical information which can be obtained without surgery to replace the pathology report. The data mining techniques are used to find the correlation between the clinical information and the pathology report in order to support lung cancer pathologic staging diagnosis. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Its main purpose is to improve the performance of athletes training enhancing the user tracking level. Moreover, it keeps the trainer up to date with more accurate data of how the user follows the scheduled training. The technologies in use are C# for the sportsperson application and Ubuntu Server operating system, Apache, MySQL and Mono framework for the server part. In the interest of the low cost feature, the motion acquisition module is implemented using an inexpensive widespread motion capture device. Our system is also designed with the following objectives: to improve the efficiency of the training exercises i.e. to perform the exercise optimally with the less number of repetitions as possible, to increase savings in training budgets as they are finished in the correct period of time and to avoid injuries caused by an incorrect performance of the exercise.

However, no prior work questioned the maximum acceptable delay for real-time collaboration or the efficacy of compensatory strategies. In this study we examine the performance consequences of simulated network delay on an artificial collaborative document editing task with a time constant and metrics for process and outcome suitable for experimental study. Results suggest that strategy influences task outcome at least as much as delay in the distribution of work in progress. However, a paradoxical interaction between delay and strategy emerged, in which the more generally effective, but highly coupled strategy was also more sensitive to delay.	collaborative real-time editor;coupling (computer programming);experiment;google drive;loose coupling;real-time transcription;sorting	Claudia-Lavinia Ignat;Gérald Oster;Meagan Newman;Valerie L.

Previous research has demonstrated the difficulty of reducing their frequency by means other than redesigning the task structure [Byrne, M.D., Davis, E.M., 2006. Task structure and postcompletion error in the execution of a routine procedure. Human Factors 48, 627–638]. Nevertheless, finding a successful strategy for mitigation of this type of error may uncover important mechanisms underlying interactive behavior. Two experiments were carried out to test visual cues for their ability to reduce the frequency of postcompletion errors in a computer-based routine procedural task. A cue that was visually salient, just-in-time, and meaningful entirely eliminated the error, whereas cues that were not as specific were ineffective. These results are beyond the predictive capability of extant error identification methods and common design guidelines but are consistent with the work of Altmann and Trafton [2002. Memory for goals: an activation-based model. Cognitive Science 26, 39–83] and Hollnagel [1993. Human Reliability Analysis, Context and Control. Academic Press, London]. Finally, a computational model developed in ACT-R is presented as a first step towards validation of the major findings from the two experiments. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

bc75e48e7aa0f1f6488c053a85dfd32cf6aa5042	breaking off engagement: readers' cognitive decoupling as a function of reader and text characteristics		Engagement during reading can be measured by the amount of time readers invest in the reading process. It is hypothesized that disengagement is marked by a decrease in time investment as compared with the demands made on the reader by the text. In this study, self-paced reading times for screens of text were predicted by a text complexity score called formality; formality scores increase with cohesion, informational content/genre, syntactic complexity, and word abstractness as measured by the Coh-Metrix text-analysis program. Cognitive decoupling is defined as the difference between actual reading times and reading times predicted by text formality. Decoupling patterns were found to differ as a function of the serial position of the screens of text and the text genre (i.e., informational, persuasive, and narrative) but surprisingly not as a function of reader characteristics (reading speed and comprehension). This underscores the importance of mining text characteristics in addition to individual differences and task constraints in understanding engagement during reading.	coh-metrix;coupling (computer programming);information science	Patricia Goedecke;Daqi Dong;Genghu Shi;Shi Feng;Evan F.

The theoretical framework of TCM is unique and with rich of content, which contains the complex relationships between disease and medicine and has formed a unique system to diagnose and cure illness. Research on question-answering (QA) over TCM is significant for Chinese NLP and representative, because the resources of TCM are mostly Chinese-based. The general strategies for QA are pipeline, includes Natural Language Processing (NLP) for original questions and structural query process. However, noises are easily introduced and information contained in the original questions may loss during these two separate procedures. In this paper we present a novel joint model for QA over TCM, which unites these two procedures into a uniform framework, together with Wikipedia alignment.

82cb1ea83c6c298808da3c1f328cdfd542a1e709	a social cognitive theory-based framework for monitoring medication adherence applied to endocrine therapy in breast cancer survivors		Poor adherence to long-term therapies for chronic diseases, such as cancer, compromises effectiveness of treatment and increases the likelihood of disease progression, making medication adherence a critical issue in population health. While the field has documented many barriers to adherence to medication, it has also come up with few efficacious solutions to medication adherence, indicating that new and innovative approaches are needed. In this paper, we evaluate medication-taking behaviors based on social cognitive theory (SCT), presenting patterns of adherence stratified across SCT constructs in 33 breast cancer survivors over an 8-month period. Findings indicate that medication adherence is a very personal experience influenced by many simultaneously interacting factors, and a deeper contextual understanding is needed to understand and develop interventions targeting non-adherence.	behavior;chronic disease;cognition disorders;color gradient;hormone therapy;interaction;mammary neoplasms;progressive disease;survivors;therapeutic procedure;cellular targeting;population health	Mehdi Boukhechba;Sonia Baee;Alicia L.

Clinical notes, which document patient encounters, often contain a certain set of patient information including demographics, medical history, surgical history, examination results or the current medical condition that is propagated from one clinical note to all subsequent clinical notes for the same patient. To this end, we present a system, which automatically generates this patient information for the creation of a new clinical note. We use semantic patterns and an approximate sequence matching algorithm for capturing the discourse role of sentences, which we show to be a useful feature for determining whether the sentence should be repeated. Our system is shown to perform better than a simple baseline metric using precision/recall results. We believe such a system would allow clinical notes to be more complete, timely, and accurate.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);demography;human-readable medium;note (document);patients;sentence	Frank Meng;Ricky K.

e95d65879b0f0c5a95b96035e844082a3a4d7a7d	towards multimodal modeling of physicians' diagnostic confidence and self-awareness using medical narratives		Misdiagnosis is a problem in the medical field, often related to physicians’ cognitive errors. Overconfidence is considered a major cause of such errors. Intelligent diagnostic support systems could benefit from understanding how aware physicians are of their performance when they estimate their confidence in a diagnosis (i.e. a physician’s diagnostic self-awareness). Shedding light on the cognitive processes related to such awareness could also help improve medical education. We use a multimodal dataset of medical narratives to computationally model diagnostic confidence and self-awareness based on physicians’ linguistic and eye movement behaviors. Dermatologists viewed images of cutaneous conditions, providing a description, diagnosis, and certainty level for each image case, while their speech and eye movements were recorded. We define both a generalized and a personalized approach to binning confidence levels, used in classification experiments. We also introduce truly multimodal features, which focus on combining linguistic and eye movement data into multimodal attributes. Results indicate that combinations of multiple modalities can outperform their constituent modalities in isolation for these problems.	experiment;multimodal interaction;personalization;product binning;self-awareness	Joseph Bullard;Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm;Qi Yu;Pengcheng Shi;Anne R.

However, despite the existence of structured data in the form of well-established nursing terminologies, computer-based nursing record systems are yet to achieve widespread adoption and few of the potential benefits have yet to be realized. In this paper we argue the need for tools and techniques to support the entry of structured nursing data into computer-based systems. In the absence of a generally accepted solution, we build on preliminary work carried out at the 2002 Nursing Terminology Summit and analyze the results of other studies in order to identify a preliminary set of requirements or desiderata for such tools and techniques. These requirements are centered on: how structured data is presented to users for selection; how to mediate between a variety of conceptual structures--terminologies, information models, user interface models and models of the clinical process; and how to reduce the considerable modeling burden through reuse of modeling constructs. Further applied research is needed with the ultimate goal of developing a general solution that will benefit nurses, other professionals and ultimately their patients.	breast feeding;data model;informatics (discipline);information model;nomenclature;nursing records;patients;promotion (action);requirement;reuse (action);standardized nursing terminology;user interface device component;applied research;benefit	Nicholas R.

DESIGN Intensive interviews were conducted using a conversational, unstructured, exploratory interview style.   SETTING Interviews were conducted at 3 publicly accessible library sites in Arizona, Hawaii and Nevada.   PARTICIPANTS Thirty-eight non-experts were interviewed.   RESULTS Three separate and distinct methods used to identify credible health information resources were identified. Consumers may have strong opinions about what they mistrust; use fairly rigorous evaluation protocols; or filter information based on intuition or common sense, eye appeal or an authoritative sounding sponsor or title.

6415e92ee8a7ba21757309ca1f1b87a2c1b35abb	lege feliciter: using structured english to represent a topographic hydrology ontology	description logic;english language	The mathematical nature of description logics has meant that domain experts find it hard to understand. This forms a significant impediment to the creation and adoption of ontologies. A number of approaches are being taken to attempt to mitigate this problem. The two most common approaches are to either provide an English like syntactic veneer to OWL, or to provide a way to convert OWL statements to English to render them more readable. This paper introduces a constrained English language called Rabbit that has been designed to better enable domain experts to author ontologies in a way that is understandable to them. Rabbit is intended to improve on existing methods through: greater clarity of expression due to the involvement of the domain expert both in the development of Rabbit, its authoring and use; the ability to hide certain modelling complexities and optimisations; and encouragement, through its grammar, to produce short sentences that are more easily interpretable. We see Rabbit as complementary to OWL, extending its reach to those who need to author and understand domain ontologies but for whom descriptions logics are difficult to comprehend.	ambiguous grammar;description logic;natural language;ontology (information science);structured english;subject-matter expert;topography;web ontology language;while	Glen Hart;Catherine Dolbear;John Goodwin	2007			computer science;capacitive sensing;phase (waves);data mining;structured english;ontology (information science);upper ontology;phase detector;topographic map;resistive touchscreen	Web+IR	-36.914523859182324	-77.75121215423724	87253

This is a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by the recurrence of manic and depressive episodes if not treated. The phenotypic representation of Bipolar Disorder is variable, different evidence suggest contributions from genetic and environmental factors. General practitioners and psychiatrists may be able to evaluate the individual patient’s clinical course and the therapies impact on it. Several medications are available for the treatment of Bipolar Disorder, however these need to be monitored in order to guarantee the clinical efficacy, prevent adverse reactions and ultimately reduce the risk of suicide which in Bipolar Disorder patients is 10 to 20 times higher than the general population. We have developed a database to integrate the clinical information collected from the patients with the corresponding genetic data provided by the Section of Clinical Pharmacology of the University of Cagliari, where the BioBank is maintained. We have developed the database using the MySQL RDBMS, on an Ubuntu server. The interface is developed in PHP using Symfony framework. The server is installed in a protected environment providing secure access to the users with different privilege levels for the access of sensitive data, therefore ensuring the privacy of the patients. Our database must provide: 1) access and tools to doctors interviewing the patients, 2) ability to retrieve and analyze data for doctors carrying out clinical research 3) a way to manage experimental results for biologists in the laboratory 4) data retrieval and analysis tools for biostatisticians. The aim is to give the doctors and the researchers all the relevant facts together, to help in the decision making for drug therapies and patient follow up and to path the way to discover new drug targets. This is a step in the long-term aimed to provide the patients of the Clinic with personalized medicine and treatments. Proceedings IWBBIO 2014.

General Practitioners (GPs) are ideally positioned to deliver preventive health and early intervention as part of young people's routine health care. A quick and effective way for GPs to identify areas of concern is through technology-based health screening tools, which are acceptable to young people and facilitate self-disclosure about sensitive topics. Despite these advantages, the rate of using this technology remains low. This is the first study that involves all end users and stakeholders in the design of a health screening technology for young people in general practice settings. Our rich findings on the design needs and concerns of young people, GPs, practice staff and parents regarding technologies for health communication will be useful to any researchers and practitioners designing health technologies in a general practice setting.	emergentism	Marianne Webb;Lena Amanda Sanci;Sylvia Deidre Kauer;Greg Wadley	2015		10.1145/2838739.2838756	knowledge management;health;health education	HCI	-60.51114770846065	-57.10469499873314	87494

METHODS Experimental materials used in this study were provided by the 2011 i2b2 Natural Language Processing Challenge. The 2011 i2b2 challenge involves co-reference resolution in medical documents. Concept mentions have been annotated in clinical texts, and the mentions that co-refer in each document are linked by co-reference chains. Normally, there are two ways of constructing a system to automatically discoverco-referent links. One is to manually build rules forco-reference resolution; the other is to use machine learning systems to learn automatically from training datasets and then perform the resolution task on testing datasets.   RESULTS The existing co-reference resolution systems are able to find some of the co-referent links; our rule based system performs well, finding the majority of the co-referent links. Our system achieved 89.6% overall performance on multiple medical datasets.   CONCLUSIONS Manually crafted rules based on observation of training data is a valid way to accomplish high performance in this co-reference resolution task for the critical biomedical domain.	machine learning;markov chain;natural language processing;rule (guideline);rule-based system	Ping Chen;David Hinote;Guoqing Chen	2013		10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000770	natural language processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;machine learning;data mining;database	NLP	-49.68331264965615	-68.90460061112928	87779
7a01b56a1036e9a9ec86715f11f2174b37d02aa9	consumers' perceptions of a virtual health check: an empirical investigation		After years of the development of information systems (IS) designed primarily for healthcare managers and professionals, there is an increasing interest in reaching consumers and patients directly through consumer health information technology (IT). Consumer-centric health information systems enable individuals to manage their health better and maintain a healthier lifestyle. However, the foremost challenge in developing systems for health behavior change is that there is modest knowledge of how individuals interact with these systems and how they process and act on information. In addition, technologies cannot have the capacity to help facilitate self-monitoring and self-management or improve consumers' health outcomes if the consumers do not adopt them. The objective of this study is to investigate consumers’ perceptions of a virtual health check. Specifically, we propose and test factors affecting perceived persuasiveness of the system and whether perceived persuasiveness predicts intention to adopt virtual health coaching. A theoretically driven research model is constructed, and a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, namely partial least squares (PLS), is used to test the model against the data gathered from 130 subjects. The results of the study lend support to the proposed model. Studying the adoption, use, and impact of innovative consumer health IT is worthwhile, as it will guide future implementations.	foremost;information system;partial least squares regression;self-management (computer science);structural equation modeling	Tuomas Lehto;Harri Oinas-Kukkonen;Timo Pätiälä;Osmo Saarelma	2012			health care;implementation;marketing;health coaching;structural equation modeling;information system;computer science;behavior change;health informatics;health information technology	HCI	-62.29945095511239	-62.12251876798488	87864
274f48b7e7ee51c75175b828fa04e1296d3b937a	a genetic algorithm for discovering linguistic communities in spatiosocial tensors with an application to trilingual luxemburg		Multimodal social networks are omnipresent in Web 2.0 with virtually every human communication action taking place there. Nonetheless, language remains by far the main premise such communicative acts unfold upon. Thus, it is statutory to discover language communities especially in social data stemming from historically multilingual countries such as Luxemburg. An adjacency tensor is especially suitable for representing such spatiosocial data. However, because of its potentially large size, heuristics should be developed for locating community structure efficiently. Linguistic structure discovery has a plethora of applications including digital marketing and online political campaigns, especially in case of prolonged and intense cross-linguistic contact. This conference paper presents TENSOR-G, a flexible genetic algorithm for approximate tensor clustering along with two alternative fitness functions derived from language variation or diffusion properties. The Kruskal tensor decomposition serves as a benchmark and the results obtained from a set of trilingual Luxemburgian tweets are analyzed with linguistic criteria.	genetic algorithm	Georgios Drakopoulos;Fotini Stathopoulou;Giannis Tzimas;Michael Paraskevas;Phivos Mylonas;Spyros Sioutas	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65172-9_53	tensor;premise;cluster analysis;community structure;heuristics;adjacency list;linguistics;social network;digital marketing;computer science	NLP	-41.22911061014549	-72.15129311691439	87942

In particular, we have focused on a full bayesian approach for deriving a smoothed formula that takes into account a-priori knowledge on the probability of terms. In fact, most of the efforts in improving the BM25 were done in capturing the language model (frequencies, length, etc.) but missed the fact that the constant equal to 0.5 used as a correction factor can be one of the parameters that can be modelled in a better way. This approach has been tested on a visual data mining tool and the initial results are encouraging.	data mining;language model;okapi bm25;smoothing	Emanuele Di Buccio;Giorgio Maria Di Nunzio	2013				ML	-37.870477598634885	-63.23257932525154	88064
3b05af642e330b0d796fbe8ec686e35fcaf1d2fc	an analysis of the standard english keyboard	standard english keyboard	A study of the nature of hand and finger motions in typing process was made, based on the data on time intervals between key strokes. Many of the results obtained confirm those formerly obtained by Dvorak and other researchers. In addition, it was [bund that each key sequence is affected by its context, thus proving that the mental aspects of typing directly affects its productivity, and that the performance analysis on a particular keyboard arrangement is not sufficient to predict the performance on other arrangements. Based on these results, the current English keyboard is judged to be a less than ideal tool for typing. However, when carefully examined, even a rudimentary measurement of certain factors of typing behavior would lead to a good understanding of some pertinent aspects of the typing process. We faced the problem of keyboard optimization in the process of developing a Japanese-input keyboard. Our approach here is based on the measurement of the time interval of key strokes, obtained from the typing performance of English text by a proficient typist, In this paper, we first present the findings based on these data, discuss an important human factors problem involved in them, then attempt to present an evaluation of the QWERTY keyboard in this perspective.	dvorak simplified keyboard;human factors and ergonomics;mathematical optimization;relevance	Yuzuru Hiraga;Yoshihiko Ono;Hisao Yamada	1980			computer science	HCI	-50.136993739786554	-53.73268930593194	88068
