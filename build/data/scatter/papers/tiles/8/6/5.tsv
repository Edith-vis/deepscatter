Two separate phase and gain mismatch cancellation loops are implemented which search for the minimum side-band component. A new sign detection method is also introduced which makes sure the direction of the loop is correct. Analytical models and mathematical derivations have been presented which corroborates the circuit implementation. A proof of concept prototype using off-the-shelf components have also been measured which suggests 38-dB side-band rejection (SBR). Furthermore, the measured TX EVM and BER are improved by an order of magnitude for a QPSK-modulated input signal.	radio frequency;transmitter	Ali Nikoofard;Siavash Kananian;Ehsan Hadizadeh;Ali Fotowat-Ahmady	2016	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2016.04.014	electronic engineering;intelligence quotient;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	61.65910044506398	60.315659576187564	23700

c7f79b31ceb2cba49bed51b09003fb03349faf00	distributed optimal load frequency control with non-passive dynamics		Motivated by an increase of renewable energy sources, we propose a distributed optimal load frequency control scheme achieving frequency regulation and economic dispatch. Based on an energy function of the power network, we derive an incremental passivity property for a well-known nonlinear structure preserving network model, differentiating between generator and load buses. Exploiting this property, we design distributed  controllers that adjust the power generation. Notably, we explicitly include the turbine-governor dynamics, where first-order and the widely used second-order dynamics are analyzed in a unifying way. Due to the non-passive nature of the second-order turbine-governor dynamics, incorporating them is challenging, and we develop a suitable dissipation inequality for the interconnected generator and turbine-governor. This allows us to include the generator side more realistically in the stability analysis of optimal load frequency control than was previously possible.	dynamic dispatch;first-order predicate;mathematical optimization;network model;nonlinear system;social inequality	Sebastian Trip;Claudio De Persis	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2017.2698259	automatic generation control;control theory;steady state;electricity generation;mathematics;passive dynamics;economic dispatch;passivity;network model;control engineering;automatic frequency control	Embedded	64.50181025948146	36.88772769389222	23755

Equalization is achieved using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The filter is implemented using variable gain blocks and delay elements. The variable gain function is implemented using a Gilbert cell topology, modified for high-speed application. The delay line is implemented using active devices. The active delay line consumes less area than a passive L-C delay line, and has improved bandwidth as well as performance over process variation. The equalizer is implemented in a 0.25-mum BiCMOS technology. To the best our knowledge, it is the first BiCMOS equalizer using an active delay line approach.	analog delay line;backplane;bicmos;delay line memory;equalization (communications);finite impulse response;gilbert cell;variable-gain amplifier	Hyoungsoo Kim;Franklin Bien;Youngsik Hur;Soumya Chandramouli;Jeongwon Cha;Edward Gebara;Joy Laskar	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378309	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;finite impulse response;mathematics	EDA	61.99487431311153	51.29278329912807	23968

The usage of voltage sensors to determine the grid voltage angle for synchronization and the grid voltage magnitude for the controller operation are avoided by applying a virtual flux concept in the proposed control scheme. The virtual flux concept is utilized to obtain the input power equations, which will be used to calculate the reference d (direct) and q (quadrature) axis currents. The estimated grid virtual flux provides a new approach in developing the proposed control structure of three phase VSC by including the d-q axes decoupling and the feed-forward components to enhance the performance of front-end VSC during load and supply voltage disturbances. Computer simulation and laboratory experiment are conducted to verify the operation and performances of the VSC under steady-state and transient conditions. The results indicate VSC utilizing the proposed virtual flux oriented control (VFOC) is able to produce unity power factor operation, low harmonic distortion of input line current, adjustable dc output voltage and fixed switching frequency.	clock rate;computer simulation;control flow;coupling (computer programming);distortion;experiment;mathematical model;modulation;optic axis of a crystal;performance;reference frame (video);sensor;shadow copy;steady state;unbalanced circuit;unity;voltage source	Azziddin M.

5d23666f5b1ed687d59e210f073b0fec801d33b5	scalable hydrokinetics power generation network for rural electrification		Among the renewable resources such as wind, biomass, hydel and solar, hydrokinetics is a largely untapped renewable resource that has good potential for small and medium-scale power generation. This work proposes a novel approach for scalable and modular hydrokinetics power generation from slow moving water bodies such as irrigation canals, by integration of multiple turbines with voltage droop control at point of interaction (POI). These units are anticipated to be especially useful in rural communities in powering applications for optimal utilization of water through drip-irrigation system. Each power generation unit (PGU) of the proposed architecture consists of a turbine-generator system with a power processing unit (PPU) that both extracts the maximum power available at any time and connects the output of the module to the POI. POI, in our case, is a dc link supported by battery storage system and an elastic load to ensure optimum utilization of all available power. PPU is proposed to consist of a MPPT ac-dc rectifier feeding power to a dc link and a converter for elastic load management. The simulation of the full integrated system is carried out in PowerSim and implementation results compared through a two-unit laboratory setup for parallel operation of multiple PGUs in tandem. The results show a good correlation between the anticipated results and measured values.	auditory perceptual disorders;community;computer data storage;converter device component;dc-to-dc converter;electrical connection;human body;irrigation informatics;large;load management;management science;maximum power transfer theorem;microgrid;physics processing unit;pregnant mare serum gonadotropins;preparation;prototype;rectifier device component;scalability;simulation;water resources;voltage	Muhammad Anees;Muhammad Awais;Nofil Bin Tariq;N.

This paper describes a novel measurement technique using acoustic waves for the transmission of multiple physical parameters from within the cavity of an injection mold to a receiver outside: temperature, pressure, velocity, and viscosity of polymer melt. Such a technique is a key to improved monitoring and control of plastic injection molding. A coded-acoustic wave modulation scheme enables multiparameter transmission through an acoustic transmitter with variable gains. This enables selective resonant frequencies that provide the carriers for the individual parameters to be transmitted, while suppressing noise induced in the modulation process. The presented acoustic wireless sensing method is applicable to a wide range of process monitoring scenarios.	8-bit;acoustic cryptanalysis;bit error rate;experiment;modulation;numerical analysis;polymer;rf modulator;radio frequency;relevance;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;thickness (graph theory);transmitter;velocity (software development)	Zhaoyan Fan;Robert X.

The technique is based on a real-time implementation of discrete Fourier transform, and it allows fast and accurate estimation of fundamental frequency and harmonics of a distorted signal with variable fundamental frequency. It is suitable for active shunt filter applications, when fast and accurate tracking of the reference signal is required to achieve a good control performance. The main application for the algorithm is aircraft ac power systems, where the fundamental frequency can be either fixed on 400 Hz and its actual value fluctuates around the nominal value, or variable in the range 360-900 Hz. Hence, a real-time estimation of fundamental frequency is essential for active filter control. The proposed algorithm has been at first implemented in Matlab/Simulink for computer simulation, and it has been compared with a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) algorithm for frequency detection and the synchronous dq reference method for harmonic detection. Experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the simulation results. The distorted current absorbed by a nonlinear load is analyzed and processed by means of a digital implementation of the algorithm running on the active shunt power filter control DSP, in order to calculate the active filter compensating current.	active filter;algorithm;computer simulation;discrete fourier transform;ibm power systems;matlab;nonlinear system;phase-locked loop;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulink	Elisabetta Lavopa;Pericle Zanchetta;Mark Sumner;Francesco Cupertino	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2015292	computer simulation;control engineering;frequency multiplier;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;frequency standard;engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;active filter	EDA	68.7919603658213	38.76934550733505	24241

For compensation, the magnitude and phase response of a predistorter should be easy to tune to match that of a nonlinear amplifier that is used in various standards. That is to say, the predistorter should show decreasing magnitude followed by increasing magnitude, and the phase must initially lag and then lead, or lead and then lag, as a function of the increasing power input. In doing so, the power turning point, gain & phase deviation, and phase lead & lag should easily be controlled by the proposed reconfigurable predistorter using a bias control and impedance transformer. These characteristics are provided by the nonlinearity of the FET and the movement of the bias point caused by negative current generation. This proposed predistorter can be adopted for a system that uses Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) 800MHz, and CDMA 1800MHz. For example, by adopting this reconfigurable predistorter in a CDMA 1800MHz, as much as 14 dB improvements in Adjacent Channel leakage Power Ratio (ACPR) at the 4 dB back off power level, can be achieved for the CDMA 1800MHz signal.	amplifier;radio frequency	Hyunil Kang	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e90-c.9.1664	power gain;field-effect transistor;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;multi-mode optical fiber;physics	EDA	64.32508424965407	47.03534944076721	24317

Thin film capacitors directly connected to LSIs using 3D integration technology are expected to reduce impedance for a power distribution network (PDN). We fabricated various multi-terminal 10 × 10 mm SrTiO3 thin film capacitors with the capacitance values larger than 1 µF, and explored the impedance in a high frequency region. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) and equivalent series inductance (ESL) values for the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors are affected by the number of contacts. Typically, the ESR values are less than 1 mΩ and the ESL values are estimated to be a few pH. The SrTiO3 MIM capacitors on Si interposers are suitable for reducing both self- and transfer-impedance of a PDN for 3D-LSIs.	characteristic impedance;coupling (computer programming);dmz (computing);embedded system;frequency band;integrated circuit;metal (api);series and parallel circuits;system integration;topological insulator;zero suppression	Koichi Takemura;Katsuya Kikuchi;Chihiro Ueda;Kazuhiro Baba;Masahiro Aoyagi;Kanji Otsuka	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on 3D System Integration	10.1109/3DIC.2009.5306572	materials science;ceramic materials;filter capacitor;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;film capacitor;equivalent series resistance	EDA	64.19127090213264	53.038883843975356	24435

This brief further discusses a phenomenon that seems to have been given little attention, i.e., the increase by 3 dB of the high-frequency part of the PHN of a realigned VCO compared to the PHN of the same VCO in free running. Considerations on the impact of this effect and of the cyclostationary nature of the PHN in realigned VCOs on some typical applications are also given. The results are verified by numerical simulations.	computer simulation;cyclostationary process;numerical analysis;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillator	Nicola Da Dalt	2014	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2013.2296195	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;phase noise	EDA	67.60673280411991	47.491967735452384	24738

32950afe276e272dc0050130e443782edf2728c7	modified droop method based on master current control for parallel-connected dc-dc boost converters		Load current sharing between parallel-connected DC-DC boost converters is very important for system reliability. This paper proposes a modified droop method based on master current control for parallel-connected DC-DC boost converters. The modified droop method uses an algorithm for parallel-connected DC-DC boost converters to adaptively adjust the reference voltage for each converter according to the load regulation characteristics of the droop method. Unlike the conventional droop method, the current feedback signal (master current) for one of the parallel-connected converters is used in the inner loop controller for all converters to avoid any differences in the time delay of the control loops for the parallel-connected converters. The algorithm ensures that the load current sharing is identical to the load regulation characteristics of the droop method. The proposed algorithm is tested with a mismatch in the parameters of the parallel converters. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified using Matlab/Simulink simulation.	boost converter;dc-to-dc converter	Muamer M. Shebani;M. Tariq Iqbal;John E. Quaicoe	2018	J.

29bf0bc999a5db34fb310715fb995c18e80307d5	high-performance time-based continuous-time sigma-delta modulators using single-opamp resonator and noise-shaped quantizer	time based quantization;noise coupling;biquadratic transfer function;continuous time sigma delta modulators	In this paper, a new methodology to improve the performance of continuous-time sigma-delta modulators is presented. The proposed structure notated as the time-based continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (TCSDM) utilizes the time encoding approach. Time-based encoding is known as a promising alternative to overcome the resolution problems of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in low-voltage circuits. The proposed TCSDM incorporates a novel time-based noise-shaped quantizer (NSQ) to significantly enhance its performance at a very low cost. Using the proposed NSQ, the modulator's noise-shaping order is improved by two without increasing the loop filter order. Furthermore, the implementation of the proposed TCSDM is alleviated using a new single-opamp resonator (SOR) to realize the loop filter. This significantly reduces the power consumption and saves more area. The concept is elaborated for a second-order TCSDM. The analytical calculations and the system-level simulation results are presented to verify the performance. To further confirm the effectiveness of the presented structure, the circuit-level implementation of the modulator is provided in TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. The results show that the proposed modulator achieves a dynamic range of 82dB over a 30MHz bandwidth while consuming less than 18.2mW power from a single 1V power supply. With the proposed NSQ and SOR, both the order and bandwidth requirements of the loop filter are relaxed, and as a result, the analog complexity of the modulator is significantly reduced.	delta-sigma modulation;operational amplifier;quantization (signal processing)	Mohsen Tamaddon;Mohammad Yavari	2016	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2016.08.008	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;control theory	Crypto	62.44192929724808	49.31457031698203	25167

The energy-conservation mode (ECM) control generates four different energy delivery paths for dual buck outputs with only one inductor. In addition, the superposition technique is used to achieve a minimized inductor current level. The average inductor current is equal to the summation of two output loads. Moreover, the IECM control activates the interleaving operation through the current interleaving mechanism to provide large driving capability as well as to reduce the output voltage ripple. As a result, 91% peak efficiency is derived and the output voltage ripple appears notably minimized by 50% using current interleaving at heavy load.

It is found that the flow of current is directly under the control of the duty cycle, and that the transformer's leakage inductance has a significant effect on the control characteristic of the converter. It is expected that such bidirectional converters will find wide applications in the interconnection of multiple sources of DC power to a common bus (e.g., in a DC uninterruptible power supply).

The proposed scheme utilizes the power drop phenomenon in the sense amplifier driving line, resulting in an 81.5% reduction in the amplitude of data-pattern-dependent sensing noise. It is very important to accurately model power drop in compensating data-pattern-dependent sensing noise. Simulation and measurement of the proposed sensing scheme show improvement of sensing noise over a conventional bit-line sense amplifier. Moreover, the type of sense amplifier driver circuit significantly affects the magnitude of the improvement. The impact of the sense amplifier driver layout is analyzed in order to better utilize the proposed scheme.

475df752025822ea1681325e03e2cafa9872c8eb	an energy efficient charging technique for switched capacitor voltage converters with low-duty ratio		Charging a capacitor array of a switched-capacitor (SC) dc-dc converter, supplying load circuits with a very short active period, can be pivotal to achieve high energy efficiency of its operation. This is because the capacitors may lose most of the stored energy during a long sleep period, and thus every sleep-to-active transition requires full recharging of the capacitors. In this brief, we present an energy efficient capacitor charging technique called split-capacitor charging, which charges a capacitor array in a step-wise fashion. Circuit simulations demonstrate that the proposed technique can reduce the energy wastage during sleep-to-active transition up to 66%. When tested on load circuits with a short active period, a voltage converter employing the proposed charging method shows up to 24% improvement in energy efficiency over conventional SC converters.	dc-to-dc converter;duty cycle;integrated circuit;power domains;simulation;switched capacitor;voltage converter	Saad Arslan;Syed Asmat Ali Shah;Jae-Jin Lee;Hyungwon Kim	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2017.2751146	duty cycle;resistor;capacitor;electronic engineering;decoupling capacitor;mathematics;voltage;switched capacitor;electronic circuit;voltage converter	EDA	60.43218046292878	45.187773475232746	26000

By choosing a suitable chopping frequency ( fchop) located in GBW < fchop < NLBW (NoLoad Bandwidth), the ripple will be suppressed rather than amplified and the effect can be improve further by an extra filter. The COOB technique was employed in instrumentation amplifiers as examples and the extra filter was designed to passive filter. These chopper amplifiers were simulated on UMC 0.18 um technology with the help of Cadence SpectreRF.

It is often difficult to upgrade the UPS system as the load grows over time. Due to lower cost and maintenance, as well as ease of increasing system capacity, the parallel operation of modularized small-power UPS has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, a new scheme for parallel operation of inverters is introduced. A multiple-input-multiple-output state-space model is developed to describe the parallel-connected inverters system, and a model-predictive-control scheme suitable for paralleled inverters control is proposed. In this algorithm, the control objectives of voltage tracking and current sharing are formulated using a weighted cost function. The effectiveness and the hot-swap capability of the proposed parallel-connected inverters system have been verified with experimental results.	algorithm;channel capacity;hot swapping;inverter (logic gate);loss function;paging;power inverter;power supply unit (computer);state space;uninterruptible power supply;ups (debugger)	Kay Soon Low;Runzi Cao	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.918474	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;machine learning;control theory;computer performance;model predictive control	Robotics	64.63726854425869	36.288783071383584	26303

This paper presents a novel EF method for time-domain analysis of dc-dc converters-based upon a numerically robust time-delayed phase condition to track the envelopes of circuit states under a varying switching frequency. We further develop an EF technique that is applicable to both fixed and varying switching frequency operations, thereby providing a unifying solution to converters with pulse width modulation, pulse frequency modulation, and pulse skipping modulation. By adopting three fast simulation techniques, our proposed EF method achieves higher speedup without composing the accuracy of the results. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated using several dc-dc converter and oscillator circuits modeled using the industrial standard BSIM4 transistor models. A significant runtime speedup of up to 30X with respect to the conventional transient analysis is achieved for several dc-dc converters with strong nonlinear switching characteristics.	algorithm;clock rate;dc-to-dc converter;domain analysis;entity framework;feedback;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;pulse-width modulation;simulation;smoothing;speedup;transient state;transistor model	Ya Wang;Peng Li;Suming Lai	2016	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2016.2524565	control engineering;electronic engineering;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory;programming language;oscillation;robustness	EDA	67.27319641119198	46.22550121539377	26377
c40feae8fcf9f858bec6ab69eab49b90f175904e	accurate and fast harmonic detection based on the generalized trigonometric function delayed signal cancellation		The abundant grid-connected power electronic devices and non-linear loads used widely have caused power system harmonic pollution. Harmonic detection is very important for selective harmonic compensation used to improve the power quality. To detect the individual harmonic component accurately and fast, a harmonic extraction based on generalized trigonometric function delayed signal cancellation (GTFDSC) is proposed to extract the fundamental component or the desired harmonic component. The proposed GTFDSC can be used to accurately extract the desired harmonic component under various harmonic scenarios because of its excellent filtering capability. What’s more, the parameters of the GTFDSC can be flexibly designed according to the distribution of the harmonic series of the input signal, thereby reducing the delay time and the number of operators. Furthermore, the GTFDSC is self-adjustable to fundamental frequency deviations by introducing the frequency feedback loop, and it is able to achieve excellent filtering capability and fast dynamic performances. Lastly, the experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The integrated tunable filter covers the entire VHF bands without dividing the frequency range by multiple filters. By adopting tunable filter and HRM simultaneously, the overall harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) of over 65 dBc is obtained.

In this contribution, we introduce an algorithm that computes the transition strategies online at the cost of slightly higher computational burden. We also study numerical and DSP implementation issues and show that the computational cost is affordable in conventional DSP. The results are experimentally validated on IPMSM drive of rated power of 4. SkW.

Recently, various studies have focused on low-power solutions using LED BLUs in a multi-channel LED configuration [1–3]. While these methods effectively reduce power consumption of LED drivers with the phase-shifted backlight driving method [1], the transient response of the LED forward current is limited by the transient response of the boost converter in the LED driver IC. This makes it difficult to obtain a higher PWM dimming frequency than 1kHz in the LED BLU. In addition, the slow transition time of the LED current limits the minimum duty cycle and PWM dimming resolution. These problems generate audible noise and negatively affect the contrast ratio and power consumption of LCDs. To overcome these problems, we use an adaptive boost voltage with a double-loop control method. Here, the transient response of the LED current depends only on the transient response of the current regulator, which is significantly faster than that of the boost converter.	backlight;boost converter;contrast ratio;current source;diode;duty cycle;image noise;integrated circuit;lamp (software bundle);liquid-crystal display;low-power broadcasting;mercury;oled;pulse-width modulation;rise time	Seok-in Hong;Jin-Wook Han;Dong-Hee Kim;Oh-Kyong Kwon	2010	2010 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5434081	electronic engineering;computer hardware;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;liquid-crystal display;control theory;pulse-width modulation;transient response;boost converter;light-emitting diode	EDA	62.047893619943395	45.214201435945384	26663

The most important source of low frequency noise in such instruments is the solid state device (usually a Zener diode) which is used as voltage reference. By using a novel circuital topology in which a lead battery which does not supply current is used as voltage reference, we have been able to design an ultra low noise current source characterized by a low-frequency noise level some orders of magnitude lower than that of similar commercial instrumentation. The design, realization and testing of such current source is presented in this paper,	current source;diode;johnson–nyquist noise;noise (electronics);solid-state electronics;system of measurement;voltage reference	Carmine Ciofi;Romano Giannetti;Vincenzino Dattilo;Bruno Neri	1998	IEEE Trans.

ec0e72f4095ae07af3b4c05f1140008e4ce708fb	22.1 a self-tuning resonant inductive link transmit driver using quadrature-symmetric phase-switched fractional capacitance	tuning;resonant frequency;capacitors;antennas;capacitance;switches;integrated circuits	Inductive coupling for power transfer is increasingly popular in many applications such as RFID and wireless charging. While much recent work has focussed on receivers [1,2], less consideration has been given to the transmit function. High-Q antenna circuits are beneficial for several reasons. Activation of a link at a distance requires a large magnetic field from the transmitter, so for a given antenna current, lower driver voltages may be used, simplifying the driver and its power supplies, and improving overall efficiency. Further, the inherent filtering allows a high-efficiency switching driver to be used while reducing harmonics in the current. However, the consequent narrow bandwidth requires precise tuning to resonance. The excitation frequency may be varied in some applications, but this transfers the tuning problem to the receiver. Any transmit tuning circuitry must be linear with large voltages (from a few V to kV) and currents (mA to many A). A conventional technique is to use multiple external capacitors selected by large switches [3] or even relays. The number of selectable elements needed depends on the Q factor, component tolerances, and environmental effects, with a typical system requiring 5 or more extra capacitors and associated HV switches (Fig. 22.1.1), plus extra IC pins, adding to system cost and volume.	electronic circuit;inductive coupling;network switch;power supply;radio-frequency identification;relay;resonance;self-tuning;transmitter	H.

f34b576310e3a36b63808c7452c591b5c56397af	study of hybrid pre-distortion compensation approach for radar transmitter in ku-band with high frequency modulation rate - modeling and experiment	compensation;transfer function;modeling;ddws;hybrid pre distortion	Pre-distortion approach is used in frequency synthesizers to compensate the statistical phase errors in the synthesized signal. However, as the systems becoming more and more complex, it is hard to describe the phase errors for a complex system with one single model. In this paper, a hybrid pre-distortion approach was proposed for a transmitter composed of different modules with high frequency modulation rate. Models for different modules are combined to form the hybrid distortion model. Based on the proposed model and the convenience of the Direct Digital Waveform Synthesis (DDWS) technology employed in the transmitter, the distortion of a complex system can be feasibly compensated. Experimental studies were performed with reduced phase errors and improved range profiles achieved, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	baseband;complex system;distortion;frequency synthesizer;iteration;ku band;modulation;nonlinear system;phase-locked loop;radar;transmitter;waveform	Zheng Lu;Chao Li;Chao Chen;Guangyou Fang	2015	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.12.20150446	control engineering;electronic engineering;systems modeling;telecommunications;engineering;control theory;transfer function	EDA	66.08647143771212	52.10219087689748	26854

All typical specifications for controller design are experimentally checked in case of a boost converter, using only input/output data. The main innovation of this paper is the automatic and systematic application of the CRC method to controlled dc-dc converters.

First, resultant theory is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate low-order harmonics and to determine switching angles for a fundamental frequency-switching scheme. Next, based on the number of harmonics to be eliminated, Newton climbing method is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate high-order harmonics and to determine switching angles for the fundamental frequency-switching scheme. Third, the magnitudes and phases of the residual lower order harmonics are computed, generated, and subtracted from the original voltage waveform to eliminate these low-order harmonics. Compared to the active-harmonic-elimination method (AHEM), which generates square waves to cancel high-order harmonics, RAHEM has lower switching frequency. The simulation results show that the method can effectively eliminate all the specific harmonics, and a low total harmonic distortion (THD) near sine wave is produced. An experimental 11-level H-bridge multilevel converter with a field-programmable gate-array controller is employed to experimentally validate the method. The experimental results show that RAHEM does effectively eliminate any number of specific harmonics, and the output voltage waveform has low switching frequency and low THD.	analog-to-digital converter;clock rate;experiment;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;h bridge;hill climbing;ivy bridge (microarchitecture);newton;resultant;simulation;total harmonic distortion;waveform	Zhong Du;Leon M.

High channel devices are confronted with numerous challenges many of which can be addressed by adopting a multi-implant architecture. However now the difficulties lie in ensuring safety of the inter-implant interface by addressing the associated risks, often neglected in the past. This paper presents a multi-implant architecture-based 98-channel neurostimulator with an inter-implant interface consisting only of two wires, carrying both power and semi-duplex data. The interface is ac-coupled both to prevent high levels of dc current in the presence of insulation failures and to maintain a charge-balanced interface. The interface is also monitored within the stimulator itself for added means of safety. The stimulator is fabricated using a 0.35-μm HVCMOS technology and occupies 4.9 × 4.9 mm2 without any external discrete components, making it suitable for a chip-scale packaging.	chip-scale package;coupling (computer programming);duplex (telecommunications);electronic component;fail-safe;interface (java);neurostimulation;radio frequency;relevance;requirement;semiconductor industry;situated;spectral leakage;systems architecture;visual prosthesis;voltage source	Louis H.

ba4848c3644721b25910737e598ced872e83ba08	a new overvoltage control method based on active and reactive power coupling		With the development of photovoltaic policy, a large number of PVs will be connected to rural networks, which cause the higher photovoltaic permeability in rural networks in the future. However, the PV of high-permeability will cause very serious reverse power flow in the rural networks, which will lead to the problems of overvoltage and the increasement of network loss, and which also seriously affect the safety of users. The relationship between the active power and reactive power of the inverter is analyzed. The quantization’s relationship between the voltage and the active power or the reactive power in the rural networks is analyzed according to the capacity characteristics of the inverter. In order to minimize the reduction of photovoltaic active power, an active and reactive power coupling control strategy is proposed. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted considering the characteristics of economy and the topology of rural networks. The results of simulation show that the proposed control strategy and the optimal control algorithm can not only guarantee the efficient usage of inverter’s active and reactive power, but also realize the optimization of network loss.

In these systems, the mechanical anomalies such as load troubles, great torque dynamic variations, and torsional oscillations lead to shaft fatigue and aging of other mechanical parts such as bearings and gearboxes. In this paper, a gearbox-based electromechanical system is investigated. Initially, a simple gearbox dynamic model is used to show the effects of rotating input, output, and mesh frequency components on the electromagnetic torque and consequently on the stator current signature. By this model, the influence of transmission error, eccentricities of pinion/wheel, and teeth contact stiffness variation is demonstrated for a healthy gearbox. Then, it is shown that the electrical machine can be considered as a torque sensor through electromagnetic torque estimation for torsional vibration monitoring without any extra mechanical sensor.

In this paper a simplified current minimization technique for direct torque controlled IPM drives is proposed by utilizing a normalized look up table that is independent of motor parameters. The implementation strategy also includes the effect of field weakening, both due to the operation of the the motor above rated speed and due to a reduction in the dc-link voltage. The control strategy is supported by simulation results and demonstrated experimentally using a 2.5 KW IPM motor.	algorithm;control theory;experiment;lookup table;mathematical optimization;simulation	T.

A novel topology of analog front-end (AFE), which combines the auto-zero technique and channel switching method to obtain both low-noise and low-power features, is presented in this work. A time-domain-based modulation approach reduces the power consumption of wireless transmitter dramatically by 80%. A RF energy harvester is also employed in this chip for sustainable use. The input referred noise and average power per channel of AFE are 0.5 μVrms and 1.345 μW respectively. The whole system consumes only 473 μW while performing the signal recording and wireless transmission. Furthermore, practical experiments of human EEG signal recording are demonstrated to verify the functions of proposed SoC.	analog front-end;cmos;electroencephalography;experiment;low-power broadcasting;modulation;rf modulator;semiconductor device fabrication;signal-to-noise ratio;system on a chip;transmitter	Kun-Ying Yeh;Yu-Jie Huang;Tung-Chien Chen;Liang-Gee Chen;Shey-Shi Lu	2018	2018 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)	10.1109/VLSI-DAT.2018.8373250	wireless sensor network;chip;electronic engineering;computer science;radio frequency;wireless;transmitter;modulation;cmos;communication channel	EDA	56.301201635660306	52.251466300746664	27769

Monitoring of certain low-order harmonics in the power supply is more important than monitoring of the entire spectrum because, usually, these are the most significant ones. In this paper, a technique based on an adaptive wavelet neural network that is the most suitable for dominant low-order harmonic estimation is presented. The proposed method works with only half-cycle data point inputs, compared to the requirement of at least one-complete-cycle data for other estimation techniques. A simple, fast converging, and reliable learning algorithm based on back propagation is used for training of the network parameters. The proposed method is examined with a number of simulated and experimental signals. The test results confirm that the proposed method accurately estimates the dominant low-order harmonics in pragmatic situations of fundamental frequency deviation, presence of interharmonics, low signal-to-noise ratio, etc.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;data point;power electronics;power supply;signal-to-noise ratio;software propagation;wavelet	Sachin K.

02dce8347ea853582d95988ac8da28cbd2bc6b5e	design of rbfn controller based boost type vienna rectifier for grid-tied wind energy conversion system		This paper presents a radial basis function network (RBFN) controller-based three-phase boost-type Vienna rectifier for a grid-tied wind energy conversion system. Boost-type Vienna rectifier is an ac/dc converter characterized by high power density and improved power factor in addition to maintaining a sinusoidal current with low total harmonic distortion at the input side. Such converter systems find its utility and application related to unidirectional power flow, such as data centers, telecommunication systems, and more appropriately for wind energy conversion systems. This paper involves the implementation of an RBFN-based control strategy for Vienna rectifier to ascertain the ability of the proposed strategy to obtain enhanced performance of a wind energy conversion system. The choice of the RBFN for the control of the rectifier system stems from its inherent capability to ensure better dynamic control notwithstanding its capability to reduce the design complexities during the network training phase. Simulation is carried out using MATLAB Simulink for a 1-kW standalone and grid-tied wind energy conversion system. This paper involves carrying out the detailed analysis and results for different wind velocities under standalone and grid-tied conditions.	control theory;data center;matlab;norm (social);radial (radio);simulation;simulink;total harmonic distortion;vienna rectifier	D.

362eb996a10aa428acf6d3509c7d65861a9ac155	a novel computer-assisted design tool for implantable mems pressure sensors		Nowadays, implantable biomedical devices generally join together MEMS-based sensors and CMOS electronics in order to perform the measurement and transmission of physiological signals, respectively. This work focuses on the analytical modelling of capacitive MEMS pressure sensors, along with the development of a MEMS design tool, which provides a sensor design proposal based on the fulfilment of a user-specified input constraint set. Two separate folders are generated as outputs by the tool, containing all the files required to perform both electromechanical and electromagnetic analyses of the sensor in Ansys®, as well as to create a sensor layout cell ready to be included in Cadence® designs. Several MEMS capacitive pressure sensors have been fabricated in PolyMUMPS technology with the assistance of the proposed design tool.

An optical transceiver with a retiming capability would significantly enhance the usability of the link by extending the reach. Such optical transceivers should operate without an external clock source since a small form factor is imperative. The optical link we develop has a four-lane configuration that consists of an electrical-to-optical (E/O) converter and an optical-to-electrical (O/E) convertor (Fig. 22.7.1). Both the E/O and O/E convertors are equipped with a per-lane reference-less clock-and-data recovery (CDR) circuit that enables independent operation of each lane. The transceiver pitch is 250μm/lane, which matches the fiber pitch of the optical-fiber array used in the link. Since the jitter added by the CDR should be minimized in retimer applications, an LC-VCO is a preferable choice for clock-signal generation. At this transceiver pitch, however, the coupling through mutual inductances between LC tanks has a significant impact on the CDR characteristics. To address this concern, we analyze the impact of inter-VCO coupling and design the CDR so that the coupling does not affect the CDR performance. Each lane of the E/O convertor consists of a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), a CDR, and a VCSEL driver with a two-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) (Fig. 22.7.1). Each lane of the O/E convertor has a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) stage followed by a limiting amplifier (LA), a CDR, and an electrical-line driver with a two-tap FFE. All the CDRs have an identical design consisting of a flip-flop for the data decision, a selector for bypass-mode operation, a Pottbacker type phase-frequency detector (PFD) [1], a charge pump (CP), a lag-lead filter, and a quadrature LC-VCO (QVCO). During the bypass mode, the CDR loop is set into a power-down mode where the VCO does not oscillate.	bicmos;characteristic impedance;charge pump;clock generator;clock recovery;data rate units;data recovery;equalization (communications);flops;flip-flop (electronics);imperative programming;lc circuit;line driver;operational amplifier;optical fiber;passive optical network;phase frequency detector;retiming;server (computing);silicon-germanium;small form factor;source-to-source compiler;television interface adaptor;transceiver;usability;voltage-controlled oscillator	Takayuki Shibasaki;Yukito Tsunoda;Hideki Oku;Satoshi Ide;Toshihiko Mori;Yoichi Koyanagi;Kazuhiro Tanaka;Tomohiro Ishihara;Hirotaka Tamura	2015	2015 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC) Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063101	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;optical fiber;coupling;bandwidth	EDA	60.481547217720916	53.05388752259566	28184

In particular, we consider here the case where a filter is constructed using two fractional-order capacitors both of the same order α. A fractional-order capacitor is one whose impedance is Zc = 1/C(jω)α, C is the capacitance and α (0 < α ≤ 1) is its order. We generalize the design equations for low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, all-pass and notch filters with stability constraints considered. Several practical active filter design examples are then illustrated supported with numerical and PSpice simulations. Further, we show for the first time experimental results using the fractional capacitive probe described in Ref. 1.		Ahmed Gomaa Radwan;Ahmed S. Elwakil;Ahmed M.

a0e57b44b8fc6e8c681e9ed54e5fcdc0106d4fa3	a pulse frequency modulation vco-adc in 40 nm		This brief describes the architecture and implementation of a novel voltage-controlled oscillator-based analog-to-digital converter (VCO-ADC). Instead of a ring oscillator, the VCO is built with a pulse frequency modulation architecture where an analog feedback loop ensures both oscillation and linearity of the voltage-to-frequency conversion. A multibit first-order noise-shaped output is achieved by sampling a digital delay line that acts as a part of the oscillator and as a multibit quantizer. A prototype has been implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process. Although most of the circuit elements are taken from a standard digital library, a transconductor is required as the input stage. To ensure proper linearity, a bulk-driven transconductor has been designed. The ADC measurements reach 53 dB of SNDR at 1 GHz sampling frequency in a 20-MHz bandwidth with a pseudo-differential architecture. Powered at 1.1 V, the power consumption is 3.5 mW. The active area is 0.08 mm2. The resulting figure-of-merit equals 242 fJ/step.		Eric Gutierrez;Carlos Perez;Luis Hernandez;Fernando Cardes;Violeta Petrescu;Sergio Walter;U.

Such a reduced phase shift variation is particularly useful to simplify the signal phase/amplitude control for the various paths of a phased array system, and allows to implement ultra-low sidelobe phased arrays.

In order to solve these problems, we propose to replace the second order lowpass interpolative SDMs to a specific class of second order bandpass interpolative SDMs with the natural frequencies of the loop filters very close to zero. The global stability property of this class of second order bandpass interpolative SDMs is characterized and some interesting phenomena are discussed. Besides, conditions for the occurrence of limit cycle and fractal behaviors are also derived, so that these unwanted behaviors will not happen or can be avoided. Moreover, it is found that these bandpass SDMs may exhibit irregular and conicallike chaotic patterns on the phase plane. By utilizing these chaotic behaviors, these bandpass SDMs can achieve higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tonal suppression than those of the original lowpass SDMs.	chaos theory;delta-sigma modulation;fractal;instability;limit cycle;low-pass filter;oversampling;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density;zero suppression	Charlotte Yuk-Fan Ho;Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling;Joshua D.

A novel frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar principle with pulsed active reflector is employed. This High-Precision-Localisation-System (HPLS) will be implemented together with common WLAN systems that are used for data communication purposes. Due to its high data rate capabilities and large potential bandwidth, the 802.11a/n standard allocated bandwidth around 5.5 GHz is applied. Special emphasis is given to the system's reconfigurability by efficiently using inherent synergies between the WLAN system and the HPLS approach. To allow multifunctional tasks, highly integrated system on chip (SoC) frontends will be designed on advanced CMOS or BiCMOS technology. Smart power and adaptive performance control will be applied to minimise the power consumption according to application needs. In order to enhance performance and coverage range, the transceiver features adaptive antenna combining (AAC) in the radio frequency (RF) receiver. AAC significantly decreases the power consumption, size and costs, since the number of multiple components is reduced to a minimum. Because of the high 3-D resolution and real-time ability, which can be achieved in indoor environments with strong multipath effects and fading, novel local positioning applications, e.g. for smart factories, robotics, interactive guiding, object tracking and augmented reality are presumably leading to a large economic potential.	advanced audio coding;augmented reality;bicmos;cmos;data rate units;modulation;multi-function printer;multipath propagation;positioning system;radar;radio frequency;real-time clock;reconfigurability;robotics;synergy;system on a chip;transceiver	Frank Ellinger;Jörg Carls;Silvan Wehrli;Heinz Jäckel;Christian Kromer;Leif Wiebking;Alexander Dabek;Jörg Hüttner;Richard Roskosch;Roland Gierlich;Claus Seisenberger;Mario Huemer;Ralf Mosshammer;Thomas Ussmüller;Robert Weigel;Viswanathan Subramanian;Marko Krcmar;Georg Böck;Demosthenes Doumenis	2006	2007 16th IST Mobile and Wireless Communications Summit		embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Robotics	59.277233934967704	56.009971785819715	28921

24fe9494aa8912895bb80b95e5659c720b56330d	an injection frequency-locked loop—autonomous injection frequency tracking loop with phase noise self-calibration for power-efficient mm-wave signal sources		"""This paper presents a fast and autonomous injection frequency tracking and locking technique. In the present injection-locking system, a quadrature injection-locked oscillator (QILO) is third harmonically locked to a quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO). In the frequency tracking loop, the frequency difference between QVCO and QILO is extracted using the QILO’s amplitude modulated (AM) envelope waveform. The AM frequency of the envelope signal bears frequency difference between the two oscillators. The envelope signal is further converted to pulse signal which subsequently drives digital feedback control circuitry to update the QILO’s output frequency so that it can track the third harmonic of the injection QVCO. The frequency calibration process is purely autonomous, self-initiating whenever the AM modulated envelope waveform is generated. The feedback signal is primarily processed in the digital domain, resulting in a compact, fast, and power-efficient injection frequency-locked loop (IFLL). By incorporating a phase noise (PN) calibration routine after completing the frequency calibration, the presented IFLL resolves the intractable issue of PN degradation at the edge of the slave oscillator’s injection locking range. This results in a large injection frequency tracking range of 26.5–29.7 GHz which is only limited by the QILO’s <italic>LC</italic> tank tuning range.

A conventional cascade structure is adopted to design the proposed controller, where the outer loop is used to regulate the dc-link voltage, and the inner loop is designed as a current controller for adjusting the active and reactive powers injected into the grid. For each loop, the controller is derived based on combining a continuous-time nonlinear model predictive control and nonlinear disturbance observer techniques. It turns out that the composite controller reduces to a nonlinear PI controller with a predictive term that plays an important role in improving tracking performance. The salient feature of the proposed approach is its ability to approximately preserve the nominal tracking performance during the startup phase. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of nominal performance recovery, disturbance rejection, and current control.	inner loop;nonlinear system;power inverter;rejection sampling;simulation;software performance testing;solar inverter	Rachid Errouissi;Ahmed Al-Durra;S.

In particular, we focus on systems where oscillators are connected to a common node through identical branch impedances. For such networks, it is shown that the synchronization condition is independent of the number of oscillators and the value of the load impedance connected to the common node. Theoretical findings are then leveraged to control a system of parallel single-phase voltage source inverters serving an impedance load in an islanded microgrid application. The ensuing paradigm: i) does not necessitate communication between inverters, ii) is independent of system load, and iii) facilitates a modular design approach because the synchronization condition is independent of the number of oscillators. We present both simulation and experimental case studies to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the proposed application.	characteristic impedance;input impedance;inverter (logic gate);linear time-invariant theory;load (computing);microgrid;modular design;nonlinear system;programming paradigm;simulation;time complexity;time-invariant system;voltage source	Brian B.

The IFQB transmitter can produce a quadrature modulated signal without active RF circuits, such as PLL, local generation, and local distribution circuits. Thus, the IFQB technique can significantly reduce the power consumption while achieving denser constellations by the quadrature modulation. The RF-powered transceiver consists of the IFQB transmitter, an OOK receiver, and a power management unit (PMU) for RF powering. The transmitter and receiver operate under a 0.6 V power supply provided by the PMU to further reduce the power consumption. We fabricated a prototype RF-powered transceiver using a 65 nm Si CMOS process to confirm the validity of the proposed technique. During the measurements, the transmitter achieved 2.5 Mb/s with a 32-QAM modulation while consuming 113 μW. In addition, a wireless temperature sensing demonstration was conducted using the prototype sensor node with the presented RF-powered transceiver.	cmos;clenshaw–curtis quadrature;mebibyte;modulation;phase-locked loop;power management unit;power supply;prototype;radio frequency;sensor node;spectral efficiency;transceiver;transmitter	Atsushi Shirane;Yiming Fang;Haowei Tan;Taiki Ibe;Hiroyuki Ito;Noboru Ishihara;Kazuya Masu	2015	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2015.2454235	frequency modulation;transmitter;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;transmitter power output;wireless;transceiver	EDA	58.43660567246263	46.41548438151497	29308

We propose a novel process to integrate magnetic thin-film inductors using CMOS-MEMS and magnetic film processing technologies. When used in IF filters, great power saving and a high degree of integration can be achieved compared with conventional SAW or Gm-C filters at IF. Magnetic thin-film inductors are much more compact than conventional inductors. Since the electromagnetic field is well confined in the magnetic film, cross-coupling is greatly reduced. With thin film (/spl sim/1 /spl mu/m) and thus less eddy current loss it is capable of frequency up to GHz. Prototype CMOS-MEMS inductors with 0.2 /spl mu/m permalloy (NiFe) thin-film were fabricated and tested. A 10X increase in both inductance and Q was observed, and the peak Q was sustained up to 200 MHz.	3d film;cmos;display resolution;electronic filter;intermediate frequency;microelectromechanical systems;prototype;radio frequency	Gang Zhang;L.

Unfortunately, it comes at the cost of a very low energy efficiency of the analog transmitter. Numerous circuit-level and signal processing techniques have been proposed to improve that energy efficiency. However more disruptive improvement can be achieved at system-level, capitalizing on energy-scalable design and circuit reconfiguration to match the user requirements and operation environment. We describe the design of such an energy-scalable reconfigurable transmitter as well as its control strategy. Based on measurement carried out on the physical realization of this transmitter, the benefit of system-level energy management is shown. Energy-efficiency scalability ranges over 30%, which translates in an average system-level energy improvement of up to 40% compared to a non-scalable system.	control theory;modulation;multiplexing;requirement;scalability;signal processing;transmitter;user requirements document	Björn Debaillie;Bruno Bougard;Gregory Lenoir;Gerd Vandersteen;Francky Catthoor	2006	2006 43rd ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference	10.1145/1146909.1147050	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal processing	EDA	58.27569726934455	55.471259258678934	29853

The analysis is founded only on the following two experimentally confirmed conditions: 1) the time required for a complete reversal of flux under unloaded conditions is inversely proportional to the magnitude of a step-driving field which is in excess of the critical field required to initiate flux change; 2) the open circuit voltage-time output waveforms caused by step driving currents are identical when normalized with respect to amplitude and time. The normalized output voltage waveform f?(x) is used to develop a terminal characteristic equation. It is shown that f?(x) may be obtained by using a nonideal step-input current. Utilizing a modified Gaussian equation to represent f?(x), equations are developed to allow the prediction of core response to arbitrary input waveforms, using 4 parameters easily obtained from voltage response vs NI step-drive plots, and f(x), which is the integral of the normalized expression for the open circuit voltage f?(x), and is proportional to the flux switched in the core. The equations are expanded to include a load circuit and to test the validity of the expressions developed. Theoretical and experimental results are compared for a core loaded with series RL and RLC circuits with both ramp and step-drive currents. Agreement is shown to be good, even though the core used was not particularly thin.	ferrite (magnet);network analysis (electrical circuits)	Robert Betts;Geoffrey Bishop	1961	IRE Trans.

ba0e8433781175d2595f78446c25e3784f66d321	an implantable sacral nerve root recording and stimulation system for micturition function restoration		This paper provides a prototype neural prosthesis system dedicated to restoring continence and micturition function for patients with lower urinary tract diseases, such as detrusor hyperreflexia and detrusorsphincter dyssynergia. This system consists of an ultra low-noise electroneurogram (ENG) signal recording module, a bi-phasic electrical stimulator module and a control unit for closed-loop bladder monitoring and controlling. In order to record extremely weak ENG signal from extradural sacral nerve roots, the system provides a programmable gain from 80 dB to 117 dB. By combining of advantages of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) electronics and custom designed IC, the recording front-end acquires a fairly low input-referred noise (IRN) of 0.69 μVrms under 300 Hz to 3 kHz and high area-efficiency. An on-chip multi-steps single slope analogto-digital converter (ADC) is used to digitize the ENG signals at sampling rate of 10 kSPS and achieves an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 12.5. A bi-phasic current stimulus generator with wide voltage supply range (±0.9 V to ±12.5 V) and variable output current amplitude (0-500 μA) is introduced to overcome patient-depended impedance between electrode and tissue electrolyte. The total power consumption of the entire system is 5.61 mW. Recording and stimulation function of this system is switched by control unit with time division multiplexing strategy. The functionality of this proposed prototype system has been successfully verified through in-vivo experiments from dogs extradural sacral nerve roots. key words: neural prosthesis, functional electrical stimulation,closed-loop bladder control, acute animal experiment, spinal cord injury	characteristic impedance;circuit restoration;control unit;effective number of bits;electronic news-gathering;experiment;functional electrical stimulation;multiplexing;neuroprosthetics;prototype;sacral nerve stimulation;sampling (signal processing);tract (literature);video-in video-out	Yuan Wang;Xin Zhang;Ming Liu;Weihua Pei;Kaifeng Wang;Hongda Chen	2014	IEICE Transactions		computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;neuroscience;spinal cord injury;neural prosthesis;functional electrical stimulation;stimulation;sacral nerve root;urination	Security	56.50113820162699	51.2421981744847	29935

The combination of resistive weighting with identical chopped gain stages proved successful in gain, delay and offset matching. It demonstrated that the input referred thermal noise of the gain stages needs to aim for 15 bits, while the rest of the requirements such as channel matching (gain, delay, offset) and settling time need only 10 bits. The channel selecting logic has a serious impact on the ADC distortion, especially at high frequencies. For this reason, a robust channel selecting logic is suggested.	distortion;embedded system;johnson–nyquist noise;requirement;settling time	Johan Piper;Jiren Yuan	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1466048	control engineering;electronic engineering;effective number of bits;telecommunications;computer science;floating point;engineering;operating system;high frequency;noise;control theory;settling time	EDA	61.86817642466682	50.60334454370002	30163

The proposed memory consists of a source-follower type buffer, which delivers an appreciably enhanced accuracy over that of the conventional buffer, and a storage capacitor to meet the Analog CNN processing demands of accurate short-term storage and multi-reading capability. The enhanced linearity of the proposed buffer is achieved by adopting high-threshold cascode (HTC) structure and low parasitic capacitance switch (LPCS). Moreover, a low leakage bootstrap (LLB) structure is integrated to enhance the turn-off performance of switch, which reduces the leakage and improves the accuracy of buffer significantly. Simulated with 180 nm CMOS mixed-signal process, the proposed analog memory unit achieves power consumption of 3.6 μW and output error of 0.4%, with the input voltage swing of 1.1 V. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	artificial neural network;convolutional neural network	Qin Li;Yuntao Wu;Huifeng Zhu;Qi Wei;Fei Qiao;Sheng Zhang;Huazhong Yang	2018	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2018.04.001	capacitor;convolutional neural network;engineering;electronic engineering;bootstrapping (electronics);linearity;cascode;leakage (electronics);parasitic capacitance;cmos	ML	61.95725181025022	46.81503536057461	30168

The 12 inverter poles forming the VSC share a common dc bus and are implemented using standard power electronic building blocks of well-proven reliability. The output voltage is doubled by using an H-bridge configuration, and only a single-secondary grid coupling transformer is required. In addition, the intermediate magnetic elements ensure an equal power sharing between the four inverters. Since they also allow for the harmonic cancellation between the inverter poles and eliminate any third harmonic component created by the modulation, the output voltage waveform has a high quality, often eliminating the need for additional filtering.

The analysis presented here provides an approach for addressing known correlations which have been of concern in reporting key comparison results. Uncertainties for each participating National Metrology Institute (NMI), the key comparison reference value (KCRV), and the pairs of NMIs are determined by fully considering the covariances arising from interrelations among the results of participants because of the time dependence of the values of the transport standards. Uncertainties of the pilot laboratory are treated differently than those of other NMIs due to the predicted values of the transport standards for all NMIs being based on pilot laboratory data. The approach separates the Type A and Type B uncertainty components providing the benefit that data from multiple artifacts (three in this instance) reduces the computed Type A uncertainties.	glonass-k2	Nien Fan Zhang;Nell Sedransk;Dean G.

3fb1d67ac4e46a507ac4dac2b664efd569fabd90	high temperature pulsed-gate robustness testing of sic power mosfets		Silicon Carbide (SiC) gate oxide reliability still remains a crucial issue and is amongst the important consideration factors when it comes to the implementation of SiC MOS-based devices within industrial power electronic applications. Recent studies have emerged assessing the gate oxide reliability of SiC MOSFETs. Such studies are needed in order to fully understand the properties of SiC/SiO2 interface which is currently holding back the industry from fully utilising the superior features that SiC may offer. This paper aims to present experimental results showing the threshold voltage (VTH) and gate leakage current (IGSS) behaviour of SiC MOSFETs when subjected to pulsed-gate switching bias and drain-source bias stress at high temperature over time. The results obtained are then used to investigate the gate-oxide reliability of SiC MOSFETs. 2D TCAD static simulation results showing electric field distribution near the SiC/SiO2 interface are also presented in this paper.	and gate;acorn machine operating system;gate oxide;power mosfet;robustness testing;sic-povm;simulation;spectral leakage;traffic collision avoidance system	Asad Fayyaz;Alberto Castellazzi	2015	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2015.06.141	electronic engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	55.33406109846783	42.0344435079673	30331

Designs generate signal waveshapes that are very difficult to model using a single-parameter model such as the transition time. In this paper, we present a simple and robust two-parameter analytical expression for waveform modeling based on the Weibull cumulative distribution function. The Weibull model accurately captures the variety of waveshapes without introducing significant runtime overhead and produces results with less than 5% error. We also present a fast and simple algorithm to convert waveforms obtained by circuit simulation to the Weibull model. A methodology for characterizing gates for the new model is also presented. Simulation results for many single- and multiple-input gates show errors well below 5%.

f68212c34d8c78d6edfe3c0f2700b07082b493ff	analysis and design of multirate synchronous sampling schemes for sparse multiband signals		We consider the problem of developing efficient sampling schemes for multiband sparse signals. Previous results on multicoset sampling implementations that lead to universal sampling patterns (which guarantee perfect reconstruction), are based on a set of appropriate interleaved analog to digital converters, all of them operating at the same sampling frequency. In this paper we propose an alternative multirate synchronous implementation of multicoset codes, that is, all the analog to digital converters in the sampling scheme operate at different sampling frequencies, without need of introducing any delay. The interleaving is achieved through the usage of different rates, whose sum is significantly lower than the Nyquist rate of the multiband signal. To obtain universal patterns the sampling matrix is formulated and analyzed. Appropriate choices of the parameters, that is the block length and the sampling rates, are also proposed.	analog-to-digital converter;block code;forward error correction;nyquist rate;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix	María Elena Domínguez Jiménez;Nuria González Prelcic	2012			coherent sampling;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	56.761066739130165	59.681480308857175	30477

This is accomplished by introducing a high frequency signal onto power lines which feed the stator and monitoring a change in the capacitance between the individual windings during introduction of the high frequency signal. In order to monitor the change in capacitance, a current sensor and voltage sensor are used to measure the current and voltage on the power lines during introduction of the high frequency signal. Changes in the capacitance between the individual stator windings are reflected as changes in the broadband impedance response of the stator windings which can be calculated by dividing the measured voltage by the measured current.	algorithm;recursion (computer science)	Irena Pevac	2009			electric power transmission;electromagnetic coil;electronic engineering;voltage;current sensor;theoretical computer science;stator;capacitance;electrical impedance;recursion (computer science);computer science	ML	70.51788416377063	38.33186289851175	30530

It paves the way to the implementation of a monolithic timing microsystem where the ASIC is part of the housing of a newly designed tiny 131-kHz XTAL to reach extreme module miniaturization (1.5 × 1.1 × 0.7 mm 3) and integrity. As this task is still ongoing, an early demonstration of the generic versatile timing module is presented using a chip-on-board approach with standalone conventionally packaged XTAL and BAW resonators. The module achieves 0.4 μW power dissipation and ±2 ppm stability over -40 °C to 85 °C in RTC mode and can deliver on-demand programmable clocks between 1-50 MHz. The latter are obtained either with a RC PLL or after division of the signal obtained from a 2-GHz BAW DCO at a power dissipation of 100 μW and 5.3 mW, respectively.	application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;device configuration overlay;embedded system;interposer;on-board data handling;performance;phase-locked loop;real-time clock;wafer (electronics)	David Ruffieux;Nicola Scolari;Frédéric Giroud;Thanh-Chau Le;Silvio Dalla Piazza;Felix Staub;Kai Zoschke;Charles Alix Manier;Hermann Oppermann;Tommi Suni;James Dekker;Giorgio Allegato	2014	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2013.2282111		EDA	57.529361731798794	47.7958671493749	30543

To increase isolation among antenna elements, a novel metamaterial spiral S-shaped resonator is embedded between two radiating elements. The proposed resonator has planar configuration and miniaturized size and is capable of blocking electromagnetic propagation between antenna elements by exhibiting negative effective permeability in the desired frequency band. To illustrate and evaluate the design process, two design samples are fabricated and tested in WLAN frequency band and the agreement among measurement and simulation results approves the design method. In the frequency range of 2.38–2.48 GHz, some MIMO communication system requirements like total active reflection coefficient, envelope correlation coefficient and capacity loss are tested on design samples which show satisfactory results, so this method can be employed in designing array antennas for small mobile communication systems. The designed MIMO antenna systems separated by 13.8 mm (less than λ/9), has better than − 40 dB isolation coefficient and near zero correlation coefficient and capacity loss at the operating frequency (2.4 GHz).

f41a62162f09a36fc0ebd3fa286029451f4c9a3c	compact multi-resonance monopole antenna with dual band-stop property for uwb wireless communications	ultra wideband communications;band notched property;microstrip fed monopole antenna;protruded strip	A novel design of ultra-wideband (UWB) monopole antenna with dual frequency band-notched property is proposed. The antenna consists of a square radiating patch with a hook-shaped slit, a feed-line, and a modified ground plane with an inverted anchor-shaped and a pair of inverted $$\Gamma $$Γ-shaped protruded strips inside the rectangular slot. In the presented structure, by cutting an inverted T-shaped slit in the ground plane and also by converting this structure to the anchor-shaped slit, additional (third and fourth) resonances are excited and hence much wider impedance bandwidth, especially at the higher band can be produced which provides a wide usable fractional bandwidth of more than 130 % (2.8---13.3 GHz). In order to generate a single band-notched characteristic, we cut a hook-shaped slit at the radiating patch. Finally, by embedding a pair of protruded $$\Gamma $$Γ-shaped strips inside the rectangular slot in the ground plane, a good dual band-notched function is achieved. The measured results reveal that the presented dual band-notched monopole antenna offers a very wide bandwidth with two notched bands, covering all the 5.2/5.8 GHz WLAN, 3.5/5.5 GHz WiMAX and 4 GHz C bands. The designed antenna has a small size of $$12\times 18\,\hbox {mm}^{2}$$12×18mm2. Good return loss, antenna gain and radiation pattern characteristics are obtained in the frequency band of interest. Simulated and measured results are presented to validate the usefulness of the proposed antenna structure for UWB applications.	resonance;ultra-wideband	Nasser Ojaroudi;Noradin Ghadimi;Yasser Ojaroudi	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-2145-9	folded inverted conformal antenna;monopole antenna;random wire antenna;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;helical antenna;patch antenna;antenna;j-pole antenna;radiation pattern;dipole antenna;antenna efficiency	Mobile	66.17598351783828	57.97530536024967	30669

4482114c0cf642f5d70a17dd9fb92eb6b51f466e	a modified lyapunov-function based control strategy for three-phase grid-connected vsi with lcl filter	lyapunov function;voltage source inverter;global stability;grid connected inverter	In this paper, a modified Lyapunov-function based control strategy for three-phase grid-connected LCL-filtered voltage source inverter is presented. The grid-connected system is modeled in the synchronously rotating frame. Lyapunov-function based control is derived from the Lyapunov's direct method which guarantees the global stability of the closed-loop system. Although the conventional Lyapunov-function based control strategy offers global stability, it is not able to damp the inherent oscillations that occur on the grid current. Therefore, a modified Lyapunov-function based control strategy is proposed by adding the capacitor voltage feedback into the control loop. In the proposed control strategy, the measurement of inverter currents, capacitor voltages and grid currents are essential. The generation of reference functions in the d- and q-components can be achieved by using the reference d-component grid current. Computer simulation results are presented and reported to validate the proposed control approach.	computer simulation;control system;control theory;direct method in the calculus of variations;lazarus component library;lyapunov fractal;power inverter;voltage source	Hasan Komurcugil;Saban Ozdemir	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7794069	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.0457658306466	38.89666141331157	30691

In the excitation system, the control portion of the excitation system is the key to whether a system can effectively resist all kinds of emergencies. Regarding the excitation system of a high temperature superconducting machine, this paper proposes the design of an excitation system control strategy. Combining fuzzy control and conventional PID control strategy, the proposed composition has the advantages of an excitation control strategy, which can achieve a precise control purpose, and provides good adaptive ability and robustness. And on this basis, the proposed composition seeks to combine variable universe fuzzy control, to further improve the control precision of the system. The fuzzy PID control system simulation model and the variable universe fuzzy PID control are investigated. Results are compared and indicate that the variable universe fuzzy PID control demonstrates better dynamic and static performance.	control theory;excited state;fuzzy control system;high-throughput satellite;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;pid;precondition;requirement;simulation;universe;voltage regulation	Lanyong Zhang;An Cao;Yixuan Du	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-151946	simulation;control theory;fuzzy control system	Robotics	66.1869366097772	36.608294322890416	30727

Namely, the output to input conductances ratio error and charge injection error. Nevertheless, this cell has to be more improved. In this paper we deal with improving the performances of the grounded gate class AB memory cells in terms of settling accuracy and dynamic ranges. Mathematical models are built in order to optimize the running of the treated cell. Optimum criteria for design parameters is derived for both settling characteristic and noise. A relation between settling accuracy and SNR is defined and is analytically shown to be dependent on the effective geometric dimensions of the memory transistor.

An optimum gross efficiency of (1.36 ± 0.02)% was achieved, amounting to an increase of (290 ± 20)% relative to the performance of an equivalent single-stage accelerator. The performance increase due to pulse-shaping for a two-stage setup was found to surpass that achieved for this single-stage setup in terms of both efficiency and velocity. This investigation highlights the potential of pulse-shaping methods to increase the feasibility and flexibility of electrical acceleration for a variety of practical applications. The intention of this paper was to exhibit the potential of reluctance acceleration technology in multi-stage, initially by using a two-stage system. Possible avenues for further investigation are proposed, to build upon the results of this study.	noise shaping;pulse shaping;velocity (software development)	Michael J. Harris;M. Shaikh;B. T.

The proposed ADC includes digital foreground calibrated comparator and a novel capacitor switching method. The former one uses programmable voltage coming from resistive divider to control the bulk of latch input differential pair, therefore comparison speed does not need to compromise and the nonlinearity introduced by variation of input capacitance is reduced. The latter one utilizes two separated capacitor arrays in a post-comparison and binary tree manner so as to save power consumption of charge recycling. Moreover, asynchronous timing control and reference-free architecture is implemented to further decrease the power and simplify auxiliary circuits for ADC. It is designed in a 65nm digital CMOS process, achieving 49.9dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) and 72.0dB spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR) at the sampling rate of 50MS/s while consuming 192.8@mW from 1V power supply.

Impulse-radio ultrawideband (UWB) communications offer an efficient way to achieve high data rate at ultralow power for short-range links. We propose a digital UWB transmitter (TX) system-on-chip (SoC) designed for ultralow voltage in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS. It features a PLL-free architecture, which exploits the duty-cycling nature of impulse radio through aggressive duty cycling within the pulse modulation time slot for high energy efficiency and minimum jitter accumulation. Wide-range on-chip adaptive forward back biasing is used for threshold voltage reduction, PVT compensation, and tuning of both the carrier frequency and the output power. To ensure spectral compliance with output power regulations without the use of bulky and expensive off-chip filters, a programmable pulse-shaping functionality is integrated in the digital power amplifier based on a 7–9-GS/s, 5-b current DAC. Operated at 0.55 V, it achieves a record energy efficiency of 14 pJ/b for the TX alone and 24 pJ/b for the complete SoC with embedded power management. The TX SoC occupies a core area of 0.93 mm2.	audio power amplifier;biasing;cmos;carrier frequency;core (optical fiber);data rate units;die shrink;duty cycle;embedded system;mebibyte;modulation;noise shaping;overhead (computing);performance;phase-locked loop;power management;pulse shaping;radio frequency;system on a chip;transmitter;tree accumulation;ultra-low-voltage processor;ultra-wideband	Guerric de Streel;François Stas;Thibaut Gurn&#x00E9;;François Durant;Charlotte Frenkel;Andreia Cathelin;David Bol	2017	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2016.2645607	system on a chip;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;silicon on insulator;baseband	EDA	58.84101261794484	53.651203430584054	31272

We first show how, depending on the severity and location of a fault, different sets of generators can have different contributions to the inter-area oscillation modes. This information is used to construct the communication topology for feedback control. An additional layer of sparsity is imposed on top of this communication structure by posing an $\ell_{1}$-sparsification of the generator states that are transmitted through each communication link. An algorithm is provided where the designed sparse controller is also used to enhance the resiliency of the closed-loop system against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

The main purpose of this study is to improve the performance of nonautonomous MLC chaotic circuit using only CFOAs. CFOA-based topology used in this realization enables to simulate floating inductance. This modification provides to the designer wideband chaotic signals for secure communication systems. In addition to this major improvement, a CFOA-based nonlinear resistor was used in the new realization of nonautonomous MLC chaotic circuit. The usage of CFOA-based inductance simulator and nonlinear resistor in the circuit structure reduces the component count and provides isolated outputs.

The three principal components of the converter system, i.e. converter, electrical machine and control are considered. Different approaches to modeling of power semiconductor elements are described. A general switch model and the approach, based on the Petri net, to development of switch macromodel is presented. Electrical machine modeling based on its multiport dynamic network representation are considered, and chosen as adequate for simulations of converter/machine interactions. A basic structure and features of a general-purpose simulation program are considered. Pertinent features for its five basic stages, i.e. input/pre-processing, description of component models, equation formulation, numerical solution and output/post-processing is developed. Theoretical considerations presented in this paper, should enable, depending on a given problem to be solved, both the correct development of a special program or a rational choice of a general purpose simulation program. The practical implementation of the described methods, models and techniques into a general purpose simulation program, particularly into a TCAD package, is the topic of a companion paper.	simulation	Romuald Szczesny;Mieczyslaw Ronkowski	1995	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126695000394	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;simulation;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;algorithm	EDA	70.16763557207551	42.28545434402586	31383

Also, under changing DC bias conditions, not only linearity performance but also parameters of gain and power added efficiency (PAE) of the power amplifier have been investigated and obtained results have been evaluated.

fffebbd1f267a1bf95b7aab2d5d427b9ae5fe5d8	a bypass-switching sar adc with a dynamic proximity comparator for biomedical applications		A bypass-switching successive approximation (BSSA) register analog-to-digital converter (ADC) employing a newly proposed dynamic proximity comparator is presented in this paper. By exploiting the current characteristics of a current correlator, the proposed comparator generates the bypass signal directly along with the polarity comparison result. The bypass window size can be adjusted to optimize the power reduction for different sensing applications with low-voltage sensitivity. A BSSA logic circuit is adopted with reduced number of logic gates as well as switching power. A prototyped chip including a proposed ADC has been designed and fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process occupying an area of 0.041 mm2. With a supply voltage of 0.6 V and at a sampling rate of 50 kS/s, the measured signal-to-noise-distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) are 56.9 and 68.7 dB, respectively, achieving an effective number of bits (ENoB) of 9.16. The ADC consumes power of 114 nW while digitizing sinusoidal inputs. With a bypass window size of ±32 LSBs, the designed ADC consumes only 76 nW when quantizing full-scale electrocardiography signals that are generated from a certified commercial simulator, exhibiting a figure-of-merit (FoM) of 2.66 fJ/conversion-step. Besides ECG signals, the ADC is also demonstrated by digitizing electromyography and electrooculography signals from human bodies.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos;comparator;cross-correlation;distortion;effective number of bits;electromyography;electrooculography;full scale;logic gate;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spurious-free dynamic range;successive approximation adc	Tzu-Yun Wang;Hao-Yu Li;Zong-Yu Ma;Yang-Jing Huang;Sheng-Yu Peng	2018	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2018.2819164	electronic engineering;control theory;comparator;effective number of bits;computer science;sampling (signal processing);successive approximation adc;spurious-free dynamic range;quantization (signal processing);logic gate;cmos	Arch	57.91252333870157	50.571725305136354	31467

For line of sight tracking in optical wireless communications, a switching matrix is employed between the pixel/photodetector array and the transimpedance (TIA) amplifier. An optimization procedure is introduced to balance various performance parameters in the optical receiver front end when including the effect of the switch. The presented optical receiver consists of a low noise, wideband TIA, where noise and stability are optimized using a series inductor at the input. The TIA is followed by a limiter with offset cancellation and 50 Ω output buffer capable of 900 mV p-p differential output swing, over the 50 Ω resistance of the BERTScope. The receiver implemented in the IBM 130 nm CMOS technology, achieves a bit error rate of 10-12 at 5-Gb/s corresponding to 2.8 μA current at the input and at 4-Gb/s corresponding to 2.1 μA input current, in presence of 1 pF input capacitance representing the photodiode. The total power consumption including the on chip 50 Ω differential output buffer is 68 mW from 1.5 V DC supply.

The thin-panel model is a one-dimensional (1-D) one based on analytical expansions of cotangent and cosecant functions that are used to describe the admittance matrix in the frequency domain; these are then converted into the time domain by using digital filter theory and an inverse Z transform. The model, which is extended to allow for material anisotropy, is executed within 1-D TLM codes. And, for the first time, the two-dimensional (2-D) thin-surface model is embedded in unstructured three-dimensional (3-D) TLM codes. The approach is validated by using it to study some canonical structures with analytic solutions, and against results taken from the literature. It is then used to investigate shielding effectiveness of CFC materials in a practical curved aerospace-related structure.	code;digital filter;embedded system;filter design;transmission line	Xuesong Meng;Ana Vukovic;Trevor M.

The main hurdle while introducing body-bias dependence in gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances is maintaining reciprocity for all capacitances. We propose a subcircuit approach to help maintain reciprocity while including body-bias dependence in overlap charges. The approach is generic, and works for any device. The model has been implemented in BSIM6 industry standard model and has been validated with TCAD simulations as well as experimental measurements.	and gate;sfiaplus;simulation;technical standard;traffic collision avoidance system	Avirup Dasgupta;Chetan Gupta;Anupam Dutta;Yen-Kai Lin;Srikanth Srihari;Ethirajan Tamilmani;Chenming Calvin Hu;Yogesh Singh Chauhan	2017	2017 30th International Conference on VLSI Design and 2017 16th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID)	10.1109/VLSID.2017.19	control engineering;data modeling;electronic engineering;semiconductor device modeling;hybrid-pi model;logic gate;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;capacitance	EDA	70.22865705928456	46.63126993555826	31750

The method corrects both linear and nonlinear errors. The procedure converges in a few ms and requires minimal hardware without the need of high-capacity ROM or RAM. The calibration procedure is tested on a 0.6 mum CMOS pipeline ADC, which suffered from a high degree of nonlinear errors. The calibration gives improvements of 18dB and 28dB for SNR and SFDR, respectively, at the sampling rate of 50MSample/s. The calibrated ADC achieves SNR of 70.9dB and SFDR of 82.0dB at 50MSample/s, which results in a resolution of about 12 bits	12-bit;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;digital data;interrupt;nonlinear system;random-access memory;read-only memory;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;spurious-free dynamic range	Jie Yuan;Nabil H.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are still likely to be more of a far-term reality because of their high manufacturing cost. A hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion (IC) engine has the potential of becoming a low-emission low-cost practical solution in the near future. This paper describes a standard sport utility vehicle (SUV) that has been converted into a hydrogen-powered HEV. The powertrain utilizes compressed gaseous hydrogen as fuel, a boosted hydrogen IC engine, an induction motor, a hydraulic transmission, regenerative braking, advanced nickel-metal hybrid batteries, and a real-time control system. Tests show that the vehicle can deliver higher fuel economy and much lower emissions than those of a traditional SUV without compromises in performance.

The simulation of the electrical power systems is one of the methods that is used for the determination of the short-circuit currents. In this paper, the model of the electrical power system has been represented by a system of differential equations for current determination. These differential equations have been expressed in Cartesian system of coordinates that decreased the number of the equations by one-third. This paper compares two approaches of short-circuit simulation in electrical power systems and evaluates the error in the calculated short-circuit current during both transient and steady-state conditions. These approaches are as follows: first, the replacement of the load parameters by zero and second, the introduction of fault simulation switch. A fault has been simulated in a study electrical power system and the factors on which the error depends have been determined. In this paper, the envelope of the short-circuit current has been considered as a comparative criterion. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	ibm power systems;short circuit;simulation	Saleh A.

d2369b328ff128044dfbb4926589e3b1fb06e969	a transient-enhanced constant on-time buck converter with light-load efficiency optimization		Two key challenges in designing regulators of handheld devices are load transient time and light-load efficiency. A constant on-time (COT) buck converter is often adopted because it facilitates a fast response with reasonable light-load efficiency. For further improvement, two techniques are proposed in this work. One is the transient-enhanced technique which can reduce the settling time and minimize the voltage dips. The other one is the self-tuning technique to improve the light- load efficiency, termed as the near-optimal reverse current calibration (NORCC). The proposed COT buck converter is realized in 0.18-μm CMOS. Measurement results demonstrate settling time and undershoot voltage of 960 ns and 50 mV, respectively, during the load changes from 100 mA to 1.5 A. The efficiency is better than 79% from 10 mA to 1.7 A; the peak value is 93.6% at 300 mA load current.

Due to lack of standards and various requirements, the battery systems have to be specifically designed for each application. This need for a specific design also affects the battery monitoring circuit. In order to reduce design effort, distributed battery monitoring systems integrated into the cells were proposed. Economies of scale allow these circuits to be produced at low cost per unit as they will be needed in every single battery cell. One of the major challenges of the distributed battery monitoring concept is the communication link for the monitoring circuits: it has to be robust, reliable, and easy to install. As a possible solution, a capacitively coupled data transmission link for a battery system consisting of up to 100 smart battery cells is investigated by simulation and experiment. Relevant influence factors of the physical implementation on a capacitive voltage divider determining the transmitted data signal are identified and evaluated, considering application specific constraints. As a result, a suitable signal conditioning circuit using frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation is proposed and experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation of the proposed circuit are presented.	constraint (mathematics);contactless smart card;download;key (cryptography);modulation;prototype;requirement;robustness (computer science);simulation;smart battery;tire-pressure monitoring system;voltage divider	M.

The structure of the network itself is not changed. The transformation of the network leads to the introdnctiori of new voltages and currents that inherently carry the information of the transformed space. The discretization of the network is only possible if the reactive elements involved are defined with a constant direction. The transformation achieves this aim, permitting the network to be discretized.	discretization	Michael Fries	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389941	mathematical optimization;multidimensional systems;network analysis;computer science;coordinate system;control theory;mathematics	DB	67.00673938782566	47.34173718417101	32045

A frequency response sensitivity function is developed, and applied to the problem of identifying a coupled rotor-fuselage helicopter model from simulated frequency sweep data. This function indicates how sensitive the frequency response of the model is, at every frequency of interest, to perturbations of the model parameters. This information can be used to tailor the identification process by indicating what frequency bands and what inputs are best suited for the identification of a given paramete& The paper also presents expressions for an efficient calculation of the derivatives of this sensitivity function. This enables faster implementations of the frequency response matching problem and of the calculation of accuracy metrics. The sensitivity functions are used to partition an identification problem that covers a very wide frequency band into two identifications over smaller frequency bands. Such frequency-banded identification appears possible, fasteJ; and slightly more accurate for the case studied in the paper. A possible application of this technique is the identification of a coupled rotor-fuselage system from separate low frequency Dight tests and higher frequency, rotor wind tunnel tests. The results indicate that the use of the frequency response sensitivity function can help automate some decisions typically left to the analyst's judgment.	frequency band;frequency response;perturbation theory;r.o.t.o.r.;radio-frequency sweep;state space;system identification	Christopher Tyler Jones;Roberto Celi	2000	IBM Journal of Research and Development	10.1147/rd.445.0748	control engineering;frequency response;electronic engineering;system identification;computer science;engineering;control theory;frequency domain	Metrics	72.70044023720726	46.30886240394233	32186

First, memristive devices are employed in discrete realizations of tunable active filter topologies. Using an external programming circuit to set the devices to a desired memristive state enables control of the filter's characteristics, namely passband boundaries and quality factor. Utilization of a memristor as a tunable load in low-pass and band-pass filter topologies is then experimentally demonstrated. We further expand this concept by demonstrating an amplitude-controlled gain amplifier topology. In this topology, instead of using external control circuitry to set the memristive state, the state is set internally during operation, providing an automatic gain control.	active filter;amplifier;automatic gain control;electronic circuit;electronic filter topology;experiment;low-pass filter;memristor	Reut Wizenberg;Ali Khiat;Radu Berdan;Christos Papavassiliou;Themistoklis Prodromakis	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865623	control engineering;electronic engineering;memristor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;q factor	Embedded	65.52435274760317	48.55482191935169	32211

The interest in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), powered by environment energy harvesters, has been increasing over the last decade, especially those using thermal energy harvesting. In this paper, a low temperature thermal energy harvesting system, which can harvest heat energy from a temperature gradient and convert it into electrical energy, which can be used to power wireless electronics, is proposed. A prototype based on three subsystems is presented to extract heat energy from a radiator and use it to power ZigBee electronics. High efficiency and a long system lifetime are two of the main advantages of this design. The experimental results show that a maximum of 150mW power can be harvested by the prototype and the system can continue to operate normally when the harvesting voltage is as low as 0.45V. Theoretical calculations suggest that by placing the two AA batteries by proposed thermal energy harvesting system, a ZigBee Wireless Radiator Valve can operate for more than eight years.	gradient;power electronics;prototype;sensor	Xin Lu;Shuang-Hua Yang	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641673	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science	Mobile	58.006521868328086	44.06468816618428	32423

b8d231b52b55f2871c97101fa57782351613d2e1	the characteristics of ssti between practical mmc-based vsc-hvdc and an adjacent turbogenerator	subsynchronous torsional interaction ssti;modular multilevel converter mmc;transient simulation;excitation signal injection test	With the development of voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC), the potential risk of subsynchronous torsional interaction (SSTI) with VSC-HVDC have been studied in previous work. Contradictory results have been reported by different researchers as to the hazard of SSTI between VSC-HVDC and turbine generators. Unlike previous studies, wherein the oversimplified model of VSC is applied, the detailed model of a practical modular multilevel converter (MMC) based VSC-HVDC is adopted to analyze the characteristics of SSTI in this paper. Moreover, a new approach named excitation signal injection test is proposed to identify some important factors that influence the damping of torsional modes, such as the system operating condition and control strategies of converters. The differences between the results obtained with detailed and equivalent models of MMC are also examined.	angularjs;control theory;electronic circuit;memory management controller;nonlinear system;r.o.t.o.r.;rectifier;shadow copy;simulation;voltage source	Dawei Sun;Xiaorong Xie;Meng Ye;Ke Wang	2016	2016 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2016.7781223	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	67.7904944196226	37.3403504881976	32476

The sample-and-hold effect, or quasi-digital (discrete) behavior in the current loop with constant-frequency PCM in PWM dc-dc converters is described in a manner consistent with the physical behavior of the circuit. Using control theory, a transfer function from the error voltage to the duty cycle that captures the quasi-digital behavior is derived. This transfer function has a pole that can be in either the left-half plane or right-half plane, and captures the sample-and-hold effect accurately, enabling the characterization of the current-loop gain and closed-current loop for PWM dc-dc converters with PCM. The theoretical and experimental response results were in excellent agreement, confirming the validity of the transfer functions derived. The closed-current loop characterization can be used for the design of a controller for the outer voltage loop.	control theory;current loop;duty cycle;pulse-width modulation;sample and hold;transfer function	Brad Bryant;Marian K.

b46fe9651bc881155a0d0d1aa890400d1cf3cb52	performance of magnetic induction communication systems using induction factors	near field communications;magneto inductive communications;system topology	Inductive communication is an emerging physical layer technology for secure communications which has promise to provide significant incentives in body area networks and other short range communication systems. This paper presents the principles and performance of inductive communication systems from the points of view of the efficiencies of the transmitter and receiver topologies. The rapid reduction of power level with distance to power six means that inductive systems should be designed for efficient flux coupling to the receiver. This therefore needs to be quantified. This paper proposes a performance measure using both the trans-impedance and a new factor called the induction factor which describes the magnitude of induced power caused by a transmitter at the receiver. The effects of system parameters on performance are modeled, simulated and discussed. Four system topologies are identified and their performances in terms of the influences of the system components are investigated. Different topologies result to different induced voltages in the receiver. We demonstrate that at frequencies below 1.4 MHz, the performance of the series–series and series–parallel topologies are almost identical. We also show by the induction factor concept that the series–parallel (transmitter–receiver) topology provides more induced voltage to the receiver at high frequencies above 1.4 MHz. This is demonstrated for frequencies up to 4.5 MHz. Many applications use frequencies above 1 MHz, making these results highly essential for inductive system design and development.	characteristic impedance;coefficient;flux qubit;interference (communication);loose coupling;mathematical induction;network topology;performance;secure communication;series and parallel circuits;source-to-source compiler;systems design;transmitter	Johnson I.

Hot carriers (HCs), found in the CMOS-based synchronization circuits, are high-mobility charge carriers that affect the MOSFETs' stability by increasing the required operating threshold voltages. The HC effect manifests itself as the phase noise, which increases with the continued MOSFET operation and results in the performance degradation of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) built on the MOSFETs. The MOSFET instability impacts on the OFDM system performance, by inducing intercarrier interference (ICI) and common phase error (CPE) on the subcarriers. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of ICI self-cancellation coding on the phase noise induced by the hot-carrier effect in OFDM systems.	cmos;catastrophic interference;constant phase element;elegant degradation;ici (programming language);instability;interference (communication);phase noise;subcarrier;voltage-controlled oscillator	Sameer R.

The verification of the measuring system has been performed by two experimental methods, one directly measuring the scale factor and one using measurements over the frequency and voltage range of the components of the measuring system. The frequency dependence of the measuring system proved to be one of the dominating uncertainties and was extensively researched. Proper correction for known errors and estimation of uncertainty contributions proved that traceable measurement of VLF voltage can be made with an uncertainty of less than 0.038% up to a voltage of 200 kV.

The purpose of the paper is to provide a holography receiver that can measure the diurnal and the seasonal antenna deformation. Key features of the holography receiver are an athermal endoskeleton structure, an external photonic local oscillator, a reduced number of high-frequency analog parts, and the introduction of a highly digitized processing system. The measured root mean square surface error is better than 4.4 μm, the repeatability is better than 2 μm, and the accuracy comparison result with the mechanical panel adjuster (screw mechanism) is better than 2.4 μm. We measured the daytime antenna deformation. The result of the daytime antenna deformation measurement we conducted shows that the surface panel inside the deformation is about 3 μm during the daytime.	holography;local oscillator;mean squared error;repeatability;smart antenna	Hitoshi Kiuchi;Masumi Yamada;Masahiro Sugimoto;Hiro Saito;Takayuki Matsui;Masao Saito	2013	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2013.2259731	electronic engineering;telecommunications;antenna measurement;antenna;optics;holography;dipole antenna;physics	Visualization	68.51498431489425	58.4528157296081	32739

DC/DC power conversion solutions are becoming more popular for fulfilling the growing challenges in the high-voltage (HV) dc-connected offshore wind power industry. This paper presents several multilevel modular dc/dc conversion systems based on the capacitor-clamped (CC) module concept for high-power offshore wind energy applications. Two types of the CC modules, namely, the double-switch (DS) module and the switchless (SL) module, are discussed. A soft-switching technique is adopted to achieve minimal switching losses and the maximum system efficiency. Theoretical analysis is carried out for the 2n+1-level cascaded configurations based on the CC modules. The inherent interleaving property of the proposed configurations effectively reduces the output voltage ripple without adding extra components. A cascaded hybrid topology is developed by the combination of DS and SL modules. The proposed hybrid topology achieves higher efficiency and lower component count. The cascaded hybrid approach is evaluated in terms of the power device count, reliability, and efficiency against other HV dc/dc topologies to demonstrate its advantage for HVDC-connected offshore wind farms. The experimental results of two 5-kW prototype CC converters are presented to validate the theoretical analysis and principles as well as attest the feasibility of the proposed topologies.	cc system;electric power conversion;forward error correction;multiple encryption;network topology;polymer capacitor;power semiconductor device;prototype;ripple effect;sl (complexity);voltage multiplier	Amir Parastar;Yong Cheol Kang;Jul-Ki Seok	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2363818	wind power;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;power optimizer	EDA	63.55892560067028	41.6651237107989	33106

These filters usually reach a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) without using tightly matched passive components but may become unstable because of common-mode signals. Previously proposed techniques to solve these problems, based on resistor or capacitor T-networks, reduce the CMRR. The two techniques proposed overcome this tradeoff. The first technique improves the stability of the filter common-mode gain by adding damping resistors that do not modify the desired differential frequency response or the CMRR. The second technique, which is particularly valuable when a path for input bias currents must be provided, uses a resistor network to estimate the common-mode voltage of the input and uses it as common ground voltage for the filter.	control theory;damping factor;frequency response;game developers conference;game design document;low-pass filter;network analysis (electrical circuits);operational amplifier;rejection sampling;sinc function;single-ended signaling	Marco Massarotto;Oscar Casas;Vittorio Ferrari;Ramon Pallàs-Areny	2007	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2007.904572	common-mode rejection ratio;control engineering;frequency response;electronic engineering;common-mode signal;stability;telecommunications;engineering;control theory;mathematics;analogue filter;statistics	Visualization	64.49434856948129	49.85182430172987	33125

DDPS is a new technique for frequency synthesis that takes advantage of the speed and low jitter of a delay-locked-loop-based frequency multipliers and the ability to digitally control the frequency from the direct digital synthesis technique DDS according to Calbaza and Savaria (2000) and Calbaza and Savaria (2002). The most important source of spurious noise frequencies in a DDPS circuit is the truncation of the output of its phase accumulator. Computing spectral analysis of DDPS circuit is a CPU time consuming task. Based on series of analytic calculations, a general and simple mathematical formula of the location of spurious frequencies and their magnitudes is predicted. This formula will help designers analyze and develop new DDPS circuits faster.	accumulator (computing);central processing unit;delay-locked loop;direct digital synthesizer;frequency synthesizer;glossary of computer graphics;numerically controlled oscillator;tree accumulation;truncation	Badre Izouggaghen;Abdelhakim Khouas;Yvon Savaria	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

8be546f53ffa0702d1e3a1eb8c6e33afa81b8b20	low speed position estimation scheme for model predictive control with finite control set		This paper presents the low speed position estimation scheme for an IPM machine controlled by model predictive control with finite control set. The career signal injection is not viable as there is no PWM to superimpose it with PWM for this type of control. The pulse vector injection technique requires current derivative sensors which makes the overall scheme less attractive. This paper utilizes the inherent high frequency vector injection of the model predictive control to extract the position information. It is shown that the high frequency current response is amplitude modulated with respect to the position. A demodulation technique based on the reactive power estimation is proposed. The simulation results at various initial positions confirm the validity of the proposed position estimation scheme.	pulse-width modulation;scheme;sensor;simulation	Shamsuddeen Nalakath;Matthias Preindl;Babak Nahid-Mobarakeh;Ali Emadi	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793482	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.32813325034071	39.856989838662614	33577
a4bb8c15e2db3ad5ef2b0180a1b4bfa9c51fcd6e	instant instrument anywhere: a self-contained capacitive synthesizer		The Instant Instrument Anywhere (IIA) is a small device which can be attached to any metal object to create an electronic instrument. The device uses capacitive sensing to detect proximity of the player’s body to the metal object, and sound is generated through a surface transducer which can be attached to any flat surface. Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant Instruments Anywhere, including using smartphone as the synthesis engine and power supply.	baseline (configuration management);capacitive sensing;power supply;smartphone;thresholding (image processing);transducer	David Gerhard;Brett Park	2012			electronic engineering	HCI	55.964383030504465	48.36963012134139	33610

The HDGS is accompanied with photovoltaic (PV) array, fuel cell stacks and a battery to supply a fixed power for driving a BLDC motor. The HDGS employs a novel multi-input DC boost converter for utilizing DG sources in a unified structure. In this structure each switching cycle of proposed boost converter is divided into five switching periods that introduce five different duty ratios. Utilizing these duty ratios result in regulating the PV/FC/Battery powers. Hence, a fixed electrical power for the BLDC motor is achieved. Due to fixed power capability of the system in different environmental conditions, the BLDC motor will be able to run at its nominal power, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used to regulate the PID parameter of speed controller in order to realize better dynamic response. Reducing the torque ripple and improving current control capability of BLDC motor, hysteresis current control with current shaping is applied. The proposed system is suitable in remote areas for applications such as cooling fan, agricultural water pumping systems and related home applications.	boost converter;computer cooling;control system;discontinuous galerkin method;electronic speed control;hybrid system;hysteresis;mathematical optimization;network switch;noise shaping;nominal power (radio broadcasting);page view;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;power management;process identifier;pumping (computer systems);ripple effect;simulation	Mohammad Reza Feyzi;S.

However, the lack of an inexpensive, low-power, underwater acoustic modem is preventing the proliferation of these sensor networks. Thus, we are building an underwater acoustic modem that considers cost and power at every level, from the analog electronics, to the modulation scheme, to the hardware platform. In this paper, we use reconfigurable devices to explore the design space of our modulation scheme – Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) – to select an implementation that provides the lowest power and area without sacrificing reliability. Specifically, we explore the bit error rate, power and area tradeoffs of coherent and non-coherent FSK in response to varying baud rate, signal to noise ratio (SNR), synchronization errors, and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices. We determine that although coherent FSK provides better bit error rate in the general case, non-coherent FSK shows similar bit error rate under high SNR and low baud rate parameters and saves nearly 4 times the hardware area over the coherent scheme on the same FPGA devices.	acoustic cryptanalysis;analogue electronics;bit error rate;coherence (physics);field-programmable gate array;low-power broadcasting;modem;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio	Ying Li;Bridget Benson;Ryan Kastner;Xing Zhang	2009			embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;bit	Mobile	55.479459265121854	59.93518092591566	33812

The polyphase filterbank possesses advantages over architectures based on separate matched and interpolation filters. Interpolations are realized by filterbank index selection and a separate interpolating filter following the matched filter is not required. Maximum likelihood timing synchronization techniques can be easily incorporated into the polyphase filter bank in a natural way. An -stage polyphase filterbank with input data sampled at approximately samples/symbol can be used in a loop that operates at samples/symbol, samples/symbol, or 1 sample/symbol. When operating at 1 sample/symbol, auxiliary control must also be included to adjust the clocking of data into the filter bank to account for small differences in the sample clock and times the data clock. Examples are presented to illustrate loop performance and control.	clock rate;digital filter;filter bank;interpolation;matched filter;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter	Fredric J.

Its application to single fault simulation in linear and nonlinear circuits is reported. The efficient fault simulation in nonlinear DC circuits is due both to the development,of original linearized Newton-Raphson models for electronic devices and to the simulation of fault values in a “continuation” stream. Fault simulation in linear cascades with up to 5000 nodes has shown an improvement of four orders of magnitude in simulation time, when compared to that of the nominal circuit. In nonlinear circuits, the time efficienc y is sometimes better than two orders of magnitude.

First, we applied our proposed model of the response to an external injection in oscillators to the liner model of the PLL. It was found that the self-injection that injects an appropriately delayed oscillator output into its own oscillator could reduce the current fluctuation caused by operation of the fractional-N PLL. We designed and fabricated a testchip to verify our analysis in a 0.18-pm CMOS process. We examined the effect of the self-injection by applying the injection to a simple fractional-N PLL while adjusting the timing and the strength of the injection. According to the measurement results, the level of the fractional spur can be reduced by 1.5 dB. This result indicates effective control of the PLL loop bandwidth by self-injection.	cmos;linear model;modulation;noise reduction;norm (social);phase-locked loop;quantum fluctuation;zero suppression	Mayu Kobayashi;Yuya Masui;Takao Kihara;Tsutomu Yoshimura	2017	2017 24th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2017.8292107	phase noise;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;computer science;noise reduction;oscillation;cmos;bandwidth (signal processing)	EDA	62.78918267347196	48.792945973301556	34009

For many structures, including ultrawideband or dielectric resonator antennas, EM-simulation-driven optimization is the only way to adjust the geometry parameters so that given performance specifications are satisfied. On the other hand, accurate full-wave antenna simulation is computationally expensive so that employing the EM solver directly in the optimization loop may be impractical. In this paper, several computationally efficient simulation-driven antenna design techniques are discussed. All of the methods exploit coarse-discretization EM models of the structures under consideration. After suitable correction, these models serve as reliable prediction tools that guide the optimization process. As the coarse-discretization model is computationally much cheaper than the original, high-fidelity antenna model, the cost of the design process is greatly reduced. The specific approaches presented here include multi-fidelity optimization, adaptive design specifications and space mapping with kriging-based coarse models.

The proposed circuit offers not only a quite good linearity of DC transfer characteristic but, first of all, a relatively low value of its output resistance. This enables a voltage mode operation even if our circuit is loaded by a not necessarily very high resistor. The obtained rather low value of output resistance in our circuit is due to adding to the transresistor-input-stage a simple rail-to-rail voltage follower. To the author's knowledge, the proposed solution is original and not published yet in the literature. Input stage of the transresistor is built of only 4 MOS transistors and creates a simple quasi-linear current-to-voltage convertor. Output stage of it is built of 9 MOS transistors, plays a role of a very precise and simple rail-to-rail CMOS-pair-based non-standard voltage follower. In respect of simplicity and headroom, our follower is better than conventional OA-based voltage followers. Preliminary simulation results are in a good agreement with the theory presented.	analog signal processing;buffer amplifier;cmos;headroom (audio signal processing);output impedance;simulation;transfer function;transimpedance amplifier;transistor;voltage converter	Ryszard Wojtyna	2016	2016 MIXDES - 23rd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/MIXDES.2016.7529775	mesh analysis;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;input offset voltage;voltage droop;engineering;78xx;electrical engineering;voltage divider;control theory;low-dropout regulator;dropout voltage;voltage source;overdrive voltage;voltage regulation	EDA	62.40499164937671	48.47986186519217	34359

For examples with moderate number of harmonics and moderate to strong nonlinearities, we demonstrate that the direct solver has far superior performance with a moderate increase in memory compared to the best preconditioned iterative solvers. This solver is especially suited for Fourier envelope analysis where the number of harmonics is small, circuits are nonlinear and Jacobian bypass can be used for additional speed. For examples with large number of harmonics and moderate to strong nonlinearities, the performance advantage is maintained but the memory requirements increase. We propose efficient preconditioners based on direct solution of harmonic balance matrices which provide the user with a memory-speed trade-off.	harmonic balance;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;nonlinear system;preconditioner;requirement;solver	Amit Mehrotra;Abhishek Somani	2009	2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference	10.1145/1629911.1630010	harmonic balance;control engineering;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;sparse matrix;electronic design automation;computer science;central processing unit;harmonic analysis;mathematics;preconditioner;iterative method;fourier analysis;radio frequency;frequency domain;robustness	EDA	72.53880784792076	43.80333163419915	34384

The chip, which was fabricated in a 0.6-um BiCMOS process, contains 100 amplifiers, control logic, and circuits for wireless power and transmission of data. ECoG signals, sensed by electrodes, are capacitively coupled to the amplifiers. Each amplifier has a gain of 59.2 dB, a maximum bandwidth of 240 Hz, an input referred noise of 2.8µV, and consumes 4.5µW of power. The output of each amplifier is connected to a 10-bit ADC via an adaptive-bias buffer and transmission gate whose transparency is set by the control logic. The control logic time-shares the ADC by multiplexing through one of five preset patterns of 32 on-chip signals. The digitized waveforms are then broadcasted wirelessly using a 900 MHz FSK transmitter. The entire chip consumes 7.2 mW of power during operation.	amplifier;bicmos;decibel;electrocorticography;integrated circuit;ion implantation;multiplexing;transmission gate;transmitter	Grant S.

The sensitivity of the output current to supply voltage fluctuation is achieved by operating the system in a rail-to-rail swing mode. A high speed is achieved from current-domain multiplexing and the inductive shunt peaking with active inductors. The fully differential configuration of the transmitter minimizes the effect of both common-mode disturbances and electro-magnetic interference exerted from the channels to neighboring devices. The full push-pull operation of the driver minimizes the static power consumption of the transmitter. The proposed transmitter is implemented in a 1.2V 0.13μm CMOS technology and analyzed using Spectre from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM3v3 device models. Simulation results demonstrate that the transmitter conveys a sufficiently large differential output current that is insensitive to supply voltage fluctuation at 10 Gb/s.	amplifier;bandwidth extension;cmos;data rate units;gigabyte;interference (communication);multiplexing;push–pull output;quantum fluctuation;serial communication;signal processing;simulation;solid-state drive;swing (java);transmitter	Minghai Li;Fei Yuan	2006		10.1145/1127908.1127925	electromagnetic interference;electronic engineering;common-mode signal;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;transmitter power output	Mobile	60.28611226230463	52.62995008790567	34856
21ba7a45d259e8d1f393febdff095411d908cda5	a low power read-out circuit with frequency accuracy of 0.2% for capacitive and resistive sensors		This paper presents a read-out circuit for capacitive and resistive sensors with large scale which converts capacitance or resistance to frequency. It utilizes a high precision and high speed comparator to control the oscillation. A method using correlated double sampling (CDS) technique in continuous-time comparator is proposed to attenuate the DC offset and low frequency flicker noise. A calibration circuit was adopted for the on-chip resistance used for capacitive sensors to achieve small variation caused by temperature. This design is based on 0.18μm CMOS process. The circuit works well when capacitance values are in the range from 10 pF to 100 pF and resistance values are in the range from 20 KΩ to 150 KΩ. Simulation results show that the variation of oscillation frequency is only 0.2% from −40 □ to 80Ό, and the minimum capacitance and resistance could be detected is 20 fF and 40 Ω respectively. The power consumption of the read-out circuit is about 40.4 μW, which could be easily integrated in a UHF RFID tag.	cmos;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;capacitive sensing;comparator;flicker noise;resistive touchscreen;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;ultra high frequency	Qi Peng;Kun Wang;Xuelian Liu;Weifeng Liu;Xiaoming Li;Yiqi Zhuang	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050473	flicker noise;control theory;capacitive sensing;resistor;electronic engineering;comparator;computer science;correlated double sampling;cmos;dc bias;capacitance	EDA	59.17407466870093	47.42245059758303	35007

A burst mode super-regenerative UWB transceiver which can recover the received signal to rail-to-rail with relatively fewer post-amplification stages is proposed. Unlike other super-regenerative receiver architectures that use oscillator, the proposed architecture employs a positive feedback loop to achieve the super-regeneration of received signal and thus eliminates the need for external resonator or quench signal. The transceiver is suitable for low data rate sensor networks application covering spectrum of 3-5 GHz. Manufactured in CMOS 0.18-μm technology, the transceiver occupies an area of 2.2 mm × 2 mm. By exploiting the duty cycle and the transceiver on-time through the burst mode operation for a given data rate of 1 Mbps, it can achieve transmitter energy efficiency of 0.671 nJ/bit and receiver energy efficiency of 3.54 nJ/bit.	burst mode (computing);cmos;coherence (physics);data rate units;duty cycle;electronic circuit;elegant degradation;low-noise amplifier;positive feedback;radio frequency;regenerative circuit;signal-to-noise ratio;thyristor;transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Yuanjin Zheng;Yao Zhu;Chyuen-Wei Ang;Yuan Gao;Chun Huat Heng	2014	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2014.2332244	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics	EDA	59.64186964107416	54.39553014663422	35094

f49ab7b32629da2a5001ba41831c71e349ea330c	open-circuit behavior analysis for indirect matrix converter		Indirect matrix converter (IMC) has attractive advantages such as lack of dc-link electrolytic capacitor, bidirectional power flow and high power density. Aiming at faulty condition, this paper presents an analysis work for indirect matrix converter (IMC), which could make contribution to detecting the failure accurately. First, some possible types of open-circuit fault are introduced and the current freewheeling path analysis is presented. Then, combining with space vector modulation (SVM) strategy, the feature of dc-link voltage is analyzed after the occurrence of an open-circuit fault. This analysis result demonstrates that the failure in IMC can be discriminated effectively by measuring dc-link voltage. Experimental results are presented to verify the proposed analytical work.

With the rising demand for solar energy installation, there is a pressing need for utilities to regulate the voltages at low voltage distribution grids. We present a linear model for voltage rise versus PV output power. The voltage rise versus injected power is modeled as a linear combination of gamma random variables. This is achieved by finding sparse bases and clustering the data into subsets based on correlation with those bases. Then fitting a gamma distribution within each subset. We are interested in modeling the voltage rise without ignoring the sparse events in the voltage. We use sparse SVD with ℓ1 penalty to model sparse voltage rises.	big data;cluster analysis;control theory;gamma correction;linear model;portable c compiler;quantum fluctuation;radial (radio);singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;voltage regulator	Ashkan Zeinalzadeh;Reza Ghorbani;James Yee	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526151	control engineering;mesh analysis;random variable;stochastic process;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics;open-circuit voltage;ac power;voltage controller;low-dropout regulator;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;voltage source;voltage optimisation;pre-charge;statistics;voltage regulation	HPC	63.88836972070982	37.9110185951381	35217
61dcc2dc30bddc5a8d91e96be530f5f0888a65e6	an approach to unified full-order modeling of dual active bridge type converters		Modeling of dual active bridge (DAB)type converters, and that of its single-phase form, is an active area of research. In this paper, a new modeling approach is proposed. It is theorised that single-phase DAB converter operating in any of its multiple modes and modulation may be modeled as four dual active half-bridge (DAHB)circuits operating in simple phase-shift modulation. It allows extension of the model developed for simple phase-shift modulated DAHB converter to any operating mode of the DAB converter. In this respect, the physical basis of the theory is first explained. Subsequently, the improved first harmonic approximation (I-FHA)model of the DAHB converter, developed a priori, is extended to the general operating case of the DAB converter. Finally, the model is validated through extensive simulation and hardware experiments proving the theoretical basis of the proposed approach.

The technique is based on 1-bit signal acquisition with a standard digital channel of an Automated Test Equipment (ATE) and a dedicated post-processing algorithm that permits to reconstruct the time-domain phase fluctuations of the analog/RF signal from the captured binary vector. Single SideBand (SSB) phase noise is then obtained based on FFT applied on the reconstructed phase fluctuations. Simulation results demonstrate a very good agreement between SSB phase noise obtained using the proposed digital method and the conventional analog method on a large range of measurement frequency offset. The digital method also permits spur detection and exhibits similar performance than the conventional method in terms of measurement variability. The technique is also validated through hardware measurements on a practical case study, i.e. SSB phase noise evaluation on the 1.3125 MHz sinusoidal signal delivered by the transceiver of a JN5168 wireless microcontroller.	phase noise;super smash bros.

b4e526106560d0e503efba3b9af01615590ec7f0	a dual-mode flow measurement system for large sensing range with high accuracy		This paper presents a smart system for large flow range measurement, consisting of a dual-mode MEMS flow sensor and the readout IC. During high flow rate (> 25 m/s), the output of the dual-mode sensor is directly digitized by a switched-capacitor incremental delta-sigma ADC with 12-bits resolution due to its large output amplitude. While in low flow rate, the sensor output is first amplified by a capacitively-coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) before digitization. A comparator is employed to enable a dynamic switching between two operation modes based on the flow rate. The readout IC can handle a large input up to 800 mV and consumes a current as low as 114 μA. The simulation results show the measurement system achieves a maximum sensing flow rate of 73 m/s while contributes a maximum measurement error rate of 300 ppm which is considerably lower than the industry standard of 3%.	comparator;delta-sigma modulation;instrumentation amplifier;microelectromechanical systems;simulation;smart system;switched capacitor;system of measurement;technical standard;the industry standard	Mingzheng Duan;Wei Xu;Xiaopeng Zhong;Moaaz Ahmed;Yi-Kuen Lee;Amine Bermak	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351324	observational error;comparator;amplitude;control theory;electronic engineering;flow measurement;integrated circuit;instrumentation amplifier;digitization;computer science;volumetric flow rate	Arch	58.92559357387467	48.037109614941365	35579

Generally, the standard field method is widely employed in loop antenna calibration at many national metrology institutes and calibration laboratories. In this method, a thermocouple is employed as a current sensor on an antenna element of a transmitting loop antenna to calculate the magnetic field strength at an antenna under calibration. This method has certain disadvantages: The standard transmitting antenna is complicated, cumbersome, and fragile. On the other hand, a calibration method is necessary to be reasonably traceable to the standard of the magnetic antenna factor. Our proposed methods can establish and keep traceability to it. We also compare the two proposed RCMs and show that they are efficient in calibrating the loop antennas.	frequency band;traceability;transmitter	Masanori Ishii;Yozo Shimada	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2010679	electronic engineering;magnetic field;antenna measurement;engineering;electrical engineering;thermocouple;physics;quantum mechanics	Visualization	68.77876700595942	58.43208095048236	35707

A key advantage of the proposed method is that it can be easily implemented using off-the-shelf components without requiring fast switching at or above the carrier frequency, which is more suitable for integrated circuit design. Moreover, the proposed technique does not need any sophisticated synchronization between the power carrier and Q-modulation switching pulses. The multicycle Q-modulation is analyzed theoretically by a lumped circuit model, and verified in simulation and measurement using an off-the-shelf prototype. Automatic resonance tuning in the Rx, combined with multicycle Q-modulation helped maximizing PTE of the inductive link dynamically in the presence of environmental and loading variations, which can otherwise significantly degrade the PTE in multicoil settings. In the prototype conventional two-coil link, the proposed method increased the power amplifier plus inductive-link efficiency from 4.8% to 16.5% at (RL = 1 kW, d23 = 3 cm), and from 23% to 28.2% at (RL = 100 Ω, d23 = 3 cm) after 11% change in the resonance capacitance, while delivering 168.1 mW to the load (PDL).	audio power amplifier;carrier frequency;characteristic impedance;coil device component;delta modulation;electric capacitance;inductive reasoning;input impedance;integrated circuit device component;integrated circuit design;lumped element model;maximum power transfer theorem;pressure-tolerant electronics;prototype;quantitative impedance;reln wt allele;relative biological effectiveness;resonance;simulation;thyristor;prescription document	Byunghun Lee;Pyungwoo Yeon;Maysam Ghovanloo	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2550009	electronic engineering;text mining;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;resistance;q factor	EDA	65.90116321046185	45.109468243957615	35742
d4fb265a95cd888cd58c107cd8af3b3ade675440	analysis of dc-link voltage ripple in voltage source inverters without electrolytic capacitor		In this paper, the DC-link voltage ripple is analyzed for an inverter without electrolytic capacitor. As the capacitance density of non-electrolytic capacitors are significantly lower than electrolytic capacitors, for a non-electrolytic capacitor based three-phase inverter, the DC-link voltage ripple is much higher than traditional inverter, which will cause more THD on load current and originates voltage stability problems when cascaded with the front-end converter. To avoid these disadvantages, the DC-link voltage ripple must be fully analyzed for a non-electrolytic DC-link capacitor three-phase inverter. This paper presents the voltage ripple analysis of the voltage source inverter under the modulation methods of SPWM and SVPWM. The results show that the DC-link voltage ripple has special patterns which relate to switching frequency, modulation ratio, output current amplitude, load power factor, and reference voltage angle. According to these analysis, the minimized DC-link capacitance can be selected to satisfy voltage ripple requirement.

Most of these micro power plants e.g. photovoltaic systems feed into the low (LV) and medium (MV) voltage level. The voltage stability in these levels is thus much more complex and is partially violated in moments of strong feed-in. To reduce this negative impact the directive VDE-AR-N 4105 was specified that PV-inverters must provide reactive power instead of pure active power. This directive should however only be the beginning. In a smart grid, the asset inverter should be used much more intensively. In this paper it is demonstrated by power flow simulations with the data of a real distribution grid including PV-system feed-in that there are more possibilities but providing the reactive power for the distribution and voltage stability. It is illustrated that the use of the complete apparent power of the inverter is a more appropriate way to obtain the stationary stability of distribution grids. With this strategy in addition, the power loss can be influenced in LV- and MV-level and the power factor of the feed-in of the HV/MV-supplying transformer can be adjusted.	analog-to-digital converter;directive (programming);inverter (logic gate);logical volume management;page view;power inverter;simulation;stationary process;transformer;virtual distributed ethernet	Arnaud Hoffmann;Marco Fleckenstein;Gerd Balzer;Thomas Hartkopf	2014	ISGT 2014	10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816478	power rating;control engineering;power module;volt-ampere reactive;power-flow study;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;base load power plant;power factor;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;switched-mode power supply;stand-alone power system;electric power system;electric power transmission;distributed generation;power engineering;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;voltage optimisation;power optimizer	HPC	63.28112898387164	37.79773808918169	35945
76484cba2baa5c39a84084c5435f078ab4f64d11	modeling and characterization of downwind tower shadow effects using a wind turbine emulator		This paper presents the modeling and characterization of the tower shadow effects using a wind turbine emulator in a laboratory environment. In particular, the downwind wind turbines are considered here as their tower shadow effects are more significant compared to the upwind counterpart. Simulation and experimental results have shown that the wind speed deficit due to this nonideal effect is significant. In addition, the tower shadow effects occur typically two to three times per revolution, depending on the number of blades. The modeling of the tower shadow profiles for tubular and four-leg tower configurations is presented. Typically, these towers are used in small wind turbine applications. The tower shadow profiles are emulated experimentally using a wind turbine emulator with its characteristics being explained. The limitations of emulating the tower shadow effects using a wind turbine emulator are demonstrated through the frequency response test performed in this study. In this study, the wind turbine emulator is connected to an isolated grid which is formed by three single-phase inverters. Finally, this paper concludes with a sensitivity analysis of the power oscillations for different widths and magnitudes of the tower shadow profile.	emulator;experiment;frequency response;inverter (logic gate);shadow copy;simulation;tower of hanoi	Leong Kit Gan;Jonathan K.

Conventional electronics are based on the charge of the electron. Attempts to use the other fundamental property of an electron, its spin, have given rise to a new, rapidly evolving field, known as spintronics, an acronym for spin transport electronics that was first introduced in 1996 to designate a program of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Initially, the spintronics program involved overseeing the development of advanced magnetic memory and sensors based on spin transport electronics. It was then expanded to included Spins IN Semiconductors (SPINS), in the hope of developing a new paradigm in semiconductor electronics based on the spin degree of freedom of the electron. Studies of spin-polarized transport in bulk and low-dimensional semiconductor structures show promise for the creation of a hybrid device that would combine magnetic storage with gain—in effect, a spin memory transistor. This paper reviews some of the major developments in this field and provides a perspective of what we think will be the future of this exciting field. It is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the whole field but reflects a bias on the part of the authors toward areas that they believe will lead to significant future technologies.	electron;magnetic storage;programming paradigm;semiconductor device;sensor;spintronics;transistor	Stuart A.

The proposed technique provides a much wider tuning range than conventional methods. It has the advantage of not relying on the value of any resistive/reactive element to achieve tunability, hence tuning ranges are no longer limited by component values realizable by technology. The technique can be extended to other applications requiring programmability of some system poles. A current-tuned LC oscillator is implemented in 0.13-mum technology to verify the technique introduced herein. The oscillator operates at 2.8 GHz, has a tuning range of 71% extendable to 98%, and a maximum power dissipation of 6 mW.	electronic oscillator;extensibility;feedback;lc circuit;linear programming relaxation;maximum power transfer theorem;microsoft windows 98;phase noise;relaxation (approximation)	Yousr M.

Although a constant phase shift can approximate a time delay in a limited frequency band, this does not hold for larger arrays that scan over wide angles and have a large instantaneous bandwidth. In this case true time delays are wanted to avoid effects such as beam-squinting. In this paper we aim at compactly integrating a delay based phased-array receiver in standard CMOS IC technology. This is for instance relevant for synthetic aperture radars, which require large instantaneous bandwidths often in excess of 1GHz, either as RF or as IF bandwidth in a superheterodyne system.

Consequently, intermodulation (IMD) and crossmodulation (XM) are generated and cause distortion in the spectrum sensing region. This paper investigates the impact on the threshold level setting of a wideband energy detection based spectrum sensing caused by a nonlinear LNA at the radio frequency (RF) front-end of a wideband cognitive radio receiver. The third and fifth order terms of the expansion of the nonlinearity characteristics are modeled using a memory-polynomial model. The main contribution of this study is the derivation of a proper threshold level for different frequency bins.		Attaphongse Taparugssanagorn;Kenta Umebayashi;Janne J. Lehtomäki;Carlos A.

5d33f6d026b94541945ef366910a7a737d4d1121	a cmos wideband current-mode digital polar power amplifier with built-in am–pm distortion self-compensation		"""This paper presents a fully integrated wideband current-mode digital polar power amplifier (DPA) in CMOS with built-in AM–PM distortion self-compensation. Feedforward capacitors are implemented in each differential cascode digital power cell. These feedforward capacitors operate together with a proposed DPA biasing scheme to minimize the DPA output device capacitance <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$C_{d}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> variations over a wide output power range and a wide carrier frequency bandwidth, resulting in DPA AM–PM distortion reduction. A three-coil transformer-based DPA output passive network is implemented within a single transformer footprint (330 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mu \text{m} \,\, \times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> 330 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\mu \text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) and provides parallel power combining and load impedance transformation with a low loss, an octave bandwidth, and a large impedance transformation ratio. Moreover, this proposed power amplifier (PA) output passive network shows a desensitized phase response to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$C_{d}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> variations and further suppresses the DPA AM–PM distortion. Both proposed AM–PM distortion self-compensation techniques are effective for a large carrier frequency range and a wide modulation bandwidth, and are independent of the DPA AM control codes. This results in a superior inherent DPA phase linearity and reduces or even eliminates the need for phase pre-distortion, which dramatically simplifies the DPA pre-distortion computations. As a proof-of-concept, a 2–4.3 GHz wideband DPA is implemented in a standard 28-nm bulk CMOS process. Operating with a low supply voltage of 1.4 V for enhanced reliability, the DPA demonstrates ±0.5 dB PA output power bandwidth from 2 to 4.3 GHz with +24.9 dBm peak output power at 3.1 GHz. The measured peak PA drain efficiency is 42.7% at 2.5 GHz and is more than 27% from 2 to 4.3 GHz. The measured PA AM–PM distortion is within 6.8° at 2.8 GHz over the PA output power dynamic range of 25 dB, achieving the lowest AM–PM distortion among recently reported current-mode DPAs in the same frequency range. Without any phase pre-distortion, modulation measurements with a 20-MHz 802.11n standard compliant signal demonstrate 2.95% rms error vector magnitude, −33.5 dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio, 15.6% PA drain efficiency, and +14.6 dBm PA average output power at 2.8 GHz."""	am broadcasting;audio power amplifier;bandwidth (signal processing);biasing;bidirectional associative memory;built-in self-test;cmos;carrier frequency;characteristic impedance;code;computation;dbm;die shrink;differential signaling;distortion;dynamic range;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;frequency band;input impedance;input/output;modulation;output device;pa-risc;power bandwidth;rlc circuit;resonance;spectral leakage;transformer	Jong Seok Park;Yanjie Wang;Stefano Pellerano;Christopher D.

However, since these FCS plugs have power ratings of up to 100 kW, they may expose the utility mains to intolerable stresses in the near future scenario where there will be a large number of public FCS spread across the network. This paper proposes an internal power balancing strategy for FCS based on flywheel energy storage system (ESS) which is able to mitigate those impacts by ramping the initial power peak. The balancing strategy was implemented in a distributed manner to grid and flywheel interfacing converters by means of distributed bus signaling (DBS) method. Since the parameters in the proposed upper hierarchical control layer affect the stability features of the system, a reduced order small-signal model has been assembled and parameters have been selected accordingly. Finally, real-time simulation results performed on a full scale model have been reported in order to verify the validity of proposed approach.	computer data storage;direct-broadcast satellite;full scale;limit cycle;limiter;linear model;nonlinear system;plug-in (computing);real-time clock;real-time computing;rechargeable battery;simulation;small-signal model	Tomislav Dragicevic;Stjepan Sucic;Juan.

The major advantage of this scheme over level-shifted and space vector modulation schemes is its inherent ability to evenly distribute losses between semiconductor devices. However, phase-shifted schemes suffer from harmonic degradation when operated at the low carrier frequencies required in high-power high-level number applications. This paper develops a model predictive modulation (MPM) scheme that achieves superior harmonic performance, compared to phase-shifted modulation, while ensuring equal semiconductor loss distribution. With respect to complete-enumeration-based predictive techniques, the proposed modulation significantly reduces the number of times the system cost function is evaluated. Reducing the number of calculations by several orders of magnitude ensures computational feasibility. Simulation and experimental results are presented, which confirm correct operation of the modulation strategy.	carrier wave;computation;elegant degradation;h bridge;heuristic;high- and low-level;loss function;material point method;modulation;multi-function printer;pulse-width modulation;sandy bridge;semiconductor device;simulation;technical standard	Christopher David Townsend;Roberto A.

It may affect domestic, industrial and commercial customers. Voltage sags may either be decreasing or increasing due to faults or change in loads. In this paper a switch mode AC to AC regulator is investigated to maintain constant voltage across the domestic appliance during the voltage deviation from the rated value. Such deviation may occur due to change in load or change in input voltage due to voltage sag of the system itself. The proposed system incorporates insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) with high frequency switching technology. The Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controls the ON/OFF time (Duty cycle) of switching devices (IGBTs) of this regulator. By regulating duty cycle of the control signal, output voltage can be maintained almost constant for wide range of input voltage variation. Simulation results show constant voltage can be achieved in either cases of increasing or decreasing input voltage as long as it is within specified limit.	constant-voltage speaker system;duty cycle;electric power quality;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;pulse-width modulation;simulation;voltage controller;voltage regulation;voltage regulator	P.

The idea of the chosen direct drive JFET concept is to switch power with a normally-on SiC JFET, using the high voltage breakdown capability of the SiC JFET and ensuring a safe normally-off behavior using a normally-off low voltage MOSFET in series. By controlling the transistor gates individually the JFET can be driven with minimum switching losses and good control. The driver makes the operation and handling of normally-on SiC JFETs as safe as normally-off switches, thereby simplifying the integration of normally-on SiC JFETs into systems like switch mode power supplies. To transfer the signal from the controller to the driver over a needed galvanic isolation of 1700 V a two chip solution with a coreless transformer arranged in one package was chosen, using a 0.6 μm BiCMOS and a 0.8 μm BCD technology. Powering of the gate driver through bootstrapping has been made possible, due to the direct drive JFET concept and the further integration of supervision and control circuitry and a negative voltage regulator that regulates the entire p-substrate of the driver chip. Tested together with the JFET in a buck converter efficiencies over 99% have been measured.	bicmos;binary-coded decimal;buck converter;electronic circuit;field effect (semiconductor);galvanic isolation;gate driver;international solid-state circuits conference;network switch;sic-povm;series and parallel circuits;switched-mode power supply;transformer;transistor;voltage regulator	Karl Norling;Christian Lindholm;Dieter Draxelmayr	2012	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2012.2225736	control engineering;mesfet;electronic engineering;logic gate;engineering;electrical engineering;gate driver	Arch	62.57921123787432	42.51761614044073	36698

The designed CASFAI behaves as an inductor in the frequency range of 0-6.9 GHz, and has reached to a maximum quality factor of 4406, inductance value of 7.56 nH, 3rd order harmonic distortion better than -30 dB for 0 dBm input power, while consumes only 2 mW power. In order to consider the performance of the proposed active inductor-based tunable output matching network on the output power level and power added efficiency (PAE) of RFPA, the CASFAI is applied as a variable inductor to the output matching network of RFPA. The overall circuit is designed and validated in ADS in a 0.18 μm CMOS process and 1.5 V supply voltage. The results indicate that by increasing the inductance value of the matching network in constant operating frequency, the PAE peak moves from high power to low power levels without any degradation. Therefore, it is possible to maintain the power efficiency at the same maximum level for lower input drive levels.

This project mainly deals with the antenna design in the context of Body Area Networks applications and channel characterization. General conclusions are drawn on the body impact on the antenna performance for on– on and in–on communications (Medical Implant Communication Systems). Narrow-band and ultra-wideband contexts are addressed both numerically and experimentally, and it is shown that design questions are significantly different for each case, leading to different constraints and guidelines. For narrow-band antennas, an alternative and original approach of desensitization using ferrite sheets is proposed and compared to classical techniques based on ground-plane screening. The characterization of numerical phantoms is also analyzed with narrow-band canonical antennas. For the specific on–on scenario, morphologies and electrical properties of the human tissues are also included in the topics of interest. For ultra-wideband antennas, focus is put on planar balanced designs, notably to reduce harmful “cable effects” occurring during the antenna characterization or the channel sounding. For both types of antennas, the main parameter under study is the distance to the body, which has a significant influence. C. Roblin (*) ENSTA Paris-Tech, 32, Bd.

A deterministic test signal-based digital background calibration is used to accurately set the cancellation gain and thus achieve accurate cancellation under different process, voltage, temperature, and operating frequency conditions. A hybrid, linear proportional control and bang-bang digital integral control, is used to obviate the need for a high-resolution time-to-digital converter and reduce jitter due to frequency quantization error. Fabricated in 0.13 m CMOS technology, the DPLL operates from a 1.0 V supply and achieves an operating range of 0.4-to-3 GHz. At 1.5 GHz, the DPLL consumes 2.65 mW power wherein the cancellation circuitry consumes about 280 W. The proposed noise cancellation scheme reduces the DPLL's peak-to-peak jitter from 330 to 50 ps in the presence of a 30 mV 10 MHz supply noise tone, and the DPLL peak-to-peak jitter is 50 ps in the absence of any supply noise. The DPLL occupies an active die area of 0.08 mm, of which the calibration logic and cancellation circuitry occupy only 12.5%.	arnold tongue;bang file;cmos;clock rate;dpll algorithm;electronic circuit;elegant degradation;image resolution;phase-locked loop;quantization (signal processing);ring oscillator;time-to-digital converter	Amr Elshazly;Rajesh Inti;Wenjing Yin;Brian Young;Pavan Kumar Hanumolu	2011	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2011.2162912	control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;computer science;engineering;control theory;oscillation	EDA	60.36925904583965	49.670242722103694	36841
3349ac7e2bb4ecb71817e6241b0cd78d82b232da	characterization of single-crystalline graphene esd interconnects		We report systematic transient characterization of single-crystalline graphene (SCG) interconnects for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection for integrated circuits (IC). Single-crystalline graphene ribbons were fabricated by CVD method with practical dimensions and characterized by transmission line pulsing (TLP) and very-fast TLP (VFTLP) measurements. Comprehensive TLP and VFTLP testing with varying pulse rise time (tr) and duration (td) was performed. Measurement statistics show improvement of ESD protection capability compared with poly-crystalline graphene (PCG) ESD interconnects. Specifically, ESD current handling density (Jt2) of SCG wires is up to ∼109 A/cm2, about three times higher than that for PCG ESD interconnects.	discharger;electrical connection;electrostatic loudspeaker;graphene;integrated circuit;rise time;task parallelism;transmission line	Qi Chen;Cheng Li;Fei Lu;Chenkun Wang;Feilong Zhang;Tianru Wu;Xiaoming Xie;Kun Zhang;Xinxin Li;Jimmy Ng;Ya-Hong Xie;Yuhua Cheng;Albert Z.

Detection of disturbances by a microgrid central controller is therefore necessary for improving the network operation. Motivated by this application, this paper presents a new structure for the centralized detection of disturbances with noisy synchrophasor data and packet delay/dropouts. We build the proposed structure starting from the analysis of noise-delay tradeoff in synchrophasor networks and developing a new phasor data concentrator for compensation of data losses. The statistical performance metrics of the disturbance detector are numerically evaluated in the case of islanding detection, corroborating that the centralized detector counteracts the measurement noise and lowers the detection time. Numerical results show that the proposed structure significantly mitigates the probability of false detection. Moreover, it can achieve the lower bound of average detection time in a wide range of packet drop rates. This paper is useful to network designers who need to employ data acquisition systems for reliable and robust microgrid control applications.	centralized computing;data acquisition;dropout (neural networks);microgrid;network packet;numerical analysis;numerical method;phasor;programme delivery control;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Younes Seyedi;Houshang Karimi;Josep M.

f9f5ba5bdc66cd6f7c152acba36c2841c1fd9310	analysis and compensation of sampling errors in tpfs ipmsm drives with single current sensor		The current reconstruction strategies using single current sensor in the motor drives are widely researched. However, the sampled currents do not represent the average values within the modulation period, especially for the asymmetric modulation or asymmetric sampling solutions. This is due to the following two reasons: 1) The detected current values obtained at different sampling points are utilized to calculate the three-phase currents; and 2) the detected instantaneous currents are applied to estimate the average current values. In this letter, the current change rates under different action vectors are estimated to compensate these errors in a three-phase four-switch interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive with single current sensor. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by experimental results on a 5-kW IPMSM motor prototype, which shows that the current reconstruction errors are reduced after compensation.

In this article, a TDC with ~40 ps measurement resolution and very large linear dynamic range is proposed for optical sensing applications. Referenced to a single 100 MHz clock, the TDC incorporates a DLL and a VDL loop to automatically stabilize the measuring resolution, thus eliminating the need for a separate calibration step before or during actual measurements. The proposed TDC is fabricated using CMOS 0.18 m technology, and its designed characteristics are validated through experiments.	cmos;dynamic range;dynamic-link library;experiment;image sensor;mumps;real-time transcription;time-to-digital converter;vhf data link	Yan Li;Hang Yu;Shaohua Liu;Xihua Huang;Lai Jiang	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700653	calibration;computer network;optical imaging;time-to-digital converter;dynamic range;time of flight;computer science;electronic engineering;cmos	Robotics	58.1114703982919	48.64994320907043	37095

A pulse width controlled oscillator accepts the PFD output where its pulse width controls the oscillation frequency. In the pulse width controlled oscillator, the input pulse width is converted into soft thermometer code through a time to soft thermometer code converter and the code controls the ring oscillator frequency. By using this scheme, our PLL realizes LPF-less as well as quantization noise free operation.

SFDR is limited by both dynamic (switching) and static (mismatch) nonlinearities. A good design needs to ensure that the spurious spectral tones caused by the static mismatches do not limit the performance. Aggressively scaling device sizes have also aggravated the problem of flicker noise, which gets modulated by the signal and presents itself as spectral tones. Typically, time domain statistical simulations are needed to guarantee system performance in presence of these nonidealities. In this work, we present a theoretical approach to compute these spectral tones.	algorithm;digital-to-analog converter;flicker noise;image scaling;mathematical optimization;modulation;simulation;spurious-free dynamic range	Gaurav Chandra;Ankit Seedher	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2008.921581	flicker noise;probability distribution;computer vision;dynamic range;electronic engineering;spurious-free dynamic range;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;electrical engineering;linearity;computer performance;silicon;computational model;communications system;statistics	EDA	66.7781284187233	50.84393925607454	37292

There is a growing risk that, this proliferation in the number of PHEVs will trigger extreme surges in demand while charging them during rush hours. To mitigate this impact, a unique charging station architecture is proposed in which the rate of charging of the PHEVs is controlled in such a way that the impact of charging during peak load period is not felt on the grid. The power needed to charge the plug in hybrids comes from grid-connected photovoltaic generation or the utility or both. The three way interaction between the PV, PHEVs and the grid ensures optimal usage of available power, charging time and grid stability. The system designed to achieve the desired objective consists of a photovoltaic system, DC/DC boost converter, DC/AC bi-directional converter and DC/DC buck converter. The output of DC/DC boost converter and input of DC/AC converter share a common DC bus. A unique control strategy based on DC bus voltage sensing is proposed for the above system for efficient transfer of energy. By using the proposed control strategy, the operations of charging station can be categorized into four modes: grid-connected rectification, PV charging and grid-connected rectification, PV charging and grid-connected inversion.	ac adapter;analog-to-digital converter;boost converter;buck converter;categorization;control theory;load profile;rectifier	G.

1a6ec23896d219c5aee3e9ffcffadbfa53b48422	integrating two stages as a common-mode transformerless photovoltaic converter		A single-phase common-mode transformerless grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) converter, which is based on the integration of two stages, is proposed in this paper. Transformer elimination in grid-connected PV systems has many advantages. It not only reduces cost, size, and weight but also increases the complete system efficiency. Since there is no galvanic isolation between grid and PV array, a leakage current may appear due to the PV parasitic capacitance to the ground, if this is not taken into account in the converter design. This paper presents a dc/dc boost converter integrated with a full-bridge inverter. The integration of these two stages reduces the ground leakage current. The neutral line of the grid is directly connected to the negative terminal of the PV array, eliminating any possibility of leakage current in this terminal. The principle of operation of the transformerless converter is analyzed, and a 200-W topology is experimentally tested.

The equivalent circuit of the EFT/B generator and the coupling clamp are modeled respectively. Firstly, a transfer function (TF) of the EFT pulse-forming network is constructed with the latent parameters based on circuit theory. In the TF, two negative real parameters characterize the non-oscillation process of the network while one complex conjugate pair characterizes the damping-oscillation process. The TF of the pulse-forming network is therefore synthesized in the equivalent circuit of the EFT/B generator. Secondly, the standard coupling clamp is modeled based on the scatter (S) parameter obtained by using a vector network analyzer. By applying the vector fitting method during the rational function approximation, a macromodel of the coupling clamp can be obtained and converted to a Spice compatible equivalent circuit. Based on the aforementioned procedures, the interference imposed on the I/O ports can be simulated. The modeling methods are validated experimentally, where the interference in differential mode and common mode is evaluated respectively.	clamper (electronics)	Xiaoshe Zhai;Yingsan Geng;Jianhua Wang;Guogang Zhang;Yan Wang	2011	IEICE Transactions		equivalent circuit;damping;rational function;electronic engineering;network analyzer;systems modeling;network analysis;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;transfer function;scattering parameters;transient;deterministic system;physics;quantum mechanics	Vision	70.19560086189763	46.10663228736398	37643

Parallel Resonance can make entire electrical network unstable as THD (voltage) may rise upto 26% of fundamental (which is nearly seven to eight times of THD produced by the harmonic source) resulting in highly distorted Electrical wave. This will result in misfiring in UPS, Variable Frequency Drives, and Battery Charges. The Protection system may mal-operate due to resonance. The losses in various electrical equipments will increase, which will result in heating and ultimately premature failure of equipments.

In particular, it exhibits a phase noise response of less than −115 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz from the carrier and has a tuning range of over 38%. The automatic amplitude control loop in the VCO gives the facility to trade-off phase noise response with power consumption. In addition, this paper discusses important features of the DC-DC converter needed for reducing spurs in such applications. The results show the negligible effect of the on-chip DC-DC converter on the spur tone level of the PLL, provided a proper regulator scheme is used to limit the output voltage ripple.	cmos;control system;dc-to-dc converter;phase noise;phase-locked loop;power inverter;ripple effect;voltage-controlled oscillator	Owen Casha;Ivan Grech;Edward Gatt;Joseph Micallef	2010	2010 17th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2010.5724732	control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	61.083819521654995	48.43833028613863	37777

A neuromorphic programmable-kernel 2-D convolution chip has been reported where each pixel included two compact calibrated digital-to-analog converters (DACs) of 5-bit resolution, for currents down to picoamperes. Those DACs were based on MOS ladder structures, which although compact require 3N + 1 unit transistors (N is the number of calibration bits). Here, we present a new calibration approach not based on ladders, but on individually calibratable current sources made with MOS transistors of digitally adjustable length, which require only N-sized transistors. The scheme includes a translinear circuit-based tuning scheme, which allows us to expand the operating range of the calibrated circuits with graceful precision degradation, over four decades of operating currents. Experimental results are provided for 5-bit resolution DACs operating at 20 nA using two different translinear tuning schemes. Maximum measured precision is 5.05 and 7.15 b, respectively, for the two DAC schemes.	1-bit architecture;4-bit;convolution;current source;digital-to-analog converter;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;gnu nano;neuromorphic engineering;pixel;staggered tuning;transistor;translinear circuit	Juan Antonio Leñero-Bardallo;Teresa Serrano-Gotarredona;Bernab&#x00E9; Linares-Barranco	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2007.916864	chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;calibration;digital control;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;very-large-scale integration;cmos;subthreshold conduction	EDA	60.025429273994895	49.38846537020108	37829
270245f2c8764263f54e52a02f9f9f59839dbfc5	analysis and design of a current-mode bandgap reference with high power supply ripple rejection		In this paper, a current-mode bandgap reference (BGR) circuit with cascode current mirrors and improved frequency compensation for achieving high power supply ripple rejection (PSRR) is presented. By slightly modifying a conventional frequency compensation scheme, the PSRR of the BGR is significantly enhanced. PSRRs of the BGR with the two different compensation techniques have been formulated and verified. Moreover, design considerations are presented, taking into account the critical parasitic capacitoru0027s effect in PSRR. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature of explicitly demonstrating how the PSRR of a BGR is improved due to the frequency compensation. The feedback loop stability is also analyzed. The measured PSRR of an example BGR using the modified compensation fabricated in a standard 0.18-m CMOS process is 77dB and 62dB at 1kHz, and 100kHz, respectively, with more than 40dB improvement at the high frequency ranges over the design with the classical compensation.	bandgap voltage reference;power supply;rejection sampling;ripple effect	Lidan Wang;Chenchang Zhan;Junyao Tang;Shuangxing Zhao;Guigang Cai;Yang Liu;Qiwei Huang;Guofeng Li	2017	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2017.08.011	frequency compensation;cascode;capacitor;electronic engineering;engineering;ripple;power supply rejection ratio;current mirror;bandgap voltage reference;control theory;cmos	HCI	62.288573350440366	47.49315696056396	37944

51b7eef610351056f4d48cb631590920f9338d54	the influence of microwave pulse repetition frequency on the thermal burnout effect of a pin diode limiting-amplifying system		Abstract This paper analyzes the influence of the microwave pulse repetition frequency on the thermal burnout effect of a PIN diode limiting-amplifying system. Based on the study of the single-shot microwave pulse thermal burnout effect and by introducing a new assumption that the heat dissipation of the electric field energy and the nonequilibrium carrier energy during the microwave pulse intervals can be neglected, the theoretical thermal burnout model in our previous study is extended to be suitable for repetitive microwave pulses. The theoretical relationship among the pulse number, the pulse repetition frequency, the pulse width and the thermal burnout power threshold is obtained by theoretical derivation. Because the assumptions are introduced, the theoretical relationship requires that both the whole length of a repetitive microwave pulse and the pulse width in a cycle of a repetitive microwave pulse should be between 10 ns and 10 μs. The results obtained by the theoretical relationship are in good agreement with the simulation results obtained by our self-designed device-circuit joint simulator, which verifies the correctness of the theoretical analyses, modeling and derivation. By fitting at least two sets of simulation or experimental data, the theoretical relationship can be used to predict the thermal burnout power thresholds of PIN diode limiting-amplifying systems under microwave pulse injections with different pulse parameters. It can greatly reduce the simulation or experimental costs and could be helpful for the design of a radio frequency receiver.	microwave;pin diode	Shipeng Yi;Zhengwei Du	2018	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2018.04.018	experimental data;burnout;electronic engineering;pulse repetition frequency;engineering;radio frequency;pulse (signal processing);pin diode;microwave;pulse-width modulation	Arch	70.92561814629889	47.740019549414846	38038

3bde36aa1cab3b698bdc2326bf64641a5ba4ae23	multichannel, low nonlinearity time-to-digital converters based on 20 and 28 nm fpgas		This paper presents low nonlinearity, compact, and multichannel time-to-digital converters (TDC) in Xilinx 28 nm Virtex 7 and 20 nm UltraScale field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The proposed TDCs integrate several innovative methods that we have developed: 1) the subtapped delay line averaging topology; 2) tap timing tests; 3) a direct compensation architecture; and 4) a mixed calibration method. The code density tests show that the proposed TDCs have much better linearity performances than previously reported ones. Our approach is cost-effective in terms of the consumption of logic resources. To demonstrate this, we implemented 96 channel TDCs in both FPGAs, using less than 25% of the logic resources. The achieved least significant bit (LSB) is 10.5 ps for Virtex 7 and 5.0 ps for UltraScale FPGAs. After the compensation and calibration, the differential nonlinearity (DNL) is within [–0.05, 0.08] LSB with σDNL = 0.01 LSB, and the integral nonlinearity (INL) is within [–0.09, 0.11] LSB with σINL = 0.04 LSB for the Virtex 7 FPGA. The DNL is within [–0.12, 0.11] LSB with σDNL = 0.03 LSB, and the INL is within [–0.15, 0.48] LSB with σINL = 0.20 LSB for the UltraScale FPGA.

The AC/DC converter converts the AC voltage of the power grid to regulated 3V DC voltage without need to bulky step-down transformer. Over-voltage problem at light load and no-load conditions due to lack of step-down transformer, is solved by an additional circuitry which prevents the converted voltage from rising high and damaging the converter. To reach less output ripple, a capacitor-less low drop-out (LDO) regulator is cascaded to the output of the converter. The measurements were done for both full-load and half-load of 17mA and 10mA respectively, and it was confirmed that the no-load over-voltage protection scheme works fine. The circuit has been implemented in a 0.35 μm 4M/2P CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology with using both 3.3 V and 5V transistors.	booting;cmos;electronic circuit;low-dropout regulator;rectifier;ripple effect;silicon on insulator;topological insulator;transformer;transistor;voltage divider	Peyman Goravanchi;Ralf Wunderlich;Stefan Heinen	2014	2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923952	forward converter;voltage regulator;charge pump;capacitor;flyback converter;ac/ac converter;telecommunications;computer science;78xx;electrical engineering;ćuk converter;voltage divider;low voltage;voltage controller;low-dropout regulator;cmos;voltage multiplier;dropout voltage;transistor;communications system;boost converter;negative impedance converter;voltage regulation	Arch	63.01338771699742	42.748755848641196	38173

The quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) approach offers an attractive alternative in which binary information is encoded in the configuration of charge among redox-active molecular sites. The Coulomb interaction between neighboring molecules provides device-device coupling. No current flow between molecules is required. We present an ab initio analysis of a simple molecular system which acts as a molecular QCA cell. The intrinsic bistability of the charge configuration results in dipole or quadrupole fields which couple strongly to the state of neighboring molecules. We show how logic gates can be implemented. We examine the role of the relaxation of nuclear coordinates in the molecular charge reconfiguration.	automata theory;bistability;coulomb;diode device component;linear programming relaxation;logic gate;quadrupole;quantum cellular automaton;quantum dot cellular automaton;transistor	Craig S.

From our results, we identify that an increased density of substrate contacts does not to any significance decrease noise on the power supply lines. However, the current injected into the substrate is highly dependent on higher-level grid/package inductance and substrate contact density. We have derived statistically that substrate noise variations could be related to these two design parameters to 69.75%. Based on linear fitting, a model that describes the injected current as function of substrate contact density and power delivery inductance is developed.	global serializability;physical design (electronics);power supply;simulation;substrate (electronics);substrate coupling	Daniel A.

09f55393eadea06b638e26d353ac525ea765dbc4	modeling and comparison of space vector pwm schemes for a five- phase induction motor drive		Multiphase induction machines are being considered for various applications in transportation and power sector. This is because of their capability to achieve enhanced power when compared to its three-phase counterparts. In addition to this, a multi phase drive improves the reliability at the system level, thus contributing to overall system efficiency. A detailed dynamic modeling of five-phase IM with various space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM)techniques are presented in this paper. These SVPWM techniques are compared in terms of total harmonic distortion. A modified SVPWM for five-phase drive is also presented. In order to verify the effectiveness space vector modulations, necessary simulation results are provided using MATLAB/SIMULINK software and experimental analysis are performed on a five-phase inverter developed in the laboratory.

In the proposed inverter, one of the bridge legs is shared with a boost converter. The boost inductor current is designed in discontinuous conduction mode, which can effectively decrease low-frequency current ripple (LFCR) in the output current of the fuel cell. The switching modes of the proposed inverter are analyzed in positive and negative half line cycles, respectively. The LFCR in the output current of the fuel cell is analyzed, from which the design principle of the boost voltage inductor is obtained. The per-unit current values of the shared switches and the loss of the whole system are derived and compared with those of the conventional inverter. Experimental verifications are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.	boost converter;control theory;dicom;diagram;modulation;network switch;power inverter;ripple effect	Jiarong Kan;Shaojun Xie;Yunya Wu;Yu Tang;Zhilei Yao;Rong Chen	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2416339	grid-tie inverter;electronic engineering;capacitor;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;inductor;active filter	Visualization	64.40981817398088	41.64631458255429	38678
fa44799565cb6426905e64d24b2faacf6136042d	driver mechanisms on cellular automata		A dr iver mechanism is introduced to a cellular automaton by which the state of one or several cells is controlled indep endently of t he other cells. On e way of achieving t his is to set certain cell valu es using a separ ate rul e governed by external inputs to the cellular automaton. When such a mechanism is used in the Life ru le, onedim ensional waves are generated by the dri ver cell and are pr opagated along the cellular automaton. It is hoped that such driving cells may be used to st udy the effects of disturbances to real-life models. Introduction Linear elect ric circuits may be analyzed in terms of their cont inuous response to a given input condit ion or by their response to a given exte rnal signal. A cellular auto maton with a single ru le can be compared to t he transient circuit, evolving by some fixed law from a given initial condit ion . Here we study the behavior of a Cellular Automat a Machine (CAM) whose cell values (zero or one) are displayed as (on or off) pixels on a twodimensional compute r display. At least one pixel in its two-dimensiona l plane is driven externally rather than solely by the main rule. We call this a driver mechanism. It is an alogous to an external input to a linear circuit and its effect is ana logous to t he transient response of a linear elect ric circuit to a given exte rnal input . We have modified a CAM-6 cellular automaton machine (from Systems Concept, Inc.), having a 256 x 256 cell plan e, to run with exte rn ally controlled cells. We will refer to this machine simply as CAM . All programs we describ e here use the terminology of [1], which describes CAM architec ture in det ail. Here we describe how a driver ru le is run on a background plane of cells. A background plane is any plane not used dir ectl y by t he main rul e. Therefore, a driver rul e is embedded within the main rul e and is used by the CAM to constant ly modify the pat tern file, which describ es the state of the plane. The modified pattern is used as the input to the next step of the main rul e. The use of the background plane prevent s any influence of the main rul e over the driver .

The output of the driver 's execut ion is th en provided as the input for the next step in th e execut ion of the main rule. In this pap er we modi fy (progr am-driven pixels) three commonly studied cellular auto mata rules that have been named Life, Fray, and Parity [1] . In each case , we force all 256 cells on a horizontal line to stay ones after 256 steps. This line grew from a single one cell by adding another forced one cell to the right of the line of ones at each of the first 256 st eps . We chose t his example of a dri ving mechani sm because it has an initial t ra nsient phase and a final (after 256 steps) steady-st ate phase. It is also easy to program. For CAM rules Life ana Pari ty, we start with a standa rd pat tern file (DISK.PAT , see [2]) that produces a solid circle of ones (of diameter 128 cells) on a backgroun d of zeros. Results are markedly different from freerunni ng behavior wit h no extern ally cont rolled cells. A driver rule can be merged with a main rule with some predetermined purpose or as a tool for experimentat ion. In this paper, we illustrate the form and effects of a dr iver mechan ism as an experimental too l. The CAM rule simulating the dr iver point consists of three par ts: the first determines the state of the driver pixels, the second part links the dri ver with the main rule, and the third par t serves to cont rol th e frequency of execut ion of the driver rule. The modified Game of Life rule One of the rules that showed an interesting property when influenced by th e driver is the Game of Life rule (see [2], pages 20-21 , for a detailed explanat ion of th e rule) . Figure 1 shows the act ual rule of Life, while figure 2 shows the modified rule of Life with a driver mechanism. In t he modified rule, the Forth word GENERATE-WAVE is used to genera te one-dimensional waves from a point source on planes 2 and 3.

As compared to SES, the proposed ESES method provides wider calibration range to accommodate multiple variation sources and produces higher calibration yield for the same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES-based calibration with application in analog/RF designs are demonstrated; current source calibration and phase/delay calibration. As compared to traditional calibration methods, the proposed ESES-based calibration incurs lower circuit overhead while achieving higher calibration resolution. ESES calibration is further applied to a wideband harmonic-rejection receiver design that achieves best-in-class harmonic-rejection performance after calibration.	accessible surface area;analogue electronics;current source;existential quantification;finite element method;group delay and phase delay;image resolution;overhead (computing);radio frequency;rejection sampling;scsi enclosure services	Renzhi Liu;Jeffrey A.

The proposed active capacitor voltage balancing control method detects the direction of the load current and measures the voltage of flying capacitors (FCs) to generate a proper switching state in order to form the required output voltage level and regulate the FC voltages at their desired reference levels. The proposed active capacitor voltage balancing control technique can modulate the output voltage through any of the pulse-width-modulation (PWM) techniques such as the phase-shifted carrier PWM or the level-shifted-carrier PWM. The foremost advantage of the proposed active control technique is that it does not demand any complex computations because it is not based on the optimization of the FC voltage-deviation cost functions. A thorough set of simulation results and experimental measurements for the five-level and seven-level SM converters are provided to validate the proposed active capacitor voltage balancing control method.	analog-to-digital converter;computation;foremost;logic form;mathematical optimization;pulse-width modulation;semi-continuity;simulation;total hi def;total harmonic distortion;transient (computer programming)	Arash Khoshkbar Sadigh;Vahid Dargahi;Keith A.

Both the FD filter and the bank of FI filters have a structure similar to that of Luenberger observer. The FD filter detects a fault event and the bank of FI filters identify a faulted converter component, for instance, failure in switching or passive components. We present simulation and experimental results for a prototype 2 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) boost dc-dc converter system to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed FDI scheme. The experimental results demonstrate accurate fault detection and identification for a collection of catastrophic component faults in PV dc-dc power converters.	bang file;bang–bang control;class;control theory;converter device component;dc-to-dc converter;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;flexible display interface;identification scheme;penicillin v;power electronics;prototype;simulation;switched-mode power supply;system on a chip	Palak Jain;Li Jian;Jason Poon;Costas J.

The proposed antenna consists of a simple rectangular-shaped patch as the main radiator, the modified mirrored L-shaped conductor back plane element, and the partial rectangular CPW-ground surface. Dual-band performances can be obtained by embedding and adjusting dimensions of strips on mirrored L-Shaped conductor back plane element. The impedance bandwidth with s11 < −10 dB is about 2.2 GHz (5.05–7.25 GHz) or 36 % for 5 GHz band and 5.2 GHz (7.6–12.8 GHz) or 51 % for X-band. The measured peak gains are about 1.8 dBi at WLAN-band and 4.3 dBi at Xband. The Experimental results indicate that the fabricated antenna with proper dimensions, good radiation characteristics, and reasonable measured gains can be a good candidate for various applications of the future multi-band wireless communication systems and mobile device.	backplane;characteristic impedance;lagrange multiplier;mobile device;on-premises wiring;performance;printing;strips;xband	Mahdi Jalali;Tohid Sedghi;Arash Kalami;Shahin Shafei	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-1789-9	monopole antenna;telecommunications	Mobile	66.27352580890857	57.92954985987674	39166

This paper presents a method to detect the dc current component flowing into the distribution power transformer with a precise measurement of the dc voltage component at the transformer winding.

The sigma-delta modulator is viewed as a device which distributes the noise power over a much broader band, compared to signal bandwidth, shapes and amplifies it, and allows filtering of the out-of-band noise. The shaping and amplification are quantified by two parameters, F and P, whose product is analogous to the square of step size of a uniform coder. These two parameters are related, on one hand, to the time constants or location of zero and poles. On the other hand, inequalities are set up between performance parameters, like signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and F and P.	analog-to-digital converter;digital-to-analog converter;lambda calculus	B.

The goal is to define the number of pump lasers and their wavelengths and powers in order to maximize both the average on-off gain and the flatness of the gain. The multi-objective optimizer aims to generate non-dominated solutions considering the average on-off gain, the number of used pump lasers and the gain ripple over the transmission bandwidth. The experimental results showed that our proposal is robust and can generate Pareto Fronts which are useful to design real Raman amplifiers. From these results, we observed that the designer can easily determine the minimum number of pump lasers to build the amplifier properly. As an example, we designed an amplifier with ripple and average on-off gain equal to 0.2 dB and 20 dB, respectively, for the case where 40 signal channels are amplified with total pump power equal to 1.5 W.	decibel;fitness function;hybrid fibre-coaxial;magnetic amplifier;mathematical optimization;on-off keying;optical amplifier;optical fiber;pareto efficiency;particle swarm optimization;raman scattering;ripple effect;swarm;switch	Carmelo J.

The grid-connected operation is constructed using the new three phase resolution-level controlled wavelet modulated inverter. The output of the wind generator is fed to a switch-mode converter, where the dc voltage is controlled to ensure extracting the maximum power at each wind speed. The resolution-level control of the grid-side inverter is designed as a current controller for adjusting active and reactive powers delivered to the grid. The proposed wind energy conversion system is implemented both in software and hardware performance testing on a direct-drive 6 kW laboratory permanent magnet generator operated with variable speed. Test results demonstrate that an accurate control of the dc voltage on the generator side ensures adjusting the generator speed to extract the maximum power from the wind at each wind speed. Also, test results show significant abilities of the resolution-level controller to initiate fast and accurate adjustments in the output active and reactive powers to meet the demand values under variable wind speed.	maximum power transfer theorem;modulation;power inverter;software performance testing;wavelet	Saleh A.

The correlated multiple sampling (CMS) technique has recently become an important technology for high-gain column readout circuits in low-noise CMOS image sensors (CISs). This paper reveals how the column CMS circuits, together with a pixel having a high-conversion-gain charge detector and low-noise transistor, realizes deep sub-electron read noise levels based on the analysis of noise components in the signal readout chain from a pixel to the column analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The noise measurement results of experimental CISs are compared with the noise analysis and the effect of noise reduction to the sampling number is discussed at the deep sub-electron level. Images taken with three CMS gains of two, 16, and 128 show distinct advantage of image contrast for the gain of 128 (noise(median): 0.29 e-rms) when compared with the CMS gain of two (2.4 e-rms), or 16 (1.1 e-rms).	analog;analog-to-digital converter;body dysmorphic disorders;cmos;converter device component;detectors;device parameters;electron;image noise;image sensor;multiple myeloma;multiple personality disorder;noise (electronics);noise reduction;pink noise;pixel;readout integrated circuit;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;small;transistor;sensor (device)	Shoji Kawahito;Min-Woong Seo	2016		10.3390/s16111867	flicker noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;correlated double sampling;electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise temperature;electrical engineering;noise;image sensor;noise;noise figure;noise floor;physics;noise generator	EDA	55.27432961590903	49.281018436072095	39522

Recently, a 3-coil WPTS was introduced in retinal prosthesis to overcome the low power transferring efficiency due to low coupling coefficient. Here we present a method to analyse this 3-coil WPTS using the S-parameters to directly obtain maximum achievable power transferring efficiency. Through electromagnetic simulation, we brought a question on the condition of improvement using 3-coil WPTS in powering retinal prosthesis.	bands;capacitor device component;coefficient;coil device component;dennō coil;electronic circuit;frequency band;hfss;inductive coupling;loose coupling;mathematical optimization;on the fly;parameter (computer programming);performance per watt;prosthesis implantation;relative biological effectiveness;resonance;retina;retinaldehyde;simulation;synaptic transmission;two-port network;visual prosthesis;positive regulation of termination of rna polymerase ii transcription	Shun Bai;Efstratios Skafidas	2014	2014 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945022	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	66.08807858851947	44.957748613932814	39612
ee98eb9b622a7371cdf5d0015dbf69f6708ca3a5	a cmos timer-injector integrated circuit for self-powered sensing of time-of-occurrence		Self-powered sensing of the time-of-occurrence of an event is challenging, because it requires access to a reliable time reference or a synchronized clock. In this paper, we propose for the first time a self-powered integrated circuit that is capable of time-stamping asynchronous mechanical events of interest. The core of the proposed design is the integration of two self-powered modules: 1) a chip-scale Fowler–Nordheim tunneling-based timer array, for generating a precision, relative time reference; and 2) a linear piezoelectricity-driven hot-electron injector acting as a floating-gate memory to record the onset of mechanical events. This paper presents measured results from a  $4 \times 4$  fully programmable timer array system-on-chip (SoC) and a linear injector array SoC, both of which have been prototyped in a standard double-poly CMOS process. The synchronization error of the timer array with respect to an external software clock was measured to be less than 1% over a duration of 100 h, and the average accuracy in sensing the time-of-occurrence of the event was measured to be 6.9%. The minimum activation energy of the self-powered system was measured to be 840 nJ (measured for event durations of 1 s), which is significantly lower than the energy that can be harvested from typical mechanical impacts.	cmos;electron;hot-carrier injection;integrated circuit;onset (audio);piezoelectricity;software prototyping;system on a chip;timer;transducer;tunneling protocol	Liang Zhou;Kenji Aono;Shantanu Chakrabartty	2018	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2018.2793531	injector;timer;asynchronous communication;synchronization;software;computer science;electronic engineering;logic gate;integrated circuit;cmos	EDA	57.18503984469651	47.60509893448961	39641

During the braking process, these two parts are consumed in the form of heat on the braking resistance, and the energy consumption will be about 24 percent of total energy consumption of the Truck. Hence, it is necessary to recover the braking energy.

The proposed cell was first designed to operate in the X-band frequency range at 9.4 GHz, then the cell dimensions were reduced to shift the operating frequency up to 30 GHz. The element is printed on a thin substrate with εr = 2.2 and 0.254 mm thickness. Unlike most of the cp-reflectarray elements the ground sheet is directly attached to the down layer of the substrate and no foam is needed which in turn reduces the fabrication costs and facilitates the mounting of the cp-reflectarray antenna. A full wave simulation using CST-MWS was applied on the proposed element and farfield monitors were assigned to the simulation setup. The proposed element proved to maintain the sense of polarization of the incident circularly polarized plane wave upon reflection, having a cross-polarization component of -30 dB at 9.4 GHz and -20 dB at 30 GHz. Also, it showed an axial ratio of 0 dB at the line of sight θ=0o at both frequencies and provides a 10.6% fractional bandwidth.	bandwidth (signal processing);cst thor;circular polarization;clock rate;decibel;frequency band;microstrip;polarization (waves);printing;simulation;substrate (electronics);thickness (graph theory)	Sarah Adel;Hany F.

However, there are currently several factors that deter the implementations of fully-integrated imaging systems. Due to the lack of low-noise amplification above fmax, the sensitivity of THz pixels on silicon cannot match that of its mm-Wave or light-wave counterparts. This, combined with the focal-plane array configuration adopted by previous sensors, requires exceedingly large power for the illumination sources. Previous works on silicon have demonstrated 1mW radiation [1,3]; but higher power, as well as energy efficiency, are needed for a practical imaging system. In addition, heterodyne imaging scheme was demonstrated to be very effective in enhancing detection sensitivity [4]. Due to the preservation of phase information, it also enables digital beam forming with a small number of receiver units. This however requires phase locking between the THz source and receiver LO with a small frequency offset (IF<;1GHz). In [5], a 300GHz PLL is reported with probed output. In this paper, a 320GHz transmitter using SiGe HBTs is presented (Fig. 25.5.1). Combining 16 coherent radiators, this work achieves 3.3mW radiated power with 0.54% DC-RF efficiency, which are the highest among state-of-the-art silicon THz radiators shown in the comparison table in Fig. 25.5.6.

86efbb36de32f9c46a131d3e6378de98fb0284e0	a study of three-phase dc-dc boost converters		Three-phase DC-DC boost converters are attractive in applications where the input is a low voltage DC source, such as in renewable energy systems that are fed by solar cells. In spite of their advantageous features, they are not, however, as well known as conventional single-phase bridge topologies. In this paper, a comparison of three three-phase DC-DC boost converters is made, including a new converter proposed by the authors. Guidelines as to which converter is better suited for particular applications are derived and presented.	boost converter;dc-to-dc converter;prototype;simulation;solar cell	Adel Ali Abosnina;Gerry Moschopoulos	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8350976	capacitor;renewable energy;electronic engineering;spite;network topology;three-phase;computer science;low voltage;converters;inductor	Arch	63.83874348250636	41.50666783101724	39897
9b1f3b0d1cbf0966dd1eca7086d65f7000f65fa8	filter-based control of an h-bridge inverter with output lc filter		This paper presents a filter-based control scheme for an H-Bridge inverter with output LC filter. This approach relies only on a single output voltage measurement to reduce the system cost as well as measurement noise and disturbance injected by output current and/or inductor current measurements. To reduce the controller sensitivity to the system parameters, the proposed controller is developed for unknown system parameters. A Lyapunov stability analysis is utilized to demonstrate system stability. Experimental results demonstrate excellent voltage regulation, insensitivity to load variations, and low output voltage distortion as well as the stability of the system under both linear and nonlinear loads.	diode bridge;distortion;h bridge;lc circuit;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;phase inversion;power inverter;sensor;total harmonic distortion;voltage regulation	Mohammad Mohebbi;Joseph Latham;Michael L.

By using a single clock to control the source, a clock divider may be used to derive a clock that will trigger an ADC at the appropriate times to produce a coherently sampled data set. Thus, the timing of the waveform and the ADC will be accurately synchronized; moreover, since test time is a valuable commodity, a predictable number of clock cycles can be issued in order to generate a sampled data set. A computer simulation is given which fully characterizes the theoretical aspects of this paper. In addition, selected laboratory measurements are also given for discussion.	analog-to-digital converter;cordic;clock signal;computer simulation;frequency divider;high-level programming language;mixed-signal integrated circuit;waveform	Mark B.

First, an algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal post-fault state among all possible states, which have the same maximum available voltage. Furthermore, a modified technique is proposed to calculate the references of inverter phase voltages under faulty conditions. This technique leads to a decrease in the common-mode voltage when the required output voltage is less than its maximum value. These solutions are mutually employed in the post-fault control system. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in comparison with the existing methods in different cases.	algorithm;control system;h bridge;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;sandy bridge;simulation	Saeed Ouni;Mohammad Reza Zolghadri;Masih Khodabandeh;Mahmoud Shahbazi;José R.

A 50 MHz, 3.3 V, 10-bit pipelined analog-todigital converter has been implemented in a 0.25-mm CMOS technology using radix!2 architecture. It achieves more than 54 dB signal-tonoise plus distortion ratio in Nyquist signal sampling at 3.0 V (10% lower than the 3.3 V nominal value) over K40 to C120 8C temperature range with a full-scale sinusoidal input. The IM3 of the converter, which is an important parameter for the OFDM based systems, is less than K64 dB. Non-linearity is reduced through digital self-calibration and correction. The digital calibration procedure takes less than 24 mS and can be done either on power up or intermittently. The layout area is 1.8 mm!1.2 mm. The converter consumes 100 mA out of a 3.3 V supply including the reference circuitry, analog cells, and all digital blocks at full-scale Nyquist sampling speed. q 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Using least squares instead of the orthogonal matching pursuit for signal recovery reduces the computational complexity where, the index search and matrix inverse stages are avoided. The proposed architecture is fully pipelined where, 14 clock cycles are required to detect 1024-length signal occupying 8 channels from 16 measurements. The design is implemented in 45 nm CMOS operating at 165 MHz. Since, the sensing time for 1024-length signal is roughly 84.8 ns, the proposed design offers high speed signal detection compared with state of art orthogonal matching pursuit architecture.	algorithmic efficiency;application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;clock signal;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;detection theory;frequency band;least squares;matching pursuit;mathematical optimization;online advertising;pipeline (computing)	Mohamed Shaban;Tarek Idriss;Haytham Idriss;Magdy A.

4dc880c29d78f12ec28de39c67fd6fffe537d002	spatial-spectral materials for high performance optical processing		Optically active Spatial-Spectral (S2) materials are a unique resource for spectrally based optical memory and processing. At cryogenic temperatures, the rare-earth ions in these materials individually exhibit narrow optical resonances on the order of MHz to sub-KHz, but are inhomogeneously broadened over GHz to THz spectral bandwidths providing up to 10^7 resolvable spectral channels. The material can be optically programmed to transform the spectral and spatial components of optical signals to perform signal processing operations such analog multiplications, time delay, filtering, convolutions, and correlations. We present work utilizing the S2 technology for high bandwidth (>32 GHz) and data rate selection and filtering, including processing of 1D data streams in real-time and 2D images. Despite cryogenic cooling, the power efficiency of the S2 technology compares favorably to CMOS in large scale systems. Finally, potential architectures for large (10^6 x 10^6) vector-matrix multipliers using S2 materials are discussed.	active galactic nucleus;broadcast delay;cmos;computer cooling;convolution;data rate units;optical rotation;performance per watt;real-time clock;signal processing;spatial anti-aliasing	Zeb W.

Three specific PWM techniques such as sinusoidal PWM (SPWM), space vector PWM (SVPWM), and hysteresis PWM (HPWM) are designed and implemented for three-phase voltage source inverter-fed SPMSM drive. Each of the PWM technique is designed and modeled for three-phase inverters. The PWM models are integrated and implemented with the SPMSM drive using the Simulink software. The software is used for simulation tests of the SPMSM drive. The performance of the SPMSM drive using various PWM techniques is investigated for the ramp change in speed and for the step change in load. The power factor (PF) and total harmonic distortion (THD) of the drive are estimated for low and rated speed conditions at no load and rated load conditions. Based on the PF and THD analyses, two optimization algorithms are presented in order to select a PWM for the SPMSM drive with different operating conditions.	algorithm;hysteresis;inverter (logic gate);mathematical optimization;power inverter;profiling (computer programming);pulse-width modulation;qualitative comparative analysis;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;requirement;simulink;structural load;total harmonic distortion;voltage source	M.

One way to improve the cells' performance in these adverse operation conditions is to proactively heat them. In this paper, we consider the scenario in which a cell is heated from both inside and outside; a current is drawn from the cell to power a convective heater; Joule heating warms the cell from inside. A problem formulation to derive the time-limited energy-optimal current policy is presented, analyzed and numerically solved. It is observed that the optimal current policy resembles a sequence of constant voltage, constant current and phases, mirroring conventional wisdom. Finally, the notion of productive warm-up-a warm-up procedure that ensures that the cell can perform work once warmed-up-is introduced; and an approximation of the optimal solution is used to identify the lowest state of charge at various operating conditions (portion of the state-space) from which productive warm-up is feasible.	approximation;bandlimiting;constant current;constant-voltage speaker system;disk mirroring;joule;newman's lemma;numerical analysis;optimal control;powera;state of charge;state space;sub-zero;warren abstract machine;while	Shankar Mohan;Jason B.

The TRX has two independent RF front-ends for each band with a shared analog baseband to achieve optimum power and cost. In Sub-GHz (760-960MHz) band, the maximum 75dBc 3rd harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) is achieved by inserting a RFA with notch filtering. In 2.4GHz band, a single-ended-to-differential (S2D) RFA with phase and gain error compensation is proposed. By optimizing two bands separately, the RX achieves a NF of 5.1dB and 4.2dB, respectively. A Σ-Δ fractional-N PLL with two switchable Class-C VCOs is employed to provide the LOs. Moreover, the multi-mode CMOS PAs are integrated, which achieve the measured output P1dB (OP1dB) of 16.3dBm and 14.8dBm with 25% PAE for Sub-GHz and 2.4GHz bands. Furthermore, to optimize the PA's back-off efficiency, the power-control loop is proposed to detect the input signal PAPR in real time and flexibly reconfigure the PA's operation modes. With this proposed technique, the PAE in Sub-GHz band is improved by ×3.24 and ×1.41 at 9dB and 3dB back-off powers. In 2.4GHz band, the PAE is improved by ×2.17 at 6dB back-off power. The measured results have demonstrated that this presented transceiver has achieved comparable or even better performance in terms of noise, HRR, OP1dB and power efficiency compared with the-state-of-the-arts.	baseband;cmos;control system;new foundations;performance per watt;phase-locked loop;power architecture platform reference;radio frequency;reconfigurable computing;rejection sampling;single-ended signaling;transceiver;voltage-controlled oscillator	Xiaobao Yu;Meng Wei;Yun Yin;Ying Song;Siyang Han;Qiongbing Liu;Zongming Jin;Xiliang Liu;Zhihua Wang;Baoyong Chi	2014	2014 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference (A-SSCC)	10.1109/ASSCC.2014.7008909	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	62.181062094153205	53.45429650483558	40959

b71dd7823aecc0ec642deb70f9f9e5e58ae0bacb	a novel light load performance enhanced variable-switching-frequency and hybrid single-dual-phase-shift control for single-stage dual-active-bridge based ac/dc converter	zero voltage switching zvs;power factor correction pfq;dual active bridge dab	Full-bridge power-factor-correction (PFC) front-end + dual-active-bridge (DAB) AC/DC topology is widely used in industry, e.g., electrical vehicle on-board charger. Such two-stage topology limits the system efficiency, and the bulky DC link bus capacitor makes the system power density relatively low. Compared to the two-stage design, the single-stage design, unfolding bridge + DAB, eliminates the bulky DC link bus capacitor and operates the front-end with only 60Hz switching frequency, thereby has the potential to increase the system power density and efficiency. A novel variable-switching-frequency and hybrid single-dual-phase-shift (VSF-SDPS) control strategy is proposed and analyzed for the DAB based single-stage topology. The proposed VSF-SDPF control consists of two phase shifts to guarantee Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS) over the full range of the AC line voltage, and frequency modulation to achieve boost PFC. The conventional front-end PFC is simplified to an unfolding bridge by changing DAB control strategy to achieve PFC and ZVS at the same time. Besides, a special ZVS boundary is utilized to solve the grid current distortion problem when the switching frequency saturated, which is especially severe at light load condition. Simulation results and experimental validation are presented under 50Vrms AC line voltage and 200V DC battery voltage test condition.	battery charger;clock rate;control theory;distortion;modulation;on-board data handling;powerbuilder foundation classes;simulation;switched-mode power supply;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Qi Tian;Alex Q.

Reference voltage given is adjusted instead of droop gain. Dynamic average consensus algorithm is explored in each agent to get the required information for scheduling voltage autonomously. State-space analysis on a single energy storage unit and simulation verification shows that the proposed method has two advantages. Firstly, modifying the reference voltage given has less impact on system stability compared to gain scheduling. Secondly, by adopting multiagent methodology, the proposed distributed control has less communication dependence and more reliable during communication topology changes.

It provides a realistic assessment of how a device will interact under various conditions and environments, allowing the testing process to truly vet the apparatuses before full scale deployment. Crucial to the PHIL concept, is the hardware-in-the-loop interface. Interfaces must be accurate, stable and able to pass through dynamics so that the hardware under test sees the most realistic view of the remainder to the system and vice versa. The damping impedance method (DIM) provides the appropriate characteristics for dynamic load applications but its philosophy requires some modification when in a system that has considerable harmonic content in either voltage and/or current. This paper will provide a modified DEVI (MDEVI) method for PHIL applications to meet this criteria. Specifically, it will investigate a power-electronic-based system with a load containing harmonic content and will compare the accuracy of the results against a traditional DEVI interface method.	characteristic impedance;full scale;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;software deployment;verification and validation	Sanaz Paran;Fletcher E.

3fd8c5bd2026c55e37106a59736327fe241cb518	electromagnetic interference in electronic circuits and systems	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	This thesis examines the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and coupling in circuits and systems. The coupling phenomenon is investigated in nonuniform transmission lines and adjacent via structures in microelectronic circuits. Radiation from metallic enclosures with apertures and lined with resistive materials is analyzed. Electromagnetic interference on a larger scale is studied in the Instrument Landing System receivers, where both in-band and out-of-band interference sources are considered. The method for modeling and analyzing vias in multilayered integrated circuits is based upon microwave network theory. The whole via structure, consisting of a vertical via passing through different layers and transitions from the microstrip lines or striplines to the vertical via, is divided into cascaded subnetworks. The parameters for each subnetwork are obtained from electromagnetic field analysis. The vertical via is modeled with equivalent magnetic frill arrays, and the transitions are characterized with the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) technique. For the electromagnetic coupling between two vias the evenand odd-mode approach is incorporated. Closedform expressions for the coupled noises on the passive via are derived. Results are presented both in the frequency domain and the time domain. Validation of the model has been carried out by measurements on a 4-layer structure. A method based on the wave transmission matrix to deal with nonuniform multiconductor transmission line systems is presented. The wave transmission matrix is employed to characterize the multiconductor transmission lines.

CMOS signal generation at this frequency range is a major challenge due to the limited cut-off frequency of transistors and their low breakdown voltage. A recent work has demonstrated generation of high power at a fixed frequency in the sub-mm-Wave range using a harmonic oscillator [1]. However, for most applications a tunable signal source is necessary. In previous works, frequency multipliers are used as an alternative for tunable power generation above 150GHz [2].

The proposed origami antenna consists of a meandered monopole folded onto three sides of the magic cube. A microstrip open-ended stub is loaded on the meandered monopole. The proposed origami magic cube can be mechanically folded and unfolded. The proposed antenna operates at 1.57 GHZ and 2.4 GHz in the folded state. In the unfolded state, the proposed antenna operates at 900 MHz and 2.3 GHz. The resonant frequency of the second band can be tunable by varying the length and position of the open stub. The origami magic cube is built on paper. Its performance is numerically and experimentally demonstrated from S-parameters and radiation patterns. The measured 10 dB impedance bandwidth of the proposed origami antenna is 18% (900-1120 MHz) and 15% (2.1-2.45 GHz) for the unfolded state and 20% (1.3-1.6 GHz) and 14% (2.3-2.5 GHz) for the folded state. The measured peak gain at 900 MHz and 2.3 GHz are 1.1 dBi and 2.32 dBi, respectively, in the unfolded state. The measured peak gain at 1.5 GHz and 2.4 GHz are 3.28 dBi and 1.98 dBi, respectively, in the folded state.	antenna device component;characteristic impedance;cube dosage form;denavit–hartenberg parameters;dual;experiment;inverted-f antenna;megahertz;microstrip;neural network simulation;nonlinear gameplay;numerical analysis;quantitative impedance;resonance	Syed Imran Hussain Shah;Sungjoon Lim	2017		10.3390/s17112675	microstrip;electronic engineering;stub (electronics);wireless sensor network;magic cube;engineering;reconfigurable antenna;electrical impedance;multi-band device;bandwidth (signal processing)	Mobile	64.42381035093369	55.55282901257551	41418

In air-cooled machines, these losses are evacuated by a forced cooling airflow through the active parts. When designing and optimizing such a machine, the design engineer must be able to get a full picture of the power losses, the cooling airflow, and the temperatures inside the active parts (e.g., core laminations, windings) and the periphery (e.g., winding overhangs). The aim of the designer is to fulfill the customer's requirements regarding the guaranteed temperatures. This paper presents a computation method, where the power loss, airflow, and temperature calculations for the world's largest air-cooled hydrogenerators are coupled in an iterative process. The new contribution of this paper is a calculation software developed by the authors. It includes a state-of-the-art loss computation, an automated airflow network, and a set of linked thermal networks. These computations result in a complete overview of the temperature gradients and allow fine tuning of the cooling airflow and, consequently, optimization of ventilation losses.	air cooling;computation;computer cooling;gradient;iteration;mathematical optimization;requirement;steady state	Georg Traxler-Samek;Richard Zickermann;Alexander Schwery	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2031191	control engineering;synchronous motor;electronic engineering;multidisciplinary design optimization;permanent magnet synchronous generator;lamination;temperature;engineering;electrical engineering;software development;hydroelectricity;iterative method;steady state;physics;temperature gradient	HPC	67.96693914299165	32.60539780689821	41608

Moreover, the model has been employed for designing an inverse Class-F PA using a commercial high-power GaN HEMT. Good agreement between amplifier simulation and measurement proves the validity of the proposed large-signal model.	audio power amplifier;large-signal model	Linsheng Liu;Jianguo Ma;Geok Ing Ng	2010	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.7.1672	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;fet amplifier	EDA	68.58131390967654	44.94259981478185	41854

Compared to other work, this LNA has a similar or better linearity at only 10mW. The LNA uses a nominal supply of 2.5V, but was tested up to 3.7V and showed no significant degradation of its linearity for ±400mV supply variations. A power clamp, designed to enable testing at higher core supply voltage, withstands a >2.6kV HBM discharge, while the overall circuit is protected for >1kV HBM discharges.	cmos;clamping (graphics);discharger;elegant degradation;high bandwidth memory;internet of things;launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;new foundations;operating point;out-of-bag error;out-of-band agreement;prototype;silicon on insulator;third-order intercept point;topological insulator	Barend van Liempd;Saneaki Ariumi;Ewout Martens;Shih-Hung Chen;Piet Wambacq;Jan Craninckx	2015	ESSCIRC Conference 2015 - 41st European Solid-State Circuits Conference (ESSCIRC)	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2015.7313854	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering	EDA	62.99727975150905	52.44016514218884	41880
cc59186cb72ffda0830b9bba421fe6ec32332e10	theory of series inductance matching to transducer at premechanical resonance zone in ultrasonic vibration cutting		In order to obtain large vibration amplitude in ultrasonic vibration cutting, the transducer demands an additional inductance to match its native capacitance. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimum oscillation frequency of the resonant tank constructed using additional inductance and the transducer's native capacitance. By analyzing the transducer impedance matching on the impedance circle deduced from the transducer equivalent circuit model, the optimum oscillation frequency is found to be not equal to the transducer mechanical resonance frequency, but below it. Frequencies near the optimum oscillation frequency are referred to as the optimum premechanical resonance zone. Consequently, the Theory of Ultrasonic Transducer Impedance Matching at Premechanical Resonance Zone is proposed. Comparative experiments are conducted at different frequency zones. The results reveal that when the transducer is excited at the premechanical resonance zone, the vibration amplitude increases and the excitation voltage signal is the desired sine wave, compared to that when excited at the mechanical resonance frequency and the postmechanical resonance zone. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of this proposed theory.

ff206e33b8a700acebb3c7e1dbdd5d9f3a28c72f	digital adcs and ultra-wideband rf circuits for energy constrained wireless applications		Ongoing advances in semiconductor technology have enabled a multitude of portable, low power devices like cellular phones and wireless sensors. Most recently, as transistor device geometries reach the nanometer scale, transistor characteristics have changed so dramatically that many traditional circuits and architectures are no longer optimal and/or feasible. As a solution, much research has focused on developing 'highly digital' circuits and architectures that are tolerant of the increased leakage, variation and degraded voltage headrooms associated with advanced CMOS processes. This thesis presents several highly digital, mixed-signal circuits and architectures designed for energy constrained wireless applications. First, as a case study, a highly digital, voltage scalable flash ADC is presented. The flash ADC, implemented in 0.18 pm CMOS, leverages redundancy and calibration to achieve robust operation at supply voltages from 0.2 V to 0.9 V. Next, the thesis expands in scope to describe a pulsed, noncoherent ultra-wideband transceiver chipset, implemented in 90 nm CMOS and operating in the 3-to-5 GHz band. The all-digital transmitter employs capacitive combining and pulse shaping in the power amplifier to meet the FCC spectral mask without any off-chip filters. The noncoherent receiver system-on-chip achieves both energy efficiency and high performance by employing simple amplifier and ADC structures combined with extensive digital calibration. Finally, the transceiver chipset is integrated in a complete system for wireless insect flight control. Through the use of a flexible PCB and 3D die stacking, the total weight of the electronics is kept to 1 g, within the carrying capacity of an adult Manduca sexta moth. Preliminary wireless flight control of a moth in a wind tunnel is demonstrated. Thesis Supervisor: Anantha P. Chandrakasan Title: Joseph F. and Nancy P.

E-mail address: mzd2003@Yahoo.com.cn (M. Dai). A parasitic charge pumping current (IPCP) is observed and extracted properly. While charge pumping current after correction (ICOCP) contributes to threshold voltage shift, this transient IPCP does not contribute and should be extracted from CP current (ICP). This IPCP is shown to be unable to be extracted by conventional low–high multi-frequency CP method (LHMF). It could only be extracted effectively enough by a high–high multi-frequency charge pumping (CP) method (HHMF). In HHMF, a high frequency is employed to measure IPCP; while in LHMF, a low frequency is used to measure the current out of ICOCP. Without eliminating IPCP, large noise tail in LHMF method distorts the shape of ICOCP curve and even masks maximum ICOCP current (ICPmax). This is because IPCP is due to transient charge-trapping and -detrapping. Therefore, IPCP is frequency dependent and its value can be obtained sufficiently only when frequency is no lower than 1 MHz. Regarding both the value of ICPmax and the shaping of ICOCP curve, HHMF is more recommended for CMOS devices with SiON and high-j dielectrics with high transient trap density. 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	cmos;distortion;noise shaping;power mosfet;pumping (computer systems);spectral leakage;tunneling protocol	Mingzhi Dai;Kinleong Yap	2010	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2010.07.004	high-κ dielectric;electronic engineering;charge pump;chemistry;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;high frequency;noise reduction;low frequency;threshold voltage;physics	EDA	64.93959087447676	45.97853529049479	42052

This technique is based on the realization of the VA equalizer transfer function directly as the voltage transfer function from port 1 to port 2 of an active-R three-port network when its port 3 is terminated in the active-RC realization of the corresponding (positive-real) shaping impedance function. The salient feature of the resulting VA active-RC equalizers is that they permit the continuous variation of the equalizer transfer function from the corresponding shaping transfer function to its inverse through the use of one single (positive) variable resistor only. In addition, they permit arithmetically symmetric changes in the logarithmic magnitude-frequency response of the equalizer through geometrically symmetric changes in the value of the constituent variable resistor. An application example is given to illustrate the main results.	bibo stability;bode plot;characteristic impedance;equalization (communications);frequency response;noise shaping;operational amplifier;positive-real function;potentiometer;transfer function;type variable	Behrouz Nowrouzian;Arthur T.

In order to compare these two receivers to a classical architecture, the performance of an I/Q demodulator (IQD) is also presented. Measured results show the superiority of TPD and IQD over FPD in terms of residual DC offsets and 2nd order intermodulation distortion (IMD2) products, noise figure (NF), and sensitivity due to the use of active balanced mixers instead of diode power detectors. Lastly, demodulation of three noncontiguous RF carriers shows the stronger potential of the three-phase demodulator (TPD) for applications in future long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) receivers through EVM and constellation diagram measurements.	baseband;compaq lte;diagram;diode;distortion;flat panel detector;intermodulation;noise figure;propagation delay;radio frequency;sensor;zero suppression	Kaissoine Abdou;Antoine Khy;Kais Mabrouk;Bernard Huyart	2014	J.

A dc voltage source is assumed as the input to the inverter, and under faulty conditions of the inverter switch, the actual voltage applied between the line to neutral (open neutral) of the 3-phase circuit is derived, based on the inverter switching table. This issue is very important, since during motor analysis and simulation it very often becomes necessary to use a line-to-neutral voltage as input to the simulation process or analysis, for which current is the output. The paper studies the necessary and sufficient conditions required for the line-to-neutral voltages indicated in the switching truth table to be true.	inverter (logic gate);power electronics;power inverter;race condition;simulation;steady state;switch;unbalanced circuit;voltage source	M.

In FRET, for example, typical fluorescence lifetime is of the order of 100 to 300ps, thus deep-subnanosecond resolutions are needed in the instrument response function (IRF). This in turn requires new time-resolved image sensors with better time resolution, increased throughput, and lower costs. Solid-state avalanche photodiodes operated in Geiger-mode, or single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), have existed for decades [1] but only recently have SPADs been integrated in CMOS. However, as array sizes have grown, the readout bottleneck has also become evident, leading to hybrid designs or more integration and more parallelism on-chip [2,3]. This trend has accelerated with the introduction of SPAD devices in deep-submicron CMOS, that have enabled the design of massively parallel arrays where the entire photon detection and ToA circuitry is integrated on-pixel [4,5].	cmos;diode;electronic circuit;frequency response;image sensor;information retrieval facility;parallel computing;pixel;resonance;throughput;time-to-digital converter;tomography;very-large-scale integration	Chockalingam Veerappan;Justin A.

The presented tool permits the characterization of the panel, and it is useful to predict its behavior in whatever working condition; in this way, it is possible to compare the actual and expected performance to prevent any decrease in the output power, so permitting the replacement of the monitored module before it goes out of order or its efficiency falls under a given threshold. The well-known two-diode model is used to estimate the parameters of the electrical equivalent circuit of the PVP and to simulate the I -V and P-V characteristic curves in any given environmental condition of irradiance and/or temperature. The model and the estimation algorithm are implemented with MATLAB functions, whereas data acquisition and result presentation are managed by a LabVIEW graphics user interface. The presented tool has been validated against an experimentally characterized PVP. The environmental parameters of the model such as irradiance and temperature have been set (with their respective uncertainties) during simulations or directly measured during the outdoor tests, whereas the others parameters have been evaluated using a best-fit algorithm on the measured data. The estimation is based on the minimization of a new objective function and on a modified expression of the model resistances, which differ from those mentioned in the available literature. After a review of the state of the art, this paper provides the description of the estimation technique and its validation by means of simulations and experiments.

For controller design we use a linearized system model, compute the feedback gains via pole placement and present an analytical expression for the gains in dependence of the actual operating point. The linearized model also allows to illustrate the non-minimum phase behavior of the DC-link dynamics for certain operation points. By online adjustment of the feedback gains, we achieve a stable closed-loop system behavior for different operation points (e.g. different reference set-points and load steps). Simulation results illustrate the control performance of a proportional state-feedback controller, a state-feedback controller with integral action and a proportional-integral state-feedback controller.	control theory;feedback;minimum phase;nonlinear system;operating point;simulation;switched-mode power supply;voltage source	Christian Dirscherl;Christoph M.

42757091f7fa72c31d16eab5ceb444336f860566	design and real-time implementation of shepwm in single-phase inverter using generalized hopfield neural network	inverters;power harmonic filters;mathematical model;mathematical model harmonic analysis pulse width modulation inverters switches equations power harmonic filters;switches;pulse width modulation;harmonic analysis	In this paper, a real-time implementation of selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation (SHEPWM) using generalized Hopfield neural network (GHNN) as applied to the single-phase inverter is designed and discussed. Finding the location of the switching instants in the case of SHEPWM involves the solution of a set of nonlinear algebraic transcendental equations. The problem is redrafted as an optimization problem, and it is solved by using GHNN. Though, in principle, then number of harmonics can be eliminated using the presented methodology, this paper tries for the case of the elimination of the 5th-, 7th-, 11th-, and 13th-order harmonics while retaining the desired fundamental. An energy function is formulated for this problem and the set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the behavior of GHNN is obtained. A program in KEIL C was developed to solve these systems of ODEs by the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method to give the switching instants for continuously varying modulation indexes (M). A MATLAB simulation was carried out, and an experimental setup was also constructed in order to validate the simulated results. The fast Fourier transform analysis of the simulated output voltage waveform and the experimental output voltage waveform confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hence, the proposed method proves that it is much applicable in the industrial applications by virtue of its suitability in real-time applications.	algorithm;artificial neural network;fast fourier transform;hopfield network;inverter (logic gate);linear algebra;matlab;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;phase inversion;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;rectifier;runge–kutta methods;simulation;waveform	M.

The sensor is based on time domain coding which converts the photocurrent into an inversely proportional pulse width (PWM) signal. The 8-bit conversion mode is used for high quality imaging while the 4-bit conversion mode provides a shorter conversion time and a 2-fold increase in spatial resolution. In order to overcome the nonlinearity introduced in the time domain PWM coding, a linearization procedure based on nonuniform time domain quantizer is proposed.

One three-level inverter and one seven-level inverter with DC link voltages in 3:1 ratio are connected to the two ends of the stator winding of the induction motor to generate a seventeen level space vector structure. A level shifted carrier based scheme is used to modulate the inverter, which requires only instantaneous phase voltage references. Selection of switching states is used to ensure that both inverters supply real power to the motor the over entire modulation range, preventing overcharging of the DC bus. The topology was tested for steady state operation over the entire modulation range, and experimental results are included below.	instantaneous phase;inverter (logic gate);modulation;network switch;power inverter;steady state	Abhijit Kshirsagar;R.

This brief shows an approach for the estimation of the data converter's spectral components and noise floor based on a small simulation window. Additionally, it provides two useful estimates of the technique's expected accuracy. The method is based on circuit-aware linear least squares spectral analysis. It can be applied together with the accuracy estimate and knowledge of the noise spectrum's shape during the design time of time-based data converters. It provides a significant advantage over classic fast Fourier transform-based techniques for time-based data converters. Both a theoretical background and simulation results are provided for a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. The technique provides a good accuracy for both the spectral components and the data converter's noise floor. The accuracy estimate expresses the technique's performance, achieving a worst case error of only 5 dB, which proves its usability.	analog-to-digital converter;best, worst and average case;colors of noise;decibel;design tool;distortion;fast fourier transform;image resolution;least-squares spectral analysis;linear least squares (mathematics);noise floor;sinadr;simulation;spectral density estimation;usability;voltage-controlled oscillator	Tom Redant;Pieter A.

However, these machines also suffer from a significant disadvantage of easily occurring large stator current harmonics. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a current harmonic elimination method based on a disturbance observer (DOB). The study provides a detailed analysis and design principles for the DOB. The performance of the proposed method is verified by experimental results. The results show that nearly complete elimination (> 99% reduction) of harmonic components is achieved. In addition, it is shown that the method is robust against uncertainties. The method provides a simple yet effective alternative for solving the issue of stator current harmonics in dual three-phase drives, and the results of this paper can be easily applied also to other multiphase machine types.	observer pattern;steady state	Jussi Karttunen;Samuli Kallio;Pasi Peltoniemi;Pertti Silventoinen	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2461519	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;torque;electromagnetic coil;physics;harmonics	EDA	67.28242358502652	39.30411553631306	43363

The new scheme utilizes an existing digital foreground calibration algorithm and extends it to work in background. The goal is to digitally calibrate the pipeline ADCs in the background without stopping the input conversion. In this method one additional stage connected in parallel to the stage under calibration and one cyclic ADC are used to accommodate the calibration. The extra stage and the cyclic ADC are only used during the calibration process. Sources of error in pipeline architectures and effects of error on residue plot of 1-bit per stage are identified and discussed. The digital background calibration accounts for capacitor mismatch, comparator offset, charge injection and finite op-amp gain. By applying proposed calibration to a 12 bit resolution pipeline ADC, maximum INL improved from 14 to 0.6 LSB, and maximum DNL improved from 26 to 0.8 LSB.	1-bit architecture;12-bit;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;comparator;least significant bit;noise reduction;operational amplifier;pipeline (computing)	Ahmad Tahmasebi;Arash Kamali;Hossein Balazadeh Bahar;Ziaadin Daei Koozehkanani	2009	2009 International Conference on Signal Acquisition and Processing	10.1109/ICSAP.2009.51	operational amplifier;embedded system;voltage;calibration;capacitor;electrical engineering;signal processing;pipeline transport;accuracy and precision;digital electronics	EDA	58.991954522841176	50.05209596191502	43405

The discussion starts with a description of the influence of antennas on UWB transmission. The parameters characterizing antennas in time and in frequency domain are specified. Since the number of possible antenna structures is nearly unlimited, the focus will be on a classification according to different radiation principles. For each of these mechanisms, the typical advantages and disadvantages are discussed, and an example antenna and its characteristics are presented. For a wireless engineer, the problem to solve is the proper design of an antenna with the desired radiation characteristics. The final outcome of this paper is that there exist numbers of UWB antennas, but not each of them is suited for any application, especially in view of radar and communication systems requirements.	existential quantification;radar;requirement;ultra-wideband	Werner Wiesbeck;Grzegorz Adamiuk;Christian Sturm	2009	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2008.2008838	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;reconfigurable antenna;electrical engineering;control theory;frequency domain	Mobile	66.13873831279525	59.62976004965695	43444

Power electronics and particularly continuous power supplies provide an ideal environment to introduce classical control theory. This paper shows a simple way to experimentally obtain the dynamic behavior of DC/DC converters. The required material is quite common in any electronic laboratory: a function generator, a data acquisition card and a PC with some software. A computer application has been developed for the management of the equipment and the signal processing. The system is capable to plot converter gain in magnitude and phase for a configurable range of frequencies between 10Hz and 100 kHz. The resulting instrument is portable, low cost and shows excellent performance. The obtained measurement provides high reliability and it is done in a reasonable time. The system is, therefore, an excellent tool for designing feedback loops for DC/DC converters with switching frequencies up to 1 MHz.	clock rate;control theory;data acquisition;experiment;feedback;personal computer;power electronics;signal processing;switched-mode power supply	Abel Alvarez Alvarez;Hector Andres Mayor;Pedro José Villegas;Alberto Martín-Pernia;Fernando Nuño García;Juan Antonio Martín-Ramos	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793309	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	69.33985238731907	41.562650911026836	43463

The converter comprises two series-connected six-pulse double-wye rectifiers, a step-down transformer, and a tuned input filter. The six-pulse rectifiers are fed from delta and polygon primary windings with different turns ratio and phase shifted by 5/spl deg/. Under the proposed control scheme, one rectifier is kept at nominal output voltage, and the other one is phase controlled to control the load's current. The proposed strategy greatly improves the rectifier's performance, reducing its reactive power maximum demand by 62% compared to conventional rectifiers and, therefore, reduces the input filters power rating also by 62%. This is accomplished while keeping the input power factor above 0.95 throughout the whole operating range. Further, the converter's reactive power consumption presents a low varying characteristic, allowing it to use a fixed filter, even when operating from a power system not capable of withstanding large reactive power variations. Finally, it presents a harmonic current distortion comparable to conventional 12-pulse high-current rectifiers. This paper presents the design and optimization procedure of the rectifying system. A 2.5 kVA laboratory prototype was used to validate the converter model, later employed in evaluating the converter operating in a 10.5 MVA copper electrowinning facility.

These techniques will be demonstrated by applying it on a part of CMOS mobile-TV receiver. This paper mainly focuses on designing a low pass filter, consisting of two cascaded parts. The first part is Frequency Dependent Negative Resistance (FDNR) based third-order noise shaped pre-filter section, which has DC gain of 80dB, with cutoff frequency of 818KHz and input referred noise voltage power spectral density of 5.2nV/sqrt(Hz). The second part is Asymmetric Floating Frequency Dependent Negative Resistance (AFFDNR) based feedback network, which is a part of instrumentation amplifier. It has DC gain of 20dB, with cutoff frequency of 765KHz and input referred noise voltage power spectral density of 83nV/sqrt(Hz). These two filters depend on CMOS op amp which has DC gain of 82dB, with unity gain bandwidth of 319MHz, phase margin of 61° and power dissipation of 428μW. This CMOS op amp is designed based on 0.25μm CMOS technology with power supply of ±1.5V.	cmos;dvb-h;erewhon;instrumentation amplifier;low-pass filter;multiple encryption;noise shaping;operational amplifier;phase margin;power supply;spectral density;television set;topology (electrical circuits)	Soliman A.

Research on this problem has been presented at several international WPT conferences (in Japan [3], Canada [4], Spain [5] and Moscow [6]). One of the main theoretical problems is the synthesis of optimal antenna systems, including both the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. Theoretical results have been presented for continuous apertures. Gaussian field distribution in the aperture of a round or square transmitting antenna is well known [7—8]. This distribution is optimal because the Gaussian function is an eigenfunction of the Fourier transformation. Recently, reports [3—6] and articles [9—12] have asserted the preference of using discontinuous apertures for optimal construction of transmitting antennas for the WPT. From the physical point of view, this claim is based on the fact that a discontinuous antenna of a given area, being divided into several parts dispersed in space, has greater directivity (i.e., the main beam is narrower). Actually, the size of the focal spot is decreased by increasing the whole transmitting antenna length, which increases the portion of energy that is intercepted by the receiving antenna when its configuration is fixed. But the discontinuous excitation of the transmitting antenna leads to an increased level of dispersed energy (sidelobes). An optimum configuration exists, which is examined in detail below. Various methods may be used for the solution of the aforesaid synthesis problem when a template for the directed pattern presents methods for determining the amplitude and phase distribution of currents that produce the desired field distribution in the near field. The developed methods are analogous to traditional methods of antenna synthesis. However, there are peculiarities that are connected with the three-dimensional (not two-dimensional) problem for the near field distribution. For the three-dimension problem we must take into consideration that under the integral describing the field on the receiving side there is a product of terms, which shows the wave beam focusing. That circumstance requires us to use either the Bessel function if we have the round radiating aperture or the field distribution on both directions if we have the square aperture. The synthesis theory of antenna radiating systems on the far-field directive pattern is a mature area of experimental electrodynamics and antenna theory. It is presented in many well-known books. However, the systematic theory and methods of antenna system synthesis of the near-field radiation distribution are absent. The synthesis problem is stated here and several methods for the solution are developed [6, 9].

38681b9b2cd6995c87104ec60949dd367721edd7	planar phase gradient metasurface antenna with low rcs		A low radar cross section (RCS) planar antenna using phase gradient metasurface is proposed in this paper. The proposed antenna works in the  ${X}$ -band and is fed by a parallel plate waveguide power divider. The designed phase gradient metasurface is coplanar with the feeding structure and couples guided waves in the parallel plate waveguide power divider to radiation waves. According to the generalized reflection law, the proposed metasurface is a frequency scanning antenna and the beam direction can be steered slightly from 16.6° to 13°. The proposed antenna is linearly polarized, and however, the RCS is reduced significantly for arbitrary polarized incident waves. The antenna was simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measurement results confirm well with the simulation results.

7fa13cea665ae087c42a4a1d248f701d8e418f1a	investigation of the effect of weak non-linearities on p1db and efficiency of class b/j/j* amplifiers		The variation of phase of the current through the non-linear intrinsic capacitances of a high-power RF device caused by the variation of the phase in the continuum of drain voltage waveforms in Class B/J/J* leads to a reduction of intrinsic drain current when moving from class B to class J* while the drain current increases from class B to class J. Consequently, a subset of voltage waveforms of the class B/J/J* continuum can be used to design amplifiers with higher P1dB, and efficiency at P1dB than in Class B. A simple choice of this subset is demonstrated with a 2.6 GHz Class B/J/J* amplifier, achieving a P1dB of 38.1 dBm and PAE at P1dB of 54.7%, the highest output power and efficiency at P1dB amongst narrowband linear amplifiers using the CGH40010 reported to date, at a comparable peak PAE of 72%.	amplifier;dbm;nonlinear system;physical address extension;prototype;radio frequency;triune continuum paradigm	Nagaditya Poluri;Maria Merlyne De Souza	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2018.2810944	control theory;voltage;electronic engineering;dbm;narrowband;amplifier;linear amplifier;mathematics;capacitance	Arch	64.7183284623402	53.04561613948812	43760

This system covers the frequency band from 1.68 GHz to 2.25 GHz with a minimum bandwidth of 570 MHz. This relatively low frequency operation is unique to this design for DF, as most of the available design covers high frequency bands above 2 GHz. In addition, a major contribution of this optimized design is 40% reduction in the total area compared with the closest design. Moreover, the proposed system is distinctive as it is capable of finding the direction in both elevation and azimuth planes. This six-port design is realized on a dielectric substrate area of 65 × 65 × 1.28 mm3.	direction finding;frequency band	Rifaqat Hussain;Mohammad S.

Phase and gain mismatches among mixing paths, typical for nanoscale technology nodes, severely impact the achievable rejection ratio in classical harmonic rejection transceivers. This paper proposes an alternative digital intensive architecture, which enables increased harmonic interference rejection for wide-band SDR transceivers impacted by severe gain and phase mismatches. A generic mathematical framework of the target architecture is introduced to support a systematic design space exploration for multi-path harmonic interference rejection transceivers. With the framework, an iterative on-die estimation and compensation of mismatch for both the transmitter and receiver are presented. Case study with four mixing paths shows that ideal rejection can be achieved when targeting a single dominating harmonic interferer, and joint suppression of the 3rd and 5th order harmonic interferers of at least 70 dB can be obtained under realistic radio input scenarios.	built-in self-test;coefficient;design space exploration;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);iteration;multipath propagation;quintic function;rejection sampling;transceiver;transmitter;zero suppression	Chunshu Li;Min Li;Marian Verhelst;André Bourdoux;Liesbet Van der Perre;Sofie Pollin	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2014.2348054	estimation;electronic engineering;calibration;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;baseband;mathematics;radio frequency;transceiver	Visualization	58.44672805194605	58.98560054830976	43887

Fuel cell systems are often low voltage systems. The key requirements of a boost converter for such application are need of high-voltage. The second-order low-pass filter is often used to filter the high frequency current ripple. It is known that the interaction between the poorly damped filter with the converter leads to degradation of dynamic performance and instability of the system. This paper addresses a novel wide stability control strategy to solve this problem without increasing the weight and size. In this paper, the mathematical model of the system is built. The dynamic stability of the system is investigated based on root locus and Lyapunov first method. The simulation results are reported to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.	boost converter;control theory;elegant degradation;instability;locus;low-pass filter;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;privacy-enhanced electronic mail;requirement;ripple effect;simulation	Shengzhao Pang;Yigeng Huangfu;Babak Nahid-Mobarakeh;Fei Gao	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793181	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	65.87115972507478	39.19207259315706	43890

The converting speed of level shifter is improved by using the coupling capacitors and the cross-coupled transistor pairs.

It performs decimation on the oversampling delta-sigma modulator output in several stages by utilizing the commutative rule. Each stage performs very simple FIR filtering and decimates the output by a factor of 2. A novel bit-serial design based on this algorithm is then presented. It features regularity and area and power-consumption efficiency. It also provides the possibility of higher frequency operation than existing designs. As an example, a comb filter of the response sinc3(f) with a decimation ratio 32 has been designed in AMS' 1 μm double-metal CMOS process. It contains only 4500 transistors even by using standard static gates and occupies about 1.1 mm2 active chip area.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;comb filter;decimation (signal processing);delta-sigma modulation;finite impulse response;oversampling;recursion (computer science);serial communication;transistor;vhdl-ams	Nianxiong Tan;Sven Eriksson;Lars Wanhammar	1994		10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409246	control engineering;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics	EDA	58.59989080315006	50.994474639762956	44071

2a5c3575f7450874168a5f40856965e97ca86d6c	a new design methodology of a triband pi-network based on multiresonant networks		In a large number of multiband/multistandard applications, it is necessary to design matching networks that are capable of concurrently synthesizing impedances at different frequencies. In order to obtain this functionality, this paper presents a method based on multiresonant networks that is capable of providing impedance matching for frequency-dependent complex loads to the reference impedance \(Z_o\), normally 50 \(\Omega \). The capacity of multiresonant networks to generate an open circuit and a short circuit condition is used to respectively remove and insert inductors/capacitors in the network, and change the impedance generated by the matching network. To evaluate the potential of this proposal, triband matching networks operating at 915 MHz, 1.8 and 2.4 GHz were designed and evaluated from post-layout simulation results. According to the results, the target impedances were generated with reflection coefficients smaller than 0.2 and insertion losses less than 1 dB, which is acceptable in most RF applications. These results corroborate the potential of the proposal for the design of triband networks.		Fabricio G. S.

It is an intelligent technique for generating equivalent gyrator circuits utilizing Second Generation Current Conveyor (CCII) as well as Transconductance Amplifier (TA) circuits. The proposed algorithm is based on the pathological representation of the active blocks. As illustrations to demonstrate the systematic realization of gyrator-GA, a fifth-order Butterworth lowpass filter is designed and simulated using PSPICE.	genetic algorithm;gyrator	Nariman A.

The discovery of electronic-grade 2-D crystals has added a new “layer” to the list of conventional semiconductors used for transistors. This paper discusses the properties of 2-D crystals by comparing them with their 3-D counterparts. Their suitability for electronic devices is discussed. In particular, the use of graphene and other 2-D crystals for interband tunneling transistors is discussed for low-power logic applications. Since tunneling phenomenon in reduced dimensions is not conventionally covered in texts, the physics is developed explicitly before applying it to transistors. Though we are in an early stage of learning to design devices with 2-D crystals, they have already been the motivation behind a list of truly novel ideas. This paper reviews a number of such ideas.	graphene;low-power broadcasting;semiconductor;transistor;tunneling protocol	Debdeep Jena	2013	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2013.2253435	electronic engineering;nanotechnology;crystal;graphene;graphene nanoribbons;physics	Visualization	56.31266094765166	35.22927106365545	44413

The GZTC-C filter definition is used in this paper as a Transconductance-Capacitor filter (Gm-C) in which its gm stage is biased exactly on transconductance zero-temperature (GZTC) bias condition. This special bias point has all necessary conditions to design MOSFET transconductors with low temperature dependence. Additionally, two calibrate-points with three-bit resolution have been added to mitigate process variations which may cause bias shift errors on sensitive nodes, driving the circuit out of its normal GZTC operation region. The final circuit has been designed in a 130 nm CMOS process generating a 5 MHz cutoff frequency. The filter occupies around 0.01 mm2 of silicon area while consuming just 21 μW. Monte Carlo (MC) post-layout and post-calibrated simulation has presented an Effective Cutoff Frequency Temperature Co-efficient (TCeff) average of 73.4 ppm/°C with 30.6 ppm/°C standard deviation for a temperature range from -40 to +120°C and has estimated a cutoff frequency fabrication sensitivity of σ/μ = 0.87%, including average process and local mismatch variability.	ansi c;biasing;cmos;coefficient;maximum power transfer theorem;monte carlo method;power supply;simulation;spatial variability	Pedro Toledo;Rene Timbo;David Cordova;Hamilton Klimach;Sergio Bampi;Eric E.

People usually employ phase-interpolation approaches to generate a pulse or clock with correct time intervals. This work proposes a new phase-interpolation DDS scheme, which uses the output of the phase accumulator to provide an initial voltage on an integration capacitor by pre-charging in the first phase, and then performs integration operation on the same integration capacitor in the second phase. By using single capacitor integration, the instability of the delay generator existed in the phase-interpolation DDS can be avoided, and the impact caused by capacitance error in the circuit implementation also can be reduced. Furthermore, without ROM tables, the proposed DDS using pre-charging integration not only reduces the spurious level of the clock output, but also has a low hardware complexity. key words: direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDS), phase accumulator, phase interpolation, pre-charging integration, delay time error	accumulator (computing);clock generator;digital clock manager;frequency synthesizer;instability;interpolation;normalized frequency (unit);numerically controlled oscillator	Hsin-Chuan Chen	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e91-c.7.1151	electronic engineering;clock angle problem;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;clock skew;interpolation;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;clock drift;synchronous circuit;digital clock manager;cpu multiplier	EDA	70.25104586411959	44.739590640538864	44469

Unlike buck-down type harvesters, the voltage-doubling charge pump of EscaCap enables the sensor nodes to operate under low ambient power conditions. The supercapacitors in the RSA can be dynamically configured for series or parallel topologies by means of a switch array for not only minimizing leakage of the supercapacitors but also improving the charging speed. Furthermore, the RSA of EscaCap is modular and can be easily expanded. Experimental results show that EscaCap can harvest energy efficiently under low and high solar irradiation conditions, achieve shorter charging time, and demonstrate flexibility and robustness.	charge pump;maximum power transfer theorem;nested set model;period-doubling bifurcation;spectral leakage;voltage doubler	Sehwan Kim;Pai H.

Two types of induction generator: single-cage and double-cage based wind farms are considered. The wind farms are connected to modified IEEE First Benchmark and IEEE Second Benchmark System. Detailed positive sequence model of the study systems are developed and frequency scanning is carried out by calculating effective impedance looking from the rotor circuit of the induction generators. It is found that induction generator based wind farms are quite susceptible to SSR due to induction generator effect when they are connected to IEEE First Benchmark System. In this case, SSR may occur at realistic levels of series compensation if the wind farms employ double-cage induction generators. Incidentally, no SSR phenomenon is found in wind farms which are connected to IEEE Second Benchmark System. The frequency scanning results are compared and validated with eigenvalue analysis. Hence, frequency scanning technique can be successfully utilized for initial investigation of any potential for SSR in wind farms connected to a series compensated transmission line.	benchmark (computing);characteristic impedance;ibm power systems;r.o.t.o.r.;resonance;sensor;transmission line	Shubham Gupta;Akshaya Moharana;Rajiv K.

Harvesting ambient vibration energy through piezoelectric (PE) means is a popular energy harvesting technique that can potentially supply 10 to 100's of µW of available power [1]. One of the limitations of existing PE harvesters is in their interface circuitry. Commonly used full-bridge rectifiers and voltage doublers [2] severely limit the electrical power extractable from a PE harvesting element. Further, the power consumed in the control circuits of these harvesters reduces the amount of usable electrical power. In this paper, a bias-flip rectifier that can improve upon the power extraction capability of existing full-bridge rectifiers by up to 4.2× is presented. An efficient control circuit with embedded DC-DC converters that can share their filter inductor with the bias-flip rectifier thereby reducing the volume and component count of the overall solution is demonstrated.	cost efficiency;dc-to-dc converter;diode bridge;electronic circuit;embedded system;handheld game console;piezoelectricity;power management;rectifier	Yogesh K.

This paper presents an ultra-low power LNA with RF performance exceeding the requirement of the intended application. By reusing the current several times and employing passive gm boosting, the LNA input impedance is reduced by a factor of 24 compared to a single transistor using the same current. The resulting power consumption is only 30μW from a 0.8V supply. Simulation results in 40nm TSMC CMOS technology show NF of 3.3dB and gain of 14.2dB at 2.4GHz.

The LNA exploits a noise cancellation technique which allows for simultaneous wide-band impedance matching and low noise design. The matching and amplifier stages in the LNA topology perform single-ended to differential signal conversion with balanced output. The second and third-order nonlinearity of the individual amplifiers as well as the distortion caused by the interaction between the stages are suppressed to achieve high IIP2 and IIP3. A method for intrinsic cancellation of the second-order interaction is employed to reduce the dependence of the IIP3 on the frequency spacing between the interfering signals in the two-tone test of DTV tuners. Fabricated in a 0.18µm CMOS technology, the LNA core size is 0.21mm2. Measurements show that the LNA IIP3 and IIP2 are +12dBm and +21dBm, respectively. The IIP3 variation is less than 5dB in the 10MHz to 200MHz frequency spacing range. A voltage gain of 14.5dB and a noise figure below 4dB are achieved in a frequency range from 100MHz to 1GHz. The LNA consumes 11mA from a 1.8V supply voltage.	launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;third-order intercept point	Saeed Saeedi;Seyed Mojtaba Atarodi	2012	IEICE Transactions		effective input noise temperature;electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise temperature;y-factor;engineering;electrical engineering;active noise control;low-noise amplifier;noise figure;physics	Visualization	63.03562831424349	52.803577296244924	44868

The proposed circuit increases the power factor (PF) at the ac input and reduces the ripple current stress on the smoothing capacitor. The basic concept is the arrangement of an active voltage source between the output of the diode bridge and the smoothing capacitor which is controlled in a way that it emulates an ideal smoothing inductor. With this the input currents of the diode bridge which usually show high peak amplitudes are converted into a 120/spl deg/ rectangular shape which ideally results in a total PF of 0.955. The active voltage source mentioned before is realized by a low-voltage switch-mode converter stage of small power rating as compared to the output power of the rectifier. Starting with a brief discussion of basic three-phase rectifier techniques and of the drawbacks of three-phase diode bridge rectifiers with capacitive smoothing, the concept of the proposed active smoothing is described and the stationary operation is analyzed. Furthermore, control concepts as well as design considerations and analyses of the dynamic systems behavior are given. Finally, measurements taken from a laboratory model are presented.	diode bridge;dynamical system;electronic circuit;emulator;rectifier;ripple effect;semiconductor;smoothing;stationary process;voltage source;whole earth 'lectronic link	Hans Ertl;Johann Walter Kolar	2005	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2005.843910	control engineering;electronic engineering;power factor;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;peak inverse voltage;precision rectifier	Visualization	64.2043851572588	41.952402574534965	45172

In the first stage of the proposed method, a parametric technique called autoregressive signal modeling is utilized to extract signal features from voltage and current signals at the point of common coupling with the grid. In the second stage, advanced machine learning technique based on support vector machine, which takes calculated features as inputs is utilized to predict islanding state. The extensive study is performed on the IEEE 13 bus system and feature vectors corresponding to various islanding and nonislanding conditions are used for support vector machine classifier training and testing. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately detect system islanding operation mode 50 ms after the event starts. Further, the robustness of the proposed method is analyzed by examining its performances in the systems with multiple distributed generations, and when system loading condition, grid disturbance types, and characteristics are altered.	autoregressive model;broadcast delay;coefficient;electric power quality;machine learning;performance;phase inversion;power inverter;simulation;support vector machine;transfer function	Biljana Matic Cuka;Mladen Kezunovic	2014	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2014.2338736	electronic engineering;engineering;machine learning;pattern recognition	EDA	69.44535647497433	36.32920659371386	45174

Understanding these effects is especially critical in evaluating communications systems used during normal mining operations and during mine emergencies. One of these types of communications systems relies on medium-frequency (MF) radio frequencies. This paper presents the simulation and measurement results of recent National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) research aimed at investigating MF coupling between a transmission line (TL) and a loop antenna in an underground coal mine. Two different types of measurements were completed: 1) line-current distribution and 2) line-to-antenna coupling. Measurements were taken underground in an experimental coal mine and on a specially designed surface test area. The results of these tests are characterized by current along a TL and voltage induced in the loop from a line. This paper concludes with a discussion of issues for MF TLs. These include electromagnetic fields at the ends of the TL, connection of the ends of the TL, the effect of other conductors underground, and the proximity of coal or earth. These results could help operators by providing examples of these challenges that may be experienced underground and a method by which to measure voltage induced by a line.	antenna device component;coal;emergencies [disease/finding];etoposide/ifosfamide/mesna/mitoxantrone;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hearing loss, high-frequency;national institute for occupational safety and health (u.s.);radio frequency;simulation;software propagation;transform, clipping, and lighting;transmission line device component;transport layer security;negative regulation of myofibroblast contraction;voltage	Nicholas W.

1f17115f0e79341e0bbb59ad38ed43bb0ab866d2	a 3rd order mash switched-capacitor σδm using ultra incomplete settling employing an area reduction technique		This paper describes a switched capacitor, 3rd order MASH 2-1 ΣΔ modulator, for signals with a bandwidth of 20kHz, using passive integrators implemented based on the ultra incomplete settling (UIS) concept. The UIS concept requires RC time constant values much larger than the clock period. Due to the low signal bandwidth the clock frequency is 10 MHz, which would result in large resistors and capacitors that would occupy a large area. The proposed circuit uses monostable circuits to reduce the active time of the clock signals, reducing the area occupied by the resistors and capacitors. Electrical transient noise simulations of the complete ΣΔ circuit show that the modulator achieves a peak SNDR of 92.06 dB, an ENOB of 15 bits and a DR of 111.4 dB for a signal bandwidth of 20 kHz, while dissipating 86 μW from a 1.1 V power supply voltage, resulting in a FOMW of 65.6 fJ/conv.-step and a FOMs of 176 dB.	bandwidth (signal processing);clock rate;effective number of bits;modulation;monostable;open-source religion;passive optical network;power supply;rc time constant;rf modulator;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);simulation;switched capacitor;transient noise	David Fouto;Nuno Paulino	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050370	electronic engineering;capacitor;computer science;effective number of bits;resistor;clock rate;multivibrator;switched capacitor;rc time constant;electronic circuit;electrical engineering	EDA	60.479314894967466	50.96820752198547	45193
ef936f1c18425c913714f128192474aaa405c9b9	voltage quality improvement in smart transformer integrated distribution grid		With increased penetration of renewable energy sources in electric grid, maintaining quality voltage at the load terminal has become a challenge. Voltage disturbances like sag, swell, harmonics, etc., can propagate from one section to another section of electric grid and degrade the performance of sensitive loads. This paper explores the capability of smart transformer (ST) to improve the voltage quality in medium voltage (MV) grid, by replacing one conventional power transformer (CPT) with an ST in a multifeeder electric grid. In addition to supplying ST low voltage loads, the voltage regulation in MV grid is achieved by controlling the reactive current injection to the MV grid. Harmonic damping capability is integrated with the control loop to damp out the grid voltage harmonics. An improved stability of MV grid voltage regulation control is achieved in the presence of harmonic damping loop and this is verified with theoretical analysis. Extensive simulation study is carried out to validate the ST features.	cpt (file format);control system;coupling (computer programming);electric power supplies;isolate compound;logical volume management;power supply;rectifier;simulation;smart card;sodium fluoride 0.221 mg/ml mouthwash [listerine];transformer;voltage regulation	V.

The starting point is an energy function comprising the kinetic energy associated with the elements that emulate the rotating machinery and terms taking into account the reactive power stored in the lines and dissipated on shunt elements. We then shape this energy function with the addition of an adjustable voltage-dependent term, and construct incremental storage functions satisfying suitable dissipation inequalities. Our choice of the voltage-dependent term depends on the voltage dynamics/controller under investigation. Several microgrids dynamics that have similarities or coincide with dynamics already considered in the literature are captured in our incremental energy analysis framework. The twist with respect to existing results is that our incremental storage functions allow for an analysis of the coupled microgrid obviating the need for simplifying linearization techniques and for the restrictive decoupling assumption in which the frequency dynamics is fully separated from the voltage one.	coupling (computer programming);lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;microgrid;modular design	Claudio De Persis;Nima Monshizadeh	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810502	mathematical optimization;simulation;control theory;mathematics	EDA	64.07621038960735	40.31840593497315	45222

be9a7162a44c8bfef1f5113e159fc7cd45da1e3e	fair arbitration for multi-instrument space probe		Multi-instrument based modern measuring devices have to deal with continuous and irregular data streams from the sensors. Usually remote measuring devices have to transmit data to another location through a single transmitter. Hence, there is a need for a Fair/non-greedy Arbiter, which guarantees transmitter bandwidth to all channels without allowing a single channel to dominate the bandwidth. The data from each instrument has to be interfaced to the Arbiter through a buffer to prevent data loss before being granted the bandwidth for transmission. An integrated circuit of such a system was designed in TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology for a Space Probe.	arbiter (electronics);bandwidth (signal processing);cmos;clock signal;greedy algorithm;integrated circuit;metastability in electronics;sensor;transmitter	Girish A.

2197304c96504a9a126cff5c312cd1b1bf0ab3e8	deadbeat control strategy for circulating current suppression in multiparalleled three-level inverters		This paper proposes a zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) control scheme for the multiparalleled three-level T-type inverters (3LT2Is). Based on the analysis with the proposed generalized model of multiparalleled 3LT2Is, it is seen that the ZSCC is influenced by the circuit parameters, duty cycles, and the circulating currents of the l th and first 3LT2I. To mitigate the circulating currents, a deadbeat control strategy for n-paralleled (n≥3) inverters is proposed, which is realized by adjusting the duty cycle of the small vectors in each PWM sampling period. Compared with the conventional PI control method, the ZSCC spike is mitigated with the proposed scheme, thus improving the quality of the output currents. Also, the reliability of the 3LT2Is system is improved because such a scheme only needs the information about the ZSCC and zero-sequence duty ratio in the l th and the first inverter. The proposed method can also be applied to the neutral-point-clamped converters. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed method.	control theory;duty cycle;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;pulse-width modulation;sampling (signal processing);simulation;zero suppression	Xiangyang Xing;Chenghui Zhang;Alian Chen;Hua Geng;Changwei Qin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2786234	pi;control engineering;control theory;sampling (signal processing);engineering;duty cycle;inverter;pulse-width modulation	EDA	65.99926716907171	39.683990259696195	45360

These discontinuities do not represent a real physiological perception of flicker, but they are a consequence of the nonlinear behavior of blocks 1, 4, and 5 of the IEC flickermeter. We have theoretically proved the origin of these discontinuities, and we have experimentally identified and quantified them. Although these discontinuities do not influence the Pst values recorded in the field, they are an intrinsic characteristic of the flickermeter model proposed in the IEC 61000-4-15 standard. This paper contributes to a better understanding of how the IEC flickermeter works when subject to rectangular fluctuations. Furthermore, the identification and quantification of these discontinuities can help to improve the design of the performance tests of the flickermeter.	experiment;flicker (screen);iso/iec 27002;nonlinear system;quantum fluctuation	Jesús Ruiz;J.

By improving folded cascode with an additional inductance connected at the gate of CG stage to cancel parasitic capacitance and then employing capacitor cross-coupled technique as a negative feedback in the proposed LNA, the performance of the LNA can be improved significantly in terms of gain (S21) and noise figure (NF) compared with the conventional fold cascode LNA. Furthermore, the DC power consumption of the LNA is further reduced with forward body bias topology. The measurements show the proposed LNA achieves 16.5 dB power gain, a NF of 1.53 dB, good input/output matching with the S11 and S22 are less than $$-$$ - 15 dB.

Both arrays are simulated with a full-wave solver, while the three-element array is fabricated and measured. Impedance match at the operating frequency is consistently maintained, as the resonance is controlled by tunable reactive loading.

Many research groups and researchers have developed different enhancements in 308 MHz band but no research has been done so far using LANDMARC in the internationally free to use 2.4 GHz Band. Using open source active RFID technology we describe our approach of adopting the LANDMARC system for 2.4 GHz band and what the main challenges are. As being open source hard- and software, our RFID tags can be flashed with individual firmware. Therefore, we used one that enables our tags not only to identify themselves to the readers, but also between each other -- a feature we additionally used to adopt the LANDMARC system.	firmware;open-source software;positioning system;radio-frequency identification	Stephan Bergemann;Jürgen Sieck	2011	2011 UKSim 5th European Symposium on Computer Modeling and Simulation	10.1109/EMS.2011.55	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Embedded	65.53409690012387	59.8515707071141	45719
b70fc7bbb5c81f537045bff11bb211567fb94e26	coil array design for maximizing wireless power transfer to sub-mm sized implantable devices		One of the main challenges for the deployment of sub-mm sized implantable device is the limit on the power that can be transmitted to these devices through inductive link. We first obtain the optimal sizing of the coils in the link and the maximum power that can be delivered to a 300 pm × 300 pm using single transmitting coil at operating frequency of 1.1 GHz. To increase the delivered power, we introduce and optimize the design of phased coil array at the transmitting side taking into account the safety limits. By adding a single coil we achieve a gain of 1.43 dB in the delivered power, while with the addition of four transmitting coils, the power that can be delivered to the implantable device is increased by 4.3 dB and reaches 10.6 μW.	brain implant;clock rate;decibel;iteration;maximum power transfer theorem;phased array;software deployment;tesla coil;transmitter	Yasha Karimi;Adam Khalifa;Webert Montlouis;Milutin Stanacevic;Ralph Etienne-Cummings	2017	2017 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)	10.1109/BIOCAS.2017.8325219	electromagnetic coil;system on a chip;maximum power principle;single coil;wireless power transfer;electronic engineering;computer science	EDA	60.921132163677704	53.818903737047975	45816

Using a Nyquist DAC to cover the entire signal spectrum is thus unnecessary, as this trades the achievable dynamic range with the bandwidth. For such applications, a narrowband Nyquist DAC followed by a mixer, RF mixing DAC [1], or exploiting higher Nyquist zones [2] are typically adopted; these are either limited by deliverable output power or nearby spectral images due to lower input data rates. A dual-rate hybrid DAC [3] uses a delta-sigma modulated LSB path to compensate for the non-idealities of the Nyquist path, allowing high linearity and a low noise floor within the Nyquist band while limiting out-of-band quantization noise. Still, this only synthesizes the baseband signal and is difficult when covering wide RF spectra due to the DSM OSR requirements.	agile software development;baseband;channelization (telecommunications);delta-sigma modulation;high-throughput computing;least significant bit;noise floor;nyquist rate;open-source religion;out-of-band agreement;pure function;quantization (signal processing);radio frequency;requirement;spectral density;spurious-free dynamic range;throughput;transmitter	Shiyu Su;Mike Shuo-Wei Chen	2018	2018 IEEE International Solid - State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2018.8310334	noise floor;delta-sigma modulation;electronic engineering;computer science;modulation;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;quantization (signal processing);spurious-free dynamic range;baseband;bandwidth (signal processing)	EDA	60.55493306321306	57.86320066396846	46032

The generator is designed to be unobtrusive to the user by embedding it within the thickness of a normal shoe sole, and by applying a passive generation principle which requires minimal additional force over that normally exerted by the user during walking. In this way, a portion of the power used in walking is harvested for potential use in powering portable electronic devices. Analysis of different geometrical and material properties is applied to identify conditions for optimized designs; average power levels of up to 14 mW (200 mW of instantaneous power) are demonstrated within a volume of 15 × 15 × 100 mm3 at a walking speed of 2 steps per second. At least two of these volumes can be easily accommodated within a shoe heel to provide up to a 56 mW average power per user, and higher power levels can be achieved for faster walking or running speeds.	shoes	D.

One cause is device scaling that results in a sharp reduction of supply voltage, creating stringent noise margin requirements to ensure functionality. This paper introduces both a novel on-chip decoupling capacitance methodology and active noise cancellation (ANC) structure. The decoupling methodology focuses on quantification and location. The ANC structure, with an area of 50 ¿m × 55 ¿m, uses decoupling capacitance to sense noise and inject a proportional current into VSS as a method of reduction. A chip has been designed and fabricated using TSMC's 90-nm technology. Measurements show that the decoupling methodology improved the average voltage headroom loss by 17% while the ANC structure improved the average voltage headroom loss by 18%.	coupling (computer programming);headroom (audio signal processing);image scaling;location (geography);noise margin;power supply;requirement;signal integrity	Eric Bohannon;Christopher Urban;Mark Pude;Yoshinori Nishi;Anand Gopalan;Ponnathpur R.

For this purpose accurate prediction of the device-level power loss is a prerequisite. The core compact modeling approach is presented, which can be easily extended to include non-ideal effects to be considered. With use of the developed model it is demonstrated that any phenomena, which prevent the gate control, become the origin of an increased power loss. An optimization scheme for achieving low power loss, based on the presented compact modeling approach, is discussed with basic circuits.	circuit design;mathematical optimization	Mitiko Miura-Mattausch;Hideyuki Kikuchihara;Takuya Kajiwara;Yuta Tanimoto;Atsushi Saito;Takahiro Iizuka;Douglas Navarro;Hans Jürgen Mattausch	2018	2018 48th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)	10.1109/ESSDERC.2018.8486858	electronic engineering;mosfet;semiconductor device modeling;electronic circuit;materials science;logic gate;circuit design	EDA	59.91730320791921	43.123376144255694	46281

dc5463702c19fd044d489690ed991bcad3e2b4c0	recent advances in mode-division multiplexed transmission using few-mode fibers		We review recent advances in few-mode fiber transmission. DSP complexity and mode-dependent gain (MDG) control are two key implementation issues. While DSP may be reduced by managing differential modal group dispersion (DMGD) and by using frequency-domain equalization, complexity still grows super-linearly with number of modes. MDG arises in inline amplifiers and can be controlled to a certain degree by optimizing the doping profile. The use of mode scrambling may ultimately be the most effective way of combatting both problems by enabling DMGD and MDG to grow only as the square root of distance. FMF are most likely to be deployed in data-centers that can benefit from high spatial information density. Elliptical-core FMFs is an attractive solution that behaves physically like parallel single-mode fibers.	amplifier;complexity;concatenation;doping (semiconductor);earliest deadline first scheduling;fm broadcasting;information design;mdl (programming language);mimo;modal logic;mode coupling;multiplexing;scrambler	Ezra Ip	2017	2017 Twenty-third National Conference on Communications (NCC)	10.1109/NCC.2017.8077066	fiber optic sensor;plastic optical fiber;telecommunications;multi-mode optical fiber;electronic engineering;dispersion (optics);amplifier;polarization-maintaining optical fiber;fiber-optic communication;computer science;multiplexing	EDA	63.07716397737154	58.147907966384984	46353

Wireless power transfer (WPT) is realized by using a 4-coil resonant inductive link at 8.6 MHz at a separation distance of 10 mm, which is the average human scalp thickness. Downlink communication at 10 kbps is performed on the same frequency as the WPT by ASK modulation. Uplink communication at 1.8 Mbps which carries digitized neural data is realized by using an integrated transmitter and a discrete receiver in 426-432 MHz band. The transmitter is composed of a cross-coupled symmetrical LC voltage controlled oscillator which is brought to resonance with a loop antenna instead of an integrated inductor. The loop antenna serves also for radiation.	amplitude-shift keying;brain implant;data rate units;modulation;resonance;telecommunications link;thickness (graph theory);transmitter;voltage-controlled oscillator	Gürkan Yilmaz;Catherine Dehollain	2014	2014 IEEE 12th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2014.6934082	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	64.69043337324858	54.65045666936299	46391

Hence, no special fabrication process such as those used for CCD imagers is required.

By applying continuous improvement methods to the elements of the United States power grid, the Initiative hopes to achieve the universal adoption of a system design that successfully meets the power needs of every consumer. Currently at a “tipping point” in its need for a more efficient and reliable electric power system, the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) collaborated with the Galvin Electricity Initiative, S&C Electric, Endurant Energy and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) to explore system renewal. The team utilized quality principals to design a prototype “Perfect Power” system for the IIT campus.

6a9c154ef56c4df2dcbf7ceb33ed01757a27ae85	optimized use of pv distributed generation in voltage regulation: a probabilistic formulation		This paper proposes a probabilistic optimiz-ation strategy for optimized use of Photovoltaic (PV) generators in distribution networks voltage regulation. Probabilistic PV output scenarios are incorporated in a constrained optimal load flow planning analysis for a given distribution network to minimize a voltage deviation index indicative of the quality of voltage regulation. The proposed strategy utilizes the PV generators as capacitors and inductors, whose reactive power compensation is monthly scheduled in coordination with the high-voltage/medium-voltage (HV/MV) substation on-load tap changer setting. The proposed strategy does not rely on a communication infrastructure nor does it comprise feedback voltage control. Physical solar irradiance and ambient temperature measurements are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on two detailed North-American MV distribution networks (25 kV and 12.66 kV). The results are validated by two distribution load flow calculation algorithms: backward/forward sweep in a MATLAB script; and the harmonic load flow solver in OpenDSS.		Moataz Ammar;Adel M.

We propose the 256-level currents to control LED brightness with 8-bit binary code. Based on current mirror theory, a switchable current is controlled by 8-switch current mirror arrays. To prolong the lifespan of LED driver, four order of the temperature sensor is proposed to control LED driving current. The diode is used as temperature sensor. In order to protect over heating of LED driver, the four sensing levels are used to control LED current. The over voltage protection is also designed to avoid to damage power MOS of this chip. With full-costumed design, the chip area included pads is only 1.87  mm 2 using TSMC 0.25  μm high-voltage technology. The single chip can drive 72 W LED devices in maximum when the LED driving current is 1.2 A and the supply voltage is 60 V. The 256-step current levels are used for LED dimming, where the resolution of current to luminance can achieve 1 mA. The maximum driving efficiency can be up to 98%, and our lighting efficiency can be improved by 20% compared with switching modulation.

The proposed filter, which employs two FDCCIIs, two grounded capacitors and two NMOS transistors, provides electronic tunability with the control voltage applied to the gate. NMOS transistors act as linear resistor. Furthermore, the proposed circuit still enjoys realization using a low number of active and passive components, no requirement with the component choice conditions to realize specific filtering functions, high input impedance, and low active and passive sensitivities performance.

Through its programmable row-by-row or column-by-column operations for both transmit and receive beam-formation, linear scaling in interconnection, data acquisition complexity, power dissipation, and programming time is achieved. In addition, its per-element controllers can activate fine granularity aperture definition when more functionality is favored over the linear-scaling power and speed efficiency. This front-end architecture is backward compatible to implement existing widely used array aperture patterns, while supporting new imaging apertures and algorithms. It lends itself very well for the combination with integrated or external digital beamforming circuits. A 16 × 16 proof-of-concept ASIC is fabricated and flip-chip bonded to a 16 × 16 capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT). Each three-level pulsing transmitter (Tx) is 46% more power efficient than a traditional two-level version, with high-voltage (HV) multiplexers (MUXs) designed for flexible Tx parallelization. Each low-noise receiver (Rx) consumes 1.4 mW active power and 54 μW sleep power, with optimized source follower stages to combine analog outputs for improved SNR. The transceivers are also fault-tolerant to inevitable defects in transducers, greatly enhancing assembly yield. The system demonstrates 3-D plane-wave generation to implement the coherent compounding algorithm for fast volume rate (62.5 volume/s), high-quality 3-D ultrasonic imaging. An interleaved checker board pattern with Iand Q excitations is also demonstrated for ultrasonic harmonic imaging, which reduces transmitted second harmonic distortion (HD2) by over 20 dB.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;backward compatibility;beamforming;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;circuit design;coherence (physics);data acquisition;distortion;fault tolerance;flip chip;image scaling;interconnection;medical ultrasound;multiplexer;nonlinear system;parallel computing;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;transceiver;transducer;transmitter	Kailiang Chen;Hae-Seung Lee;Charles Sodini	2016	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2015.2505714	embedded system;aperture;electronic engineering;transducer;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;application-specific integrated circuit;multiplexing;transceiver	Arch	55.475916631655245	50.512201127203475	46900

The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver that uses binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation for a compact and power efficient design. The receiver realizes coherent demodulation using injection locking without a PLL or an external reference clock utilizing a path to inject the received signal into the VCO. The demonstrator achieves 11 Gb/s ASK data transmission over 14 mm using bond-wire antennas with a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10-11. The active footprint of the transmitter is 0.06 mm2 and the power consumption is 29 mW with an energy usage of 6.4 pj/bit per channel. The receiver occupies the active footprint of 0.07 mm2 and consumes 41 mW.

This paper presents a framework for multi-resolution simulation of switching converter circuits by providing an appropriate amount of detail based on the time scale and phenomenon being considered. In this approach, a detailed full-order model that accounts for the higher-order effects of components, parasitics, switching nonlinearity (e.g., saturated inductors), switching event detection, etc., is constructed first. Efficient order-reduction techniques are then used to extract several lower order models for the desired resolution of the simulation. The simulation resolution can be adjusted as needed even during a simulation run time. The state continuity across different resolutions and switching events is ensured using appropriate similarity transforms. The proposed high-fidelity model of converter is verified with hardware measurement and is used to verify different simulation resolutions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated to achieve orders of magnitudes improvement in simulation speed.	binocular disparity;boost converter;diode;linear system;minimal recursion semantics;model order reduction;nonlinear system;power electronics;run time (program lifecycle phase);scott continuity;series and parallel circuits;simulation;switched-mode power supply;wiring	Ali Davoudi;Juri Jatskevich;Patrick L.

A specific test signal called step-ramp signal (SRS) is designed. It accurately corresponds to a reference counter. With multiple gains design, a preamplifier following the CUT makes the output of the CUT larger to ensure that the output of the preamplifier is larger than that of the sampled voltage of the SRS inputted to the CUT. The difference between the output of the preamplifier and sampled voltage of the SRS is matched to a set of reference counter output codes. The ratio extracting from the codes can be simply and accurately calculated with digital circuits. This method is suitable to be implemented with Built-In Self-Test (BIST) structure for features on low chip area overhead and short test time. The demonstration is done by Ispice simulation. The accuracy of all ramp pieces of the SRS are within 0.036% and the method gives high accuracy of ratio measurement.	built-in self-test;clock signal;code;digital electronics;duty cycle;level of measurement;overhead (computing);preamplifier;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;spectral leakage;switched capacitor	Yun-Che Wen	2009	2009 12th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems	10.1109/DDECS.2009.5012113	embedded system;electronic engineering;switched capacitor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;preamplifier	EDA	66.67207869254739	50.020983716423736	47392

In this proposal, an array including N ring resonators is coupled to one arm of MZI to introduce the required nonlinear phase shift to switching. Also, two-photon absorption phenomenon is used and will be proposed as another alternative for manipulation of optical switching properties. The proposed idea needs small chip area (/ 1=Ntraditional cases) for implementation. We show that the switching threshold intensity can be decreased with increase of N, decrease of the coupling coefficient and increase of the two-photon absorption coefficient. In this structure with traditional optical fibers with the low nonlinear index of refractions ð10 18 m=WÞ and using an array including 15 ring resonators with 6mm diameter for each rings only 3mW for the switching threshold power is required. Also, using erbium-doped fiber for implementation of the rings with the high nonlinear index of refractions ð10 15 m=WÞ and five ring resonators including 0.3mm diameter, the switching threshold power can be reduced to mW level. If the nonzero two-photon absorption coefficient is considered, the switching threshold will be very smaller than the above-mentioned values. We show that with changing the optical amplifier gain the switching threshold can be tuned. So, the proposal can be used as a functional block for the integrated optical switch with very small and tunable threshold. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In a phased array system, one or more narrow beams are generated by transmitting (or receiving) a common RF signal that is phase shifted at the output of each antenna in the array such that the direction of the beams can be varied by controlling the phase difference between consecutive antennas. Microwave transceivers for phased-array radar applications have traditionally been fabricated in III–V technologies like GaAs and InP due to their superior ƒT and ƒmax. However, modern-day CMOS and BiCMOS technology nodes are now exhibiting ƒT and ƒmax in the range of 200 to 250GHz, tipping the scales in favor of silicon due to its higher integration capability, lower costs and the availability of significant digital signal processing.

LVDC being a novel approach to public electricity distribution, a research site was set up in a public rural-area distribution network to enable comprehensive studies concerning the LVDC distribution. In a previous journal article by the author, CM and RF EMI were studied with the objectives: (1) to determine whether there are disturbances that exceed the requirements of the standards, or whether the CM current could cause safety issues in the converter-fed user-end network; (2) to discuss the effects of the CM current on the feasibility of power line communication in a dc network; and (3) to analyze the measured RF disturbances. However, standardization is still lacking for the frequency range from 2 to 150 kHz. In this paper, in situ measurements are conducted on the LVDC research site to define the levels of disturbance. The results in the previous journal article were based on the research site with a thyristor bridge rectifier, and when the rectifier was upgraded to a PWM grid-tie rectifying converter, disturbances were measured again. In this paper, these results are analyzed against the previous measurements to define whether additional measures are required. Further, the design and implementation of a CM filter and its effects on the disturbances of the dc network are analyzed.	characteristic impedance;diode bridge;emi;frequency band;interference (communication);modem;pwm rectifier;power-line communication;pulse-width modulation;rf modulator;radio frequency;rectifier;requirement;thyristor;transcranial direct-current stimulation	Pasi Nuutinen;Antti Pinomaa;Pasi Peltoniemi;Tero Kaipia;Janne Karppanen;Pertti Silventoinen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2602845	thyristor;electromagnetic interference;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;pulse-width modulation;radio frequency	Networks	68.91830316154422	53.20029525408084	47823

However, mixed analog-digital BIST (MADBIST) has not yet achieved the same degree of practicality. An accurate analog signal source, as well as circuitry to measure the analog response, must be fabricated onto the chip, and must be self-calibrating. A MADBIST is discussed which could be used for a signal-to-noise ratio test on a chip which includes a digital-to-analog converter, an analog-to-digital converter, and a microprocessor which includes RAM and ROM. The MADBIST strategy for the SNR test is introduced, accuracy issues are discussed, and simulation results are presented. u003e	built-in self-test;mixed-signal integrated circuit;signal-to-noise ratio	Michael F.

The Digital Delta-Sigma Modulator (DΔΣM) is typically used to carry out this function. Unfortunately, divide ratio modulation is a significant component of the PLL phase noise, in particular due to interactions between modulation-induced phase noise and nonlinear loop dynamics. A recently proposed modulator, named the Successive Requantizer, claims to offer better spurious component and phase noise performance compared to the traditional DΔΣM, while offering similar noise-shaping properties. This paper describes a method of deriving the statistical properties of both the modulated control signal and the corresponding phase noise, for given state transition matrices. Convergence of the noise PMF is also described.	delta-sigma modulation;interaction;noise shaping;nonlinear system;phase noise;phase-locked loop;quantization (signal processing)	Yann Donnelly;Michael Peter Kennedy	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2016.7841235	gaussian noise;effective input noise temperature;electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise temperature;quantum noise;noise;control theory;mathematics;noise figure;oscillator phase noise;phase noise	Robotics	66.58523068191583	50.92582812700476	47885
80011881c10f4806b60b307a9793e56398c0245e	feasibility study of superconducting cable application to oil/gas power supply network		Oil/gas plant is one of largest electrical energy consuming facilities, and its electric power distribution network must have high reliability, high efficiency, and, in certain locations, more efficient space utilization. Superconducting cable offers one of the most effective solutions to meet these requirements. However, application of superconducting cable to such a plant has not been reported. In this paper, the static and dynamic performance of a superconducting cable applied to a typical distribution substation feeding an oil/gas planet is investigated. The voltage distribution under steady state operation and the transient voltage and current during fault conditions are examined and compared with conventional cables. It is found that, in addition to improving efficiency, the superconducting cable can be applied without further constraints on circuit breaker duties and insulation coordination requirements. Furthermore, a typical electric power network in the plant is proposed.	computer simulation;power supply;requirement;separation of duties;steady state;traction substation	Junichi Arai;Kohei Higashikawa;Tadashi Koshizuka;Hisatoshi Ikeda;Noureddine Harid;Ahmed Al-Durra	2017	2017 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2017.8101859	transient voltage suppressor;voltage;electric power;direct-buried cable;electric potential energy;supply network;circuit breaker;electric power distribution;electronic engineering;engineering	Arch	63.07401451997047	38.66229948243765	47923

Within that context, a 25-MHz self-referenced solid-state frequency source is presented and demonstrated where measured performance makes it suitable for replacement of crystal oscillators (XOs) in data interface applications. The frequency source is referenced to a frequency-trimmed and temperature-compensated 800-MHz free-running LC oscillator (LCO) that is implemented in a standard logic CMOS process and with no specialized analog process options. Mechanisms giving rise to frequency drift in integrated LCOs are discussed and supported by analytical expressions. Design objectives and a compensation technique are presented where several implementation challenges are uncovered. Fabricated in a 0.25-mum 1P5M CMOS process, and with no external components, the prototype frequency source dissipates 59.4 mW while maintaining plusmn152 ppm frequency inaccuracy over process, plusmn 10% variation in the power supply voltage, and from - 10degC to 80degC. Variation against other environmental factors is also presented. Nominal period jitter and power-on start-up latency are 2.75 psrms and 268 mus, respectively. These performance metrics are compared with an XO at the same frequency.	algorithm;backdrop cms;cmos;crystal oscillator;electronic circuit;frequency drift;lc circuit;liquid crystal on silicon;olpc xo;phase noise;power supply;prototype;requirement	Michael S.

The inverter consists of four legs and two capacitors connected in a series. The 4LI have several disadvantages. First, it is not possible to modulate W phase voltage of the IMs. Second, the neutral point potential of two capacitors fluctuates. Third, motors speed does not come up to the rated speed. This paper shows an expanded two-arm modulation, compensation method and field-weakening control method to solve them. Next, the independent rated speed control of two IMs fed by the 4LI with the field-weakening control system is demonstrated by the experimental results. Moreover, it shows the effectiveness of those methods.	arm architecture;control system;mathematical induction;modulation;power inverter	Yuji Kubo;Takayuki Moroi;Kouki Matsuse;Hisao Kubota;Kaushik Rajashekara	2014	2014 IEEE Industry Application Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2014.6978393	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.91851490984364	39.388197043046944	48347

The chip contains a matrix of 40 × 32 pixels with the size of 100µm × 100µm. Each pixel contains a charge sensitive amplifier, a main amplifier stage, two discriminators with trim DACs and two 16-bit ripple counters. The nominal power consumption per pixel is 42 µW. The effective peaking time at the discriminator input is 28 ns and it is mainly determined by the time constants of the CSA. The gain is equal to 32 µV/e<sup>−</sup> or 64 µV/e<sup>−</sup> in the low and the high gain mode respectively. In the high gain mode the ENC without the detector is 91 e<sup>−</sup> rms and rises to 106 e<sup>−</sup> rms with stud bump-bonded pixel detector. The effective threshold spread at the discriminator input is only 0.76 mV (at one sigma level, with 7-bit trim DACs enabled), which corresponds to a 12 e<sup>−</sup> rms at the input. A dead time in the front-end as low as 117 ns (paralyzable model) can be set. The chip can operate in the continuous readout mode and in readout mode separate from exposure. The ideas of building large area detector using through silicon via is also presented.	16-bit;amplifier;bump mapping;cmos;discriminator;integrated circuit;nominal power (radio broadcasting);pixel;ripple effect;sensor;through-silicon via;very-large-scale integration	Piotr Maj;Pawel Grybos;Robert Szczygiel	2011	2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043373	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;particle detector;physics	EDA	55.39884903762334	49.21250878101629	48458

The proposed LDO utilizes voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as an integrator to replace the conventional voltage-based error amplifier. It reduces the overall area by using only 1.2pF of on-chip capacitor while consuming low quiescent current (<30μA at typical corner). Using time as the processing variable, the time-based error amplifier operates with full-swing CMOS digital like signals without introducing any quantization error. The proposed LDO was designed in TSMC 65nm CMOS LP technology with input and output voltages as 1.2 V and 0.8V-1.1V, respectively, achieving a regulation bandwidth of 3MHz. Settling time of 200ns or less was achieved for 10mA load current step and 0–100pF output load capacitor.	biasing;cmos;error amplifier (electronics);input/output;low-dropout regulator;quantization (signal processing);quiesce;settling time;voltage-controlled oscillator	Qadeer Ahmad Khan;Saurabh Saxena;Abirmoya Santra	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351598	integrator;capacitor;electronic engineering;quantization (signal processing);computer science;control theory;settling time;voltage-controlled oscillator;biasing;amplifier;cmos	Arch	61.336049013033225	49.08437616094522	48557

19bac6fd2c56a25abf3fb06925558eef6b1e4c98	a technique to determine the designable inductance value(s) in wide-band cmos-amplifier system employing shunt-peaking	band edge frequency;bandwidth extension;cmos transimpedance amplifiers;shunt peaking inductance;pole zero placement	This paper presents a technique towards obtaining an estimate of the value of inductor(s) to expand the bandwidth of operation in a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) ampli ̄er system which exploits shunt peaking principle. The basic principle is placement of the zeros of the transfer function in an interleaved manner relative to the uncompensated RC timeconstant frequency (TCF) and the band-edge frequency (BEF) (i.e., product of the poles) of the transfer function. Application of the analytical results has been demonstrated for (i) a commongate (CG) ampli ̄er stage in a 0.18m CMOS process and (ii) an inter-stage inductor coupling network which serves as an interface between two ampli ̄er stages. MATLAB simulation has been used to obtain the range of design inductance values. The TSMC 180-nm CMOS process has been used in Cadence CAD environment to validate the theoretical predictions. The inductors laid out have been modeled using the ASITIC program to obtain more realistic results. The proposed technique provides a bandwidth extension of the CMOS common-gate ampli ̄er from 6.68GHz to 10.4GHz with 1 dB peaking using only a 1.85-nH inductor. For the inter-stage coupling network, the suggested design procedure leads to a bandwidth extension ratio (BWER) exceeding three, with less than 3-dB ripple.	amplifier;bandwidth extension;bibliothèque des ecoles françaises d'athènes et de rome;cmos;circuit complexity;computer-aided design;integrated circuit layout;matlab;numerical analysis;relevance;ripple effect;semiconductor;simulation;tor carding forum;transfer function;transistor	R.

With one master and one slave chip, the chipset works on the principle of near-field communication (NFC), in which the master chip transmits magnetic energy to power up the slave chip and reads back digitized data via impedance modulation. Compared with traditional NFC-based radio-frequency identification systems, the self-locking operating frequency range is significantly extended from 8 to 12 MHz, providing a robust self-adaptive stability in impedance-varying environments. Apart from an analog port digitized by a built-in 12-bit self-calibrated analog-to-digital converter, up to three switch quantity ports are simultaneously integrated, enabling the chipset to monitor the change of static binary voltages, and provide additional control functions. The fabricated chipset has been successfully characterized and applied to contactless temperature measurement and the switch's on-off detection in a mass-produced household appliance product, showing great potential in various industrial and instrumental applications.	12-bit;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;canonical account;characteristic impedance;chipset;clock rate;contactless smart card;control function (econometrics);frequency band;integrated circuit;lock (computer science);near field communication;pulse-width modulation;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;static library;switch;system on a chip	Dong Li;Meigen Shen;Jiangtao Huangfu;Jiang Long;Yong Tao;Jingyu Wang;Changzhi Li;Lixin Ran	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2148676	embedded system;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos	Arch	57.202553746406394	47.31855245439009	48684

Standard fabrication techniques already allow the isolation of single electron spins in silicon transistor-like devices. Although this is also possible in other materials, silicon-based systems have the advantage of interacting more weakly with nuclear spins. Reducing such interactions is important for the control of spin quantum bits because nuclear fluctuations limit quantum phase coherence, as seen in recent experiments in GaAs-based quantum dots. Advances in reducing nuclear decoherence effects by means of complex control still result in coherence times much shorter than those seen in experiments on large ensembles of impurity-bound electrons in bulk silicon crystals. Here we report coherent control of electron spins in two coupled quantum dots in an undoped Si/SiGe heterostructure and show that this system has a nuclei-induced dephasing time of 360 nanoseconds, which is an increase by nearly two orders of magnitude over similar measurements in GaAs-based quantum dots. The degree of phase coherence observed, combined with fast, gated electrical initialization, read-out and control, should motivate future development of silicon-based quantum information processors.	central processing unit;coherent control;dephasing;electron;electrons;experiment;greater than;heterojunction;history of the transistor;interaction;international system of units;one-electron universe;quantum decoherence;quantum dot;quantum information science;silicon;silicon-germanium;singlet oxygen;singlet state;transistor–transistor logic;triplet state;gallium arsenide;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Brett M.

The device is intended to operate in a battery switch station, allowing an up-to 1-h recharge of a 25-kWh depleted battery, removed from a vehicle. The charger is designed as a dual-stage-controlled ac/dc converter. The input stage consists of a three-phase full-bridge diode rectifier combined with a reduced rating shunt active power filter. The input stage creates an uncontrolled pulsating dc bus while complying with the grid codes by regulating the total harmonic distortion and power factor according to the predetermined permissible limits. The output stage is formed by six interleaved groups of two parallel dc-dc converters, fed by the uncontrolled dc bus and performing the battery charging process. The charger is capable of operating in any of the three typical charging modes: constant current, constant voltage, and constant power.

The proposed circuit architecture is a generic demodulator; designed to operate at 27.12 MHz while supporting a wide range of data rates. It allows low power consumption, small silicon area and high immunity against noise and amplitude disturbance. A simplified CWM demodulator architecture and a corresponding fully integrated implementation elaborated using the 130 nm IBM CMOS technology are reported. Post-layout simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the CWM demodulator for wireless power transfer and downlink communication. The proposed CWM demodulator can reach data rates up to 1/3 of the carrier frequency, i.e., 9.04 Mbit/s in this case. The circuit occupies an 1826 µm2 silicon area and dissipates 14.5 µW, in worst conditions, when operating from a 1.2 V power supply. For lower data rates, it consumes less power and allows higher power transfer during communication through an inductive link.	cmos;carrier frequency;data rate units;envelope detector;image noise;low-power broadcasting;mebibyte;megabit;metal gear solid: peace walker;power supply;pulse-width modulation;simulation;telecommunications link	Aref Trigui;Mohamed Ali;Ahmed Chiheb Ammari;Yvon Savaria;Mohamad Sawan	2017	2017 15th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2017.8010182	phase-shift keying;electronic engineering;modulation;computer science;architecture;data transmission;wireless power transfer;amplitude-shift keying;demodulation;cmos	EDA	60.17698349495443	54.31298329119256	49502

This typically results in a more than 20 dB reduction in harmonic distortion. Additive dither [1,2,3,4] has been demonstrated to reduce the spurii to a significant extent. In this paper Frequency Shift (FS) dither is described. FS dither applies a frequency shift to the signals to be digitised. After Analogue to Digital conversion the signal is demodulated by removing this frequency shift using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. FS dither has the advantage that the demodulated output has very low levels of harmonic distortion compared to a system without FS dither. By applying both Additive and FS dither at the same time, input signals with amplitudes far less than a quantum level can be digitised and detected accurately.	additive model;analog-to-digital converter;digital signal processing;digital-to-analog converter;distortion;dither;instrument flight rules;simulation	Cornelis Jan Kikkert;Abbas Bigdeli	1999		10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815775	digital signal;computer science;electrical engineering;digital signal processing;control theory;mathematics;demodulation;total harmonic distortion	HCI	66.7835236021338	51.11970561819999	49775

CFIAs are attractive because of their ability to sense differential input voltages in a common-mode voltage range (CMVR) that includes either of the supply rails [1]. They can thus interface directly, for instance, with ground-referenced sensors in a single-supply system. This property results from the fact that the input voltage is sensed by an open-loop input stage, which typically exploits the inherent level-shift provided by the input transistors' threshold voltage to sense beyond the rail.	differential signaling;instrumentation amplifier;pink noise;ripple effect;sensor;transistor	Michiel A.

This interference is very typically introduced via fluctuations in the power supply voltage, caused by the nonideal output resistance of small batteries, when a transceiver chip changes operating modes. The proposed method is designed to have low computational complexity in order to potentially allow for low cost, real-time implementations on low-power-based platforms, either in the system front or back end. Additionally, the paper provides guidelines on how to choose some of the operating conditions of the transceiver in order to minimize the effect of the interference through the application of the proposed method. Overall, successful performance is illustrated with experimental results obtained from an acoustic monitoring system, since this is considered to have specifications which are representative of most physiological monitoring devices.	acoustic cryptanalysis;blood glucose self-monitoring;computational complexity theory;electronic circuit;interference (communication);low-power broadcasting;monitoring, physiologic;output impedance;power (psychology);power supply;principle of good enough;real-time clock;specification;transceiver device component;voltage	Eduardo Aguilar-Pelaez;Guanrong Chen;Esther Rodríguez-Villegas	2012	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2012.2218600	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;remote patient monitoring;transceiver	EDA	56.44729725388252	45.855187841959214	50095

However, when maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is implemented in TEG power electronic systems, the established knowledge and wisdom surrounding PV oriented MPPT systems is often applied directly without consideration of the TEG's characteristics. Unsuitable MPPT algorithms generate large operating point variations thus deteriorating the steady state performance of the TEG. Therefore an algorithm that can reliably deliver power with low steady state error over a range of operating conditions is desired. This paper compares three common MPPT methods (perturb and observe, power gradient tracking and fractional open-circuit voltage / short-circuit current), in terms of their steady state performance and reliability, when used with a 4.2 V, 3.4 A (for matched load at ΔT = 270°C) TEG module. Experimental results are reported that confirm better and more reliable steady state performance of the fractional open-circuit voltage / short-circuit current method compared to the perturb and observe and power gradient tracking algorithms.	algorithm;goodyear mpp;gradient;impedance matching;maximum power transfer theorem;noise (electronics);operating point;performance;perturbation theory;power electronics;steady state	Ian Laird;Dylan Dah-Chuan Lu	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6572096	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;reliability;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Arch	61.32899713821935	44.07895983573098	50205
72a200f3f6a82ab6cac6f9611226a428608adb9e	state dependent riccati equation based rotor-side converter control for doubly fed wind generator		This paper proposes a rotor-side converter (RSC) control of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) through state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) approach to enhance the low voltage ride through (LVRT) ability. In order to guarantee the stability of the DFIG-based wind farm under external disturbances, a robust input-to-state stability (ISS)-based controller is presented in cooperation with the SDRE approach. The robust ISS controller is proved to be able to stabilize the wind generation system, while the system dynamics are not guaranteed to be of high performance. By parameterizing the robust ISS controller, the SDRE approach is used to provide guidance for the selection of ISS control parameters. Due to design flexibility, the SDRE control has the ability to enhance dynamic performances of wind generation system through optimizing the state-dependent coefficients. Time-domain simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. Compared with the conventional PI controller, exact linearization-based nonlinear controller, and robust ISS controller, the proposed SDRE-based RSC control has the ability to optimize the dynamics of the wind generation system during and after faults, and has better LVRT performance.	coefficient;control theory;convolutional code;nonlinear system;performance;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;system dynamics	Boyu Qin;Haoyuan Sun	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2839579	control theory;pid controller;wind power;distributed computing;rotor (electric);low voltage ride through;control theory;ac power;computer science;riccati equation;linearization	Robotics	65.3315238373975	37.495842268744504	50209
622153be3e28c1f8889bc8c8cee6ba49fee3ae38	wide band match for high q radio transceivers		Wide-band (WB) matching solutions for integrated radio transceivers can significantly reduce the manufacturing and logistic cost of Worldwide IoT solutions. Short range low energy radio solutions usually applies high impedance TX and RX frontends to achieve high efficiency and good sensitivity. However, WB matching design for high impedance PAs and LNAs are very challenging, especially at the higher Q RX side. Moreover, low cost, direct tie configurations are required with cheap SMD elements. The applied RX match is derived from Youla's 2nd order low pass matching prototype with modifications to have minimal bill of materials (BOM). The design methodology, challenges and tuning process are discussed. The presented Sub-GHz UHF WB matching solutions have more than 200MHz bandwidth without any variable or switched component. The new matchings show the same or better RX sensitivities in much wider bandwidth than the old narrowband solutions. The TX side has flat fundamental power characteristic within the operating bandwidth and well suppressed harmonics.	browser object model;characteristic impedance;color balance;high impedance;prototype;storage module device;transceiver;ultra high frequency	Attila Zolomy;Zoltan Vida	2018	2018 11th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Signal Processing (CSNDSP)	10.1109/CSNDSP.2018.8471875	balun;harmonics;electronic engineering;narrowband;high impedance;ultra high frequency;lead (electronics);bandwidth (signal processing);low-pass filter;computer science	Arch	63.00419292716839	54.09457526376523	50270
1d96053e81f70afba51eee6eb91986e0c5c54787	harmonic analysis of direct digital control of voltage inverters	discrete time control;inverters;harmonic;steady state	Voltage inverters are the most common kind of actuator to interface with variable frequency electrical systems. They are usually driven by a modulation block that provides the gating signals for the switches. Direct digital control avoids the modulation block, being the gating signals directly produced by the controller. In such configuration, the control of the electrical system is a discrete-time and quantized-actuation problem. This paper analyzes the harmonic content in sinusoidal steady state resulting from such configuration. The analysis illustrates the higher harmonic content, providing lower bounds for such content in the case of low ratios of commutation to fundamental frequencies. Also, the dependence of harmonic content with duty cycle and with commutation losses is exposed. The findings apply to different kind of control structures, regardless of its design or tuning parameters. Some of them are experimentally compared. A two-level three-phase inverter is used in the analysis for its relevance and simplicity although the procedure can be applied to any number of phases or levels.	control flow;duty cycle;experiment;foremost;game controller;inverter (logic gate);modulation;network switch;phase inversion;power inverter;quantization (signal processing);relevance;sampling (signal processing);steady state;total harmonic distortion	Manuel R.

In this work the challenges set by the integration of such devices on silicon are analyzed in depth. The two main alternative electronic driver architectures, namely multistage and travelling wave, are compared with focus to power efficiency. This is, in fact, a key parameter when considering the stringent requirements of standard module form factors. A 25 Gbps multistage and a 56 Gbps travelling wave modulator have been realized. Each electro-optical transmitter is obtained by the 3D assembly of an electronic IC on top of a photonic IC through copper pillars. STMicroelectronics PIC25G Silicon Photonics platform has been adopted for the fabrication of optical devices, while 65 nm CMOS and 55 nm BiCMOS technologies are exploited to realize the electronic drivers. A 30% better power efficiency compared to Silicon Photonics state-of-the-art at similar data rates and comparable extinction ratio performance has been demonstrated in both cases. Since packaging is also a crucial aspect for Silicon Photonics high volume production, experiments on bare dice as well as on packaged chips are reported.	bicmos;cmos;computer form factor;conley–zehnder theorem;data rate units;electronic circuit;experiment;integrated circuit;mach;modulation;multistage amplifier;passive optical network;performance per watt;rf modulator;requirement;transceiver;transmitter	Enrico Temporiti;Andrea Ghilioni;Gabriele Minoia;Piero Orlandi;Matteo Repossi;Daniele Baldi;Francesco Svelto	2016	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2016.2593802	electronic engineering;erbium;photonics;silicon photonics;hybrid silicon laser;electrical engineering;optoelectronics	DB	62.65314819826072	54.61521053398104	50489

The steady state as well as the dynamic performance of the wind system is explored. The necessary conditions for steady operation have been established. The performance of the system under variable wind gust and other disturbance conditions has been studied. It has been observed that a stand alone generator is very vulnerable to transient variations in the system. This is because of the lack of excitation to the unit. A stabilizing control scheme through a thyristor controlled variable capacitance at the generator terminal is suggested for stabilizing the system. PI controller with optimized gain settings is included in the control loop. The PI controlled variable capacitance strategy has demonstrated very good steady state and transient performance of the wind turbine-generator system.

Each stage is a non-binary cyclic ADC based on ß-expansion and the proposed ADC is designed in 3-stage pipeline structure. 16-bit non-binary output code of 3-stage is selected as 4-4-8 bits according to the considerations of total power consumption and conversion speed of the ADC. We also proposed a radix-value estimation technique for multi-stage non-binary ADC to realize the high linearity of this pipeline cyclic ADC. The SPICE simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed ADC architecture and radix-value estimation algorithm. Simulated ENOB=14.25-bit is achieved while Fs = 400kSPS.

The linear equalizer is one of the most important building blocks in these receivers. An analog domain equalizer requires wideband delay circuits for providing a constant delay with the desired bandwidth. This paper discusses the delay-bandwidth-area trade-off encountered while designing these delay circuits with low power consumption. A novel topology of a wideband active delay cell for a 100 Gb/s dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) receivers has been presented. As the delay cell has a 60 GHz bandwidth, several such delay cells can be cascaded to obtain larger delay with an overall acceptable bandwidth (for example, a delay of 100 ps with 20 GHz bandwidth). With this delay circuit designed in a 130 nm BiCMOS technology, we are able to achieve a delay × bandwidth/power product that is about 3 times better than the available state-of-the-art.	adaptive equalizer;approximation;bicmos;cma-es;cell (microprocessor);coherent;digital signal processing;equalization (communications);gigabyte;in-phase and quadrature components;key (cryptography);low-power broadcasting;modulation;monomial;padé approximant;simulation;transfer function	Saurabh R.

Therefore a previously published model is used which reduces the effect of GBW to an integrator gain-error and feedback loop delays. Consequently, methods for the compensation of these errors are adopted with some modification. The results are confirmed analytically and by simulations and show a possible GBW reduction of about a decade compared to current designs.	delta-sigma modulation;gain–bandwidth product	Maurits Ortmanns;Friedel Gerfers;Yiannos Manoli	2003		10.1109/ICECS.2003.1301665	delta-sigma modulation;feedback loop	HPC	64.6774253052289	49.6874452491507	50746

In this paper, a circuit designed to emulate the dynamic behavior of power system loads is presented. It is constructed from common analog components and is fully reconfigurable via a set of analog input signals. As load behavior is heavily dependent on that of the external network, it is important to demonstrate how this reconfigurable analog load emulation module (RALEM) may be utilized in dynamic power flow studies. Such a demonstration is presented. These studies provide the network's transient and steady-state flow of power in real-time or faster.

The WBL study is achieved by a PA characterization using two-tone measurements. The characterization method allows to identify the dependency of PA memory effects on the two-tone frequency spacing. PA memory effects (MEs) are measured using the opening in the AM/AM and AM/PM curves and they were found to be located in a limited range of tone spacings. The outcome of this characterization procedure is the identification of the PA wideband limit defined as the upper limit of the MEs frequency range. The most interesting phenomenon related to the WBL is that for all tone spacings beyond the WBL the AM/AM curves of the PA collapse to a quasi-static case, which is different from the static case. The presence of the wideband limit is not so evident from AM/PM curves, where the phase loop is not collapsing beyond WBL. The wideband limit is an important aspect of the DUT behaviour and can be used to improve the accuracy of the DUT behavioral model identifying its memory range.	am broadcasting;audio power amplifier;behavioral modeling;device under test;frequency band;pa-risc;rf power amplifier;selective calling;ultra-wideband	Felice Francesco Tafuri;Daniel Sira;Troels Studsgaard Nielsen;Ole K.

092cc79e0996780e6922456dacffdbd8014c5d9d	sliding mode control of three-phase series hybrid power filter with reduced cost and rating		This paper presents and discusses the viability of 3-phase hybrid series power filter compensator in a realistic distribution network. The proposed configuration can challenge unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) with less components and a cost. It ensures power quality by compensating current harmonics, reactive power, sag voltage, swell voltage and unbalance voltage. The main contribution is the proposed configuration integrating a control algorithm of the series active filter to compensate reactive power rather than using a thyristor controlled reactor (TCR). The strategy consists of integration a current source angle in the reference voltage to shifts a reference voltage to get unity power factor in the grid side. The sliding mode control (SMC) which a powerful control ensures a stability using Lyapunov candidate function validation. In order to reduce the rating of the active filter, a design of the passive filter is integrated to take care of reactive power and current harmonic compensation due to its low impedance at the harmonic frequency. The studies include simulation results and evaluations of the passive components used to compensate current harmonics. For the validation, an implementation and testing results are carry out using Matlab/Power Systems (PS).

In this scheme, residential loads are transferred from one phase to another to minimize VU along the feeder. The central controller, installed at the distribution transformer, observes the power consumption in each house and determines the house(s) to be transferred from an initially connected phase to another. The transfer is carried out by the help of a static transfer switch, with a three-phase input and a single-phase output connection, through which each house is supplied. The steady-state and dynamic performances of the proposed load transfer scheme are investigated by MATLAB analyses and PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.

Excessive jitter or wander may result in bit errors or frame slips within digital exchanges. This paper discusses the requirements with respect to SDH Equipment Clocks (SEC), which are the basis for improved network synchronization. Two parameters have a significant impact on the phase error generated by the clock: the oscillator performance and the phase detector characteristic. This paper proposes a synthesizer-based PLL structure employing a fixed frequency highly stable oscillator. A novel approach for an all-digital phase detector provides enhanced resolution, thereby reducing the phase error.

PLED with specific features of small size, long life and high-brightness light will be choices of future light sources. The PLEDs are feed using a lead acid battery that is charged with a PV panel. This paper presents an interface board with a ATMEL ATTINY861V microcontroller, a single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) and input and output voltage and current measurements. The microcontroller runs the perturbation and observation (P&O) maximum power point tracker (MPPT) algorithm used in battery charging process. This algorithm makes the system more efficient. In order to control the PLEDs current, an equal interface board is used running now the proportional integral (PI) current PLED control algorithm adjusting the wanted level of light in the PLEDs array. The two identical interfaces boards based in the economic microprocessor achieved very good results in battery charging and discharge supervision improving the efficiency a life-time of the lead acid batteries (first board) and presents good current control results in the PLEDs array (second equal board) providing a constant PLEDs light even in voltage battery variations or discharges. The stand alone lighting system monitors the surround area and if it feels any movement it changes the level of light of PLEDs from signal light to illumination light. After a pre-defined time it comes back to signal light, saving energy.	algorithm;battery charger;diode;discharger;illumination (image);input/output;maximum power transfer theorem;microcontroller;microprocessor;oled;single-ended primary-inductor converter;single-ended signaling	José M.

f651cfeb361161faf5146a49f92acf9fc9151efc	stability analysis for coupled multilayer graphene nanoribbon interconnects		Abstract   Based on equivalent single conductor (ESC) concept for multilayer graphene nano-ribbons (MLGNRs), this paper establishes the distributed transmission line model of coupled MLGNR interconnects and derives the analytical expression of coupled transfer function. Using the proposed model and Nyquist stability criterion at the global level of 14 nm technology node, the impact of switching factor and various design parameters on the relative stability and crosstalk delay of the coupled interconnects is investigated. It is shown that crosstalk effect makes the coupled interconnect system more stable than that in a single interconnect case. Moreover, increasing the wire length and edge roughness, the coupled interconnects becomes more stable due to the raise in crosstalk delay. Whereas, the increase of wire width, space and doping density, the crosstalk delay decreases, and the coupled interconnects is less stable. The time response for the step input verifies the analysis mentioned above. The results presented in this paper are useful for the design of reliable MLGNR interconnects with better propagation characteristics.	electrical connection;graphene	Libo Qian;Yinshui Xia;Shi Ge;Yidie Ye;Jian Wang	2016	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2016.10.007	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology	EDA	70.9077333566868	46.9448313531804	51162

Using the emerging topology, which combines the five-leg inverter into the rectifier stage of the conventional IMC, the three-to-five-phase IMC topology reduces the number of power switches and results in a simpler commutation compared with the conventional three-to-five-phase direct matrix converter. In addition, a simple approach to realize the carrier-based pulsewidth modulation (CBPWM) method for a three-to-five-phase IMC is presented, and the proposed CBPWM method is analyzed based on the space-vector approach. As a result, the IMC with the proposed CBPWM method can be more easily implemented compared with IMCs with the space-vector PWM method. A three-to-five-phase IMC control platform is realized by coordinating a TMS320F28335 DSP (Texas Instruments) with an EPM7128SLC84-15 field-programmable gate array (Altera). The simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the CBPWM strategy.	ac/ac converter;algorithm;carrier wave;diffusion monte carlo;digital signal processor;emoticon;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;memory controller;network switch;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;rl (complexity);rectifier;simulation;the matrix;xfig	Tuyen D.

We developed an accurate HDL model for the energy harvester and demonstrated its accuracy by validating it experimentally and comparing it with recently reported models. To address the performance loss due to the close mechanical-electrical interaction that takes place in energy harvesters, we proposed a holistic methodology to the energy harvester optimisation based on the HDL model. The effectiveness of employing such an approach has been demonstrated by showing that it is possible to improve vibration-based energy harvester efficiency (energy delivered to load/harvested energy) by 30% through optimising the micro-generator size and the voltage booster circuit components.	bioinformatic harvester;boost converter;booster (electric power);experiment;hardware description language;holism;mathematical optimization;simulation	Leran Wang;Tom J.

The analysis proves that the power dissipation of the nonadaptive structures varies linearly with dynamic range and quadratically with bandwidth. We present two adaptation techniques, modifying the bias current or output resistance, both of which alleviate this strong dependence on dynamic range. It is shown that adapting the bias current is most suitable for our application which requires a modest bandwidth but very wide dynamic range. Measurements demonstrate operation with currents ranging seven orders of magnitude from 200 fA to 2 muA with an average error of 0.8% and maximum error of 3.4%. The power consumption averaged over this entire range of currents is 3.45 muW . Either signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or bandwidth can be made to tradeoff with the input current magnitude depending on the application. If the bandwidth is limited to 5 kHz, it achieves an average SNR of 65 dB.	automatic control;biasing;cpu power dissipation;characteristic impedance;dynamic range;electronic circuit;optical attenuator;output impedance;preamplifier;signal-to-noise ratio;transimpedance amplifier	Arindam Basu;Ryan W.

fc6a8db9045d67f8b84f6ba1a76f4edf36dc8072	design of digitally controlled multiple-pattern time-modulated antenna arrays with phase-only difference		An optimization approach based on differential evolution (DE) is proposed to design multiple-pattern time-modulated linear antenna arrays (TMLAAs) with phase-only control by using 5-bit digital phase shifters. The synthesized multiple patterns include a pencil beam (PB), a flat-topped beam (FTB), and a cosec squared pattern (CSP). The function of the DE is to find, simultaneously, a common, i.e., fixed, set of continuous values of switch-on time durations and discrete static excitation amplitudes for 5-bit digital attenuators, and different sets of discrete excitation phase distributions for 5-bit digital phase shifters; to generate different power patterns in the far field of the TMLAA. By perturbing the static amplitude distribution of a 20-element TMLAA in the discrete search range of “(0.2–1),” the patterns are obtained by reducing side lobe levels (SLLs) to almost −20 dB and sideband levels (SBLs) to less than −25 dB. Towards the end, the same on-time and amplitude distribution is used to produce a symmetric side lobe (S-SL) and asymmetric side lobe (A-SL) CSP, and their usefulness under a noisy signal environment is discussed.	modulation	S.

A methodology to implement the voltage reduction optimization was developed by controlling the substation LTC and capacitor banks, and having smart inverters participate through their autonomous Volt-VAR control. In addition, a power quality scoring methodology was proposed and utilized to quantify the effect on power distribution system power quality. All of these methodologies were applied to a utility distribution system model to evaluate the voltage reduction energy saving and power quality under various PV penetrations and smart inverter densities.	autonomous robot;electric power quality;inverter (logic gate);litecoin;mathematical optimization;power inverter;smart card;traction substation	Fei Ding;Andu Nguyen;Sarah Walinga;Adarsh Nagarajan;Murali Baggu;Sudipta Chakraborty;Michael McCarty;Frances Bell	2017	2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2017.8085991	stand-alone power system;voltage reduction;switched-mode power supply;voltage optimisation;power factor;volt-ampere reactive;voltage regulation;control engineering;electronic engineering;electric power distribution;engineering	EDA	63.00917662789351	38.06552639750637	51703

For the electric circuit analysis, we clarified the momentary voltage-current characteristics at breaking operation of reed switches by FEM analysis. We could also estimate the capacitance of the contact electrodes at the metal bridge rupture by FEM analysis, and would derive the non-arcing condition using SPICE simulation. The suitable capacitor value in the transient current circuit for arc ignition suppression would be depend on the load impedance, the power supply, the time depending contact resistance R(t)s, the contact capacitance, and the minimum arc voltage and current.	equivalent circuit;network switch	Noboru Wakatsuki;Yu Yonezawa;Atsushi Yamamoto	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e89-c.8.1182	equivalent circuit;electronic circuit;electronic engineering;capacitor;network analysis;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;reed switch;contact resistance;capacitance;input impedance;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	64.7851255133694	44.052006822206806	51804
609b162fab8f7f1b196c070384142466cd4a3080	low-power 10-bit 100 ms/s pipelined adc in digital cmos technology		A 10-bit pipelined analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) at a sampling rate of 100 MS/s utilising only metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) transistors is presented and designed in 1.8 V 0.18 μm standard digital complementary MOS (CMOS) n-well technology. The internal gain of value 2 of the intermediate stages is achieved by using a charge-pump-based concept that avoids the use of power-area inefficient operational amplifier. All the capacitors are realised by capacitors implemented by metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSCAPs) that allows easy integration with any inexpensive standard digital CMOS technology, and altogether giving low area-power-cost solution. A low DC gain CMOS differential amplifier in source follower configuration is used and low gain effects are calibrated digitally in the background. Peak differential non-linearity (DNL) improves from −1/+0.27 least significant bit (LSB) to −0.43/+0.57 LSB and peak integral non-linearity (INL) is reduced from −9.56/+9.3 LSB to within range of ±0.5 LSB after calibration. Also signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) increase to 65.4 and 72.08 dB, respectively, after calibration.

The domino effect, which is a critical limit for the circuit implementation of conventional 4-path TI sigma-delta modulators, can be eliminated by the proposed modulator output prediction method. This along with the input signal down sampling scheme enables a complete SC circuit implementation of the 4-path TI modulator with only five op-amps, using the conventional 2-phase clock control. Also, the single global feedback path of the proposed structure makes it robust to path mismatch effects compared to other TI modulators, which usually have multi-path global feedbacks.	delta-sigma modulation;rf modulator;sampling (signal processing);ti-nspire series	Kye-Shin Lee;Yunyoung Choi;Franco Maloberti	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

In this case, the sensor cannot output any information. Therefore, various countermeasures have been proposed for sensor devices and signal processing. These countermeasures increase the dynamic range using additional components and/or computations, which increase the system cost. In this paper, we propose a simple alternative method of just adding noise. Inspired by the concept of supra-threshold stochastic resonance, which is often discussed in the context of nonlinear physics, a fluctuation in sensor response is introduced in the proposed method. We analytically describe the mechanism by which the dynamic range is increased, which is intuitively understandable and can be used in practical image sensors.	amplifier;computation;dynamic range;experiment;fractal dimension;image noise;image sensor;noise generator;nonlinear system;quantum fluctuation;signal processing;stochastic resonance;supra, inc.;xfig	Yukihiro Tadokoro;Seiya Kasai;Akihisa Ichiki;Hiroya Tanaka	2016	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2015.2478393	resistor;image noise;computer vision;dynamic range;shape;noise;image sensor;light-emitting diode	Robotics	73.13144130094634	51.75448661361605	51981

Two basic CMOS Multiple Outputs Operational Transconductance Amplifier (MOOTA) and grounded capacitors are constructed as a current-mode high-pass filter. Gain and frequency response of high-pass filter can be independently tuned through the particular bias current. It is, therefore, orthogonally of oscillation condition and frequency oscillation is obtained through bias currents of each OTA. Multiphase sinusoidal current output and voltage output can be obtained with equally space in phase of 360/n degree. Third-order high-pass filter has been raised to confirm the theoretical agreement. Low-harmonic distortion of achieved sinusoidal output less than 0.75% is obtained. The performances are carried out by PSpice for confirm its attractive characteristics.	biasing;cmos;crystal oscillator;distortion;filter bank;frequency response;in-phase and quadrature components;loopback;multiphase particle-in-cell method;operational transconductance amplifier;performance	Preecha Thongdit;Terdsak Kunto;Pipat Prommee	2015	2015 38th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2015.7296390	computer vision;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;rc oscillator;high-pass filter	Robotics	65.8418434203829	48.38318149321447	52180

4b5e3858541322cc668411c392baebf789025192	automated generation algorithm for synthetic medium voltage radial distribution systems	distribution systems statistical distributions synthetic test cases kl divergence;topology algorithm design and analysis medium voltage market research testing automation power systems	To introduce more automation in the distribution level of the power system, increasingly more data are needed to serve as input to control algorithms. To examine the complex interaction between the various layers of the system and verify the effectiveness of automation, difficult to obtain, realistic test systems are necessary. An algorithm for automatically synthesizing realistic medium voltage distribution feeders, and thus circumvent the data access problem, is presented. The algorithm treats distribution system feeders as graphs with nodes and edges, each with various properties, and leverages this structure to search for emerging statistical patterns. Using a large data set from a DSO in The Netherlands, clear statistical distributions are identified linking properties, such as load, node degree, or cable length, to the feeder structure. Specifically, many properties are linked to a node’s or edge’s distance, in hops, from the primary substation. With consideration for standard engineering practices, the statistical trends are exploited in the synthesis process, to generate feeders, which display similar characteristics to the real samples. The KL-divergence is used in the evaluation of analysis and synthesis results. Beyond solving the data access problem, the use of automatically generated, synthetic, distribution systems will enable testing and validation techniques, such as Monte Carlo simulations, which are currently not possible in this field, where single test cases are the norm.	algorithm;data access;dhrystone;discrepancy function;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;kl-one;kullback–leibler divergence;library (computing);monte carlo method;radial (radio);simulation;simulation software;switch;synthetic intelligence;test case;testbed;traction substation	Eran Schweitzer;Anna Scaglione;Antonello Monti;Giuliano Andrea Pagani	2017	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2017.2682934	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering	DB	63.312844871919864	32.724631804727835	52331

The main contribution of this work resides in the employment of the derivative of voltage that is used to determine instantaneously the increment or decrement ratio of the converter duty cycle. The use of this derived signal improves the performance of the proposed MPPT method in comparison to the conventional P&O strategy, considering the dynamic system response, steady state error and robustness (against different irradiation and temperature profiles). In order to validate this MPPT proposal, a prototype of a microinverter based on the flyback converter aiming at connecting PV panels to the power grid was implemented. The microinverter control strategy was held on the Matlab/Simulink© environment together with the dSPACE© platform.

In this paper, a case study was conducted and analyzed for a generator instability issue when operating with a VFD. Serious current oscillation happens between the generator output and the drive input at two electrical submersible pump (ESP) systems consisting of a dedicated generator and a VFD in each well. Minor changes of certain parameters and settings of the two ESP systems could trigger current oscillation at the input of the drives, also a current fluctuation at the ESP motors connected to the output of the drive and thus serious vibration of the ESP pumps. The analysis indicates that the low DC link voltage at the drives and the low displacement power factor at the drive input are the root causes of the problem. Effective solutions for this type of instability problem are proposed in this paper.	displacement mapping;esp game;instability;quantum fluctuation;vacuum fluorescent display	Xiaodong Liang;Joe Liu	2010	CCECE 2010	10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575254	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;oscillation;quantum mechanics	SE	66.03406398525681	41.16068663622385	52726

These parameters include dimming level, power consumption, power factor, detection of pedestrians, malfunction in the luminaire and environmental conditions, such as solar irradiation, temperature and humidity. Two modules and a supervisory software compose the system. The first device is the smart module (SM), whose task is to measure the parameters stemming from the power grid as well as from the luminaire. The second is the control module (CM), which coordinates the data received from each smart module, store and subsequently send them to the supervisory system in a more suitable communication link. The supervisory system (SS) is responsible to save the information in a database, analyze and detect problems or even possible faults while sending commands to each CM. With the aim to evaluate the proposed system, it was performed experiments to demonstrate its operation as well as the power quality analysis capability. The results have shown energy efficiency potential due to the type of lamp used and the insertion of proposed system.	algorithm;basic block;control unit;database;distortion;electric power quality;experiment;modularity (networks);requirement;sensor;smart module;stemming	Milena F.

2e354ee2916aa5618bb906f51f68ec525dc4dd86	a missing-code-detection gain error calibration achieving 63db snr for an 11-bit adc		This paper presents a calibration technique based on missing-code-detection (MCD) scheme to correct the gain error between the MSB and the LSB array in SAR ADCs with bridge-DAC structure. The MCD algorithm replaces the gain factor calculation with simple missing-codes count that significantly reduces the calibration digital overhead. It also relieves the linearity requirement of the testing signal; therefore, a simple charge-pump circuit can be utilized as a testing signal generator (TSG). An 80 MS/s 11-bit SAR ADC with the proposed calibration are integrated together in 65nm CMOS. It does not require any external calibration signal and the measurement results demonstrate that the calibration can improve the SNR of the ADC by 7.3 dB from 55.7 dB to 63 dB at the DC input frequency.	algorithm;cmos;charge pump;code;decibel;least significant bit;magnetic circular dichroism;most significant bit;overhead (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;successive approximation adc	Guan-Cheng Wang;Yan Zhu;Chi-Hang Chan;U Seng-Pan;Rui Paulo Martins	2017	ESSCIRC 2017 - 43rd IEEE European Solid State Circuits Conference	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2017.8094570	calibration;computer science;successive approximation adc;electronic engineering;signal generator;linearity;least significant bit;histogram;cmos;control theory	EDA	59.52859389290319	50.365039994876	52943

For each opamp, distortion contributions from different groups of transistors are identified and plotted versus frequency. This makes it possible to find the strongest sources of distortion in the various frequency regions. Further, equations that describe the third harmonic as a function of circuit parameters and input frequency are presented. Despite the simplifications, these equations describe the third harmonic accurately. Further, they provide insight and understanding by connecting distortion to circuit parameters such as transconductances, capacitances, poles, and zeros. The comparison of the opamps shows that each opamp has a frequency region where the distortion is lower than for the other two. The three-stage op amp has far lower distortion at low frequencies, the single-stage op amp is better at high frequency and the two-stage op amp is best for the mid frequency range.	differential signaling;distortion;frequency band;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;reference circuit;transistor model	Bjørnar Hernes;Willy M.

This paper presents an efficient pseudorandom test method for nonlinear circuits. The method uses a simplified Volterra series model to characterize nonlinear behaviors of devices under test (DUTs) accurately with a low complexity algorithm. A multilevel pseudorandom sequence is used to excite DUTs over a wide range of frequencies and generate a spread-spectrum output response. The cross spectral density of the input test pattern and output response is computed to estimate the parameters of Volterra series and predict the performance of DUTs. In addition, the method can be used to compensate nonlinear errors of DUTs and improve performance.

At steady-state light-load condition, the fuzzy controller adaptively adjusts the excitation current with respect to the torque current to give the minimum total copper and iron loss. The measured input power such that, for a given load torque and speed, the drive settles down to the minimum input power, i.e., operates at maximum efficiency. The low-frequency pulsating torque due to decrementation of flux is compensated in a feed forward manner. If the load torque or speed commands changes, the efficiency search algorithm is abandoned and the rated flux is established to get the best dynamic response. The drive system with the proposed efficiency optimization controller has been simulated with lossy models of converter and machine, and its performance has been thoroughly investigated.	fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;pulse (signal processing);search algorithm;steady state	C.

This frequency synthesizer is fully compliant with IEEE 802.15.3c normalization [1–4]. This PLL delivers a quadrature LO signal around 20GHz and a differential LO signal around 40GHz and has 17.9% tuning range. The wide tuning range of 17.9% permits to cover the full IEEE 802.15.3c band with industrial margin. The phase noise is −100dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset and the total power dissipation is only 80mW including the output buffers and amplifiers. Short-range wireless multi-Gb/sec communication systems use the mm-wave band of 57GHz to 66GHz, according to the IEEE 802.15.3c normalization. The frequency synthesis is one of the key elements for these transceivers. Indeed, one must take into account the antagonist tradeoff between large band tuning range of the frequency synthesizer and phase noise performance. In transceivers using super-heterodyne architecture with double conversion, the frequency synthesizer signal fLO can be equal to 2fRF /3 and fRF /3. In this case, to cover the four channels of the IEEE 802.15.3c normalization, the frequency synthesizer has to deliver a first local oscillator (LO) signal between 19.44GHz and 21.6GHz and a second LO signal between 38.88GHz and 43.2GHz, respectively. This architecture offers a good trade off between the required large frequency tuning range (≫15%) and low phase noise (≪−95dBc/Hz).	amplifier;cmos;frequency synthesizer;heterodyne;local oscillator;phase noise;phase-locked loop;transceiver	Olivier Richard;Alexandre Siligaris;Franck Badets;Cedric Dehos;Cedric Dufis;Pierre Busson;Pierre Vincent;Didier Belot;Pascal Urard	2010	2010 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433941	electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;frequency synthesizer;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;cmos	EDA	61.268870801321704	52.22355473748744	53269

Batteries with different nominal electrical characteristics and production technologies are currently in use. Among them, lithium-iron batteries are increasingly being used. The differences in basic characteristics of batteries and standardization issues require fast identification of various battery types and adapting of charging algorithms according to nominal current, voltage, capacity and state of charge. This paper describes a method for determining the nominal current for unknown LiFePO4 battery connected to the stationary filling station for charging electric bicycles. A prerequisite for determination of the rated current is identification of current-voltage curve at the moment of connection and identification of the number of cells. The algorithm for determining these parameters is given in the first part of the paper. The second part deals with determination of the nominal current for LiFePO4 battery based on current-voltage response to the selected battery charging algorithm.	algorithm;battery charger;current–voltage characteristic;initial condition;state of charge;stationary process	Igor Sirotic;Viktor Sunde;Zeljko Ban	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859545	trickle charging;electrical engineering;constant power circuit;automotive battery;battery	HCI	60.48011879822103	36.59922155430207	53389

With measurements obtained only from voltage and current sensors, the proposed estimator can capture the rotor temperature online. The rotor speed is first extracted from the stator current harmonic spectrum based on the estimated rotor slot and eccentricity harmonic frequencies. Then the inductances are estimated according to the induction machine equivalent circuit developed from the rotor flux field orientation. The stator winding resistance at ambient temperature is the only motor parameter needed as input in this stage. Once the inductances are obtained, they are fed into the rotor resistance estimation algorithm to yield an estimate of the rotor resistance. Finally, the rotor temperature is calculated from the linear relationship between the temperature and rotor resistance. The experimental results from different motors are shown to validate the proposed algorithms. The whole scheme is efficient and reliable and is therefore suitable for implementation in a motor overload protection relay to provide thermal protection against rotor overheating.	algorithm;distance (graph theory);equivalent circuit;experiment;harmonic spectrum;interrupt;kernel density estimation;mathematical induction;power supply;r.o.t.o.r.;relay;sensor;spectral density estimation;tachometer;the need for speed	Zhi Gao;Thomas G.

The longer the operation time under low supply voltage, the lower the current consumption of the cellular phone. In order to increase the output power under low supply voltage, we applied the 2nd harmonic-injection technique, which is useful for distortion compensation. With 2nd harmonic-injection, there is an inflectional power point. The distortion increases rapidly when output power goes beyond the inflectional power point. It is important to make this inflectional power point high in order to compensate for distortion in the high output-power region. We report here that the inflectional power point can be increased by connecting a 2nd harmonic short circuit to the drain terminal of the FET to which the 2nd harmonic for distortion compensation is injected. A prototype of the final stage of the power amplifier under a supply voltage of V dd =1.5 V is presented. We report that applying a CDMA uplink signal, 1.5 dB higher output power and 12% higher drain efficiency is achieved compared when only 2nd harmonic injection is employed.	audio power amplifier;mobile phone;short circuit	Shigeo Kusunoki;Tadanaga Hatsugai	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e88-c.4.729	power supply rejection ratio;power gain;field-effect transistor;code division multiple access;electronic engineering;telecommunications;power factor;power transmission;engineering;electrical engineering;short circuit;amplifier;half power point;prototype;switched-mode power supply;audio power;total harmonic distortion;low voltage;second-harmonic generation;voltage optimisation;power bandwidth;physics;low-power electronics	HCI	63.85347818484752	46.13533411386333	53616

The linear model and the control design are developed in the stationary-frame. The model shows a highly coupled system along and coordinates when using a -Y transformer vs. two completely decoupled subsystems in the case of Y-Y transformer. This issue was often overlooked in literature. The developed model includes the phase shift caused by the -Y transformer to address its effect on the steady-state and the dynamic behaviors under balanced and unbalanced distorted three phase conditions. Linear state-space model of the closed-loop system is developed to study the dynamics and stability of the two configurations. Modal analysis shows that the phase shift introduced by the -Y configuration can reduce the ultimate gain of the open loop system by 62% as compared to the system interfaced using Y-Y configuration. The developed linear model has been simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and validated using a detailed switching model in PSCAD/EMTDC under balanced and unbalanced three-phase conditions. The proposed control method can provide fast active and reactive power control with a minimum harmonics distortion in the line current.	closed-loop transfer function;control system;coupling (computer programming);distortion;lazarus component library;linear model;matlab;modal logic;phasor;portable c compiler;quantum state;shadow copy;simulation;simulink;state space;stationary process;steady state;system dynamics;systems design;total harmonic distortion;transformer;transient (computer programming);type system;unbalanced circuit	Hisham Mahmood;Jin Jiang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2011.2166412	control engineering;linear variable differential transformer;open-loop controller;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;capacitor;stability;engineering;control system;electrical engineering;state-space representation;linear model;modal analysis;power electronics;mathematical model;control theory;phase;total harmonic distortion;distributed generation;steady state;transformer;statistics	Robotics	64.82022929984493	38.37730372637314	53618

The primary advantage of ACHMI is to produce a staircase output voltage with low harmonic content utilizing unequal dc voltages on the individual H-bridge cells. In a grid-connected mode of operation, the control strategy of the ACHMI is based on the conservative power theory, providing selective disturbing current compensation besides injecting its available energy. In autonomous mode of operation, two different control methods along with a damping resistor in the filter circuit are developed for regulation of the ACHMI instantaneous output voltage in a variety of load conditions. The first method is a single-loop voltage control scheme without the need of any current measurement. The second one is a multiloop voltage control scheme with a load current feedforward compensation strategy and preservation of the grid-connected current control scheme. The steady-state response and stability of both voltage control schemes are analyzed, and based on the application requirement, the control schemes are implemented individually. The effectiveness of each control strategy is experimentally verified using a hardware-in-the-loop setup with the control algorithm implemented in the TMSF28335 DSP microcontroller.	algorithm;autonomous robot;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;h bridge;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;microcontroller;microgrid;multi-function printer;nonlinear system;power inverter;steady state	Ali Mortezaei;Marcelo Godoy Simões;Abdullah Saad Bubshait;Tiago Davi Curi Busarello;Fernando Pinhabel Marafao;Ahmed Al-Durra	2015	2015 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2015.7356820	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;control theory	Embedded	64.72101954150453	39.022433415026484	53651

Case studies indicated that the novel ROP-SPASVD formulation reduces rotor swings of synchronous generators by over 50%, while having a negligible impact on the blackout size (i.e., <; 1.5% increase), which is still optimized holistically.	approximation;benchmark (computing);circuit restoration;closing (morphology);denial-of-service attack;dynamic dispatch;holism;mathematical optimization;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;singular value decomposition;steady state;the australian;twin shaft disaster	Terrence W.

In practice, the fluctuation of power generation from renewable energy sources can lead to the severe consequences to power transmission network. By treating the fluctuation of power generation as the control input, the risk identification problem is formulated with the aid of optimal control theory. Thus, a control approach is developed to identify the fluctuation of power generation that results in the worstcase cascading failures of power systems. Theoretical analysis is also conducted to obtain the necessary condition for the worst fluctuations of power generation. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented on IEEE 9 Bus System to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	control theory;ibm power systems;numerical analysis;optimal control;quantum fluctuation;simulation	Chao Zhai;Gaoxi Xiao;Hehong Zhang;Tso-Chien Pan	2018	CoRR			Embedded	65.1500156020662	34.57716460381432	53921

This requirement is a real issue for the new high-performance ADCs. This paper proposes a test solution that relaxes this constraint. The technique allows the test of ADC harmonic distortions using only low-cost ATE. The method involves two steps. The first step, called the learning phase, consists in extracting the harmonic contributions from the AWG. These characteristics are then used during the second step, called the production test, to discriminate the harmonic distortions induced by the ADC under test from the ones created by the generator. Hardware experimentations are presented to validate the proposed approach.	analog-to-digital converter;built-in test equipment;diplexer;image resolution;nonlinear system;point of view (computer hardware company);test data;total harmonic distortion;waveform	Vincent Kerzerho;Philippe Cauvet;Serge Bernard;Florence Azaïs;Michel Renovell;Mariane Comte;Omar Chakib	2008	VLSI Design	10.1155/2008/482159	electronic engineering;real-time computing;effective number of bits;image resolution;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;arbitrary waveform generator	EDA	56.29868608588988	55.35333840269808	54101

The next challenge for optical interconnects is to move to a serial data-rate of 25Gb/s or higher [1,2]. To achieve flexible interconnects on a bandwidth demand, a CDR is required to operate at multiple rates in a wide tuning range. A selectable multi-VCO structure is one method to overcome this issue. However, when multi-VCOs are allocated in each channel, the large size of VCOs makes it difficult to achieve a high-density optical link. In this paper, we presenta dual-loop hybrid CDR including a phase interpolator (PI) loop for phase tracking and a common VCO loop situated outside the channel areas for frequency acquisition. We develop a quadrant-switching analog Pl-loop that has the ability to track the frequency mismatch corresponding to full-rate frequency up to 35Gb/s. The 4-channel driver IC with this dual-loop hybrid CDR is fabricated in 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS technology.

60ff6e2678105553c1b14105916311a6c545dc44	extended-bandwidth negative impedance converters by nested networks		We show a novel scheme for increasing resistive bandwidth in opamp negative impedance converters (NICs) with recursive topologies. A simplified theoretical model indicates bandwidth improvement due to altering pole and zero locations in the network’s transfer function by allowing certain resistor terms to take negative values. We extend established practices by allowing negative resistors as NIC components by nesting NICs within an NIC network. The result is a nested arrangement of NICs that theoretically extends frequency-dependent terms in the model’s transfer function toward higher frequencies. This theory is confirmed experimentally by comparing nested networks to standard NIC networks. Improvement is limited by non-ideal amplifier effects and comes at the price of system complexity. This brief provides techniques for nesting voltage-mode NICs to increase bandwidth of negative resistance in NIC opamp circuits by a factor of 1.65–3.24.	characteristic impedance;experiment;network interface controller;nominal impedance;operational amplifier;recursion;theory;transfer function	Aubrey N.

The time-to-digital converter uses a coarse digital delay line with an interpolation structure to achieve a resolution better than the gate-delay of the technology. The delay lines are stabilized by using replica delay lines. The arrival of photons can be measured channel wise with a resolution and range of 80 ps and 3.5 ns, respectively. The maximum variation of the 80 ps resolution through the spectral rows was measured to be ± 33 ps. The main error source of Raman spectroscopy measurement, a high fluorescence can be rejected effectively with this resolution when a typical used pulse width of the laser is approximately 150 ps.	cmos;delay line memory;digital delay line;diode;dynamic range;interpolation;point of view (computer hardware company);propagation delay;ps (unix);pulse-width modulation;raman scattering;time-to-digital converter;zero suppression	Ilkka Nissinen;Jan Nissinen;Juha Kostamovaara	2013	2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)		raman spectroscopy;electronic engineering;interpolation;optics;physics;avalanche photodiode	EDA	55.60749540273223	49.47518297448395	54474

Moreover, a fuzzy logic approach allows us to conclude to the load level operating system and to inform the operator of the rotor fault severity. Several experimental results prove the performance of this method under various load levels and various fault severities. Notwithstanding, this approach requires a steady-state operating condition. The conclusion resulting from this paper is highlighted by experimental results which prove the efficiency of the suggested approach.	faraday cage;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;modulus robot;operating system;r.o.t.o.r.;squirrel;steady state;type signature;unbalanced line;vertical bar	Hubert Razik;Maurício Beltrão de Rossiter Correa;Edison Roberto Cabral da Silva	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2029580	control engineering;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor;engineering drawing	Embedded	69.33449735407058	37.44549852192855	54486

The existing network embodies overhead lines (OHL) and underground cables (UGC), in many occasions assembled in parallel, as well as combined heat and power (CHP) facilities. Furthermore, it is characterized by meshed topology, which ensures system flexibility and improved reliability; however, this configuration favors propagation of fault currents and voltage sags across the grid. To minimize damage from these, the present study investigates prospective fault current limitation techniques, including the superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL), regarding the features of the Helsinki subtransmission network. This paper inspects the optimal location of these solutions and performs economic assessment. Moreover, it examines the benefits of the employed techniques, assesses whether they achieve the desired operational performance, and quantifies total costs, accrediting load growth for a 40-year period.	current limiting;limiter;overhead (computing);prospective search;recursion;short-circuit evaluation;software propagation;traction substation;transformer;user-generated content	Bruno J.

In order to choose the output vector from the VEF-Table, a “TwoStep” selection algorithm is established based on the cost function, which can select two vectors with duty cycle sequentially. By synthesizing two vectors, the proposed approach is capable of adjusting the magnitude and angle of the output vector, so as to reduce the undesirable ripples of torque and flux. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by both numerical simulations and experimental results.	duty cycle;integer factorization;lookup table;loss function;mathematical optimization;modulus robot;numerical analysis;online and offline;power inverter;selection algorithm;simulation;voltage source	Changliang Xia;Shuai Wang;Xin Gu;Yan Yan;Tingna Shi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2535958	market research;control engineering;electronic engineering;torque sensor;hysteresis;network switch;stall torque;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;torque;vector control;physics;direct torque control	Robotics	66.89095365415653	38.67680100165972	54704

With the trend of higher data-rate, higher carrier frequency and higher order of modulation, the jitter or phase noise requirement becomes more demanding given a limited power budget. This tutorial starts from the fundamentals of PLL jitter and power consumption. Various sources of PLL jitter and power will be identified and analyzed, and design methodologies to optimize them on both the block and system level will be presented.

Previous algorithms based on Boundary Element Method (BEM) are inefficient to extract interconnect capacitance due to the complex dielectric structures. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that combines multilayer Green's function with the equivalent charge method to efficiently deal with the complex dielectrics. The multilayer Green's function is efficient to model layered dielectric media, while the equivalent charge method is powerful to model non-planar complex dielectric. Our method can also model ground plane and reflective boundary wall. From experimental results, the new method is significantly faster than previous methods in realistic conditions, i.e., 70X speedup and 99% memory saving compared with FastCap and 2X speedup and 80% memory saving compared with PHiCap for complex dielectric structure with similar accuracy.	algorithm;boundary element method;embedded system;speedup;very-large-scale integration	Nancy Y.

1c8b3cdacc5c95598ccff720e16c6db181e75904	a synchrophasor-based decision tree approach for identification of most coherent generating units		Identifying coherent generating units in power systems is an important step toward development of a reduced model for bulk electricity grid aiming at wide-area analysis and controlled islanding practices. In this paper, an approach for identification of the most coherent generating units is proposed which exploits a decision tree (DT) algorithm based on synchronized data measured by phasor measurement units (PMUs). Such DTs should be trained so as to provide accurate decisions for almost all possible disturbances in power systems. Three probabilistic parameters are, therefore, taken into account in a training stage including fault type, fault location, and the system load level at the time fault occurs. In order to generate the training dataset, different scenarios are simulated and appropriate attributes are extracted from voltage phasors. Furthermore, the most coherent generating units, which are the DT target, are determined in each scenario by evaluating the similarity between the frequency components existing in their speed variation signals. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is verified by its application to the 68-bus, 16-machine test system through which it reveals high accuracy in recognizing the most coherent generating units under various prevailing conditions in power grid.

This paper illustrates the rail-to-rail capability of a single-pair bulk-driven CMOS input stage operated from an extremely low supply voltage. A composite input stage is also introduced to point out some limitations inherent in multiple-pair input stages and carry out performance comparison, based on experimental data obtained in standard 0.35 mm CMOS technology. The performance achieved by the single-pair bulk-driven input stage can be readily extended to a nanoscale process, as lower supply voltages in scaled technologies are expected. Measurements demonstrate the rail-to-rail suitability of the single-pair input stage and show intrinsic advantages of this approach in some amplifier features, such as linearity and common-mode rejection ratio, as compared to the case of the composite solution. & 2010 Elsevier B.V.

For traditional power systems, Low Voltage (LV) networks play a passive role in voltage regulation, but when DGs are present the LV network may play an active role in voltage control. In this paper, a voltage control strategy using mini Combined Heat and Power (mCHP) is proposed. For this aim, the electrical and thermal dynamics of a mCHP plant are considered, a voltage controller is designed and a voltage control mode is developed, which prolongs the regulation action of the mCHP unit using heat storage. Simulations are conducted considering thermal and electrical demand of a typical multi-family house in the climate region of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Aspects of resulting voltage and thermal profiles, compared to a traditional heat lead mode, are discussed for an exemplary day.	computer simulation;control theory;ibm power systems;logical volume management;voltage controller;voltage regulation	Diego I.

74620a2c27fe73570b42ddfaca455c004033aa14	an auto-balancing scheme for non-contact ac voltage measurement		A simple, low-cost and non-contact type AC voltage measurement unit is presented here. The non-contact voltage sensor is designed to provide an output voltage that is directly proportional to the RMS value of unknown voltage being measured by the probe. The output is independent of the coupling capacitance between the probe and the insulated wire/cable under measurement. This is accomplished by a new, specially designed self-balancing signal conditioning circuit. This approach allows the sensor output to achieve less sensitivity to the variability of the probe to wire capacitances, good linearity and high accuracy over a range of voltage (0-300V) being measured. A prototype of the proposed probe and signal conditioning circuit has been designed, developed and tested in the laboratory. The result obtained established the practicality of the proposed scheme.	heart rate variability;prototype;self-balancing binary search tree;sensor	Dominik Buchinger;Boby George	2018	2018 IEEE 9th International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems (AMPS)	10.1109/AMPS.2018.8494863	electronic engineering;engineering;electrode;voltage;linearity;signal conditioning;coupling;band-pass filter;capacitance;root mean square	Arch	69.0278838698835	49.93180917100164	55374

The controlled transfer of energy from a unregulated DC source to a regulated output voltage is realized through a switched-capacitor (SC) circuit. A duty-cycle control is used; the driving signals of the transistors in the SC circuit are determined by the feedback circuit. The absence of magnetic devices makes possible the realization of power converters of small size, low weight and high power density, able to be manufactured in IC technology. High efficiency, small output voltage ripple and good regulation for large changes in the input voltage and/or load values are other positive features of the new type of DC-to-DC power converter. The input-to-output voltage conversion ratio is flexible; the same converter structure can provide a large range of constant desired values of the output voltage for a given input voltage, by predetermining the steady-state conversion ratio. The frequency response shows good stability of the designed converter. The experimental results obtained by using a prototype of a step-down SC-based DC-to-DC converter confirmed the theoretical expectations and the computer simulation results. >	dc-to-dc converter	Siu Va Cheong;Henry Shu-hung Chung;Adrian Ioinovici	1994	IEEE Trans.

In the designed fractal antenna, the six elliptical slots in ground plane and two elliptical slots in radiating patch are embedded to improve the depth of return loss. Further, the parametric study is performed on width of microstrip feeding line, position/size of ellipses in radiating patch and ground plane to achieve mismatch loss ≤ 0.044dB and power delivered to antenna 99%, i.e., return loss (S11)≤−20dB for S-band.

Power dissipation and die area of SC and SI implementations are compared based on linearity and noise constraints. It is shown that if nonlinearity errors of the class AB SI ADCs are removed by calibration, their performance prevails that of the SC ADCs. Also it is shown that class AB SI ADCs occupy less die area than SC ADCs for a given resolution.	amplifier;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;cpu power dissipation;nonlinear system;switched capacitor	Gholamreza Nikandish;Behnam Sedighi;Mehrdad Sharif Bakhtiar	2007	2007 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378731	electronic engineering;switched capacitor;engineering;electrical engineering;dissipation;control theory	Arch	60.79190128116907	49.6332009478087	55575

The problem with small inductors is that they exhibit low inductance and larger equivalent series resistance (ESR); in other words, they induce larger ripples in the output and higher conduction power losses. This brief presents and verifies a current-ripple suppression technique in which a discrete 2 × 2 × 1 mm3 4.7-¿H inductor is effectively multiplied by subtracting a replica of the inductor's ac ripple current, allowing only a residual ripple to reach the output. Experimental results from a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated circuit prototype demonstrate a currentand output-ripple reduction of 10.8 X and 25.8 X, respectively. The ESR power savings in the smaller inductor favorably offset the quiescent power lost in the multiplier (128 mW), outperforming its higher nonmultiplied 47-¿H counterpart at high loads (above 250 mA).	cmos;discrete mathematics;feed forward (control);integrated circuit;prototype;ripple effect;semiconductor;series and parallel circuits;switched-mode power supply;wireless router;zero suppression	Lucas Andrew Milner;Gabriel A.

An effective scheduling algorithm is crucial to optimizing the overall performance of the MFPAR. There are various existing adaptive resource scheduling methods for the allocation of radar resources, but none of them consider the mission of imaging, a very important task. In this paper, an adaptive ISAR-imaging-considered task scheduling algorithm is proposed. Based on the sparse-aperture ISAR Compressive Sensing (CS) cognitive imaging techniques, the required resources for target imaging can be calculated from the online cognition of the target characteristics. Then the imaging mission is considered in the resource scheduling optimization model to realize adaptive allocation of radar resources and high-resolution imaging of multi targets. With the proposed algorithm, different tasks, such as tracking, searching and imaging, etc. can be implemented simultaneously, thus the radar efficiency is significantly improved. The effectiveness of the proposed method will be demonstrated by simulation experiments.	algorithm;cognition;compressed sensing;experiment;image resolution;mathematical optimization;phased array;radar;scheduling (computing);simulation;sparse matrix	Yijun Chen;Qun Zhang;Ning Yuan;Ying Luo;Hao Lou	2015	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2449251	radar tracker;radar engineering details;simulation;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;resource management;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;scheduling	Embedded	81.58326432359512	45.853421203589235	55741

The proposed algorithm uses Kalman filtering to suppress the effect of errors in the histogram counts based on characteristics of input noise and circuit mismatches. Appropriate versions of the algorithm for ADCs of flash and pipelined architectures are introduced respectively. Simulation results show that this approach can reduce the INLk estimation error by over 50% and achieve desired accuracy with a much smaller number of samples as compared to the conventional algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly shorten the linearity test time by a factor of 10 or higher. Therefore, it can enable test and help maintain the quality of high-performance ADCs, and reduce the production test time and cost for medium and low resolution ADCs	16-bit;adobe flash;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;anurag kumar;decade (log scale);image resolution;kalman filter;mathematical optimization;simulation	Le Jin;Degang Chen;Randall L.

Among these, the Park-PLL and the second-order-generalized-integrator-based PLL are very attractive, owing to their simple digital implementation, low computational burden, and desired performance under frequency-varying and harmonically distorted grid conditions. Despite the wide acceptance and use of these two advanced PLLs, no comprehensive design guidelines to fine-tune their parameters have been reported yet. Through a detailed mathematical analysis, it is shown that these two PLL structures are equivalent to each other, from the control point of view. Then, a linearized model is developed which is valid for both PLLs. The derived model significantly simplifies the stability analysis and the parameter design. To fine-tune the PLL parameters, a systematic design approach is suggested afterward, which guarantees a fast dynamic response, a high disturbance rejection ability, and a robust performance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.	arnold tongue;computation;control point (mathematics);phase-locked loop;point of view (computer hardware company);rejection sampling;simulation	Saeed Golestan;Mohammad Monfared;Francisco D.

The filter provides for the emulation of the variable response of the acoustic channel and thus has to be adaptive. Bit-level systolic macrocells are used as building blocks of the circuit, in order to achieve the high performance needed and to satisfy the complexity requirements. The circuit consists of a systolic core where the computation is performed, characterized by a high clock frequency, an easy and regular design, and of a low-speed interface to the rest of the board. Peculiar characteristics are also the high number of taps (1024), the techniques used to reduce the area occupied by the 16 × 16 multiplier, and those used to synchronize the internal clock to the external one. The circuit was designed with a 1.2 μm CMOS technology. It employs more than 300 000 transistors and its clock frequency is greater than 70 MHz.	acoustic cryptanalysis;echo suppression and cancellation;finite impulse response	Roberto Roncella;Roberto Saletti;Pierangelo Terreni;Cristiano Toncelli	1992	Signal Processing	10.1016/0165-1684(92)90080-G	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;finite impulse response;mathematics;systems architecture	Robotics	55.209427166097775	54.25433912686649	55970

The spectral subtraction (SS) method is suitable for removing these noises because it does not require any extra hardware, but the original signal is quite distorted. Therefore we have developed an advanced SS (A-SS) method suppressing the distortion of the original signal. It first subtracts the assumed noise spectrum from an input signal, and then processes the spectrum so as to keep the power constant. In addition, digital cameras have a unique problem that the ratio of noise against a recorded signal varies frequently, which is caused by the lens variability and recording environment difference. To counter this issue, we have developed the two algorithms: the statistically optimized algorithm to pre-compute the noise spectrum beforehand, and the feedback algorithm to automatically control the quantity of subtraction according to the noise ratio. We implement the A-SS method applying the proposed algorithms into a prototype camera and verified the effectiveness on the noise reduction.	algorithm;colors of noise;digital camera;distortion;feedback;heart rate variability;noise reduction;prototype	Tomoki Oku;Akiomi Kunisa;Makoto Yamanaka;Haruhiko Murata	2013	2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664796	gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;effective input noise temperature;computer vision;noise;electronic engineering;colors of noise;dark-frame subtraction;computer science;noise measurement;noise;optics;noise floor;noise	EDA	68.01857034869165	50.85087995377931	56146

These techniques, starting from a series of measurements carried out on a previously selected test point set, given the circuit topology and the nominal values of the components, are aimed at determining the effective values of the circuit parameters by solving a set of equations nonlinear with respect to the component values. Here the role of symbolic techniques in the automation of parametric fault diagnosis of analog circuits is investigated. Being in fact the actual component values the unknown quantities, symbolic approach results particularly suitable for the automation of parametric fault diagnosis techniques, as shown, for example, in [1]. Obviously all this is applicable to linear analog circuits or to nonlinear circuits suitably linearized. On the other hand, present trend is moving as much as possible to techniques of design that lead to linear analog circuits, so this is not a so serious restriction [2]. It is important to note that in the analog fault diagnosis two phases can be considered: the first one is the phase of testability analysis and ambiguity group determination, while the second one is the phase of fault location. Testability gives theoretical and rigorous upper limits to the degree of solvability of fault diagnosis problem once the test point set has been chosen, independently of the method effectively used in phase of fault location. For what concerns ambiguity groups, they can be considered as sets of circuit components that, if considered as potentially faulty, yield an undetermined system. For the testability evaluation problem symbolic approach is a natural choice, because a circuit description made by means of equations in which the component values are the unknowns is properly represented by symbolic relations. Also for ambiguity group determination symbolic approach gives excellent results, as reported, for example, in [3]. For the fault location phase several different approaches can be used and all of them can be considered as an optimization problem, because, starting from measurements carried out on the circuit under test, the component values better fitting them have to be determined. Generally symbolic techniques are suitable for optimization problems, because the relations required by specific optimization strategies are easily generated using symbolic methods. To this end three different methodologies were used by authors during last few years, based on NewtonRaphson type algorithms, neural networks and genetic algorithms, and a comparison has been made by means of programs developed for this goal [1,4-5]. In all the three cases the quite realistic hypothesis of bounded number of faulty components (k-fault hypothesis) is made, taking into account component tolerances. The results of comparison can be so summarized: if frequency domain measurements are considered, symbolic approach can give good results with both a Newton-Raphson type algorithm and a hybrid neural network approach [5]. However good results are obtained also with a neural network approach based on time domain measurements, without using symbolic network functions [4]. On the other hand, genetic algorithms based on the use of symbolic network functions and frequency domain measurements are very slow and, then, they are not advantageous.	analogue electronics;artificial neural network;circuit topology;genetic algorithm;hybrid neural network;in-phase and quadrature components;integrated circuit;mathematical optimization;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;optimization problem;test point	Antonio Luchetta;Stefano Manetti;Maria Cristina Piccirilli	2002			control engineering;electronic engineering;genetic algorithm;computer science;newton's method;artificial neural network;algorithm	EDA	72.78632570571448	46.14100409584074	56265

A possible DDC algorithm consists of two simple cascading integrating comb (CIC) filters and a finite input response (FIR) filter preceded by a modulator that is controlled with a numeric controlled oscillator (NCO). Implementations of the algorithm have been made for five architectures, two application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), a general purpose processor (GPP), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and the Montium tile processor (TP). All architectures are functionally capable of performing the algorithm. The differences between the architectures are their performance, flexibility and energy consumption. In this paper, we compared the energy consumption of the architectures when performing the DDC algorithm. The ASIC is the best solution if digital down conversion is constantly required. When digital down conversion is needed only parts of the time, the Altera Cyclone II is the best solution due to its smaller technology size. In the spare time, the reconfigurable architectures can be reconfigured for other tasks of today's multimedia devices	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;cyclone;field-programmable gate array;finite impulse response;frequency band;graph partition;image scaling;modulation;numerically controlled oscillator;tile processor	Tjerk Bijlsma;Pascal T.

These undesirable behaviors increase the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and shift the dc input line current to non null values. This results in a malfunctioning of the system or even damages caused by the increase of the temperature which can jeopardize enormously the performances and shorten the lifetime of the system. In order to avoid these problems, subharmonic line frequency instabilities must be suppressed. In this paper, a selective notch filter based controller is combined with the output voltage compensator to suppress these instabilities and to stabilize a two-stage PFC ac-dc converter. A frequency domain analysis is used to explain the control mechanism of directing subharmonic and chaotic oscillations into stable periodic motion. A detailed study of the effect of this selective filter on the dynamical behavior of the system is presented. A simple harmonic model is used to obtain the control stability domain. This control technique is simple and allows widening the stability domain and improving the performances of the system being its experimental implementation possible using standard devices such as OAs and passive elements. The correctness of the proposed technique is verified with numerical simulations and experimental measurements.	approximation algorithm;boost converter;chaos theory;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);domain analysis;dynamical system;electronic circuit;experiment;feedback;flyback;frequency band;hysteresis;integrated circuit;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;oracle application server;performance;power electronics;powerbuilder foundation classes;prototype;single-ended primary-inductor converter;single-ended signaling;total harmonic distortion;zero suppression;ćuk converter	Abdelali El Aroudi;Reham Haroun;Angel Cid-Pastor;Luis Martinez-Salamero	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215747	control engineering;electronic engineering;stability;power factor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;automatic frequency control;control theory;feedback;band-stop filter;total harmonic distortion;oscillation;frequency domain	Robotics	66.19712885566574	40.43582216564934	56274

It has been observed while building logic circuits that comprise only of SETs the voltage at the gate input had to be much higher than the power supply for the SET to have acceptable switching characteristics. This limitation in the gate and power supply voltages makes it practically inappropriate to build circuits. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture to overcome this limitation by combining conventional MOS devices with SETs. Three different types of hybrid circuits have been proposed and their characteristics have been studied using SPICE-based simulation tool which includes a SET-SPICE model. & 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The single-EM solution avoids losses from another EM and its power electronics, which are employed in many existing HEVs. The topology of the MMT planetary gearset is the same as that of conventional four-speed automatic transmissions (ATs). The MMT realizes five power flow modes, which are developed into 16 operation modes, including one Motor_only mode, four Engine_only modes, four Compound driving modes, six Braking modes, and one Charging while parking mode. The properly arranged clutches transmit power flow more flexibly, allow direct mechanical power transmission from the engine to the drive shaft, and avoid spin loss for the engine and energy conversion loss for the electric components. Simulation under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) shows that the fuel consumption of the proposed HEV is comparable to a benchmark “THS II-like” vehicle, which uses a planetary gearset, two EMs, and no clutch, which indicates the fuel economy potential of this concept.	benchmark (computing);control theory;electronic component;logic programming;matlab;mpeg media transport;map;mathematical model;modulation;planetary scanner;power electronics;simulation;simulink;time complexity	Futang Zhu;Li Chen;Chengliang Yin	2013	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2012.2222456	control engineering;gear;engineering;power electronics;drive shaft;automotive engineering;mathematical model;fuel efficiency;torque;forensic engineering	Mobile	61.362477778367705	34.869307381917885	56322

When either the voltage profile of the FSIG severely declines due to the load consumption increasing in the nearby area, or the mechanical power of the wind turbine increases owing to the wind speed increasing, the loss of the stable equilibrium point will result in this class of long-term voltage instability problems. Although this problem is a local phenomenon, it may spread to the rest of the system and cause the cascaded blackout. Meanwhile, with massive deployment of synchrophasor technology, it is possible to improve system awareness and enable early warning to detect this class of LTVS problems in real-time. In this paper, a measurement-based algorithm for synchrophasor long-term voltage stability indicator (SLVSI) will be proposed. First, qualitative analysis of this class of LTVS problems is conducted by corresponding bifurcation diagrams and hysteretic curves. Secondly, a measurement-based FSIG equivalent model is proposed by utilizing real-time phasor measurements from synchrophasors. The above concept can be extended to distribution power networks with multiple FSIGs. The entire distribution power grid will be considered as a modified coupled single-port network. By exploring the concept of reactive power response factor, the corresponding Thevenin equivalent parameter of each individual FSIG branch is adjusted based on real-time phasor measurements. Thus, a SLVSI for each individual FSIG can be defined by modifying the conventional L-index. Simulation experiments on two IEEE test systems are performed to validate the accuracy of the proposed SLVSI.	algorithm;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;experiment;hysteresis;instability;phasor;real-time clock;sensor;simulation;software deployment;thévenin's theorem	Jian-Hong Liu;Chia-Chi Chu	2015	2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)	10.1109/TSG.2014.2379716	equivalent circuit;wind speed;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;torque;voltage regulation	Embedded	64.19114829985631	35.22376328042364	56401

Unlike conventional implementations, the proposed synthesizer is open both when transmitting and receiving data. It is, therefore, possible to use a wide loop-filter bandwidth without violating the noise or spurious requirements. A wideband loop-filter can be implemented using small component values, allowing an on-chip loop filter. To handle the frequency drift associated with open-loop implementations, a low-leakage charge pump is proposed. The synthesizer is implemented using a 0.18-mum CMOS process. The total power consumption is 9 mW, and the circuit area including the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) inductors and on-chip loop-filter is 0.32 mm2. The measured frequency drift indicates a leakage current of below 2 fA.	cmos;charge pump;frequency drift;frequency synthesizer;key (cryptography);low-power broadcasting;modulation;network packet;requirement;spectral leakage;transceiver;transmitter;voltage-controlled oscillator	Fredrik Jonsson;Håkan Olsson	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2009.2015366	control engineering;frequency drift;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;direct digital synthesizer;frequency synthesizer;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;switching time;oscillation	EDA	60.63790808943886	52.31579479483027	56567

Given the production test sequence for measuring multiple specifications of a transmitter-under-test, switching from one test hardware setup to the next, impacts test time. In this paper, a new test methodology for wireless transmitters is demonstrated, in which a single stimulus is used to test multiple frequency-domain and modulation-domain transmitter specifications in a significantly short test time. In the proposed test method, a multi-tone stimulus is applied at the baseband of the transmitter-under-test; the corresponding spectral test response at the RF output of the transmitter is analyzed for predicting the transmitter specifications using an alternate testing framework. Pass/fail decisions are made using the predicted specification values.

However, subject to the limited accuracies of devices, the theoretical analysis of the analog self-interference cancellation has a large difference with the experimental performance, and can not be applied directly in the practical application. In this paper, the effect of accuracies of the analog devices, such as the tunable attenuator and phase shifter, on the self-interference cancellation performance of a full duplex transceiver is analyzed, i.e., the closed-form expressions of the self-interference cancellation ratio with different accuracies of analog devices are shown. By analysis and simulation, the self-interference cancellation performs worse as the step sizes of the tunable attenuator and phase shifter increase.	duplex (telecommunications);freedos;interference (communication);optical attenuator;simulation;transceiver	Jun Wang;Ying Shen;Hongzhi Zhao;Chuan Huang;Shihai Shao;Youxi Tang	2016	2016 25th Wireless and Optical Communication Conference (WOCC)	10.1109/WOCC.2016.7506579	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;attenuator;wireless;transceiver	Metrics	61.77504966184606	60.43773771953822	56913

Unfortunately, if not correctly handled, this chemistry can quickly bring loss in performance and produce potentially dangerous situations. Battery management systems (BMSs) are a practical way to manage these battery packs and improve their efficiency. In this paper, we propose an original BMS architecture particularly suited for light-EV applications based on the concept of redundant cell, i.e., a technique that dynamically disconnects a cell in the battery pack for optimal balancing purposes. The proposed BMS is very flexible, economical, stable, and space saving.	battery management system;complexity;diode;extended validation certificate;hardiness zone;low-power broadcasting;memory effect;network switch;pulse-width modulation;simultaneous multithreading;transistor	Antonio Manenti;Andrea Abba;Alessandro Merati;Sergio M.

The first topic is the spiral inductor design which determines the performance of the boost converter, and the second is the effect of TSV’s on the boost converter. These techniques are very important in achieving a 3D-SSD with a boost converter. In the design of the inductor, the on-board inductor from 250 nH to 320 nH is the best design feature that meets all requirements, including high output voltage above 20 V, fast rise time, low energy consumption, and area smaller than 25 mm2. The use of a boost converter with the proposed inductor leads to a reduction of the energy consumption during the write operation of the proposed 1.8-V 3D-SSD by 68% compared with the conventional 3.3-V 3D-SSD with the charge pump.

The proposed autotransformer consists of only two single-phase transformers for its realization against three single-phase transformers required in other configurations. The proposed 18-pulse AC-DC converter is suitable for retrofit applications, where, presently, a six-pulse diode bridge rectifier is being used. A set of power-quality parameters, such as total harmonic distortion (THD) and crest factor of AC mains current, power factor, displacement factor, and distortion factor at AC mains, THD of supply voltage at PCC, and DC-bus-voltage ripple factor for a VCIMD fed from an 18-pulse AC-DC converter, are computed to observe its performance. The presented design technique provides flexibility to give an average DC output from the proposed converter, which is the same as that of a conventional three-phase diode bridge rectifier. However, it is also possible to step-up or step-down the output voltage as required. The effect of load variation on VCIMD is also studied to observe the effectiveness of the proposed harmonic mitigator. A laboratory prototype of the proposed autotransformer-based 18-pulse AC-DC converter is developed to validate the design and simulation model.	ac adapter;dc-to-dc converter;diode bridge;displacement mapping;faraday cage;interphase;portable c compiler;power supply;prototype;rectifier;ripple effect;simulation;squirrel;total harmonic distortion;transformer;transformers	Bhim Singh;Vipin Garg;G.

The main purpose of this study is to reduce the fluctuation and to reject the impact of load induction motor drive (IMD) on DC-link voltage. Indeed, the use of Proportional-Integral (PI) controller cannot achieve these objectives due to their disturbances sensitivity problem and limited regulation bandwidth. To avoid these problems, an ANFIS regulator has been designed and the inverter side output power is added to the reference active power in the rectifier side. The performance of the proposed regulation technique is compared to the PI regulator to show its effectiveness.

A quadrature inductor-capacitor (LC) oscillator is quickly switched on and off for the duration of the pulse, and the amplitude envelope is modulated with an impulse using a variable passive CMOS attenuator. The impulse is realized using a glitch generator (CMOS nand gate) and its duration can be changed over a wide range (375 ps to more than 1 ns). The switching technique used in the quadrature oscillator creates a large initial voltage for fast startup (0.5 ns) and locks the initial phase of the oscillations to the input clock for pulse coherence. The measured phase noise thus matches that of the clock signal, with a relatively low phase noise of -70 dBc/Hz and -100 dBc/Hz at 1kHz and 1 MHz offsets respectively. The entire circuit operates in switched-mode with a low average power consumption of less than 2.2 mW and 14.8 mW at 50 MHz and 600 MHz pulse repetition frequencies, or below 11 pJ of energy for each of the four differential quadrature pulses. It occupies an active area of less than 0.41 mm2 .	cmos;clock signal;coupling (computer programming);electronic oscillator;glitch;initial condition;lc circuit;lock (computer science);modulation;nand gate;optical attenuator;phase noise;pulse duration;pulse generator;radar;refresh rate;ultra-wideband;virtual 8086 mode;wire bonding	Ahmed M.

One of the most important applications of BESS is to restore an electric power system to operation without counting on the external transmission network. To prevent potential damage to the expensive equipment of power plant, the converters must generate a high quality and reliable three phase voltage. This research provides a simulation-based investigation in order to scrutinize different multi-level inverter topologies to find the more appropriate multi-level inverter structure for BESS application. The investigation has been done entitled of quantitative and qualitative studies. Throughout the quantitative study, the output specifications of each inverter topology is scrutinized, while other features such as reliability, modularity and functionality are scrutinized as qualitative study.

267c344ad6905f3a9b853912a23423b02a753172	a 10-bit 1 ms/s segmented dual-sampling sar adc with reduced switching energy		Abstract This paper implements a 10-bit segmented Dual-Sampling SAR ADC for a WPT system. To solve the mid-code problem of the Dual-Sampling structure and improve the linearity, a segmented structure is adopted in capacitive DAC. A new switching scheme is proposed for MSBs decisions to skip some of the unnecessary switching steps. This ADC is applied to digitize analog inputs of the different sub-blocks of the WPT system. Applying these techniques reduces the unit capacitor size, as well as the power consumption while improving the linearity of the system. The overall system achieves 9.8 ENOB at 1 MS/s conversion speed and consumes 19.6 μA from 3 V supply voltage. DNL and INL for this structure are measured to be −0.63–0.56 and −0.85–0.79 LSB respectively.

c3762702ba6ca900470b303be8e623b734e422f1	a low-power high-speed comparator for precise applications		"""A low-power comparator is presented. pMOS transistors are used at the input of the preamplifier of the comparator as well as the latch stage. Both stages are controlled by a special local clock generator. At the evaluation phase, the latch is activated with a delay to achieve enough preamplification gain and avoid excess power consumption. Meanwhile, small cross-coupled transistors increase the preamplifier gain and decrease the input common mode of the latch to strongly turn on the pMOS transistors (at the latch input) and reduce the delay. Unlike the conventional comparator, the proposed structure let us set the optimum delay for preamplification and avoid excess power consumption.

Regarding the basic readout circuit, it comprises only one source follower and one current source to establish a self-biased configuration for a single ISFET device. Due to elimination of body effect, it displays linear transfer characteristic in the experimental result. Incorporating temperature compensation further improves the thermal stability of the ISFET device in pH sensing function. This has been validated by the experimental results on pH values ranging from 4 to 9 in a temperature range of 22 degC to 50 degC from the measurement setup. The pH7 parameter is used as a reference in the method.

The proposed Vth extraction circuit eliminates the nonlinear temperature-dependent mobility and mobility ratio terms, and it achieves a wide operating temperature range from -25 °C to 250 °C. The threshold-voltage temperature coefficient (TC) mismatch between nMOS and pMOS is compensated by selecting different channel lengths. Fabricated in the 1-μm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS process, the voltage reference achieves a box model TC of 27 parts per million (ppm) (mean) for an operating temperature range of -25 °C-250 °C and 18.7 ppm (mean) for a range of 25 °C-150 °C. Furthermore, the ratiometric output achieves mean temperature inaccuracy within ±1.8% over a temperature of 275 °C.	cmos;coefficient;nmos logic;nonlinear system;pmos logic;silicon on insulator;topological insulator;voltage reference	Jerrin Pathrose;Lei Zou;Kevin T.

The programmable gain function is achieved by varying the effective transconductance ratios of input and output stages, which is realized through innovative binary-weighted and triode-region transistor ladder. The proposed technique effectively overcomes the problems associated with the implementation of resistors ladder in these types of structures. The operational principle of this unique structure is discussed, its most important formulas are derived, and its outstanding performance is verified by post-layout simulations in TSMC 0.18- $mu$ m N-well CMOS fabrication process. Owing to its unique construction, the proposed circuit combines the ever interesting constant bandwidth, linear-in-decibel, and fine-step programmable gain range merits all in a simple and low power structure. The core of proposed structure draws only 36.5 $mu$ W from 1.8-V power supply. The circuit is capable of delivering a wide programmable range of about 37 dB and operating at frequencies up to 20 MHz. To approve the robustness of the structure, full process, voltage, and temperature variation analysis of the circuit is investigated through corner case and Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo simulations show standard deviation values of less than 0.21 $mu$ W and 0.5 dB in power consumption and voltage gain, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed structure would lend itself well for use in applications that demand high ratios of frequency over power consumption.	transistor	Hassan Faraji Baghtash	2018	IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCSII.2017.2675914	fully differential amplifier;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;open-loop gain;rf power amplifier	EDA	62.29596103148595	48.316222861265445	57907

The output power of a traditional cascode is limited by the early saturation of the common-base(CB) device. The interstage matched cascode can be employed to improve the power handling ability through optimizing the input impedance of the CB device. The minimized power mismatch between the CB and the common-emitter(CE) devices results in an improved saturated output power. To demonstrate the technique for power amplifier designs at mmwave frequencies, a single-branch cascode based PA using single-finger devices and a two-way combined based PA using three-finger devices are fabricated. The single-branch design shows a measured power gain of 9.2 dB and a saturated output power of 12.3 dBm at 67.2 GHz and the two-way combined design shows a power gain of 9.5 dB with a saturated output power of 18.6 dBm at 72.6 GHz. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In three-phase system, a PI controller can track the reactive current without steady-state error theoretically because it is converted to DC component in synchronous rotating coordination. What's more, because of the constraints of device switching capacity and grid voltage disturbances like low-order harmonic distortion, the harmonic characteristics of device output current is poor. Aiming at improving the accuracy of reactive power compensation, ability of anti-disturbance of grid voltage and the distortion performance of the output current, this paper presents a Proportional Resonant (PR) controller with multiple resonant frequencies for single-phase SVG. The controller design is taken in z-domain for convenient digital implementation. The superiority of control strategy is verified through created simulation models and experimental prototype.	control theory;discontinuous galerkin method;distortion;matlab;prototype;requirement;resonance;scalable vector graphics;simulation;static single assignment form;steady state	Kun Yang;Lei Chen;Yuhong Jia;Guozhu Chen	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/ISIE.2012.6237145	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Embedded	66.1388425661421	39.322698648468354	58170

48cbfd79ce775b6d513fde77691f06d2a4eeb47c	solar panel modelling for low illuminance indoor conditions		In the energy harvesting domain, the modelling of a solar panel plays an important role in predicting the energy availability of energy harvesting system applications. Indoor environments, which are illuminated by artificial light sources, have typically much lower illumination levels than outdoor environments. In this paper, we compare the behaviour of different types of models under low illuminance conditions, in order to investigate sufficient modelling approaches for indoor environments. Previous work has shown that equivalent circuit modelling may have reduced performance under low illuminance conditions. Instead, we investigate behavioural models and compare their results with the equivalent circuit model. Two different types of behavioural models have been tested, namely artificial neural network models and polynomial curve fitting models. The comparison of these three models has shown that it is not possible to establish which of the modelling methods performs best, because each of them have strong points and shortcomings making the ideal choice application dependant.	artificial neural network;curve fitting;equivalent circuit;illumination (image);polynomial	Xinyv Ma;Sebastian Bader;Bengt Oelmann	2016	2016 IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference (NORCAS)	10.1109/NORCHIP.2016.7792891	electronic engineering;simulation;engineering;optics	Robotics	72.62410664861058	48.010578834904486	58541

However, the main challenges of a transcutanoues energy transfer (TET) system are the temperature rise caused by power loss in the implanted circuitry and the changes in positioning between the external and internal coils due to fitting and changes in posture. This study presents a TET system with a closed-loop frequency-based power regulation method to deliver the right amount of power to the load under variable coil coupling conditions. After implanting a TET system into adult sheep, the temperature rise in the internal and external coils of a TET system was measured for power delivery in the range of 5 W to 15 W. The sheep was housed in a temperature controlled (16 plusmn1degC, humidity 50plusmn10%) room, in accordance with the standard protocols implemented at the University of Auckland for sheep studies. A power-loss analysis for the overall system was performed. The system was capable of regulating power for axially aligned separations of up to 16 mm. The maximum power efficiency of the overall system was 82.1% and a maximum temperature rise of 2.7degC was observed on the implanted secondary coil.	alignment;body position;coefficient;coil device component;dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry;electronic circuit;energy transfer;exposure to humidity;implantation procedure;implants;intrauterine devices;maximum power transfer theorem;medical devices;offset binary;performance per watt;poor posture;protocols documentation;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);simulation;transformer	Thushari Dissanayake;Aiguo Patrick Hu;Simon Malpas;Laura Bennet;Andrew J.

The circuit can operate with a low supply voltage, e.g. VDU < 1 V when it is implemented with a 0.18-pm technology. It requires no bias current, thus have very low power dissipation.

This paper presents techniques for obtaining realizable and accurate reduced models for two-port and multi-port RC circuits. The proposed method is also particularly suitable for interconnect reduction for nonlinear circuit simulation and for interconnect post-processing in a parasitic extractor. The method has two limitations. First, it only considers the first few moments of the transfer function; however, that is accurate enough for RC circuits. Second, the amount of interconnect reduction is topology dependent. Although, most on-chip interconnect topologies are well suited for the method proposed. Accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated for various realistic examples.	electrical connection;electronic circuit simulation;integrated circuit;linear circuit;nonlinear system;rc circuit;randomness extractor;transfer function;video post-processing	Anirudh Devgan;Peter R.

An integrated CMOS power amplifier (PA) with the ability to transmit arbitrary instantaneous UWB waveforms has significant value in realizing a completely-integrated silicon UWB imaging transceiver. UWB radar and imaging systems that utilize waveforms occupying the FCC-allocated lower GHz frequency bands (960 to 3100MHz) are attractive for wireless search-and-rescue and see-through-the-wall sensing applications as well as within-the-wall imaging due to the lower electromagnetic attenuation of most materials at these frequencies. The main contribution of this paper is the realization of an integrated 0.13µm CMOS power amplifier that is suitable for signals with an ultra-wide instantaneous bandwidth. The UWB PA is compatible with previously-reported true-time-delay-based beam-forming systems for low-GHz high-resolution imaging applications [1].	audio power amplifier;cmos;frequency band;group delay and phase delay;image resolution;radar;transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Jonathan Roderick;Hossein Hashemi	2009	2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977464	medical imaging;electricity generation;electronic engineering;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;electrical impedance;cmos;bandwidth	EDA	61.27339474990475	56.182892954900296	58705

DG offer great opportunities such as voltage support and reduced customer costs. However, high DG penetration can give rise to network constraint breaches such as voltage and frequency limits, fault ride through capability, system security, reliability and stability. To avoid these breaches regulation of DG is essential. With the introduction of vast numbers of DG, common regulation approaches can lead to under utilisation of DG resources, requiring unnecessary high voltage (HV) grid imports and increasing line losses. In this study we aim to design a network partitioning strategy that enables the efficient management of DG, and maximises DG output and reduces costs. We introduce a subnet partitioning strategy that maximises the utilisation of DG power by balancing it with local demand, where locality is quantified in a modified electrical distance. We also present a case study that compares three partitioning strategies under a variety of network demands. Results show that the proposed power balanced partitioning technique can provide a structure to the DG regulation that offers better efficiency of DG operation than other partitioning strategies. In addition, the adaptive nature of the partitioning can make it capable of reducing HV grid power imports, reducing line losses, and improving voltage profiles. Furthermore, such a partitioning approach can add robustness over a range of network conditions.	binary space partitioning;computer security;discontinuous galerkin method;network partition;principle of locality;robustness (computer science);subnetwork	Benjamin Millar;Danchi Jiang;Md.

Quantisation of the analogue current measurement signal leads to measurement errors which are a direct consequence of the uncertainty with which an N-bit resolution analogue-to-digital converter assigns a binary word for a given analogue input value. This paper presents comprehensive simulations of the performance of different current sensors monitored by the DSP unit and discusses aspects of compatibility between the sensor dynamic range and the resolution of an analogue-to-digital conversion process. Recommendations are given on how to match the OCT to the given A/D parameters, and vice versa, in order to meet specified accuracy requirements.	digital signal processing;transducer	Pawel Niewczas;Andrew Cruden;W.

Portable devices require a strong power consumption reduction to increase the battery life. Since a considerable part of the power consumption is due to the analog baseband filters, improved and/or novel analog filter design approaches have to be developed.

The regulator was designed around Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller, which acquires temperature in the microreactor and sets the output power of the heater in order to maintain the required temperature in the microevaporator stage of the microreactor. It also serves as a user interface device for controlling the operating conditions in the microreactor. The temperature is sampled with an integrated platinum temperature dependent resistor. Its output is amplified and applied to the internal analog to digital converter of the microcontroller. The temperature control is achieved by ON-OFF regulation principle with an adjustable hysteresis. The heater actuation circuit comprises a boost converter, controlled by pulse width modulated signal from the microcontroller. The output of the boost converter is applied to the platinum (Pt) heater in the microreactor evaporation stage.

Our circuit is based on an affine transformation of a reaction-diffusion cellular neural network (CNN), and uses differential pairs with multiple-input floating-gate (MIFG) MOS transistors to implement both the nonlinearity and summation of CNN cells. As a result, the circuit operates in voltage mode, and thus it is expected to reduce power consumption. Due to good matching accuracy of devices, the circuit generates stable rhythmic patterns for robot locomotion control. From experimental results on fabricated chip using a standard CMOS 1.5-/spl mu/m process, we show that the chip yields the desired results; i.e., stable rhythmic pattern generation and low power consumption.	artificial neural network;brainwave entrainment;cmos;cellular neural network;central pattern generator;experiment;feedback;feedforward neural network;integrated circuit;mobile robot;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;robot locomotion;servo;transistor	Kazuki Nakada;Tetsuya Asai;Yoshihito Amemiya	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2005.849120	chip;control engineering;motion control;central pattern generator;electronic engineering;cellular neural network;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control theory;affine transformation;mathematics;reaction–diffusion system	EDA	55.65580721626102	44.4744654838585	59238

A fully integrated CMOS solution has the potential to drastically reduce costs enough to hit consumer price points.

However, constraints on memory, speed, and energy currently limit the processing capabilities within a sensor network. In this paper, we describe how ultra-low-power analog circuitry can be integrated with sensor nodes to create energy-efficient sensor networks. We present a custom analog front-end which performs spectral analysis at a fraction of the power used by a digital counterpart. We then show that the front-end can be combined with existing sensor nodes to (1) selectively wake up the mote based upon spectral content of the signal, thus increasing battery life without missing interesting events, and to (2) achieve low-power signal analysis using an analog spectral decomposition block, freeing up digital computation resources for higher-level analysis.	analog signal processing	Brandon Rumberg;David W.

A novel model is proposed for the jitter; this model takes into account the radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise in the head of an ATE. The RMS value of the jitter is measured at the output signal of the testhead board to validate the proposed model. For measuring the RMS value, a novel circuitry has been designed on a daughter board to circumvent ground noise and connectivity problems arising from the head environment. An H-field is applied externally at the loop filter of a phase-locked loop (PLL), thus permitting the measurement of the RMS jitter to verify the transfer function between radiated EMI and jitter variation. The error between measured and predicted jitters is within a 15% level at both 200 kHz and 500 kHz.	arnold tongue;built-in test equipment;emi;electronic circuit;interference (communication);phase-locked loop;transfer function	Young-Jun Lee;Thomas Kane;Jong-Jin Lim;Young Jun Schiano;Yong-Bin Kim;Fred J.

In quantum technology, reading out devices is difficult; measuring may destroy the information stored in the quantum system. Optimal design can be achieved by signal processing circuits based on the nullor that, theoretically, do not extract power and thus energy from the system. Because of the nullator properties at the input of the nullor two-port and the norator properties of the output of the nullor, signals can be tapped from the quantum system without absorbing power from it; energy to do so is provided by external sources. Circuits based on the nullor are theoretically circuits for reading out signals from devices in quantumtimal circuits for reading out signals from devices in quantum systems and for processing this data afterwards. In the paper, basic sensing circuit concepts based on the nullor and their descriptions based on the chain-matrix (K-matrix) are presented. Some possible candidates for implementing the theoretical schemes are discussed, and as a possible application, a single-electron tunneling electrometer is described.

The proposed architecture is based on non-uniform sampling, whose sampling instants depend on the amplitude of the input voltage. The proposed design has the power performance advantage for an input voltage close to the upper reference voltage. Thus, the proposed architecture is suitable for the applications in which the input signal rarely assumes voltage values closer to the lower reference voltage. The design is simulated, at the transistor level, in a 180-nm CMOS technology. The results show that about 96.7% of the power can be saved in the best case (input voltage in the vicinity of upper reference voltage) when compared to a conventional flash ADC.	analog-to-digital converter;best, worst and average case;cmos;closed-circuit television;flash adc;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);transistor	R.

The software system, MONSTR, has been developed and applied to several industrial examples. The results of this analysis are directly entered to the circuit simulator, HSPICE, as the actual temperature for each circuit element and thus an integrated electro-thermal simulation is performed.	electrical element;electronic circuit simulation;finite difference;finite element method;numerical analysis;spice 2;software system	Vladimir A.

In general, the single-ended OTA configuration is simpler than the multiple-output OTA counterpart and the requirement of grounded capacitors is preferable for an integrated circuit fabrication process. Therefore, the proposed circuit provides a simple circuitry by using only single-ended OTA and highly suitable for integrated circuit (IC) implementation by using grounded capacitors. The condition of oscillation and the frequency of oscillation of the circuit can be set orthogonally. The circuit also offers an electronic control of the frequency of oscillation through adjusting the bias currents of OTAs. The theoretical results are verified by PSPICE simulators. From simulation results, it can be expressed that the proposed circuit agrees well with theory.	electronic circuit;integrated circuit;operational amplifier;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation;single-ended signaling	Montree Kumngern;Somyot Junnapiya	2012	2012 Fourth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSyN.2012.24	computer science;control theory;cmos	EDA	64.70986964015992	48.59091644812655	59723
1466af336c847c068c9f6c11c629e3f8b3c58263	theory and design of frequency-tunable absorptive bandstop filters		Absorptive bandstop filters are a relatively new class of bandstop filter, which are able to achieve very high levels of stopband rejection with relatively low-quality-factor resonators, in contrast to typical reflective bandstop filters, whose stopband rejections are limited by the quality factors of their resonators. This paper performs an in-depth theoretical and practical analysis of this class of filter, presenting design principles for reducing the sensitivity to process variation, increasing the tuning range over which the filters can operate with good performance, and addressing the practical non-ideal effects of implementation, such as frequency variation of couplings and quality factor. Four varactor-tuned microstrip bandstop filters are presented to verify the presented theory. They illustrate the design tradeoffs between selectivity and tuning range, choice of coupling topology and tuning range, and show the benefits and drawbacks of cascading stages to create higher-order filters.	cascading failure;microstrip;rejection sampling;selectivity (electronic);simulation	Mark D.

Double-sided parallel-strip line network causes electromagnetic waves to be coupled to the network surrounding the object and pass them across it without forward and backward scattering. Using of these unloaded transmission lines makes the simplicity of the structure feasible. Achieving a broadband cloaking condition is the other advantages of the proposed structure. Large object cloaking is provided by the using of a new structure which has an empty space in the center of similar previous structures. Simulation results demonstrate the quality of cloaking for different dimensions in conventional and proposed structures.

Two power management aspects are considered: 1) equal power sharing, which is realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing algorithm; and 2) optimal power dispatch, which is achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. The proposed algorithms are based on the application of the average consensus theory along with voltage sensitivity analysis. Each distributed generation (DG) unit exchanges information with its neighbors, thus locally updating its no-load voltage setting to achieve the supervisory control objectives. The incorporation of DG droop-based control renders the proposed algorithms fully distributed with a reduced number of agents. The stability of the proposed algorithms is addressed, as well as the convergence of the proposed DEIC algorithm. Real-time OPAL-RT simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop application.	agent-based model;algorithm;cpl;column (database);current source;discontinuous galerkin method;dynamic dispatch;emoticon;expanded memory;hil bus;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;iteration;mathematical model;microgrid;performance rating;power management;real-time clock;rendering (computer graphics);requirement;voltage regulator module;voltage source;windows rt;xfig	Amr A.

This paper introduces the stimulus error identification and removal (SEIR) method for accurately testing ADC linearity using signal generators that may be significantly less linear than the device under test. In the SEIR approach, two imprecise nonlinear but functionally related excitations are applied to the ADC input to obtain two sets of ADC output data. The SEIR algorithm then uses the redundant information from the two sets of data to accurately identify the nonlinearity errors in the stimuli. The algorithm then removes the stimulus error from the ADC output data, allowing the ADC nonlinearity to be accurately measured. For a high resolution ADC, the total computation time of the SEIR algorithm is significantly less than the data acquisition time and therefore does not contribute to testing time. The new approach was experimentally validated on production test hardware with a commercial 16-bit successive approximation ADC. Integral nonlinearity test results that are well within the device specification of /spl plusmn/2 least significant bits were obtained by using 7-bit linear input signals. This approach provides an enabling technology for cost-effective full-code testing of high precision ADCs in production test and for potential cost-effective chip-level implementation of a built-in self-test capability.	16-bit;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;bmp file format;built-in self-test;computation;data acquisition;device under test;elegant degradation;experiment;image resolution;integral nonlinearity;least significant bit;line source;nonlinear system;programming paradigm;requirement;successive approximation adc;time complexity;waveform	Le Jin;Kumar L.

This paper develops a general theory of noiseless load-sharing matrix switches, from which many new switches can be derived. Considerable design flexibility is thereby provided, with respect to the number of inputs, the types of input drivers, and the winding ratios. As an example, previous results (Chien) indicate that 20 inputs are required for a certain type of 16-output switch. The present re-results show that only 17 inputs are required.		Peter G.

bd04b09a3b3475445df8aa41b67cf81966efe1fb	pso based power sharing scheme for an islanded dc microgrid system		This paper proposes a power sharing scheme for an Islanded DC microgrid with hybrid energy storage system (HESS). HESS comprises of battery and supercapacitor (SC), where the usage of supercapacitor reduces the current stresses on the battery. This scheme reduces the losses in the HESS interfacing converters along with State of Charge (SOC) balancing. To maintain a constant DC link voltage a DC link voltage controller is employed which is quick and has better regulation compared to droop controlled scheme. An objective function is formed by taking the power loss and SOC into consideration. A centralized controller is employed for sensing the battery's SOC and current demanded by DC link voltage controller. This centralized controller uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for solving the objective function and generate optimized coefficients which will share the power among the HESS interfacing converters. The proposed scheme is tested and validated using MATLAB based simulink environment.	centralized computing;coefficient;computer data storage;controllers;equilibrium;loss function;matlab;microgrid;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;sandy bridge;simulation;simulink;software release life cycle;state of charge;system on a chip;verification and validation;verifying specimen;voltage controller;voltage regulation	Leela Krishna Vedulla;Mahesh Kumar Mishra	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216070	control engineering;voltage;control theory;engineering;voltage controller;battery (electricity);state of charge;control theory;voltage droop;energy storage;microgrid	EDA	63.702462911237525	37.53928536636813	60245

This is because conventional integrated temperature sensors are based on BJTs, which have a strongly process-, stress- and temperature-dependent saturation current (Is). Together with other leakage currents, this leads to rapidly increasing temperature errors at high temperatures: up to ±3.0°C at 200°C [1].	sensor;spectral leakage	Caspar P.

The antenna consists of a rectangular patch with two bevels. To realize notch characteristics in 3.3---3.7 GHz for WiMax, and in 5.15---5.85 GHz for WLAN band, two round shape slots are etched in radiating patch. The third notch band in 7.1---7.76 GHz for X-band downlink satellite communication is obtained by etching a pair of C-shaped slot on the ground. The proposed antenna exhibits a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern in the $$H$$H-plane, and a dipole-like radiation pattern in the $$E$$E-plane for the entire pass band. The proposed antennas are successfully simulated and measured. The individual effects of the each slot on band notch characteristics are also investigated. The gain of the proposed triple band notched antenna is relatively stable across the operating frequency band except at notched bands and thereby making the proposed antenna suitable for practical UWB applications.	ultra-wideband	Pritam Singh Bakariya;Santanu Dwari;Manas Sarkar	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-014-2268-z	omnidirectional antenna;antenna factor;monopole antenna;random wire antenna;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;computer science;patch antenna;antenna;radiation pattern;coaxial antenna;slot antenna;dipole antenna;antenna efficiency	Mobile	66.11057439907152	57.97529145816454	60398

This technique makes the modulator less sensitive to amplifier non-linearities in the integrator. Moreover, the number of comparators in the multibit quantizer can be greatly reduced since the quantizer only needs to resolve signals with maximum amplitude much less than its own full-scale. Therefore, power and area for the quantizer and loading on the integrator that precedes the quantizer are also reduced.

For this purpose, not only the power flow but also the nonlinear characteristic and dynamic impedance of batteries need to be emulated. In this paper, nonlinear local model networks are used to obtain dynamic battery models with high fidelity that can be computed in real time. This approach also allows the extraction of local linear impedance models for high-bandwidth impedance emulation, leading to a tighter coupling between the test bed and simulation model with predictable closed-loop dynamics. A model predictive controller that achieves optimal control with adherence to system constraints is extended to impedance control and robustness against constant power loads. This results not only in superior dynamic performance but also in stable dc-bus voltage control even for testing of tightly controlled electric motor inverters with negative differential input resistance. Since the controller design is based on a model of the test bed setup including the virtual battery model, emulator hardware, and input characteristics of the powertrain under test, it is possible to systematically analyze stability.	characteristic impedance;differential signaling;emulator;extended validation certificate;hil bus;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;input impedance;inverter (logic gate);nominal impedance;nonlinear system;optimal control;power inverter;power supply;testbed;traction teampage	Oliver König;Christoph Hametner;Guenter Prochart;Stefan Jakubek	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2253070	robust control;control engineering;electronic engineering;optimal control;engineering;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	Robotics	64.38616992411917	37.525780946072025	60539

The type of structure used for this purpose often features a considerable length. This characteristic can result in a frequency dependence of the measured capacitance value that can easily lead to under-estimate the k value of the insulator. The aim of this paper is to show and explain the frequency dependence by the study and the modeling of the typical interline capacitance structure. The results of this study lead to determining a design parameter and a measurement procedure to circumvent the problem.	interlaced video	Michele Stucchi;Karen Maex	2002	IEEE Trans.

The proposed circuit utilizes a bulk driven cascode current mirror through an adaptive gate bias technique, that results in a high output impedance over a very wide output voltage range, accurate Charge/ Discharge current matching, which minimizes the steady-state phase error in a phase-locked loop (PLL), and low transient glitches. The current variation is less than 0.5 μA or 1% over output range. Therefore proposed circuit stabilizes the loop bandwidth of the charge pump PLL and maximizes the dynamic range. The charge pump is designed and simulated under the power supply of 1.8 V in 0.18μm CMOS technology to verify the efficiency of the proposed techniques. Monte Carlo process variations and mismatch simulations show that the current variation in the proposed charge pump is very low.	arnold tongue;cmos;characteristic impedance;charge pump;computer simulation;current mirror;discharger;dynamic range;glitch;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;monte carlo method;output impedance;phase-locked loop;power supply;simulation;single-ended signaling;steady state	Hamid Reza Erfani Jazi;Noushin Ghaderi	2014	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.10.20130934	electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;charge pump;engineering;electrical engineering;low voltage	EDA	61.31757811651797	48.10494215686107	60608

However, model errors and imperfect power efficiency lead to evident dc-link voltage tracking offset. This paper proposes a revised quasi-centralized direct model predictive control (RQC-DMPC) scheme for back-to-back converter PMSG wind turbine systems, within which, the dc-link voltage is directly controlled by a grid side predictive controller with a flexibly designed cost function using a revised dynamic reference generation concept. The dc-link voltage steady status tracking errors are eliminated. To reduce the computational efforts of the classical scheme, a computational efficient concept is incorporated into the proposed method. The proposed scheme is implemented on an entirely field programmable gate array-based platform. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experimental data. The dc-link control performance comparison with classical proportional-integration controller-based methods and the QC-DMPC scheme under different scenarios are also experimentally investigated. The results emphasize the improvement of the proposed RQC-DMPC scheme.	centralized computing;electric power conversion;experiment;field-programmable gate array;loss function;performance per watt;synchronous data link control	James Zhenbin Zhang;Tongjing Sun;Fengxiang Wang;José Rodríguez;Ralph Kennel	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2573768	wind power;wind speed;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;torque;model predictive control;physics;field-programmable gate array	Robotics	66.30280935478257	37.75117036163041	60631

The bidirectional transmission line coupler based electromagnetic clip connector, which can be used to make local area network connections similar to clips, suppresses the signal reflections on the bus enabling 280 Mb/s data rate which is 7 times faster than the state-of-the-art in-vehicle LAN transceiver. Since all modules are connected with the shortest distance, this connection system can reduce wire harness weight by 30%. Forward error correction is done by N-x Manchester encoding on the transmitter side and majority voting on the receiver side. High noise immunity is achieved through synchronous receiving by the digital clock recovery circuit which is robust against noise. Communication tests were conducted at 280 Mb/s with 10 transceivers fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology connected by a 10 m unshielded twisted pair cable. Evaluation of the bit error rate and radiation spectrum confirmed that the ISO specifications concerning electromagnetic susceptibility and the CISPR ones concerning electromagnetic interference are satisfied.	acoustic coupler;bit error rate;blu-ray;cmos;clock recovery;clock signal;cross-correlation;data rate units;emi;error detection and correction;forward error correction;interference (communication);interrupt;mebibyte;megabyte;multi-level cell;oversampling;power dividers and directional couplers;reflection (computer graphics);signal reflection;test harness;transceiver;transmission line;transmitter;twisted pair	Atsutake Kosuge;Akira Okada;Masao Taguchi;Hiroki Ishikuro;Tadahiro Kuroda	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2015.2512709	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;electromagnetic compatibility	EDA	62.46887365329904	55.7824150183653	60661

The oscillation frequency is several GHz and can be tuned by both a DC bias current and an external DC magnetic field. High compactness, high tunability and full compatibility with standard CMOS process make this spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) a promising candidate for future RF transceivers. The main issues to be addressed are spectral purity and output power. First measurements on a hybrid built connecting the STNO to a dedicated wideband amplifier show that today's performance in terms of power is close to but not yet compatible with telecommunication standard requirements. Using time domain analysis we show that frequency fluctuations are an issue for spectral purity. Frequency synthesis concepts based on STNOs are also discussed.	amplifier;biasing;cmos;domain analysis;frequency synthesizer;gnu nano;integrated circuit;layer 2 tunneling protocol;mathematical optimization;process optimization;pure function;radio frequency;requirement;spintronics;transceiver;triple modular redundancy	Patrick Villard;Ursula Ebels;Dimitri Houssameddine;Jordan A.

e8bf71da851d7a2c898632c44c4a4abb84ad51ea	a 13μm cmos soc for simultaneous multichannel optogenetics and electrophysiological brain recording		Optogenetics and multi-unit electrophysiological recording are state-of-the-art approaches in neuroscience to observe neural microcircuits in vivo [1]. Thereby, brain-implantable devices incorporating optical stimulation and low-noise data acquisition means have been designed based on custom integrated circuits (IC) to study the brain of small freely behaving laboratory animals. However, no existing IC provides multichannel optogenetic photo-stimulation along with multi-unit electrophysiological recording capability within the same die [2-5]. They also lack critical features: they are not multichannel and/or do not include an ADC [6], or they address only one signal modality [5-6], i.e., either local field potentials (LFP) or action potentials (AP). In this paper, we report an IC for simultaneous multichannel optogenetics and electrophysiological recording addressing both LFP and AP signals all at once. This 0.13μm CMOS chip, which includes 4/10 stimulation/recording channels, is enclosed inside a small wireless optogenetic platform, and is demonstrated with simultaneous in vivo optical stimulation and electrophysiological recordings with a virally mediated Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) rat.	action potential;cmos;channelrhodopsin;data acquisition;integrated circuit;international conference on functional programming;least fixed point;modality (human–computer interaction);optogenetics;system on a chip;video-in video-out	Gabriel Gagnon-Turcotte;Christian Ethier;Yves De Koninck;Benoit Gosselin	2018	2018 IEEE International Solid - State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2018.8310386	electronic engineering;chip;electrophysiology;neuroscience;computer science;local field potential;integrated circuit;cmos;optogenetics	EDA	55.409944684961324	46.63912879472021	60979

Rules for selecting the appropriate wordlengths of the constituent DDSMs are derived which ensure that the spectral performance of the bus-splitting architecture is comparable to that of the conventional design but with less hardware. Behavioral simulations and experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions.

Emerging nanoscale solutions with radio frequency, optical, ultrasonic, or molecular channels in OC and IB media have various challenges including achievable footprints and frequency, energy consumption, medium dependent features, and interference. In this paper, major challenges are addressed with magneto-inductive (MI) transceivers by combining the advantages of THz operation frequency, unique features of intercalated multi-layer graphene (MLG) coils and range extension with MI waveguides. Our design promises scalable and high performance solutions for the OC interconnect bottleneck while providing biocompatible and universal solutions for challenging IB medium. The proposed solution is theoretically analyzed and numerically compared with the copper-based alternatives, and the practical challenges are discussed. Simulation results achieve high capacity (several Tbit/s) and ultra-low power (500 zJ/bit) wireless communications while providing high (hundreds of kWs) and efficient (109 W/mm2) wireless PT at several millimeters. In addition, unique properties of MLG such as lightweight structure, biocompatibility, current carrying capacity, and planar manufacturability make the solution more promising for challenging environments.	design for manufacturability;gnu nano;graphene;inductive reasoning;interconnect bottleneck;interference (communication);layer (electronics);numerical analysis;radio frequency;scalability;semiconductor;simulation;terabit;transceiver	Burhan Gulbahar	2017	IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications	10.1109/TMBMC.2017.2655022	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;graphene;radio frequency;physics;transceiver	Mobile	61.86059148033887	58.26812490620752	61126

The focus of this paper is the design of a tunable continuous time bandpass delta-sigma modulator that utilizes an excess loop delay compensation technique proposed in [1] to optimize the SNR of the modulator, besides preserving its stability by incorporating a full clock cycle delay. An improved, low noise, compact gyrator-C structure is proposed to obtain a high-Q bandpass filter subsequently used in the design of a second-order bandpass delta-sigma modulator clocked at 400 MHz for direct conversion of narrow band signals around 100 MHz. The proposed structure eliminates the need of a capacitor bank/array for the coarse tuning of the modulator since this structure enables coarse tuning in the range of 80 to 120 MHz and fine tuning of 5 MHz above or below the centre frequency. This modulator has been implemented in AMI 0.5µ CMOS process and achieves an SNR of 46 dB over a bandwidth of 1 MHz, calculated from post-layout simulations. The power consumption of this design is 49 mW at a supply of 3V.	cmos;clock rate;clock signal;delta-sigma modulation;gyrator;offset binary;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Akhil Gupta;Shahrokh Ahmadi;Mona E.

The proposed method is based on a prototype filter design and is capable to efficiently address multiband signals. Recent practical implementations recommend the use of the equiripple (ER) filter. Numerical results show that for a given complexity and for a given PAPR reduction, the proposed method outperforms the performance of the ER filter in terms of power spectral density and error vector magnitude (EVM). Finally, the proposed method is extended to address the potential heterogeneity of the EVM specifications, even within the same band. We show that our approach provides an additional gain in terms of PAPR reduction capability.	adaptive filter;algorithm;clipping (computer graphics);coefficient;distortion;erdős–rényi model;filter design;finite impulse response;high-level programming language;out-of-band agreement;power architecture platform reference;prototype filter;rejection sampling;spectral density	Sylvain Traverso	2016	2016 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2016.7565043	adaptive filter;erbium;distortion;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;prototype	EDA	60.36168979576821	58.33177664734692	61284

In MLGFIM, the problem domain is first divided into multilevel cubes. Next, the peer-level Green's function interpolation technique is employed, and then, a new lower-to-upper-level Green's function interpolation technique is devised. They are used with the multilevel discretization to speed up the matrix-vector multiplications in the iterative solution in which a computational complexity of O(N) is achieved. The MLGFIM is used to extract the capacitances encountered in radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) and microelectromechanical systems. Moreover, to demonstrate its efficiency both in simulation speed and memory storage requirement, MLGFIM is compared with FastCap for free space problems and applied to extract capacitances from multilayered structures. For problems with 375,000 unknowns, the proposed method only requires 343 MB of computer memory.	computational complexity theory;computer memory;discretization;integrated circuit;interpolation;iterative method;megabyte;microelectromechanical systems;olap cube;problem domain;radio frequency;simulation;the matrix	Hao Gang Wang;Chi Hou Chan;Leung Tsang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2005.850804	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;mathematics;rfic;algorithm;quantum mechanics;electrostatics	EDA	73.145590674459	44.84232091255909	61309

In this paper, WPIC is composed of two parts, one provided by hydro power and the other provided by thermal power. After proper consideration of wind power randomness, WPIC provided by hydro power is determined by the regulation ability of reservoir in hydro power plants. Then, a concept of equivalent thermal power units output duration curve is proposed to accurately evaluate WPIC provided by thermal power in a probabilistic perspective. Numerical tests are conducted on Gansu power grid in 2015. Monthly WPIC under different scenarios are determined, which validates the effectiveness of this approach.	randomness	Can Sun;Zhaohong Bie;Gengfeng Li;Bowen Hua	2012	2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465821	wind power;power station;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;base load power plant;peaking power plant;engineering;electrical engineering;operations management;electric power system;distributed generation;grid energy storage;power optimizer	EDA	62.21754938557502	35.65732813604132	61401

The shunt active filter, realized by a current-controlled inverter, has been used to compensate a nonlinear current load by receiving its reference from a neural adaptive notch filter. This is a recursive notch filter for the fundamental grid frequency (50 Hz) and is based on the use of a linear adaptive neuron (ADALINE). The filter's parameters are made adaptive with respect to the grid frequency fluctuations. A phase-locked loop system is used to extract the fundamental component from the coupling point voltage and to estimate the actual grid frequency. The current control of the inverter has been performed by a multiresonant controller. The estimated grid frequency is fed to the neural adaptive filter and to the multiresonant controller. In this way, the inverter creates a current equal in amplitude and opposite in sign to the load harmonic current, thus producing an almost sinusoidal grid current. An automatic tuning of the multiresonant controller is implemented, which recognizes the largest three harmonics of the load current to be compensated by the APF. The stability analysis of the proposed control system is shown. The methodology has been applied in numerical simulations and experimentally to a properly devised test setup, also in comparison with the classic sinusoidal current control based on the P-Q theory.	adaline;active filter;adaptive filter;computer simulation;control system;experiment;neuron;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;phase-locked loop;power inverter;recursion	Maurizio Cirrincione;Marcello Pucci;Gianpaolo Vitale;Abdellatif Miraoui	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2022070	adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;voltage-controlled filter;kernel adaptive filter;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control system;harmonic analysis;automatic control;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;active filter	HPC	66.84706023480369	39.74202225742498	61469

Against this background, available transfer capability (ATC) has attracted increased attention. ATC refers to critical transmission power that can be added to the current power flow, and ATC can be used as a numeric index of stability. In this paper, tie-line transient stability is used as an index of transient stability improvement. We propose a method for using NAS battery systems to improve transient stability, where output is determined by H-infinity control theory.

In order to examine whether the proposed controllers can achieve stable operation, a novel stability analysis is introduced, which incorporates the advanced nonlinear concept of input-to-state stability and exploits the cascaded structure of the closed-loop system. This new methodology succeeds in proving asymptotic stability of the complete closed-loop system, under the only constraint of selecting negative feedback-loops. However, since the cascaded controller design is based on the time-scale separation assumption, a systematic tuning method is conducted for the accurate gain selection of both the inner-loop and outer-loop controllers. Finally, the theoretical analysis and the system performance are fully verified by simulation results which are further validated by experimental tests.	boost converter;control theory;database tuning;negative feedback;nonlinear system;simulation;voltage regulation	Konstantinos F.

An SDG is actually a radio front-end (RF FE) that generates digital samples at intermediate frequency (IF), which can be recorded and used in the future as test input to a baseband processing unit. The proposed SDG is based on the bandpass-sampling principle and works over combined (but overlapping) frequency bands of all three GNSS constellations (American Global Positioning System (GPS), European Galileo system and the Russian GLONASS system). It is observed that there is currently no commercially available multi-system multi-frequency GNSS SDG. This paper hopes to fill this gap. First, the overall architecture of the proposed SDG is described, followed by the detailed design of each block, namely, the bandpass & bandstop filters, and the frequency planning for the bandpass-sampling analog to digital converter (ADC).	analog-to-digital converter;baseband;frequency band;glonass;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;intermediate frequency;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);satellite navigation;simulation;undersampling	Sarang Thombre;Jari Nurmi	2012	2012 International Conference on Localization and GNSS	10.1109/ICL-GNSS.2012.6253114	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	59.18257056855891	57.213828331000826	61596

The transceiver has been fabricated in a standard 65-nm CMOS process. It in cludes a receiver with a 17.3-dB conversion gain and less than 8.0-dB noise figure, a transmitter with a 18.3-dB conversion gain, a 9.5-dBm output 1 dB compression point, a 10.9-dBm saturation output power and 8.8-% power added efficiency. The 60-GHz frequency synthesizer is implemented by a combination of a 20-GHz PLL and a 60-GHz quadrature injection-locked oscillator, which achieves a phase noise of -95 dBc/Hz@l MHz-offset at 60 GHz. The transceiver realizes IEEE802.15.3c full-rate wireless communication for all 16QAM/8PSK/QPSK/BPSK modes, and the communication distances with the full data rate using 2.16-GHz bandwidth, measured with an antenna built in the package, are 2.7-m (BPSK/QPSK) and 0.2-m (8PSK/16QAM). The measured maximum data rates are 8 Gb/s in QPSK mode and 11 Gb/s in 16QAM mode over a 5 cm wireless link within a bit error rate (BER) of <;10-3. The transceiver consumes 186 mW from a 1.2-V supply voltage while transmitting and 106 mW from 1.0-V supply voltage while receiving. Both transmitter and receiver are driven by a 20-GHz PLL, which consumes 66 mW, including output buffer, from a 1.2-V supply voltage.	bit error rate;cmos;channel (communications);frequency synthesizer;gigabyte;injection locking;noise figure;phase noise;phase-locked loop;post-wall waveguide;power-added efficiency;transceiver;transmitter;uncompressed video;x.690	Kenichi Okada;Ning Li;Kota Matsushita;Keigo Bunsen;Rui Murakami;Ahmed Musa;Takahiro Sato;Hiroki Asada;Naoki Takayama;Shogo Ito;Win Chaivipas;Ryo Minami;Tatsuya Yamaguchi;Yasuaki Takeuchi;Hiroyuki Yamagishi;Makoto Noda;Akira Matsuzawa	2011	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2011.2166184	electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;oscillation;cmos;injection locking;transceiver	Mobile	61.046687658175045	53.87550362758276	61653

The transformer yields current-stress reduction of energy-recovery switches, which affects circuit cost and reliability, and its turns ratio can be used to adjust the sustain-pulse slopes affecting gas-discharge uniformity. Dividing the recovery paths, the switching loss of the recovery switches is reduced by preventing abrupt change of the switch output capacitance charge current. In addition, the proposed circuit has a simpler structure because it does not use the recovery-path diodes, which should afford a large recovery current.

However, mm-wave synthesizers still rely on analog PLLs, predominantly of the integer-N type [1]. This is due to limited DCO tuning resolution and challenges in phase digitization including limited resolution, linearity, and input frequency of the TDC. The 60GHz ADPLL in [2] uses a 32× CML/injection-locked-frequency-divider chain in the DCO-TDC interface, which results in high power consumption (>0.5 of total power), large area, and high in-band phase noise. This paper presents a 60GHz phase-domain ADPLL with a 16GHz tuning range, digital phase extraction at fDCO/4, and several on-chip calibration techniques that enable low in-band phase noise and spurs.	cmos;device configuration overlay;frequency divider;in-phase and quadrature components;phase noise;phase-locked loop	Ahmed I.

Islanding detection and prevention is a mandatory requirement for grid-connected distributed generation (DG) systems. Several methods based on passive and active detection scheme have been proposed. Although passive schemes have a large non-detection zone (NDZ), concern has been raised on active method due to its degrading power-quality effect. Reliably detecting this condition is regarded by many as an ongoing challenge as existing methods are not entirely satisfactory. The main emphasis of the proposed scheme is to reduce the NDZ to as close as possible and to keep the output power quality unchanged. In addition, this technique can also overcome the problem of setting the detection thresholds inherent in the existing techniques. In this study, we propose to use a hybrid intelligent system called ANFIS (the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) for islanding detection. This approach utilizes rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) at the target DG location and used as the input sets for a neuro-fuzzy inference system for intelligent islanding detection. This approach utilizes the ANFIS as a machine learning technology and fuzzy clustering for processing and analyzing the large data sets provided from network simulations using MATLAB software. To validate the feasibility of this approach, the method has been validated through several conditions and different loading, switching operation, and network conditions. The proposed algorithm is compared with the widely used ROCOF relays and found working effectively in the situations where ROCOF fails. Simulation studies showed that the ANFIS-based algorithm detects islanding situation accurate than other islanding detection algorithms. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, the state of the art on spur-tone-magnitude reduction is used to demonstrate that an M -bit MASH architecture dithered by a simple M-bit linear feedback shift register (LFSR) can be as effective as more sophisticated topologies if the dither signal is properly added. A comparison between the existent digital ΣΔ modulators used in fractional synthesizers is presented to demonstrate that the MASH architecture has the best tradeoff between complexity and quantization noise shaping, but they present spur tones. The objective of this paper was to significantly decrease the area of the circuit used to reduce the spur tone magnitude for these MASH topologies. The analysis is validated with a theoretical study of the paths where the dither signal can be added. Experimental results of a digital M -bit MASH 1-1-1 ΣΔ modulator with the proposed way to add the LFSR dither are presented to make a hardware comparison.	allan variance;delta-sigma modulation;dither;linear-feedback shift register;multistage amplifier;noise shaping;quantization (signal processing);signal transfer function	Victor R.

Since the output impedance of the inverter is the source for tracking error caused by load current, this paper proposes a simple digital feedback controller that focuses on reducing the output impedance of inverters by a feedback of the load current. The proposed control strategy ensures high-quality steady-state and dynamic responses from the inverter system. The design of the proposed digital controller is simple and requires only a reasonably accurate knowledge of the output L-C filter parameters. In addition, only the output voltage and the load current are sensed if the dc link voltage is constant. The results of simulations and experiments show that the proposed controller can achieve very low total harmonic distortion and fast dynamic response under varied loads including nonlinear loads with low switching frequency.	characteristic impedance;clock rate;control theory;experiment;inverter (logic gate);nominal impedance;nonlinear system;output impedance;power inverter;simulation;steady state;total harmonic distortion;uninterruptible power supply;voltage controller	Heng Deng;Ramesh Oruganti;Dipti Srinivasan	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2007.909053	control engineering;electronic engineering;digital control;engineering;sense;control theory;voltage source	Visualization	66.05904193621903	39.64396494590541	61974
87bf86e6228bc219af7b2f4f2b860be9ddeb018b	a 65nm 376na 0.4v linear classifier using time-based matrix-multiplying adc with non-linearity aware training		A 6-bit time-based folding matrix multiplication technique for support vector machine (SVM) classification is proposed. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performs in-situ matrix multiplications (MM) along with analog to digital conversion. It also offers a low supply voltage of operation (down to 0.4V) and an input range of 0.8V, drawing a total of 376nA of current. We propose a technique to extend the input range of the VCO based ADC using a folding technique. The classifier is trained considering the non-linearity of the VCO, which results in 5X lower power at iso-accuracy. An accuracy of 93% is achieved with adaboost at the digital back-end with linear SVM as the weak classifier.	adaboost;analog-to-digital converter;digital camera back;linear classifier;matrix multiplication;nonlinear system;support vector machine;voltage-controlled oscillator	Amaravati Anvesha;Arijit Raychowdhury	2017	2017 IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference (A-SSCC)	10.1109/ASSCC.2017.8240278	electronic engineering;matrix multiplication;computer science;support vector machine;adaboost;phase frequency detector;linearity;linear classifier;voltage-controlled oscillator;matrix (mathematics)	EDA	58.918096056688384	48.6121128399134	61977

Though initially computer aided automation started as substation monitoring system (SMS) just for monitoring some key parameters such as voltage and currents of different components in a substation, the technological advancement has enabled to have access to more features from components of the entire distribution system. Since the distribution system has expanded to cater power to even remote locations, thus for reliable power supply, insulator condition monitoring automation plays an important role because the failure of insulator either causes complete disruption of power or reduction of system voltage leading to heavy power losses. This paper presents a methodology for condition monitoring automation of insulators by a combined approach using mean shift tracker and fuzzy inference system (FIS) and the case studies validate the efficacy of the methodology.	automation;computation;denial-of-service attack;inference engine;marginal model;mean shift;mike lesser;null (sql);power supply;serial ata;streaming media;template matching;time complexity;topological insulator;traction substation;type system	Velaga Sreerama Murthy;Dusmanta Kumar Mohanta;Sumit Gupta	2013	IJCAET	10.1504/IJCAET.2013.050550	reliability engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;digital signature algorithm	EDA	62.652383856206036	33.71055087571718	62010

In contrast to analog approaches, digital Tx Leakage compensation approaches can easily be reconfigured and therefore are highly attractive for future mobile devices, using software defined radios. In this contribution we show that Tx Leakage reduces the SNR at the ADC output. However, this SNR loss is negligibly weak in presence of moderate Tx Leakage. This proves that compensating the Tx Leakage in digital domain is a suitable approach to lower the requirements on the analog transceiver front end and to facilitate the design of software defined radios.	analog-to-digital converter;digital rights management;distortion;duplexer;interference (communication);mobile device;quantization (signal processing);rx microcontroller family;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;transceiver;transmitter	Andreas Frotzscher;Gerhard P.

First, we apply the Laplace transform on the input current sources to derive the analytical formula. Then, we calculate the circuit frequency response with logarithmic scale frequency components. The frequency domain response is approximated by a rational function using vector fitting modeling. The rational function is used to derive the natural frequency of the power ground networks, and can be converted back into time domain easily. Based on the analysis results, we then present the worst case clock gating pattern algorithm to analyze the power networks with multiple clock domains. The most expensive part of the proposed algorithm is the matrix solving: O(F(N) ldr log f ldr D). Function F is the complexity of iterative solution of complex matrix with dimension N. We assume that there are D clock domains and the frequency spans from 0 to f Hz. Experimental results show that our method is up to 60X faster than HSPICE, and can analyze large circuits which are not affordable by HSPICE.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;clock gating;computation;current source;domain analysis;electronic circuit simulation;frequency response;iterative method;parallel computing;spice 2;the matrix;transfer function	Wanping Zhang;Ling Zhang;Rui Shi;He Peng;Zhi Zhu;Lew Chua-Eoan;Rajeev Murgai;Toshiyuki Shibuya;Noriyuki Ito;Chung-Kuan Cheng	2007	2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design	10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601939	control engineering;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;frequency domain;laplace transform	EDA	71.38675434497574	44.92981796189122	62365

To accurately model the PD waveforms, a high sampling rate of 500 MHz was used in collecting the PD data with the use of a high-frequency current transformer. While characteristics such as rise time, fall time and pulse width have been used in the past to analyze PD waveforms, this paper uses Prony's method to fit a digital transfer function to the PD waveform, such that the impulse response of the digital filter approximately matches the waveform. Results show that this technique can be applied to internal, corona and surface partial discharge signals, and a model like this can be used for simulating and interpreting PD waveforms.	digital filter;discharger;fall time;ibm power systems;prony's method;pulse-width modulation;rise time;sampling (signal processing);simulation;transfer function;transformer;waveform	R.

A six-order islanded microgrid model used in a smart grid system is investigated. This model exhibits both lightly and highly damped, highly oscillatory behavior. While it is typical in power systems to use the slow subsystem obtained via SP to approximate the dynamics of the original system, simulation results on the islanded microgrid models show that the slow subsystem cannot approximate the original model well. We explicitly show that this system does not contain any slow dynamics implying that a poor approximation is produced by the slow subsystem obtained via SP. We show that the model investigated has two fast and four very fast modes. An excellent approximation can be obtained by using an approximate fourth-order model based on the very fast modes only. In addition, we also show that the reduced-order model obtained via the direct truncation (DT) method of the balanced model provides a very good approximation of the original system when the latter is truncated to order four.	approximation algorithm;ibm power systems;level of detail;microgrid;model order reduction;simulation;truncation	Kliti Kodra;Ningfan Zhong;Zoran Gajic	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525480	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;control theory;smart grid;computational model	Robotics	65.92314426872306	34.84095533646801	62539

2e607e54a255c1cca394e2793a7cfe7b1ad000ed	13.2 a digital multimode polar transmitter supporting 40mhz lte carrier aggregation in 28nm cmos	impedance;frequency modulation;long term evolution;radio frequency;transmitters;bandwidth	The evolving trend for increasing data rates in cellular communication systems with limited and fragmented frequency spectrum requires enhanced spectral efficiency of today's and future communication standards. The resulting need for high-order modulation schemes with large peak-to-average power ratio results in stringent requirements on in-channel linearity and SNR. At the same time FDD operation in SAW filter-less designs enforces very demanding limits for out-of-band and spurious emissions. Digital polar TX concepts have demonstrated low power consumption combined with low out-of-band noise in moderate bandwidth applications like WCDMA [1]. However, the implementation of 4G wideband polar systems with 20MHz RF bandwidth and above is very challenging due to the nonlinear conversion from cartesian to polar coordinates extending the effective signal bandwidth even further. A digital quadrature TX concept with up to 80MHz bandwidth, low EVM and moderate power efficiency has been shown in [2]. More than 30% power-added efficiency has been demonstrated in a 20MHz polar TX based on a switched-capacitor digital PA [3]. However, [2,3] suffer from low resolution and limited out-of-band noise performance.	bandwidth (signal processing);cmos;compaq lte;electronic filter;image resolution;mobile phone;modulation;nonlinear system;out-of-band agreement;performance per watt;power-added efficiency;radio frequency;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;spectral efficiency;switched capacitor;transmitter	Michael Fulde;Alexander Belitzer;Zdravko Boos;Michael Bruennert;Jonas Fritzin;Hans Geltinger;Marcus Groinig;Daniel Gruber;Simon Gruenberger;Thomas Hartig;Vahur Kampus;Boris Kapfelsperger;Franz Kuttner;Stephan Leuschner;Thomas Maletz;Andreas Menkhoff;Jose Moreira;Alan Paussa;Davide Ponton	2017	2017 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2017.7870339	frequency modulation;transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;radio frequency;bandwidth	EDA	60.647977851996075	57.91945746528944	62593

A frequency-domain method is proposed for the determination of net hysteresis bandwidth for a given desired maximum switching frequency of the inverter. The switching transition concept of Tsypkin's method and the describing function of nonlinear relay have been used for the derivation of results. A hierarchical switching algorithm has been suggested for the modular cells of the cascaded multilevel inverter. The hierarchy of each cell is swapped sequentially to provide the self-balancing capability in case the dc-link voltage is supported by the capacitors. The simulation and experimental verification of the derived results are provided through a single-phase distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) model. The application in the three-phase system has been shown through simulation studies on a 3.3-kV distribution-system compensation using DSTATCOM. Verification on both single- and three-phase systems is obtained using a five-level cascaded-multilevel-inverter topology.	algorithm;clock rate;h bridge;hysteresis;modulation;multiple encryption;nonlinear system;power inverter;relay;self-balancing binary search tree;simulation	Rajesh Gupta;Arindam Ghosh;Avinash Joshi	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2030766	control engineering;electronic engineering;voltage;capacitor;sliding mode control;hysteresis;engineering;describing function;control theory;frequency domain;bandwidth;statcom	Robotics	65.08987496290254	41.12249886516652	62735

Thus, the proposed circuit is self-powered and can work without any external power supply. By utilizing an averaging scheme, it is shown that the energy harvesting circuit exhibits a pseudo-resistive behavior from the input. An analytical expression for the input resistance of the converter is derived and verified using simulation studies. This resistive characteristic of the converter is useful in applications involving maximum power transfer where resistive matching with the source of power is desirable.

The modeling approach consists of only four active and reactive nodal power injections and line power flows equations, and treats the elements of Ybus admittance matrix as constant parameters. The transformer tap ratios are only included in the simplified four equations as control variables, and hence not included in the Ybus matrix. This modeling approach reduces significantly the total number of variables and thus improves the computational time performance. The proposed approach is applicable for any system that does not have tap changing transformers connected in two adjacent buses, or multiple tap changing transformers connected to one bus.	computation;time complexity;transformer;transformers	Sultan S.

A nonlinear current steering digital to analog converter (DAC) has been utilized to convert phase word to sine wave amplitude directly without area consuming ROM for the sine look-up table, which is the speed bottleneck of the DDFS circuit. In order to achieve high speed performance and low power dissipation, CMOS current mode logic (CML) is chosen to implement the logic cells. A semi-symmetrical switching scheme of current source matrix of the nonlinear DAC is proposed to compensate the systematic and gradient errors introduced by the processing and environment variations. The DDFS chip is implemented in Chartered 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS technology with die area of 2.1/spl times/1.9 mm/sup 2/ and total power consumption of 820 mW at 3.3 V supply voltage.	8-bit;cmos;cpu power dissipation;current source;current-mode logic;digital clock manager;digital-to-analog converter;frequency synthesizer;gradient;lookup table;nonlinear system;normalized frequency (unit);semiconductor industry	Xuefeng Yu;Foster F.

The noise specification of the IA is made adaptive to the peak-peak value of the fetal electrocardiography (fECG) signal, which varies for different gestational age and measurement settings. Contrary to the currently available point solution IAs, the proposed IA is scalable for a noise range from 30nV/VHz to 250nV/VHz while consuming 15μW to 1μW respectively. A new IA architecture is proposed to achieve a better noise efficiency factor (NEF), while allowing noise scalability. The IA is designed in TSMC 0.18μm CMOS process. Simulation results show that the IA achieves a NEF of 3.4 to 5.5 over the noise scalable range, a CMRR of 100dB, and an input impedance (Zin) of 1GO.	algorithm;cmos;characteristic impedance;feedback;input impedance;instrumentation amplifier;low-power broadcasting;relative intensity noise;scalability;simulation;transistor	Shuang Song;Michael Johannes Rooijakkers;Chiara Rabotti;Massimo Mischi;Arthur H.

Current memory interfaces with single-wire signaling operate at 5Gb/s/pin [1] and 6Gb/s/pin [2] with the power efficiency of 17.4pJ/b/pin and 15.8pJ/b/pin, respectively. Mobile DDR memory I/O with differential signaling has better power efficiency of 6.4pJ/b/pin [3], and so does the prior dual-band interconnect (DBI) [4] with the efficiency of 5pJ/b/pin at 4.2Gb/s/pin for simultaneous bidirectional (SBD) mobile memory I/O interface. However, DBI's differential signaling is incompatible with existing standards, and it also occupies large die area for using differential transmission lines and an LC-oscillator for generating RF-carrier. To alleviate these concerns, we propose to use a Single-Transmission-Line DBI (STL-DBI) with the best figure-of-merit (FoM) defined as data rate per pin divided by the I/O-interface die area and power consumption.	data rate units;differential signaling;electronic oscillator;input/output;interference (communication);mobile device;performance per watt;perl dbi;radio frequency;smart battery;t-line;transmission line;zero suppression	Yanghyo Kim;Gyungsu Byun;Adrian J.

Producing such pulses can be efficiently achieved with so called avalanche generators. In these generators an external delay line, charged to relatively high voltage, is periodically discharged to the generator output exploiting the avalanche breakdown effect in a bipolar junction transistor. This paper describes a number of avalanche generators built and used by the authors, including versions with trigger and amplitude modulation inputs. The described generators were constructed primarily to produce pulses simulating beam-induced signals from the Large Hadron Collider. They can, however, be useful for any measurements where nanosecond pulses with amplitudes of tens of volts are required.	analog delay line;large hadron collider;modulation;particle filter;simulation;transistor	Michal Krupa;Marek Gasior	2014	2014 Proceedings of the 21st International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (MIXDES)	10.1109/MIXDES.2014.6872257	electronic engineering;single-photon avalanche diode;avalanche diode;electrical engineering;optoelectronics;physics	EDA	70.5078403488742	50.49093653573093	63173

With the compensation technique, maximum jitter reduction achieved is as high as 49%. The power overhead for the compensation block is only 7% of the total power consumption. The output driver with the proposed compensation technique is designed using 110 nm CMOS process technology.	cmos;clock skew;emphasis (telecommunications);overhead (computing);time-to-digital converter	Debashis Dhar;Inhwa Jung;Chulwoo Kim	2012	2012 International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC)	10.1109/ISOCC.2012.6406925	electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	59.42181665011417	51.0091770495278	63266

55cf487c6e84f418267af1de5421c198ca40103e	ddc based channelizer design		After some research it has been observed that CIC filters are generally used in DDC based channelizer design. However, each of the different DDC techniques has several advantages and disadvantages over other techniques. For this reason, DDC techniques have been studied in detail and it has been analyzed which technique can be more efficient in which situations. MATLAB Simulink platform was used to design channellizer. The components used in Simulink were selected as part of Xilinx FPGA family. In addition, the designed systems were synthesized in Xilinx ISE platform and usage of the resources was compared. Firstly, the widely used CIC based channelizer is designed. The second method is bandpass filter based channelizer. Finally, the structure of DDC-Tree channelizer has been examined. FM signal is used as input signals. They are sampled at 21875 MHz. Also, the channellizers are designed for system with 64 channels.	american and british english spelling differences;display data channel;fm broadcasting;field-programmable gate array;matlab;simulink;xilinx ise	Oguzhan Kosar;Murver Kirci;Enes Karav	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404184	computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;field-programmable gate array;frequency modulation;electronic engineering;signal-to-noise ratio;matlab;band-pass filter;communication channel	EDA	58.36653662636586	56.84498739038856	63419

This paper presents a fast clock-skew analysis via parameterized incremental truncated-balanced-realization, called piTBR method. Environmental uncertainties are parametrically and structurally added into the state equation of clock network. A compact macromodel is obtained by the subspace projection constructed from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of circuit output waveforms. To reduce the computational cost, we propose an incremental SVD method that only needs to partially update the projection matrix by analyzing the perturbed output waveform owning to environmental uncertainties. Experiments on a number of clock networks show that compared with the macromodeling by the fast TBR method, our method reduces the computational cost in the order of 100x with a similar accuracy. In addition, compared with the macromodeling by the Krylov-subspace-based method, our method reduces the waveform error by 2x with a similar runtime.	algorithmic efficiency;clock network;clock skew;experiment;gradient;iterative and incremental development;krylov subspace;macromodel;quantum fluctuation;singular value decomposition;waveform	Hai Wang;Hao Yu;Sheldon X.-D.

Non-linear extraction strategies such as Synchronous Electrical Charge Extraction (SECE) [1,2], energy investing [3], and Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) [4] have been developed to maximize the extracted energy from harmonic excitations. However, in most of today's applications, vibrations are not periodic and mechanical shocks occur at unpredictable rates [4]. SSHI interfaces naturally seem as the most appropriate candidates for harvesting shocks as they exhibit outstanding performance in periodic excitations [4]. However, the SSHI strategy presents inherent weaknesses while harvesting shocks, since the invested energy stored in the piezoelectric capacitance cannot be recovered.	autonomous robot;home automation;piezoelectricity	Anthony Quelen;Adrien Morel;Pierre Gasnier;Romain Grezaud;Stephane Monfray;Gaël Pillonnet	2018	2018 IEEE International Solid - State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2018.8310228	electronic engineering;electric potential energy;computer science;electric charge;piezoelectricity;mechanical energy;harmonic;capacitance;inductor;vibration	Robotics	59.05512609879138	44.448959833235826	63564

In order to control these hybrid structures, different strategies exist, allowing to fix the switching frequency as a function of some parameters of the linear regulator. This article compares two control strategies that, although can be applied to the same circuital structure of linear-assisted converter, are sensibly different. The first one, reported in previous literature, cancels completely the average current through the linear regulator in steady state to achieve a reduction of the losses. Thus the efficiency of the whole system increases and almost equals the one of the standalone switching converter. The proposed approach, in spite of a slightly increment of linear regulator's losses, reduces the output ripple due to the crossover distortion of linear regulator output stage.	clock rate;crossover distortion;linear logic;linear stage;logic level;low-pass filter;modulation;nmos logic;polish notation;ripple effect;steady state;switched-mode power supply;transistor	Herminio Martínez;Antoni Grau-Saldes	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE Emerging Technology and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2014.7005314	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;charge pump;flyback converter;network switch;computer science;78xx;ćuk converter;control theory;low-dropout regulator;steady state;boost converter	EDA	64.78800976057607	42.31479704076264	63591
a6afde2e1fb8afb5fbf04afcff2975c636881831	integrated vcos for medical implant transceivers	nova;research repository;university of newcastle;institutional repository;research online	The 402-405 MHz MICS (Medical Implant Communication Service) band has recently been allocated by the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) with the potential to replace the low frequency inductive coupling techniques in implantable devices. This band was particularly chosen to provide full-integration, low-power, faster data transfer and longer communication range. This paper investigates the design of a VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) that will be an essential building block of such wireless implantable devices operating in the MICS service band. Three different integrated quadrature VCOs that meet the requirements of the MICS standard are designed in 0.18 μm TSMC CMOS process to propose an optimum choice. Their performances in terms of power consumption, die area, linearity and phase noise are compared. The fabricated VCOs are a four stage differential ring VCO, an LC tank VCO directly loaded with a poly-phase filter and an 800 MHz LC tank VCO with a high frequency master-slave divider. All three architectures target a VCO gain of Kvco = 15 MHz/V with 3 calibration control and 2 FSK (Frequency-Shift Keying) control signals and are designed for 1.5 V supply voltage in a 0.18-μm standard CMOS process.	cmos;inductive coupling;lc circuit;low-power broadcasting;performance;phase noise;requirement;transceiver;voltage-controlled oscillator	Ahmet Tekin;Mehmet Rasit Yuce;Wentai Liu	2008	VLSI Design	10.1155/2008/912536	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;nova	EDA	58.7439366721062	54.010956865337796	63620

The proposed DPC scheme achieves a decoupled control of stator active and reactive powers by choosing, step-by-step, the optimum voltage vector to be delivered by the rotor side voltage source inverter. A robust approach for sensorless estimation of speed and rotor position is presented using a Model Reference Adaptive System observer. The paper firstly introduces a precise description of the theoretical principle of the DPC algorithm. Then the implementation is illustrated. Drive performance is predicted by simulation and experimentally verified by using a prototyping digital test rig. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, giving improved drive performance with respect to previous experiments, in particular avoiding some disadvantages of classic DPC techniques.	adaptive system;algorithm;deferred procedure call;experiment;power inverter;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;voltage source	Mahmoud A.

The results at low frequencies for the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard are compared to the results for a low- Q antenna. Two hand grips are studied and combined to a SAM(Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin)phantom.

Although current information is used as a control variable, a pure voltage-mode implementation has been considered and the inductor current ripple is digitally reconstructed. The proposed universal control algorithm can be applied to different converter topologies and operating modes. In particular, experimental results are shown for a prototyping system of a Buck converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM), where only negligible transient effects are present when changing the operation mode. The presented measurements confirm that the proposed universal control algorithm is capable of achieving tight voltage regulation and excellent dynamic performance under different operating conditions. Additionally, a comparison to a state-of-the-art digital Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller illustrates the performance improvement of the proposed digital control scheme.	algorithm;buck converter;control flow;dc-to-dc converter;dicom;nonlinear system;pdf/a;pid;ripple effect;universal controls;virtual 8086 mode;voltage regulation	Andreas Berger;Matteo Agostinelli;Robert Priewasser;Stefano Marsili;Mario Huemer	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168608	control engineering;electronic engineering;sliding mode control;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;inductor	EDA	65.50889318814846	40.271241646760856	63864
3ac92fd270c9ba49c0f3030e8aec03e8378b59cc	design of low-voltage high-speed cml d-latches in nanometer cmos technologies		This paper presents the design of a novel low-voltage high-speed D-latch circuit suitable for nanometer CMOS technologies. The proposed topology is compared against the low-voltage triple-tail D-latch and its advantages are demonstrated both by simulations, under different performance/power consumption tradeoffs with a 40-nm CMOS technology, and theoretically, thanks to a simple model of the propagation delay derived for both low-voltage topologies. In order to further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed topology, it has also been used to design a D flip-flop (DFF), where thanks to the feature to need just 1 clock differential pair; a further speed improvement is achieved over the conventional triple-tail topology. Indeed, by comparing a two-stage frequency divider designed using both the triple-tail DFF and the proposed folded DFF, a 54% improvement in the maximum operating frequency is found when using the proposed folded DFF.	approximation algorithm;cmos;clock rate;clock signal;current source;differential signaling;digital forensics framework (dff);flops;flip-flop (electronics);frequency divider;large-signal model;moore's law;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;swing (java);switching circuit theory;transistor;whole earth 'lectronic link	Giuseppe Scotti;Davide Bellizia;Alessandro Trifiletti;Gaetano Palumbo	2017	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2750207	electronic engineering;computer science;network topology;transistor;propagation delay;logic gate;nanometre;frequency divider;low voltage;cmos	EDA	62.28216065927126	48.78324959346437	64005

This is especially valid in the context of highly complex structures such as MEMS gyroscopes, because of the dramatic increase in calculation time with raising level of detail. Model Order Reduction (MOR) methods such as the modal superposition have been successful in the description of linear systems, but cannot be used to simulate nonlinear systems. Here, a nonlinear MOR method for structural mechanics simulations is presented and its application on a simple MEMS geometry demonstrated. The method is a novel approach for computationally efficient transient simulations of nonlinear mechanics occurring in MEMS high Q systems (e.g. MEMS gyroscopes). In a one mass oscillator test system a reduction of computation time by a factor of 1000 is achieved, while the physics of the system is preserved within a good accuracy.	algorithmic efficiency;ccir system a;computation;level of detail;linear system;microelectromechanical systems;modal logic;model order reduction;nonlinear system;simulation;time complexity	Markus Dorwarth;Steven Kehrberg;Robert Maul;Rudy Eid;Florian Lang;Benjamin Schmidt;Jan Mehner	2014	2014 IEEE 11th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices (SSD14)	10.1109/SSD.2014.6808820	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	72.07202720538444	43.95392540736568	64208

This method is applicable to analyse Class E power amplifiers with any circuit configuration and parameters at any switching-on duty cycle, and does also take into account the switching transistor ON resistance. It is valuable to the design of Class E amplifiers by offering designers insight into circuit behavior.	amplifier	Wen Chen;Henrik Floberg;Shui-Sheng Qiu	1999	I. J.

T-network (or π-match) is utilized to achieve simultaneously wideband input and output impedance matching, wideband power gain (S21) and wideband NF at W-band.

Adaptation is required in post-manufacturing to correct yield loss and achieve zero defective parts-per-million as well as during normal operation to account for different application scenarios and for varying environmental conditions. A self-adaptive system must be capable of providing the required high performances after manufacturing and throughout its normal operation regardless the application scenario wherein it is deployed and despite the varying environmental conditions. In this paper, we describe a generic post-manufacturing self-adaptation technique for RF circuits as well as concurrent self-adaptation techniques for a safety-critical medical sensor for glaucoma diagnosis and for a NFC system which is very sensitive to the environment in which it operates.	adaptive system;electronic circuit;interoperability;linear model;mission critical;near field communication;nonlinear system;operating environment;performance;radio frequency;remote control;sensor;system of measurement	Martin Andraud;Anthony Deluthault;Mouhamadou Dieng;Florence Azaïs;Serge Bernard;Philippe Cauvet;Mariane Comte;Thibault Kervaon;Vincent Kerzerho;Salvador Mir;Paul-Henri Pugliesi-Conti;Michel Renovell;Fabien Soulier;Emmanuel Simeu;Haralampos-G.

213d7612ddaa8d1d42b261d20b2b4ca95edec185	analysis of crosstalk-induced effects in multilayer graphene nanoribbon interconnects		Crosstalk e®ects in multilayer graphene nanoribbon (GNR) interconnects for the future nanoscale integrated circuits are investigated with the help of ABCD parameter matrix approach for intermediateand global-level interconnects at 11 nm and 8 nm technology nodes. The worst-case crosstalk-induced delay and peak crosstalk noise voltages are derived for both neutral and doped zigzag GNR interconnects and compared to those of conventional copper interconnects. The worst-case crosstalk delays for perfectly specular, doped multilayer GNR interconnects are less than 4% of that of copper interconnects for 1mm long intermediate interconnects and less than 7% of that of copper interconnects for 5mm long global interconnects at 8 nm node. As far as the worst-case peak crosstalk noise voltage is concerned, neutral GNR interconnects are slightly better performing than their doped counterparts. But from the perspective of overall noise contribution, doped GNR interconnects outperform neutral ones for all the cases. Finally, our analysis shows that from the signal integrity perspective, perfectly specular, doped multilayer zigzag GNR interconnects are a suitable alternative to copper interconnects for the future-generation integrated circuit technology.	abcd schema;best, worst and average case;copper interconnect;crosstalk;doping (semiconductor);electrical connection;graphene;integrated circuit;marginal model;multilayer perceptron;optical amplifier;signal integrity;two-port network	Manodipan Sahoo;Hafizur Rahaman	2017	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S021812661750102X	graphene;electronic engineering;computer science;zigzag;integrated circuit;crosstalk;doping	EDA	64.92968606643298	53.18789991218852	64633

The system includes 32-electrode stimulation capability, eight multiplexed low-noise low-power bio-potential sensing channels with on-chip digital FFT, and a Cortex M3-based microcontroller for implementing closed-loop algorithms. The stimulation subsystem can provide a maximum stimulation current of 12mA with approximately 3% accuracy per channel. The sensing subsystem uses a fully differential chopping amplifier achieving a noise floor <;100nV/rtHz with approximately 1μA current from 2V supply. A 13bit continuous-time sigma-delta ADC is used to sample the amplifier output at the rate of 33kHz. The ADC consumes approximately 100nA while achieving an ENOB of 12b with a 250Hz date rate. A hardware implementation of a cached-FFT is included in the sensing IC to perform spectral analysis of the bio-potential signal. The resulting multiple spectral signatures can be selectively sent to the microcontroller allowing for algorithmic control of the stimulator system. The system partition was designed to minimize overall computational power while providing user flexibility. The sensing performance of the prototype has been demonstrated with 2-D cursor control in a non-human primate brain machine interface (BMI) model using 20 features simultaneously.	algorithm;amplifier;brain–computer interface;british informatics olympiad;cursor (databases);delta-sigma modulation;digital signal processor;effective number of bits;embedded system;fast fourier transform;low-power broadcasting;microcontroller;multiplexing;noise floor;prototype;system partition and boot partition;type signature	Peng Cong;Piyush Karande;Jonathan Landes;Rob Corey;Scott Stanslaski;Wesley Santa;Randy Jensen;Forrest Pape;Dan Moran;Timothy Denison	2014	ESSCIRC 2014 - 40th European Solid State Circuits Conference (ESSCIRC)	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2014.6942031	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	56.43208482811198	52.47387797775591	64801

In particular, the topic on """" wavelets for single carrier communications """" has been considered in this paper. I. Introduction Wavelets are small oscillatory waveforms that are non-zero for a limited period of time, satisfying certain mathematical conditions. The primary advantages of wavelet transform are considered to be wavelet diversity and high localization in time and frequency domains. Fast wavelet transform is implemented via filter banks. One important feature of the wavelets is that wavelet symbols are overlapping both in time and frequency. This feature enables a high spectral efficiency. Another important feature of the wavelets is the so-called wavelet diversity. Wavelet diversity implies that there exist various wavelet families and new wavelets can be designed depending on the application of interest. This paper provides an overview of the wavelet applications in the field of single carrier communications."""	electrical engineering;existential quantification;fast wavelet transform;filter bank;spectral efficiency	Ömer Bulakci	2012	CoRR		telecommunications;multimedia	DB	57.558019036256916	60.01328274389875	64879
b1e2fb2a012e9a96b9a5cd8ac7673d0b421d9bfc	predictive dtc strategy with fault-tolerant function for six-phase and three-phase pmsm series-connected drive system		On the one hand, with the use of direct torque control (DTC) for a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and a three-phase PMSM series-connected system supplied by a six-phase inverter, it is possible to realize fast torque control for two PMSMs. On the other hand, because the number of inverter output voltage vectors (VVs) is increased to 64, it is difficult to divide sectors for traditional switching table DTC (ST-DTC). Furthermore, it is difficult to choose an optimal switching vector to reduce torque and flux ripples of two PMSMs in ST-DTC. A predictive control strategy of torque and stator flux is introduced into a two-PMSM series-connection DTC system, including winding fault, in this paper. Based on the principle of minimum errors of torque and stator flux amplitude and minimum zero-sequence current, an optimal VV is predicted. In order to realize uninterrupted torque control before and after open-phase fault, open-phase winding flux is considered in stator flux, and the inverter VV considering open-phase voltage is constructed in an open-phase control strategy. The experimental results show that the steady-state torque and stator flux ripples of a series-connected drive system are greatly reduced, and the drive system can operate without interruption from failure-free to failure operation.	control theory;interrupt;phase inversion;power inverter;steady state;verification and validation	Yangzhong Zhou;Guangtuan Chen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2786236	flux;control theory;synchronous motor;three-phase;control engineering;direct torque control;engineering;torque;inverter;model predictive control;stator	Robotics	66.21528939074751	37.71847806701078	64947
46d802a65369cac0cc8da860fa980a829f1a9aa5	dark current reduction by an adaptive ctia photocircuit for room temperature swir sensing		We report an adaptive capacitive transimpedance amplifier circuit for room temperature sensing of short wave infrared (SWIR) radiation. The photocircuit reduces junction leakage current by measuring the current across a photodiode held at zero bias. This is critical to enable room temperature SWIR detection using materials with smaller bandgaps (and higher leakage current) such as InGaAs, which are typically operated at cooled temperatures. The transimpedance amplifier incorporates a floating gate current mirror in order to precisely cancel offset using nonvolatile analog storage. We experimentally verify that we are able to precisely tune the input offset and demonstrate a reduction in dark current of an InGaAs photodiode by two orders of magnitude, from 700pA to 2.25pA, when comparing similar adaptive and non-adaptive circuits.

However, silica exhibits large temperature dependence, so the temperature of silica-based PLCs needs to be controlled. We can reduce the cost and the energy budget of optical equipment by using athermal waveguides. We propose an athermal optical waveguide comprised of trenches filled with low-refractive index material. The propagation constant of the waveguide is determined by the refractive indices of the core and the low-refractive index material; their thermo-optic coefficients have opposite signs, and therefore the temperature dependence of the waveguide can be suppressed. A 1-bit delay circuit was designed for a 12.5Gbit/s differential phase shift keying receiver using the athermal waveguide, and it displayed a wide operating temperature range.	interference (communication)	Kenji Iwamoto;Jiro Ito;Hiroyuki Tsuda	2009	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.6.1769	electronic engineering;refractive index;optics;physics	EDA	67.94386551048402	55.96266998370669	65041

Here, VPC is suggested to realize a variable multiphase operation by changing the phase number p and topological path for the more suitable level of voltage gain so as to improve the power efficiency, especially for the lower output voltage Besides, PWM is adopted not only to enhance output regulation for different desired outputs, but also to reinforce output robustness to source/loading variation. Further, some theoretical analyses and designs include: n-stage p-phase MPSC model, steady-state analysis, conversion ratio, power efficiency, output ripple, stability, capacitance selection, and control design. Finally, the closed-loop MPSC is simulated, and the hardware is implemented and tested. All the results are illustrated to show the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

5b54e1a4a4d737aaea9ffcfea7169980de4be81d	multi-phase sub-sampling fractional-n pll with soft loop switching for fast robust locking		This paper presents a low phase noise sub-sampling PLL (SSPLL) with multi-phase outputs. Automatic soft switching between the sub-sampling phase loop and frequency loop is proposed to improve robustness against perturbations and interferences that may cause a traditional SSPLL to lose lock. A quadrature LC oscillator with capacitive phase interpolation network is employed to generate multi-phase outputs, which are further utilized to achieve fractional-N frequency synthesis. Implemented in a 130nm CMOS technology, the SSPLL chip is able to achieve a measured in-band phase noise of −120 dBc/Hz and a measured integrated jitter of 209 fs at 2.4 GHz, while consuming 27.2 mW with 16 output phases. The measured reference spur and fractional spur level is −72 dBc and −49 dBc, respectively.	cmos;chroma subsampling;clock signal;control system;electronic oscillator;frequency synthesizer;interpolation;lc circuit;lock (computer science);loop invariant;mosis;media-embedded processor;phase noise;phase-locked loop;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor device fabrication	Dongyi Liao;Foster F.

Even though the input signals of an ADC are fully differential, two single-ended source followers should be normally used. This is because differential source followers have some drawbacks. In this study, a wideband fully differential source follower is presented to obtain maximum efficiency of a fully differential THA. Because a cross coupling technique at the differential nodes is adopted, the performance of the proposed source follower is superior to the performance of conventional followers. The result of Spurious Free Dynamic Range(SFDR) is -66.92dBc for Fin=Fs/2 at FS=500MHz. The SFDR of the proposed source follower is better by about 8.6dB than the SFDR of a conventional source follower under the same experimental conditions. To verify them, an 8-b cascaded folding ADC which includes the proposed source follower is fabricated with a 0.13um CMOS technology.	amplifier;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;flash adc;single-ended signaling;spurious-free dynamic range	Inkyung Hwang;Daehyuk Kim;Ji-Hyun Roh;Mun-Kyo Lee;Sun-Phil Nah;Minkyu Song	2013	2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)		embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;cmos	EDA	61.85520629644922	50.37878933430175	65226

This paper proposes Fractional Order Proportional integral [FOPI] Controller algorithm for wind farm supervision. This control system is based on two control levels: A supervisory system controls active and reactive power of the whole wind farm by sending out set points to all wind turbines, and a machine control system ensures that set points at the wind turbine level are reached. The whole control is added to the normal operating power reference of the wind farm established by a Supervisory Control. Finally obtained Results by this controller are also compared with the conventional PI controller through simulation results considering a wind farm of three generators DFIGs (1.5 MW).	algorithm;control system;control theory;microwave;simulation	Boualem Benlahbib;Noureddine Bouarroudj;Farid Bouchafaa;Bachir Batoun	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	10.1109/IEEM.2014.7058835	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.19214384253296	38.05300766205611	65286

Because of the conceptual appropriateness and computational simplicity, this approach is essentially a fast and flexible method. At first, the coherency measures are derived from the time-domain responses of generators in order to reveal the relations between any pair of generators. And then they are used as initial element values of the membership matrix in the clustering procedures. An application of the proposed method to the Taiwan power (Taipower) system is demonstrated in an attempt to show the effectiveness of this clustering approach. The effects of short circuit fault locations, operating conditions, data sampling interval, and power system stabilizers are also investigated, as well. The results are compared with those obtained from the similarity relation method. And thus it is found that the presented approach needs less computation time and can directly initialize a clustering process for any number of clusters.	computer cluster	Shu-Chen Wang;Pei-Hwa Huang;Chi-Jui Wu;Yung-Sung Chuang	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e90-a.10.2223	correlation clustering;real-time computing;permanent magnet synchronous generator;computer science;electrical engineering;machine learning;electric power system;cluster analysis	Crypto	67.74989687400041	36.84930358705483	65342

The reference spur is a major issue when the bandwidth is increased, because ripples on the VCO control line undergo less filtering by the loop filter. This paper proposes design techniques based on sub-sampling phase detection to reduce the reference spur of a 2.2GHz PLL to −80dBc at a high loop-bandwidth-to-reference-frequency ratio (fBW/fref) of 1/20.	phase-locked loop;sampling (signal processing);settling time;voltage-controlled oscillator	Xiang Gao;Eric A.

The proposed TIA with T-network achieves much wide band operation within range of 4.8–19.6 GHz.

This paper analyzes the zero portion effects on the output voltage of the railway auxiliary inverter with pulsating dc-link based on the approximately independent hybrid modulation technique, and proposes a carrier phase-shift optimization strategy. Average mathematical models of output voltage are built, and Fourier series of the voltage difference is derived for further analysis. The output voltage performances under different conditions are compared in time-domain simulation. The results of simulation and experiments show that the proposed phase-shift approach reduces the zero portion effects and performs as well as that of FDCLI.	experiment;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;modulation;performance;power inverter;pulse (signal processing);simulation	Lijun Diao;Lei Wang;Huiqing Du;Lu Wang;Zhigang Liu;Suleiman M.

The sum of the products is taken at the end of that specified time. The system has the advantage of measuring acoustic power over a specified period of time irrespective of voltage waveforms.

b5f4d721c21451352ac455f38aa5f5a652aa8959	a 0.6v 3.8μw ecg/bio-impedance monitoring ic for disposable health patch in 40nm cmos		Simultaneous measurement of Electrocardiogram (ECG) and bio-impedance (BioZ) via disposable health patches is desired for patients suffering from chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, a sensing IC must consume ultra-low power under a sub-volt supply to comply with miniaturized and disposable batteries. This work presents a 0.6 V analog frontend (AFE) IC consisting of an instrumentation amplifier (IA), a current source (CS) and a SAR ADC. The AFE can measure ECG and BioZ simultaneously with a single IA by employing an orthogonal chopping scheme. To ensure the IA can tolerate up to 300mVpp DC electrode offset and 400mVpp common-mode (CM) interference, a DC-servo loop (DSL) combined with a common-mode feedforward (CMFF) loop is employed. A buffer-assisted scheme boosts the IA's input impedance by 7x to 140MΩ at 10Hz. To improve the BioZ sensitivity, the CG utilizes dynamic element matching to reduce the 1/f noise of the output current, leading to 35mΩ/√Hz BioZ sensitivity down to 1Hz. The ADC shows a 9.7b ENOB when sampled at 20ksps. The total power consumption of the AFE is 3.8μW.	analog front-end;british informatics olympiad;cmos;characteristic impedance;current source;digital subscriber line;effective number of bits;feedforward neural network;input impedance;instrumentation amplifier;interference (communication);negative feedback;pink noise;servo;successive approximation adc	Jiawei Xu;Qiuyang Lin;Ming Ding;Yao Li;Chris Van Hoof;Wouter Serdijn;Nick Van Helleputte	2018	2018 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)	10.1109/CICC.2018.8357025	effective number of bits;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;current source;successive approximation adc;electrical impedance;input impedance;digital subscriber line;instrumentation amplifier;cmos	EDA	57.14433983354499	50.68680648657696	65766
17950844c3d4e2a7ed84cf612a5af307e17424fc	zcsr for targeting the optimal impedance in digital radio frequency matching box		Digital radio frequency (RF) matching box used in the manufacturing process of semiconductor is a critical equipment for discharging plasma. In this process, the impedance of the plasma chamber is always changed. Inconsistent impedance between matching box and plasma chamber leads to uneven thickness of plasma coating on semiconductor. In order to maintain consistent impedance, the impedance of RF matching box and the plasma chamber have to achieve a dynamic match. Past researches used the approximation method to approach the optimal impedance step by step. However, when the impedance of the plasma chamber is changed, the approximation method loses the trend approaching the optimal impedance point. Zeroth-level Classifier System (ZCS) is a rule-based machine learning method which adapts to a changing environment for online learning. In this paper, the ZCS with continuous-valued inputs (ZCSR) is applied for targeting the optimal impedance in digital RF matching box. The results indicate that ZCSR is capable of approaching the optimal impedance on average about 225 problem instances in the fixed impedance of the simulated chamber. We have verified that ZCSR can find optimal impedance in fixed impedance chamber. In the future, we will apply the ZCSR to the variable impedance chamber.	approximation;characteristic impedance;learning classifier system;logic programming;newton's method;online machine learning;plasma active;plasma display;radio frequency;semiconductor;switched-mode power supply;thickness (graph theory)	L.-Y.

By comparison to Quantum CV simulator, it focalizes on the experimental conditions needed for an accurate determination of Vfb with various analytical methods. First, we demonstrate that an accurate determination of substrate doping level is crucial. Second, the so called Maserjian’s method appears to be more reliable when the maximum measurable capacitance is reduced; it is also less sensitive to variations of the depletion bias used for extraction of substrate doping level. Third, with non-constant substrate doping profile, significant source of error can be induced by uncertainty on the effective doping level at flat band conditions. A simple rule between doping gradient and surface doping level is proposed to ensure reliable extraction. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

From loss measurements carried out for variable attenuators, as well as for attenuators of fixed attenuation values as devices under test, which are fitted to quarter-wavelength lines in three different configurations, the attenuation is simply obtained and is unrelated to the source and load reflection coefficients of GammaG and GammaL, respectively. Experimental results on a 10-dB step attenuator measurement at frequencies from 1 to 17 GHz show good agreement with measurements where the source and load are impedance matched. The technique is effective even with GammaG and GammaL higher than 0.1.	characteristic impedance;coefficient;device under test;impedance matching;microwave;optical attenuator;radio frequency	Anton Widarta;Tomoteru Kawakami	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2008472	insertion loss;impedance matching;electronic engineering;telecommunications;device under test;engineering;electrical engineering;attenuator;reflection coefficient;focused impedance measurement;radio frequency;physics	Embedded	67.01560115294444	56.163253937785434	65838

In this context, this paper proposes a ring oscillator for an impulse radio UWB transmitter. A multiloop ring oscillator is considered because it holds the potential of both high oscillation frequency and fast switch-on time. The novelty of the proposed inverter cell is found in the possibility to adjust the oscillation frequency digitally, rather than with an analog voltage. This leads to larger tuning range and less sensitivity to control noise. The digitally controlled oscillator is designed in 0.13µm CMOS technology and according to simulations the tuning range is from 4 GHz to 12.5 GHz. The power consumption is below 8 mW.	cmos;digitally controlled oscillator;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;ring oscillator;simulation;transmitter;ultra-wideband;voltage-controlled oscillator	Andrea Gerosa;Silvia Soldà;Andrea Bevilacqua;Daniele Vogrig;Andrea Neviani	2010	Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537336	electronic engineering;voltage-controlled oscillator;telecommunications;vackář oscillator;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;variable-frequency oscillator;oscillator start-up timer;digitally controlled oscillator;cmos;local oscillator	Arch	61.375747595226855	51.857443216058954	65840
13f555943f699e8003f443d688e5cf68f4b19b09	compact dual-band antenna array for massive mimo	dual band antenna;antenna array;massive mimo	A compact dual band antenna operating simultaneously at 5.4 GHz and 15 GHz is presented in this paper. It is a planar array composed of a grid of 6×8 (48) patch antennas working at 5.4 GHz and 7×9 (63) patch antennas working at 15 GHz. The whole antenna array occupies an area of 150 mm × 180 mm which fits the ordinary size requirement of wireless access point. All the antenna patch antennas have a reflection coefficient lower than −6 dB across 320 and 2000 MHz bandwidth at 5 and 15 GHz. The electromagnetic coupling between any two antennas is lower than − 10 dB within the specified bandwidth. Measurement results show good agreement with the simulation of input matching, mutual coupling and radiation pattern. Compared to the ordinary antenna array design with half-wavelength spacing between two neighboring antennas, our proposed dual band array design accommodates 1.6 times more antennas at 5.4 GHz and extra 63 antennas at 15 GHz, while maintaining sufficient radiation efficiency, matching bandwidth and decoupling.	coupling (computer programming);fits;ku band;mimo;prototype;rca connector;radiation pattern;reflection coefficient;simulation;wireless access point	Linsheng Li;Muhammad Ali;Katsuyuki Haneda	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794556	embedded system;omnidirectional antenna;reflective array antenna;collinear antenna array;monopole antenna;random wire antenna;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;computer science;reconfigurable antenna;directional antenna;conformal antenna;antenna noise temperature;patch antenna;antenna;smart antenna;radiation pattern;slot antenna;dipole antenna;antenna array;biconical antenna;antenna efficiency	Arch	66.08813372548367	58.044634449586525	65934

When the receiver coil enters a strong magnetic field generated by the transmitter coil, the implanted device can receive more than needed power. This may lead to the generation of so high received voltages that the implant may be damaged (which may also have consequences for the patient). In addition, during the regulation of the rectified DC voltage, the low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator exhibits poor power efficiency if the input voltage is much higher than the output voltage. Thus, the corresponding heating effect is increased. This study introduces a high-voltage CMOS dynamic power control circuit that can be integrated in the implantable power receiver front-end. The circuit is capable of auto-detuning the receiver inductive-capacitive (LC) tank to adjust the power reception level according to the actual magnetic field strength. The experimental results show that the power control circuit reduces the impact of the varied magnetic field on the rectified voltage. Also, the prototype measurements show that the power efficiency of the LDO regulator increases from 35 to 72%, when the power control circuit activates the detuning function.	cmos;dennō coil;dropout (neural networks);low-dropout regulator;performance per watt;prototype;transmitter;voltage regulator	Lei Zou;Torben Larsen	2011	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds.2010.0330	power gain;control engineering;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;telecommunications;power factor;power control;computer science;engineering;78xx;electrical engineering;constant power circuit;switched-mode power supply;electrical load;cmos;voltage optimisation;voltage regulation	EDA	58.3502485126458	45.30544774698768	65971

Closed-form and numerical integration solutions are presented for phase disposition PWM of a diode-clamped inverter to illustrate the technique, together with a comparison of theoretical and experimental spectral results for the naturally and asymmetric regularly sampled cases to confirm the validity of the approach.	diode;numerical analysis;numerical integration;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;sampling (signal processing);spectral leakage	Brendan Mcgrath;Donald Grahame Holmes	2002	IEEE Trans.

In this paper, I did much research on general lightning protection measure that is being taken in order to eliminate or reduce the effect of this natural disaster on different power equipments. Through survey I revealed that by applying one protective measure the effect of lightning stroke on the lines can be reduced to a greater extent. This protective measure is a small needle which when placed vertically on the overhead ground wire reduces the effect. This method can have good effect in lightning protection scheme to mitigate or nullify the over voltages induced on transmission line due to lightning effect.

9699383ff3349f0907f1b2bf74513785e6d3e411	current sensor fault-tolerant control for direct torque control of induction motor drive using flux-linkage observer		This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for direct torque control of induction motor (IM) drives against the line current sensor failures. Three major steps involved in the proposed FTC scheme are the detection of sensor fault, isolation of the same, and finally, the reconfiguration by proper estimation. Third-difference operator employed in the motor line current is found suitable for the detection of the sensor fault, while flux-linkage observer-based current estimation scheme performs the task of estimation of line current post the occurrence of the fault. Furthermore, a decision-making logic circuitry isolates the faulty signal and simultaneously selects the appropriate estimated current signal to make the drive fault-tolerant. The proposed current sensor FTC scheme is simple and unique in nature. Moreover, it can be universally applied with any speed control schemes involving IM drive. The proposed scheme is simulated and extensively tested in MATLAB/Simulink. The obtained simulation results are also verified using a dSPACE-1104-based IM drive laboratory prototype to show the effectiveness of the scheme.	electronic circuit;fault tolerance;finite difference;flux limiter;inductive reasoning;linkage (software);matlab;prototype;simulation;simulink	Murli Manohar;Sukanta Das	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2714675	control reconfiguration;control engineering;computer science;current sensor;fault tolerance;fault detection and isolation;direct torque control;vector control;induction motor;control theory;electronic speed control	Robotics	68.54127971137403	36.299336125470674	66585

An entire power system consists of multiple homes that are interconnected via a distribution network and that are connected to the commercial power grid. The interconnection is autonomously achieved with a recently developed technology of grid-connected inverters. A mathematical model of slow dynamics of the power system is also developed in this paper. The developed model enables the evaluation of steady and transient characteristics of power systems. key words: power system, architecture, model, bifurcation, uncertainty, system-level design	bifurcation theory;control system;electric power conversion;electronic system-level design and verification;ibm power systems;interconnection;inverter (logic gate);level design;mathematical model	Yoshihiko Susuki;Ryoya Kazaoka;Takashi Hikihara	2013	IEICE Transactions		architecture;theoretical computer science;electric power system;mathematics;power-flow study;interconnection;control engineering;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;maximum power point tracking;energy storage;control system;electrical engineering	Arch	62.51692153955362	37.87207358519211	66596
8e363610e523b904f7608d0eeb571f25aef3152f	a new structure of uhf rfid tag antenna mountable on metallic surface using double slits		In this paper, we have proposed a novel passive ultra high frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) metal tag antenna mountable on the metallic surface to resonate at 930 MHz. The techniques with double slits for impedance matching and reading distance enhancement is used to obtain a good performance. All simulations are carried out by Ansoft HFSS software and Intermec read verifies the measured results. The dimensions of the proposed antenna are around 46 × 28 mm. The Monza R6 chip tag with read sensitivity of up to −20 dBm was used. Good performances such as reasonable reading distance has been observed. The proposed antenna provides a valuable reference for the RFID tag antenna design mounted on metal surface, and it can be widely used in UHF RFID systems.	characteristic impedance;dbm;hfss;impedance matching;performance;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation;ultra high frequency	Juliana Borges Ferreira;Álvaro Augusto Almeida de Salles;Giovani Bulla;Eduardo Luis Rhod	2017	2017 IEEE 9th Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	10.1109/LATINCOM.2017.8240165	radio-frequency identification;reading distance;chip;hfss;acoustics;software;ultra high frequency;impedance matching;electrical impedance;computer science	Mobile	65.69531956065488	59.085659925663755	66617
e56bf1697676872a85e68bfe828d2661d0a81ef3	a switched capacitor energy harvester based on a single-cycle criterion for mppt to eliminate storage capacitor		A single-cycle criterion maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is proposed to eliminate the need for bulky on-chip capacitors in the energy harvesting system for Internet of Everything (IoE). The conventional time-domain MPPT features ultra-low power consumption; however, it also requires a nanofarad-level capacitor for fine time resolution. The proposed maximum power monitoring does not rely on the time-domain, but on logic criterion that can be simply determined by a finite-state machine where the maximum photovoltaic (PV) power occurs at minimum conversion ratio and maximum switching frequency. Single-cycle is used as the criterion to determine the magnitude of the output power. Practical concerns, such as self-startup and self-sustaining capabilities are here addressed by proper design of the reconfigurable switched capacitor power converter. A hysteretic control not only regulates the output, but also avoids the loading condition in IoE applications. This harvester simultaneously addresses the challenges including self-startup, self-sustaining capability, and regulated output without using a storage capacitor. Compared with various PV cells, the power conversion efficiency has a peak value of 72%, which remains above 60% for a wide harvesting voltage and power range. The chip area is as small as 0.552 mm2.	bioinformatic harvester;boosting (machine learning);cmos;clock rate;device configuration overlay;electric power conversion;finite-state machine;hysteresis;maximum power transfer theorem;network switch;positive feedback;single channel per carrier;switched capacitor	Xiaosen Liu;Krishnan Ravichandran;Edgar S&#x00E1;nchez-Sinencio	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2017.2726345	electronic engineering;voltage;capacitor;control theory;mathematics;maximum power principle;decoupling capacitor;switched capacitor;control engineering;energy conversion efficiency;photovoltaic system;maximum power point tracking	EDA	60.37558684814331	45.43602095640137	66637

In this brief, a new digital logarithmic single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SS-ADC) with a digital counter is described. Since the proposed scheme is easily implemented with a simple algorithm, we can reduce power consumption and chip area drastically. Further, the logarithmic SS-ADC enhances the DR by 24 dB. The proposed ADC, which has been fabricated using a 0.13- μm CIS process, achieves a signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio of 57.6 dB at 50 kS/s.	active pixel sensor;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;clock rate;counter (digital);decibel;distortion;dynamic range;fixed-pattern noise;image sensor;normal mode;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	Daeyun Kim;Minkyu Song	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2012.2213359	embedded system;computer vision;dynamic range;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;particle detector	EDA	59.34351848689699	50.592509888850664	66742
d4df686f35ac70d3e64f2cf0f6791ee3a7271baf	accurate synthesis of integrated rf passive components using surrogate models		Passive components play a key role on the design of RF CMOS integrated circuits. Their synthesis, however, is still an unsolved problem due to the lack of accurate analytical models that can replace the computationally expensive electromagnetic simulations (EM). Both, physical-based and surrogate models have been reported that fail to accurately model the complete design space of inductors. Surrogate-assisted optimization techniques, where coarse models are locally enhanced during the inductor synthesis process by using new EM-simulated points to update the model, have been proposed, but either the efficiency is dramatically decreased due to the online EM simulations or the optimization may converge to suboptimal regions. In this paper, we present a new surrogate model, valid in the entire design space with less than 1% error when compared with EM simulations. This model can be generated offline, and, when embedded within an optimization algorithm, allows the synthesis of integrated inductors with high accuracy and high efficiency, reducing the synthesis time in three orders of magnitude.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;cmos;computation;converge;electronic component;embedded system;integrated circuit;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;online and offline;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);simulation;surrogate model;vergence	Fábio Passos;Reinier Gonzalez-Echevarria;Elisenda Roca;R.

In this paper, a method to increase the linear modulation range for zero-CMV operation without increasing the dc-bus voltage using a cascaded multilevel inverter with a single dc supply is presented. Using this method, the peak fundamental output voltage can be increased from 0.499 to 0.637 Vdc with zero CMV inside the linear modulation range. Also, various pulse width modulation (PWM) switching sequences are analyzed in this paper, and the PWM sequence that gives minimum current ripple is used for the zero-CMV operation of the inverter. The inverter topology with single dc supply is realized by cascading a two-level inverter with two floating-capacitor-fed full-bridge modules. Simulation and experimental results for steady-state and dynamic operating conditions are presented to validate the proposed method.	inverter (logic gate);power inverter;pulse-width modulation;ripple effect;simulation;steady state	S.

Considerable work has been done on modeling and applications in specific areas, however, very little is known on the potential of memristors for control applications. Being nanoscopic variable resistors, it is intuitive to think of using them as a variable gain. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a memristive analog gain control framework and theoretic foundation of a control strategy which can be implemented using this framework. Analog memristive controllers may find applications in control of large array of miniaturized devices where robust and adaptive control is needed due to parameter uncertainty and ageing issues.	analog-to-digital converter;control theory;memristor;variable-gain amplifier	Gourav Saha;Ramkrishna Pasumarthy;Prathamesh Khatavkar	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2014.2359715	control engineering;synchronization;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;automatic gain control;memristor;telecommunications;gain;computer science;engineering;control theory;resistance;robustness	Robotics	66.88372254118661	44.99682996421454	66902

The circuit consists of an on-chip threshold-voltage-monitoring circuit, a current-source circuit, a bodybiasing control circuit, and the delay cells of the VCO. Because variations in low-voltage VCO frequency are mainly determined by that of the current in delay cells, a current-compensation technique was adopted by using an on-chip threshold-voltage-monitoring circuit and body-biasing circuit techniques. Monte Carlo SPICE simulations demonstrated that variations in the oscillation frequency by using the proposed techniques were able to be suppressed about 65% at a 1-V supply voltage, compared to frequencies with and without the techniques. key words: voltage-controlled oscillator, process variation, process compensation, body bias, current reference	biasing;current source;monte carlo method;spice;simulation;voltage-controlled oscillator	Ken Ueno;Tetsuya Hirose;Tetsuya Asai;Yoshihito Amemiya	2009	IEICE Transactions		chip;voltage-controlled oscillator;electrical engineering;threshold voltage;low voltage;process variation;oscillation;short circuit ratio;monte carlo method;rl circuit	EDA	60.95761277736708	47.58920978884068	67471

It consists of a Y-branch grating demultiplexer and two p-i-n photodiodes. Polarization-independent operation for two closely spaced channels ( Delta lambda =3.6 nm) at lambda =1.5 mu m was obtained. In polarization-independent operation, 1.3-mm-long Bragg gratings on buried waveguides showed a peak crosstalk attenuation of 15 dB and a stop bandwidth of 0.2 nm at -10 dB. These values show the high potential of Bragg grating devices for dense wavelength division multiplexing applications. The static electrical properties of the monolithically integrated p-i-n photodiodes (dark current of 2-5 nA at -10 V, breakdown voltage of 45-65 at a 10 mu A leakage current) approach the values obtained for discrete devices. The bandwidth of 420 MHz enables operation in the 600-Mbaud region. The external quantum efficiency of the complete detector chip ( eta =0.08) is still rather small. However, it could be considered sufficient for the operation of such devices in local networks with distances of a few kilometers. >		Gerhard Winzer;Walter Döldissen;Cornelius Cremer;F.

The design focuses on the necessary approaches to ensure power transfer over the complete operating range of the system. As such, a new approach to the design of the primary resonant circuit is proposed, whereby deviations from design expectations due to phase or frequency shift are minimized. Of particular interest are systems that are neither loosely nor tightly coupled. The developed solution depends on the selected primary and secondary resonant topologies, the magnetic coupling coefficient, and the secondary quality factor.	battery charger;coefficient;contactless smart card;lc circuit;loose coupling;power supply;systems design	Chwei-Sen Wang;Oskar H.

70f4fef06a201b0dc2e025cff9e3df0768ecdc71	optical quantum gates with semiconductor nanostructures	quantum gate	An all optical implementation of quantum information processing with semiconductor macroatoms is presented. Our quantum hardware consists of an array of semiconductor quantum dots and the computational degrees of freedom, i.e. the qubits, are energy-selected interband optical transitions. The proposed quantum-computing scheme exploits exciton–exciton interactions driven by ultrafast sequences of multi-colour laser pulses. Contrary to existing proposals based on charge excitations, the present all-optical implementation does not require the application of time-dependent electric fields, thus allowing for a sub-picosecond, i.e. decoherence-free, operation time-scale in realistic state-of-the-art semiconductor nanostructures. Moreover, the fully-optical character of the proposed gating scheme makes it an ideal candidate for the realization of all-optical computing networks.

Among the different technologies, UWB is known to potentially offer the best precision. This paper presents a fully integrated low-power UWB impulse radio receiver dedicated to communication and ranging applications. The new architecture based on double quadrature is used to reach sub-cm ranging precision while limiting the speed requirements and complexity of ADC and digital signal processing. Much attention has been paid to rejecting the out-of-band signals which could degrade receiver performance while fully exploiting the available spectrum in the [3-5 GHz] band.

Such probe sensors offer relevant advantages in terms of single-photon sensitivity and high internal gain for relatively low reverse bias. Along with the SiPMs detectors, an ad-hoc processing pipeline, we developed, offers advantages e.g. in order to correct signal distortions. The processing pipeline is composed by the PPG raw signal filter, consisting of a FIR pass-band scheme (low-pass filter plus high-pass ones), the PPG pattern recognition system, and completed with the medical indicators detection system and the indicators extraction.	distortion;finite impulse response;hoc (programming language);low-pass filter;pattern recognition;p–n junction;sensor;waveform	Vincenzo Vinciguerra;Emilio Ambra;Lidia Maddiona;Salvatore Oliveri;Mario Francesco Romeo;Massimo Mazzillo;Francesco Rundo;Giorgio Fallica	2017	2017 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2017.8093327	silicon photomultiplier;electronic engineering;computer science;detector;optical filter;low-pass filter;photoplethysmogram	EDA	55.64684211810617	52.827164168393104	67881

The output of the SRCG can be utilized as a reference clock for frequency acquisition in dual-loop clock-and-data recovery circuits. A frequency-locked loop (FLL) subsequent to the SRCG guides the voltage-controlled oscillator frequency into the pull-in range of the phase-locked loop while suppressing the high-frequency phase noise of the SRCG. The phase noise and frequency offset of the SRCG-FLL pair are analyzed. The validity of the theoretical analysis is supported by results taken from a test chip.	clock generator;clock recovery;data recovery;dual loop;frequency offset;frequency-locked loop;phase noise;phase-locked loop;voltage-controlled oscillator	Jinho Han;Jaehyeok Yang;Hyeon-Min Bae	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2012.2195059	electronic engineering;real-time computing;phase-locked loop;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;clock skew;engineering;electrical engineering;delay-locked loop;control theory;synchronous circuit;phase noise;clock signal	EDA	60.14939793336263	51.00216970642965	67899

The Opamppsilas behavioral model is built with limited unit-gain bandwidth, slew-rate and nonlinear gain. A hyperbolic tangent model has been used to describe the nonlinearity of the Opamppsilas gain, which provides the error less than 0.26% against the transistor-level implementation. During the simulation of sigma-delta modulator, the switch-capacitor circuits and comparator are implemented in transistor level, simulations are performed at the transistor and behavioral mixed level, thus the error caused by time sequence has been introduced into the simulation results. The comparative results show that the Verilog-A model for Opamp incurs an error of no more than 0.3 dB in the magnitude of harmonics while providing a 15times advantage in the simulation speed with respect to transistor-level implementations.	behavioral modeling;comparator;delta-sigma modulation;hardware description language;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;simulation;time series;transistor;verilog;verilog-a	Yi Wang;Yikai Wang;Lenian He	2008	APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746344	operational amplifier;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;control theory;hardware description language	EDA	63.79033171392071	49.366649473828076	68161

The estimation of these variations is made by introducing the current mission profiles extracted from a photovoltaic plant over one year into a calculation tool. The latter is based on a losses model and a thermal model including a coupling between them. The calculation of the losses in SiC MOSFETs in the 3rd quadrant is detailed. The results are the mission profiles of the junction temperature of semiconductors, which allow for determining and comparing the thermal constraints in SiC MOSFET and Si IGBT power modules.	ac adapter;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;inverter (logic gate);power inverter	Mouhannad Dbeiss;Yvan Avenas;Henri Zara	2017	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2017.07.087	engineering;mosfet;electronic engineering;semiconductor;thermal;power module;inverter;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;photovoltaic system;junction temperature	EDA	62.22388255354086	41.390356206856076	68331

bb9d6f48b495a649b9666ad74f37a812533f3f16	influence of gate leakage current on algan/gan hemts evidenced by low frequency noise and pulsed electrical measurements		The study of the pulsed drain current or noise characteristics in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is the key of knowledge for designing the power amplifiers, the low noise amplifiers and the oscillators or mixers, but it is well accepted today that this study is not fully accomplished without pointing on the effect of the gate leakage current; It is obvious that the transistor’s leakage current may disturb its operation at high power and high frequency. Leakage currents studies are also an area of great importance in optimization of safe operating area and reliability of HEMTs. Therefore, room temperature pulsed I-V and low frequency noise measurements of gate and drain currents of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs have been investigated under different bias conditions on two devices showing identical drain current and different gate current levels. The results show a correlation between two non-destructive measurement techniques applied on devices under test.

In order to process real-time synchronous signals from the various parts of the human body, portable devices with multi-channel bio-potential acquisition are needed. We present a multi-channel compressive sensing (CS) technique to enable synchronous acquisition of multi-channel bio-signals for Wearable Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs). The proposed technique exploits inter- and intra-channel sparsities inherent in a multi-channel ensemble to enable higher power savings compared to traditional CS. Simultaneous single-pass reconstruction of multiple signals that are sparse in time and frequency domain are shown using the same front-end hardware and minimal reconstruction overhead. The analysis of coding techniques for the sensing matrix is presented with Gold Codes, which are shown as the best option for a multi-channel WBSN framework achieving near zero cross-correlation between each column of the sensing matrix as well as each input channel. For a 4X compression, the proposed Joint-Compressive Sensing (Joint-CS) technique is shown to require 4% less thresholding with 30 dB better SNR than conventional CS with Bernoulli codes. In addition, an on-chip Gold-Code seed initialization circuit is demonstrated that further strengthens the SNR gains as compared to conventional pseudo-random number based seed initialization, demonstrating a stand-alone Joint-CS implementation.	bernoulli polynomials;british informatics olympiad;code;compressed sensing;cross-correlation;data compression;mobile device;overhead (computing);pseudorandomness;random number generation;real-time locating system;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing);wearable computer	Arya Alex Rahimi;Leonardo Bosco Carreira;Subhanshu Gupta	2016	2016 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS)	10.1109/BioCAS.2016.7833775	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering	EDA	55.4773503043737	52.22856170168587	68475

As device area is decreased to reduce parasitic capacitances and hence achieve higher bandwidth, random mismatches inherently increase. The proposed Survivor strategy circumvents this tradeoff by fabricating a number of small-geometry device pairs on-chip (each of which have high bandwidth) and having the IC self-select the best-matched set of devices during start-up and/or power-on-reset events and use them in critical portions of the circuit. In the experiments conducted on a prototype fabricated using a 0.6-mum CMOS technology, a mirror using the best-matched minimum channel-length pair chosen from a bank of 32 pairs (6 mum/0.6 mum) had a 3-sigma offset performance (1.94%) similar to that of a mirror using 48 mum/4.8 mum devices (1.91%) and hence a bandwidth that was 64 times higher (BW6/0.6ap64BW48/4.8)	amplifier;cmos;comparator;experiment;parasitic element (electrical networks);power-on reset;prototype;transceiver	Vishal Gupta;Gabriel A.

Moreover, the evolution of the main electrical variables is predicted considering different characteristics of the steel to be milled. Within this work, the response of the overcurrent protection of the different filtering banks is analyzed along with different scenarios that could lead to switching operations in those filters. The analysis of the voltage stability and distortion at the point of common coupling (PCC), the evaluation of reactive power flows upstream of the PCC, the prediction of harmonic currents, and the study of the new operating conditions of the filters and the rolling stands under the said contingencies are assessed. The methodology described in this study provides the operator with important information on the expected electrical variables that can be extremely useful in deciding if the hot rolling mill can ride-through unexpected switching states of the filter banks. This forecast can avoid a good number of unscheduled stops, which could result in a significant reduction of production and economical losses.	distortion;filter bank;portable c compiler	Gonzalo A.

The double channel time-interleaved scheme reduces the required operating speed of amplifiers in the sample-and-hold amplifier and multiplying digital-to-analog (D/A) converters by 50%. The switched and shared op-amp with two input pairs amplifies each channel signal without extra series switches while minimizing the gain, bandwidth and offset mismatches between channels. The low-jitter sampling clock with a 50% duty cycle improves the dynamic performance of the wideband input signals significantly. The Flash ADCs employ a differential difference amplifier type pre-amp to continuously process dual-channel outputs. The prototype ADC in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology demonstrates the measured differential nonlinearity and integral nonlinearity within 0.62 and 0.99 LSB, respectively. At 200 MS/s, the ADC shows a maximum SNDR of 52.8 dB and a maximum SFDR of 60.4 dB.

In addition, feedback factor of the first MDAC can be increased, which significantly reduces the power consumption of the first opamp. Simulation results in 90 nm CMOS show that 8.88 bits of effective-number-of-bits at 300 MHz sampling rate can be achieved while consuming 77mW at 1.2V supply.

The proposed compensator is applied to compensate the high reactive-power/harmonic demand of a 12-pulse line-commutated HVDC rectifier terminal. Simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy compensates the reactive power and harmonics of the HVDC converter satisfactorily. All of this is achieved using significantly smaller capacitance at the compensator dc link than the capacitance required in the state-of-the-art shunt compensators employing passive components. The compensator thus would eliminate the need of fundamental-frequency reactive power supply and minimize (or eliminate altogether) the requirement of passive shunt harmonic compensation. This would result into smaller shunt passive filters, smaller or no shunt capacitor banks, and smaller converter transformers, leading to a more compact HVDC terminal, the current size of which is considered to be the main hurdle in its application for integration of large-scale offshore wind energy. Experimental results from a small-scale setup validate the effectiveness observed in the simulations.	power supply;rectifier;simulation;transformers	Muhammad Jafar;Marta Molinas	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2225396	control engineering;volt-ampere reactive;electronic engineering;power factor;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;switched-mode power supply;ac power;electric power system;harmonics	EDA	63.91308490093079	41.54891140401093	69102

As a result, conventional wireless devices can receive these backscattered signals without any modification (neither hardware nor software) to the conventional wireless device. We present a proof of concept using the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, or BLE, standard widely available on smart phones and mobile devices. Our prototype backscatter tag produces three-channel bandpass frequency shift keying (FSK) packets at 1 Mbps that are indistinguishable from conventional BLE advertising packets. An unmodified Apple iPad is shown to correctly receive and display these packets at a range of over 9.4 m using its existing iOS Bluetooth stack with no changes whatsoever. We create all three BLE channels by backscattering a single incident CW carrier using a novel combination of fundamentalmode and harmonic-mode backscatter subcarrier modulation, with two of the band-pass channels generated by the fundamental mode and one of the band-pass channels generated by the second harmonic mode. The backscatter modulator consumes only 28.4 pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional BLE transmitters. The backscatter approach yields over 100X lower energy per bit than a conventional BLE transmitter, while retaining compatibility with billions of existing Bluetooth enabled smartphones and mobile devices.	application-specific integrated circuit;bluetooth;channelization (telecommunications);chipset;data rate units;eb/n0;field-programmable gate array;ibeacon;key (cryptography);mobile device;modulation;normal mode;pre-shared key;prototype;rf modulator;semiconductor;sensor node;smartphone;subcarrier;transmitter;ultra high frequency;ios;ipad	Joshua F.

The system was developed to enable calibration of UHF couplers that are used to detect insulation defects in gas insulated substations. The frequency response of a sensor is determined using fast Fourier transform (FFT) processing of its output voltage when it is subjected to a step electric field with a rise time of less than 300 ps. Provided the step response of the sensor is relatively short, the absorbing termination of the GTEM cell can be dispensed with, simplifying its construction. The need for impedance matching at the cell input can be eliminated by using a signal source that absorbs the reflected energy. In addition, the use of a wire septum offers the potential for improving field uniformity. A description of the measurement system is given, and some typical results are presented.	ultra high frequency	Martin D. Judd;Owen Farish	1998	IEEE Trans.

The proposed sampling-based charge preamplifier with asynchronous self-reset enables a pixel to detect single X-ray photon energy with higher sensitivity and faster processing rate. The use of the correlated double sampling enabled by the sampling-based architecture also reduces flicker noise and contributes to the achievement of high pixel-to-pixel uniformity. Discrimination of the energy level of the detected X-rays is performed by the proposed compact in-pixel ADC with low power consumption. Three 15-bit counters in each pixel count up energy-discriminated photons for the reconstruction of multispectral X-ray images. A 128 × 128 X-ray image detector with a pixel size of 60 × 60 μm2 is implemented and measured using a 0.13-μm/0.35-μm standard CMOS process. It discriminates 3 energy levels of photon energy with a gain of 107 mV/ke- and a static power consumption of 4.6 μW/pixel. The measured equivalent noise charge (ENC) and minimum detectable energy level of the detector pixel are 68 e- rms and 290 e-, respectively. The measured maximum threshold dispersion in the pixel array is 164 e- rms without any calibration. The functionality of our chip is also successfully demonstrated using real X-ray images.	cmos;circuit complexity;discriminator;display resolution;energy level;flicker noise;image resolution;mv-algebra;medical imaging;mercury(ii) iodide;multispectral image;pixel;preamplifier;radiography;sampling (signal processing);sensor;transformer	Hyunsik Kim;Sang-Wook Han;Junhyeok Yang;Sung-il Kim;Young Ho Kim;Sangwook Kim;Dae-Kun Yoon;Jun Su Lee;Jae-Chul Park;Younghun Sung;Seong-Deok Lee;Seung-Tak Ryu;Gyu-Hyeong Cho	2013	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2012.2221196	computer vision;electronic engineering;calibration;image resolution;computer science;preamplifier;optics;physics	Vision	55.12852624124483	49.45540439008249	69544
184bcf07f8aaf25af977731137e8bf7335fdb002	dual band hybrid dielectric resonator antenna for application in ism and unii band	dielectric resonator antenna;radiation;bandwidth	There are many commercial applications, such as mobile radio and wireless communications that use microstrip antennas. Microstrip antennas however have limitations in size, bandwidth, and efficiency. On the other hand, the dielectric resonator (DR) antenna is attractive due to its small-size, high radiation efficient, and ease of excitation.[1-3] Three dielectric properties of materials must be considered for DR antenna used: a high permittivity, a high quality factor, and a near zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency. The size of the DR antenna decreases with increasing the permittivity of the dielectric resonator. The quality factor is representative of the antenna losses. Typically there are radiation, conduction, dielectric, and surface wave losses. Therefore the total quality factor is influenced by these losses. The DR antenna offers very high radiation efficiency due to its low dielectric loss and it has no metallic loss. A near zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency are for high temperature stability. In traditionally, the DR with relatively small permittivity around 10 is chosen for DR antenna to enhance the radiation capability.[4-10] However, low profile DR antenna with relatively low resonant frequency can be achieved by using high permittivity. Recently, dual band antenna has been implemented for applications in WLAN (wireless local area network, 2.4–2.484 GHz), ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) and Bluetooth at low band. Additionally, the dual band antenna can be applied at high band, such as HIPERLAN (high-performance radio local area network, 5.15–5.35 GHz) and Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNNI) applied. In this paper, we present the design of a dual band hybrid antenna consists of a rectangular slot and a circular disk high permittivity dielectric resonator for operating at the ISM band and UNNI band.

This paper presents the modeling, simulation, and characterization of the PDN in a high-speed printed circuit board (PCB) designed for chip-to-chip communication at a data rate of 3.2 Gbps. The test board consists of transmitter and receiver chips wirebonded onto plastic ball grid array (PBGA) packages on a PCB. In this paper, a hybrid method has been applied for analysis which consists of the Transmission Matrix Method (TMM) in the frequency domain and Macromodeling method in the time domain. As an initial step, power/ground planes have been modeled using TMM. Then, the macromodel of the power/ground planes has been generated at the desired ports using macromodeling. Finally, the macromodel of the planes, transmission lines, and nonlinear drivers have been simulated in standard SPICE-based circuit simulators for computing power supply noise. In addition to noise computation, the self and transfer impedances of power/ground planes have been computed and the effect of decoupling capacitors on power supply noise has been analyzed. The methods discussed have been validated using hardware measurements.	ball grid array;clock rate;complex systems;computation;coupling (computer programming);data rate units;digital electronics;frequency response;gigabit;macromodel;matrix method;newton's method;nonlinear system;power supply;printed circuit board;printing;spice 2;semiconductor research corporation;simulation;transmission line;transmitter;wire bonding	Jinwoo Choi;Sung-Hwan Min;Joong-Ho Kim;Madhavan Swaminathan;Wendemagegnehu T.

95737f86e80afbdccfb57b903ef09c439bed552f	12.6 90% peak efficiency single-inductor-multiple-output dc-dc buck converter with output independent gate drive control	mosfet circuits;voltage control;control systems;field effect transistor switches dc dc power convertors driver circuits;dc dc power converters;logic gates;portable electronics single inductor multiple output dc dc buck converter output independent gate drive control simo dc dc buck converters n mosfet switches oigd control low power deadtime overstress recycling dor technique energy loss;proceedings paper;inductors;mosfet circuits logic gates voltage control dc dc power converters control systems recycling inductors;recycling	Single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) DC-DC buck converters, which possess the advantage of compact size, are commonly implemented in portable electronics like mobile phones and tablets. However, their power efficiency is degraded considerably, as illustrated in Fig. 12.6.1, when multiple outputs are requested in a wide range, such as 1.2 to 3.3V for tablets. The use of P-MOSFET [1][2] and N-MOSFET [3] switches results in low efficiency of 64 and 70% at outputs of 1.2 and 3.3V, respectively, because of low gate driving voltages and large on-resistance. This implies that conventional usage of P-MOSFET and N-MOSFET switches is inappropriate in SIMO converters [1-3]. This paper presents a SIMO converter with output-independent gate drive (OIGD) control for all N-MOSFET switches. One of the salient features is that OIGD control achieves output-voltage-independent characteristics on efficiency and keeps peak efficiency of 90% over the range of 1.2 to 3.3V for tablets. The other salient feature is that a low-power deadtime overstress recycling (DOR) technique retrieves 95% of energy loss during deadtime and releases the overstress problem simultaneously.	analog-to-digital converter;buck converter;computer recycling;dc-to-dc converter;erewhon;low-power broadcasting;mobile computing;mobile phone;network switch;performance per watt;tablet computer	Yi-Ping Su;Chiun-He Lin;Shen-Yu Peng;Ru-Yu Huang;Te-Fu Yang;Shin-Hao Chen;Ting-Jung Lo;Ke-Homg Chen;Chin-Long Wey;Ying-Hsi Lin;Chao-Cheng Lee;Jian-Ru Lin;Tsung-Yen Tsai	2015	2015 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC) Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063007	control engineering;electronic engineering;logic gate;engineering;control system;control theory;inductor;recycling	Mobile	61.59877797898431	43.65595731277874	69718

To decrease the computation times by eliminating the matrix inversion, a reluctance matrix (RM) based model of an induction machine is developed. This model, however, is a fundamental-wave model which doesn't consider the slotting in the machine. The model enhancement introduced in this paper allows the implementation of the higher harmonics. The proposed model with slot harmonics was compared with the model based on matrix inversion in order to highlight the speedup in computation time. An experimental setup consisting of a 4.2 kW IM with wound rotor connected to a DC machine is described.

The proposed system is a unique combination of a low-kilovoltampere 12-pulse rectifier system with a single-phase boost PFC scheme to shape the input current to near sinusoidal waveshape. The voltampere rating of the active PFC converter is 0.05 pu and is not exposed to line transients under varying load conditions. The proposed system is suitable for utility interface of higher power rectifiers employed in power supplies and adjustable-speed drive systems which demand clean input power characteristics in the range of 1-500 kW. The proposed system is rugged and, in the event the active control were to fail, the system reverts to 12-pulse operation with fifth and seventh harmonic cancellation. Analysis and design of the system is examined in detail, and simulation and experimental results on a 10 kVA prototype are shown.		Bang Sup Lee;Jaehong Hahn;Prasad N. Enjeti;Ira J.

The design considerations and analysis of operation for the employed class-AB rectifier are described. Fabricated in a standard 0.35-mum CMOS process, the RF detector uses only 0.031 of area and presents an equivalent input capacitance of 13 fF.

Following the Lyapunov approach, we designed an adaptive law to cope with uncertainties in the disturbance signals and parameters. Complexity of the proposed controller is reduced by rotations which transform the adaptive terms into a sum of resonant filters tuned at the frequencies of the harmonics under compensation, and operating on the output voltage error. To facilitate the implementation, we have tried to preserve the structure of the proposed controller as close as possible to the conventional one, which includes a voltage outer loop (basically a proportional plus integral (PI) control on the output voltage error) and an inner control loop (basically a proportional control plus a feedforward term). In the proposed controller, the bank of resonant filters appears as a refinement term added to the inner control loop. Indeed, they insert notches in the audio-susceptibility curve, which are tuned at the harmonics under compensation. Thus, in addition to the benefits of a conventional feedforward PWM control, the bank of resonant filters are able to cancel selected harmonics. Experimental results on a boost converter board, using a poorly regulated voltage source, are presented to assess the performance of our approach.	boost converter;complexity;control system;distortion;feedforward neural network;lyapunov fractal;prototype;pulse-width modulation;refinement (computing);ripple effect;robustness (computer science);voltage source	Gerardo Escobar;Andres A.

Intensive research efforts in the past have been focused on the flux signature analysis as they have been more efficient compared to classical motor current signature analysis. In this paper, it is observed that a flux sensing simple internal observer coil (OC) is more succinct than external flux sensors. The proposed simplified, inexpensive technique has yet not been reported in the literature. The new results of root mean square (RMS), fundamental, third harmonic, and total harmonic distortion analysis of the voltage spectra of the OCs are found to exhibit variations in relation to the severity of interturn faults as compared to the healthy condition. The mathematical theory of the technique is provided and supported by an experimental validation. An experiment for confirming the performance of the proposed method was done on a 2.2-kW three-phase four-poles, 440-V squirrel-cage induction motor, increasing the fault level in steps from 1% to 15% combined with variations in load from no load to full load.	faraday cage;fault detection and isolation;mean squared error;methods of computing square roots;radial (radio);sensor;squirrel;tesla coil;total harmonic distortion	Gulamfaruk N.

To undertake a low-voltage input (e.g., from thermoelectric or solar source), our CP scheme features a differential bootstrapped ring-VCO generating six-phase clock signals with a boosted swing. Driven by replicas of these swing-boosted clock signals, the entailed number of CP stages is reduced and a 1:10 step-up ratio can be achieved with only a 3-stage CP, resulting in a higher PCE. Using the replicas of the clock signals also reduces substantially the dependency of the clock frequency on the load drivability. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, a 0.87-V output voltage is measured at a 38.8% power conversion efficiency, under a 500- $\text{k} {\Omega }$  load and a 0.15-V input.

It involves the employment of a load-modifying element (load-healer) so as to extend the range of frequency-dependent complex load that could be matched. Two simple load-healers incorporated in the conventional T-network are used to illustrate the concept. The proposed scheme can be successfully applied in many situations where conventional matching networks are severely limited. Two prototypes operating concurrently at 1 and 2 GHz are designed corresponding to the two types of load-healer. They are implemented on FR4 substrate having a dielectric constant of 4.6, a substrate height of 1.5 mm, and a 35-$\mu\text{m}$ copper cladding.

To achieve power-efficient massively parallel analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) in a 2-D array, a 10-bit 30 MS/s beamforming ADC that merges the subarray beamforming and digitization functions in the charge domain is proposed. It eliminates the need for costly intermediate buffers, thus significantly reducing both power consumption and silicon area. Self-calibrated charge references are implemented in each subarray to further optimize the system-level power efficiency. High-speed datalinks are employed in combination with the subarray beamforming scheme to realize a 36-fold channel-count reduction and an aggregate output data rate of 6 Gb/s for a prototype receive array of  $24 \times 6$  elements. The ASIC achieves a record power efficiency of 0.91 mW/element during receive.

The extent to which finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is influenced by parametric uncertainties is a recurrent concern at the moment of evaluating the viability of this method for power electronics applications. This paper proposes an analytic approach to examine the influence of model parametric uncertainties on the prediction error of FCS-MPC for current control in a three-phase two-level inverter. The analysis shows that the prediction error is not only determined by parametric mismatch but also by the instantaneous values of load current and inverter output voltage. This implies that within each sampling period of the predictive algorithm several conditions of prediction error are generated, as multiple voltage vectors are evaluated. Simulation and experimental results are provided and discussed showing the effects of inaccuracies in the modeling of load resistance and inductance parameters on the performance of FCS-MPC. Even though steady-state performance is noticeably affected with parameter changes, especially when the load inductance is overestimated by the model, its fast transient step response is less affected by parameter changes.	distortion;experiment;genetic algorithm;input impedance;iteration;parametric polymorphism;power electronics;power inverter;recurrent neural network;ripple effect;sampling (signal processing);simulation;steady state;step response	Héctor A.

The first step of settling places charge onto the load capacitance using charge pumps, and the second fulfills the settling requirements using typical negative feedback around an operational amplifier. Hence, the design combines the efficiency of a fast charge-transfer phase with the gain and noise-immunity advantages of amplifier-driven settling. Improved conversion efficiency results from a higher ratio of current delivered to the load to that consumed in static biasing. Additional circuitry constrains critical amplifier node voltages during the charge transfer, facilitating a graceful transition to amplifier-driven settling. The two-step settling technique is demonstrated in a 2.5 bit/stage 10-bit pipelined ADC that consumes 11.1 mW while sampling a 21.3 MHz input signal at 42 MS/s. The resulting SNDR is 55.6 dB (ENOB = 8.94) and the SFDR is 67.5 dB.	analog-to-digital converter;biasing;boolean algebra;cmos;comparator;decibel;delta-sigma modulation;displacement mapping;effective number of bits;electronic circuit;image scaling;negative feedback;network switch;operational amplifier;power supply;rejection sampling;requirement;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);small-signal model;spurious-free dynamic range;switched capacitor	Charles T.

1914eaeff06ce91a61688a29ceade6f74063b371	nine level t-type neutral point clamped voltage source inverter for induction motor drive		The paper proposes a three phase nine level T-type neutral point clamped (9L-T-NPC) inverter for medium voltage induction motor drive. The primary objective of the proposed inverter is to improve the output voltage quality with reduced number of devices and passive components. The generation of nine levels in the output pole voltage is achieved using only ten switches per phase. Although the similar structure of the inverter is well-suited for seven level operation, by using a suitable modulation technique, nine levels can be generated in the output pole voltage without increasing the active and passive devices. In this proposed inverter, the flying capacitors in the inverter are properly controlled at the required voltage levels using redundant switching states. The performance of the inverter fed induction motor drive is analyzed using simulation results under varying modulation index and load conditions. Vector control is implemented for the speed control of the induction motor and tested under different transient conditions. A new PWM technique is proposed to balance the flying capacitors during common-mode voltage injection so that the inverter can deliver full active power up to modulation index of 1.15.	capacitor device component;charge pump;hysteresis;inverter device component;mathematical induction;np-completeness;network switch;pokeweed mitogens;power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;smo protein, human;simulation;steady state;switch device component;switched capacitor;voltage source	Teenu Techela Davis;Anubrata Dey	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216226	three-phase;control theory;engineering;inverter;vector control;voltage source;induction motor;ac power;electronic speed control;pulse-width modulation	Robotics	65.01609679882216	41.085755391735624	70439

First, the impulse responses between any pair of terminals of lines are obtained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In this calculation, the characteristic impedance of the interconnect is imposed at every terminal in order to converge quickly the transient waveforms. Next, the frequency responses are obtained by the Fourier transform of these transient waveforms. Then, the time-domain models are synthesized from the frequency responses by using the least square approximation and the complex frequency hopping technique. Finally, with this model, the transient responses are rapidly simulated by the conventional circuit simulators. In conclusion the validity of this method is verified by comparison with the time-consuming FDTD simulation.	electrical connection;finite-difference time-domain method	Takayuki Watanabe;Hideki Asai	1999		10.1109/ISCAS.1999.780146	control engineering;fourier transform;electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics	EDA	71.26495190235254	45.07134685689103	70510

In future, PEV load will play a significant role in the distribution grids. This integrated load into the power grid may overload the system components, increase power losses, and affect the voltage profile in the distribution systems. Currently, the constant power load model is most commonly used for the modeling of the electric vehicle (EV) load that considers the EV loads as constant power elements without considering the voltage dependence of the EV charging system. EV load demand cannot be considered as a constant power due to the fact that modeling as a constant power load will not provide accurate information about the behavior of the charging system during the charging process. In this paper, an accurate model representing the realistic behavior of EV load is developed which is based on the ZIP load model with the ZIP parameters established through the realistic EV load data. The proposed model can be used to analyze the true behavior of the EV charger integrated to an electricity grid and determine the impacts of EV charging load on the grid. A realistic charging system was used to test and capture the EV load behavior and extract the coefficients of the EV ZIP load model, which have been verified using computer simulations and laboratory experiments. Additionally, a comparative study between the proposed ZIP load model and the constant power load model was carried out, and the results were verified with the practical EV load data. The results confirm that EV represented using constant power load will not provide the true reflection of the EV load behavior and the EV impacts on the power grid.	battery charger;coefficient;computer simulation;experiment;extended validation certificate;ibm power systems;iteration;load balancing (computing);load profile;plug-in (computing)	Ahmed M.

The proposed architecture employs low-power register files and resource-sharing techniques, thus consuming less power than many existing works. The proposed design adopts a number of area-efficient hardware structures to further reduce the hardware cost.

fb6d1fa5aecf9a4afa317dce77a320e78c9a2c1b	beijing converters: bridge converters with a capacitor added to reduce leakage currents, dc-bus voltage ripples, and total capacitance required	reliability;density measurement;legged locomotion;power system measurements;leakage currents;capacitors;capacitance	Isolation transformers and bulky electrolytic capacitors are often used in power electronic converters to reduce leakage currents and voltage ripples but this leads to low power density and reduced reliability. In this paper, an auxiliary capacitor is added to the widely used conventional full-bridge converter to provide a path for, and hence significantly reduce, the leakage current. The operation of the full-bridge converter is split into the operation of a half-bridge converter and a dc-dc converter so that the ripple energy can be diverted from the dc-bus capacitor to the auxiliary capacitor. Hence, the dc-bus capacitor can be significantly reduced while maintaining very low voltage ripples on the dc bus because it is only required to filter out switching ripples. The auxiliary capacitor is designed to allow high voltage ripples because its voltage is not supplied to any load. Accordingly, the auxiliary capacitor can also be very small as well. As a result, the total required capacitance becomes very small. The reduction ratio of the total capacitance is significant, which makes it cost-effective to use film capacitors instead of electrolytic capacitors. The proposed converters can be also operated as an inverter without any restriction on power factor because the adopted four switches are all bidirectional in terms of power flow. Experimental results for both rectification and inversion modes are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed converter in reducing the ripples, the leakage currents, and the total capacitance needed, with comparison to the conventional bridge converter without the auxiliary capacitor.	dc-to-dc converter;network switch;power inverter;rectifier;ripple effect;sandy bridge;spectral leakage;thin-film transistor;transformers	Qing-Chang Zhong;Wen-Long Ming;Wanxin Sheng;Yongsheng Zhao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2609839	reservoir capacitor;control engineering;electronic engineering;capacitor;engineering;electrical engineering;reliability;leakage;capacitance;physics;boost converter;decoupling capacitor	EDA	62.54598460541958	42.92289064570691	70928

3aa090cbb06fa7d43e536d38835b8a801ffcbc23	a distributed finite-time secondary average voltage regulation and current sharing controller for dc microgrids		This paper proposes a distributed finite-time secondary controller to achieve average voltage regulation and proportionate current sharing within a finite settling time for autonomous network of dc microgrids. It is employed by using a distributed finite-time control approach which maintains average voltage regulation of the system facilitating proportionate current sharing simultaneously by virtue of dynamic consensus between its neighbors. The proposed scheme ensures an improved performance over the conventional distributed secondary methods by reducing overshoots and chattering which is significant for critical operation of the loads. The proposed control strategy is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment to test link-failure resiliency, plug and play capability, and controller performance under communication delays within a tolerable upper bound on delay determined using time-delay analysis. Moreover the effect of variable time delays in different transmission medium is also simulated to test the practicality of the approach. This strategy is further tested on a 500-W FPGA-based experimental prototype to validate the control approach under different scenarios.

A modelling platform, based on a meet-in-the-middle approach between top-down and bottom-up design strategies, allows a fast but still accurate exploration of the mixed-signal design space. Different amplifier architectures are configured and compared to find optimal trade-offs among different cost-functions: low distortion, high efficiency, low circuit complexity and low sensitivity to parameter changes. A novel amplifier architecture is derived; its prototype implements digital processing IP macrocells (oversampler, interpolating filter, PWM cross-point deriver, noise shaper, multilevel PWM modulator, dead time compensator) on a single low-complexity FPGA while off-chip components are used only for the power output stage (LC filter and power MOS bridge); no heatsink is required. The resulting digital input amplifier features a power efficiency higher than 90% and a total harmonic distortion down to 0.13% at power levels of tens of Watts. Discussions towards the full-silicon integration of the mixed-signal amplifier in embedded devices, using BCD technology and targeting power levels of few Watts, are also reported.	algorithm;audio power;audio signal processing;binary-coded decimal;bottom-up proteomics;circuit complexity;class-d amplifier;digital data;digital electronics;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;heat sink;interpolation;lc circuit;low-power broadcasting;meet-in-the-middle attack;mixed-signal integrated circuit;noise shaping;performance per watt;power semiconductor device;prototype;pulse-width modulation;top-down and bottom-up design;total harmonic distortion;watts humphrey	Sergio Saponara;Pierangelo Terreni	2010	EURASIP J.

The methodology is established and subsequently applied to two areas of power system analysis - small-disturbance stability and sub-synchronous resonance (SSR). In the first case, probability density functions (pdfs) for critical oscillatory electromechanical modes are established based on the stochastic variation of system uncertainties such as generation and loading. These pdfs provide probabilities of unstable or poorly damped oscillations that are evaluated using risk-based approaches. For SSR analysis, frequency scans are completed to identify generators which are at risk of experiencing high mechanical torques. In both cases, evaluation using severity functions is used to ensure that acceptable levels of risk are not exceeded. The proposed methods are demonstrated using a meshed power system with capacitor series compensated AC tie lines.	coefficient;control theory;decstation;emoticon;ibm power systems;instability;microwave;modal logic;resonance;stochastic process;system analysis	Robin Preece;A.

An external substrate ring is shown to be essential in capturing and modeling the inherent inductance of the MIM capacitor. Additionally, deembedding of series parasitics plays a very important role in modeling of MIM capacitors since these devices have very low series resistance. Various short structures were studied and their impact on the MIM characteristics are reported. It is shown that a short structure with the shortest path to ground is best suited to deembed the series parasitics.	back end of line;cmos;radio frequency;series and parallel circuits;shortest path problem	Shyam Parthasarathy;Balaji Swaminathan;Ananth Sundaram;Robert A.

Ginzton Laboratory, Stanford University Stanford, California 94305 OPTICAL FIBER DELAY LINES Single mode optical fiber is an excellent delay medium for broadband signal processing because it exhibits extremely low loss and dispersion. Two new forms of a fiber delay line are presented, each capable of performing a variety of signal processing functions. In the macrobend tapped delay line, the optical signal is tapped by forming sharp bends in a fiber coil. A 16-tap device with 1 ns tap intervals has been demonstrated as a 1 Gb/s sequence generator and matched filter. A 19-tap device was demonstrated as a frequency filter with a fundamental passband at 1 6Hz. The v-groove tapped delay line makes use of arrays of silicon v-grooves to precisely align and position an array of adjustable evanescently coupled fiber taps. A 4-tap vgroove device was used as a 500 Mb/s sequence generator and matched filter. A similar 7-tap device was demonstrated as a discretely variable delay line, and as a programmable filter whose fundamental passband could be varied in discrete steps from 69 MHz to 1.67 GHz. Both of the delay line designs presented appear to be extendable to include large numbers of closely spaced taps.	align (company);analog delay line;bend radius;delay line memory;evanescent field;extensibility;gigabyte;jackson;matched filter;mebibyte;newton;optical fiber;signal processing	S.

The feedback loop inherent in a simultaneous bidirectional link provides a natural opportunity to use adaptive pre-emphasis to compensate for channel characteristics. The system determines the degree of corruption of a received signal and generates a pulse width modulated signal which gets sent back through the bidirectional link to control the amount of pre-emphasis that is used. The technique has been verified using Cadence SpectreRF and Verilog-A simulators, where the channel loss characteristics are based on an FR-4 material model. The simulation results show that the system automatically selects the best fit for the observed channel loss compensation, which then reduces the efforts needed to recover the data at each receiver.	curve fitting;emphasis (telecommunications);fr-4;feedback;pulse-width modulation;signalling system no. 7;simulation;verilog;verilog-a	Ming-Ta Hsieh;Gerald E.

With the graft scheme, the typical PWM switch-mode converters, such as buck-boost, boost-buck (Cuk), Sepic, and dual Sepic, can be generated from the two basic converters, buck and boost. The small signal models of these converters can, therefore, be derived by properly combining those of the buck and boost. Using the proposed approach can help to yield highly related dynamic models of the converters in a family and, in addition, physical insights into the converters can be readily identified. This has made the proposed modeling method valuable and viable.	grafting (decision trees);pulse-width modulation	Tsai-Fu Wu;Yu-Kai Chen	1998	IEEE Trans.

The storage system consists of a fuel cell (FC), serving as the main power source, and a supercapacitor (SC), serving as an auxiliary power source. It also contains a power block for energy conversion consisting of a boost converter connected with the main source and a boost-buck converter connected with the auxiliary source. The converters share the same dc bus, which is connected to the traction motor through an inverter. These power converters must be controlled to meet the following requirements: 1) tight dc bus voltage regulation, 2) perfect tracking of the SC current to its reference, and 3) asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. A nonlinear controller is developed, on the basis of the system nonlinear model, making use of Lyapunov stability design techniques. The latter accounts for the power converters' large-signal dynamics and for the FC nonlinear characteristics. It is demonstrated using both a formal analysis and simulations that the developed controller meets all desired objectives.	boost converter;buck converter;cell (microprocessor);computer data storage;control theory;controller (computing);large-signal model;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;power inverter;requirement;simulation;switched-mode power supply;traction teampage;voltage regulation	Hassan El Fadil;Fouad Giri;Josep M.

Each is based on a known linear interpolation algorithm and modified for third order forward differencing. The tradeoff between overflow avoidance and loss of precision has made forward differencing a method which, although known to be fast, can be difficult to implement. It is shown that there is one particular family of curves which represents the worst case, in the sense that if a member of this family can be accurately drawn without overflow, then any curve which fits in the bounding box of that curve can be. From this the limitations in terms of step count and screen resolution are found for each of the two algorithms.	algorithm;autoregressive integrated moving average;best, worst and average case;bicubic interpolation;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;display resolution;fits;finite difference;linear interpolation;minimum bounding box	R.

One main reason is the cost of generating non electrical test stimuli. Hence, replacing the functional multi-domain test equipments with electrical ones arouses interest. The focus of this paper is on sensitivity testing and calibration through fully electrical measurements. A new method based on analytical expressions of the sensitivity with respect to both physical parameters of the structure and electrical test parameters is proposed The accuracy of the method is evaluated by mean of a high level model including global and intra-die mismatch variations. It is shown that an accurate estimation of the sensitivity can be achieved using only electrical measurements and that the dispersions on the sensitivity can be divided by about 7 after the calibration procedure. These results are promising enough for high volume production of low-cost sensors.	high-level programming language;microelectromechanical systems;sensor	Norbert Dumas;Florence Azaïs;Frédérick Mailly;Andrew Richardson;Pascal Nouet	2008	2008 11th IEEE Workshop on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems	10.1109/DDECS.2008.4538807	control engineering;electronic engineering;calibration;computer science;engineering;electrical measurements;electrical engineering;operating system;capacitive sensing;accelerometer	EDA	70.31394147215474	49.93193095414845	72031

Rapid response to requirements for frequency, gain, and skew angle inspired a search for an alternative to conventional, commercial slot array acquisition. The solution to this requirement is high-resolution 3-D printing of modified slot arrays combined with metal plating. Modification of the structure included removal of wall material in regions where these openings would not cause radiation, opening the structure to enable metal plating while not affecting gain. A 3-D-printed slot array requires no further assembly, unlike conventional waveguide-based arrays that require soldering or brazing, block machining, or plate assembled, brazed structures. Stereolithography 3-D printing of plastic slot array antennas, modified to enable metal plating, has been used to produce a 30 dBi realized gain slot array at 21 GHz for under $1000 USD in a few weeks. Metal plated, 3-D printed plastic slot arrays are also very lightweight in comparison with conventional metal structures. Performance of 3-D printed, metal plated slot arrays has been shown to be identical to conventional metal structures at frequencies up to 22 GHz.	3d printing	Gregory Peter Le Sage	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2544278	slot antenna	Visualization	68.37082333490983	58.46955340156967	72061

Most importantly, it is found that the single-layer SFPM machine is with asymmetric back-EMFs, due to which the performance of sensorless control will deteriorate. In order to minimize this influence, a control strategy is developed for the improvement of accuracy of rotor position estimation, which is based on the elimination of back-EMF harmonics and not sensitive to the machine parameters. In addition, it also shows that the developed strategy is easy for implementation and the experimental results confirm that the influence of asymmetric and non-sinusoidal back-EMF can be effectively compensated. Consequently, an improvement in the accuracy of rotor position estimation is achieved at both steady and dynamic states as compared with those conventional methods without compensation.	control theory;eclipse modeling framework;experiment;linkage (software);prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;waveform	T.

Battery management systems (BMS) are key technology of electric vehicles (EV) or hybrid EV. BMS is assembled by battery modules consisting of series of battery cells. Owing to high supply voltage and large current, the HV current sensors are needed for security, but they are not easily implemented on chip. Thus, we proposes an on-chip high-voltage current sensor to resolve this issue. The proposed HV current sensor in this work provides a wide sensing voltage range as well as large sense current range. The proposed design is implemented using a typical 0.25 μm 1P3M 60V BCD process. The on-chip sensing current range of the proposed HV current sensor is from 0.5 A to 1 A. The error of the proposed HV current sensor is only ± 0.37 %. Notably, the sensing voltage range is up to 20 V~40 V.	battery management system;binary-coded decimal;extended validation certificate;sensor	Chua-Chin Wang;Wen-Je Lu;Sheng-Syong Wang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on IC Design & Technology	10.1109/ICICDT.2014.6838585	fiber optic current sensor;embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	58.39137946277993	45.29683182449019	72193

Unlike the traditional buck-boost converter, this converter possesses fast transient responses, similar to the behavior of the buck converter with synchronous rectification. In addition, it possesses the non-pulsating output current, thereby not only decreasing the current stress on the output capacitor but also reducing the output voltage ripple. Furthermore, it has the positive output voltage, different from the negative output voltage of the traditional buck-boost converter. Above all, there are two types of KY buck-boost converters presented herein. In this paper, the basic operating principles of the proposed converters are first illustrated in detail, and second, some experimental results are offered to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topologies.	active rectification;boost converter;buck converter;buck–boost converter;low-power broadcasting;nsa product types;performance;pulse (signal processing);rectifier;ripple effect	K.

By implementing a one-cycle buck DC-DC converter, it is demonstrated that the dynamic power MOSFET width controlling technique has a much improved power reduction whether the load current is light or heavy. The maximum efficiency of the buck converter is ∼ 92% with a 3% efficiency improvement for the heavy load condition. The efficiency is further improved by ∼16% for the light load condition as a result of the power reduction from the large power MOSFET transistors. Also proposed is a new error-correction loop circuit to enable a better load regulation than that of previous designs. Compared with the adaptive gate driver voltage technique, the optimum power MOSFET width can achieve a significant improvement in power saving. It is also superior to the low-voltage-swing MOSFET gate drive technique for switching DC-DC converters.	power mosfet	Ke-Horng Chen;Chieh-Ching Chien;Ching-Hsun Hsu;Li-Ren Huang	2007	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds:20050331	electronic engineering;error detection and correction;buck converter;engineering;electrical engineering;power electronics;power mosfet;control theory;gate driver;low voltage;power semiconductor device	EDA	63.198357171999255	45.35336027619922	72324

The chip can recover BPSK modulated Gaussian monocycle pulses (GMP), along with its first derivative, at a data rate of 500 Mb/s. No clock reception is required, as the receiver recovers data based on the relative phase of the two simultaneously received inputs. While retrieving the data, it consumes a power of 63 mW from a supply voltage of 1.8 V. A shunt-peaked narrow band amplifier, matched to the input antenna, is used to amplify the received GMP. Wireless data have been successfully recovered using a pair of horn antennas at a distance of 6 cm. The chip, developed in a 180 nm CMOS technology, occupies a die area of 3.4 mm 2 .

The wideband communication system is needed in order to guarantee the flexibility and robustness of the control system in both transient and dynamic performance. Therefore, it should be modelled together with the controller system as a communication-control system. The detailed model of voltage source converters (VSCs) is considered as well as communication system components in order to investigate the stability of power electronics systems in presence of a communication system in the feedback loop of the controller. The communication system elements such as noise, delay, and level of distortion due to quantization are selected to realistically model a practical situation.	bifurcation theory;centralized computing;channel (communications);control system;distortion;feedback;image noise;microgrid;power electronics;simulation;sysop;voltage source	Mehdi Karbalaye Zadeh;Reza Parseh;Marta Molinas;Kimmo Kansanen	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688047	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.72477706750345	37.37575360572295	72494

By using liquid crystal cells with variable birefringence, we have achieved a wavelength tuning of 33 ITU channels, for a 100-GHz frequency spacing, from 1564.69 to 1530.32 nm via a 10-stage hybrid Solc filter. The designed device presents a tuning step of 0.1 nm by applying a voltage difference of 0.2 V. The optical cancelling technique is used to make a 3-dB bandwidth tuning between 0.31 and 1.4 nm. The channel’s bandwidth is adjusted for different kinds of 40-Gbps modulated channels spectra. The 10-stage hybrid Solc filter provides theoretically an insertion loss of 4.6 dB, by using polarizers and birefringent plates characterized by high anti-reflection coatings, while its crosstalk approximates 14 dB. The proposed filter provides very low polarization-dependent loss through the incorporation of a polarization beam splitter and a polarization beam combiner.	beam robotics;birefringence;crosstalk;data rate units;lumpers and splitters;modulation;perl data language (pdl);polarization (waves);polarizer;power dividers and directional couplers;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing;waveplate	Abderrahmane Hadj Slimane;Fethallah Karim	2017	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-017-0691-2	polarizer;computer network;computer science;birefringence;insertion loss;beam splitter;electronic engineering;electro-optic effect;telecommunications;wavelength-division multiplexing;communication channel;bandwidth (signal processing)	HPC	65.32597616155273	56.76467998208707	72531

The new method works on circuit matrices directly and reduces the circuit complexities by eliminating subcircuits in a hierarchical way. The resulting admittances in the reduced networks are kept as rational functions of s with reduced order. Some theoretical results are characterized for the presence of common factors coming from the suppression of sub-circuits. A novel common factor removal (de-cancellation) strategy based on a graph-based hierarchical subcircuit reduction process is proposed. The resulting reduction algorithm is applicable to any linear circuits in s-domain. The stability of the reduced system is enforced by applying the Hurwitz polynomial approximation. The reduced systems can be used for fast s-domain analysis and for time domain waveform evaluation. Experimental results on both linear analog circuits and RLC circuits, and comparison with SPICE in s-domain analysis are also provided.	algorithm;network topology	Sheldon X.-D.

This paper presents a new procedure for tracing the loop currents which results in one-to-one correspondence between the number of integrators in the stimulation setup and the count of independent energy-storing elements in the network, i.e., the degree of the system's characteristic equation. The generality of the procedure proves that it is always possible to trace the loop currents in such a way that excess integrators are avoided. The loop-analysis and the branch-variables-analysis approaches are discussed and examples given.	simulation	Joseph Otterman	1958	IRE Trans.

The proposed circuit uses two dual-X second generation multi-output current conveyors (DX-MOCCII), two grounded capacitors and three grounded resistors. The circuit configuration realizes low-pass filter (LPF), high-pass filter (HPF), band-pass filter (BPF), notch filter (NF) and all-pass filter (APF) responses simultaneously at different output terminals. The new circuit enjoys the features of low input impedance and high output impedance, which is desirable and useful for cascadability in CM circuits. For realizing the universal filter responses, the proposed circuit configuration does not require matching constraint of passive components and both active and passive sensitivities are found low.

Basically, the current as a function of time is calculated by taking the gradient of the minority carrier charge stored in the base region. Two methods of approximating the distribution of stored charge are described. Good agreement has been obtained between calculated and experimental results; it is found that the rise time for the resistance-load case is about four times that for a capacitance-load case which produces the same peak current. A practical pulse generator circuit is described in which the resistance load takes the form of a delay-line. The performance of this circuit is compared with that of a capacitance-load relaxation oscillator; while the rise time of the former is longer, the pulse shape is more easily controlled.	transistor	Douglas J.

Signals processed in continuous time provide an improved Signal to Noise ratio and the power consumption can be reduced, due to the property that the signal is only processed when an appropriate change in the analog input signal occurs. Therefore this kind of signal processing is interesting for a wide range of applications. However, there are still some critical aspects with respect to the implementation of continuous time systems. In particular the required chip area and the power consumption of CT delay elements proposed up to now is quite large. Therefore in this contribution a new concept for continuous time delay elements will be introduced, which offers considerable improvements with respect to size and power consumption.	broadcast delay;ct scan;digital signal processing;sampled data system;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Karsten Konrad;Dieter Brückmann;Nima Tavangaran;Jidan Al-Eryani;Rainer Kokozinski;Thomas Werthwein	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6572454	multidimensional signal processing;electronic engineering;real-time computing;start signal;digital down converter;common-mode signal;signal transfer function;audio signal processing;analog signal;digital signal;computer science;electrical engineering;signal chain;operating system;digital signal processing;signal processing;noise;multiplicative noise;sampling;low-power electronics;signal	Embedded	57.011908216130706	53.307741748333505	72737

A linearizing dual-slope digital converter (LDSDC) that accepts a thermistor sensor as input and provides a digital output that is directly proportional to the temperature being sensed is presented here. A logarithmic amplifier at the input of the LDSDC compensates for the exponential characteristics. The conversion logic of the underlying dual-slope converter is suitably modified to implement the required inversion and offset correction and thus obtain linearization over a wide range of input temperature. The efficacy of the proposed LDSDC is established through simulation studies and its practicality demonstrated with experimental results obtained on a prototype unit built and tested. Analysis of the proffered method to identify possible sources of errors is also presented.	integrating adc;log amplifier;prototype;sensor;simulation;time complexity	N. Madhu Mohan;V.

Still, two major disadvantages exist: a lower than unity voltage transfer ratio and high sensitivity to power grid disturbances. Many solutions to provide continuous operation of adjustable speed drives (ASDs) during power grid disturbances have been proposed, but they are all applied to dc-link ASD. In this paper, a new solution to provide limited ride-through operation is presented with a matrix converter using a scalar controlled induction motor for a duration of hundreds of milliseconds, without any hardware modification. During the ride-through operation, the drive is not able to develop torque or to control the motor flux. By recovering the necessary power to feed the control hardware of the matrix converter, it is able to keep the ASD operating. When normal grid conditions are reestablished, the matrix converter is able to accelerate the motor from nonzero speed and flux by initializing the modulator with the estimated frequency and the initial angle of the reference output voltage vector. The maximum duration of the ride-through operation depends on the initial motor flux, speed level, rotor time constant, load torque, and inertia. This method is verified on a laboratory setup with a matrix converter.	ac/ac converter;continuous operation;displacement mapping;flux limiter;flux qubit;modulation;r.o.t.o.r.;the matrix;unity	Christian Klumpner;Frede Blaabjerg	2002	IEEE Trans.

6b40ea57ac8e98062fce9c8d7d34afdfccbd8878	an application of groebner bases to the classification of nonlinear circuits	nonlinear circuits	One of the application of Groebner base to the classification of nonlinear circuits is proposed. The circuits are excited by a sinusoidal electric voltage or current sources with an angular frequency. In an evaluation of electric circuits the first thing we have to do is to estimate the amplitude characteristic which is defined as the polynomial equation of two variables. These variables are the amplitude of the sources and that of harmonic component of the current or voltage in the circuit elements. The estimation tends to be performed on individual nonlinear circuit. If we are able to classify the nonlinear circuits into several groups based on the amplitude characteristcs, we will have no need to investigate each nonlinear circuit. In order to have a Groebner base we first formulate the circuit equations as the sets of the nonlinear ordinary differential equation of several circuits with specific number of reactive elements such as capacitors and/or inductors. Applying a harmonic balance method to the circuit equations, we derive a simultaneous polynomial equations, which represents the periodic equilibrium state of the circuits. By adding the amplitude characteristic to the simultaneous polynomial equations we have another sets of polynomial equations in which each variable is the amplitudes of sine and cosine functions. Here we try to find a Groebner base for each set of polynomial equations using the lexicographical order. As the result, the last element of the Groebner base which makes the classification possible gives the amplitude characteristic of each circuit. As an example, a Groebner base is shown to classify the nonlinear circuits which are composed by one voltage source (sinusoidal function), one resistor, one capacitor and one nonlinear inductor of which characteristics is given by the polynomial function of the fluxinterlinkages. From these four circuits elements we can compose eight nonlinear circuits. Usually the different circuits are considered to have different amplitude characteristics. However, we have three types of the amplitude characteristics from the different circuits. By use of a Groebner base these eight circuits are classified into three categories from the point of view of the amplitude characteristics of fundamental harmonic oscillations.	angularjs;current source;gröbner basis;harmonic balance;integrated circuit;lexicographical order;lexicography;linear circuit;polynomial;voltage source	Kohshi Okumura	1997	ACM SIGSAM Bulletin	10.1145/271130.274462	mathematics	EDA	67.71635675450256	46.435081405669415	73087

However, intermittency of renewable energy has resulted in several problems faced by the power systems such as system frequency fluctuation. In order to suppress the system frequency fluctuation, a battery inside an electric vehicle (EV) is expected to be used as a control device for Load Frequency Control (LFC). This paper proposes a new EV multi-step smart charging scheme with two charging sequences: first come first serve schedule and sequence with the ratio of ASOC to remaining grid connecting time. The total controllable capacity of the EVs is estimated based on the lumped EV model. The result shows the effectiveness of the proposed control by multi-step charging on EV which can suppress the frequency fluctuation. In addition, the customer's convenience is taken into consideration by using the satisfaction index defined as the ratio of charged energy to the required energy.	extended validation certificate;formal methods;ibm power systems;quantum fluctuation;simulation	Phichian Chatupromwong;Akihiko Yokoyama	2012	2012 10th International Power & Energy Conference (IPEC)	10.1109/ASSCC.2012.6523314	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	63.41512747103746	36.51322034944726	73124

Typically current passing through a printed circuit board trace induces a highly nonuniform magnetic field which varies as a function of frequency and position relative to the trace. This paper proposes a technique to increase the frequency bandwidth of anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) current sensors and simultaneously to intensify and normalize the field detected by the sensor in the frequency range of interest, i.e., DC-5 MHz. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed technique yields significant enhancement in detection bandwidth of AMR current sensors.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;anisotropic diffusion;bandwidth (signal processing);clock rate;contactless payment;experiment;frequency band;printed circuit board;printing;sensor	Shahriar Jalal Nibir;Elisa Hurwitz;Morteza Karami;Babak Parkhideh	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2561264	electronic engineering;magnetic field;telecommunications;sensitivity;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;bandwidth;physics	Mobile	64.30017566936547	53.563610887525165	73300

d1df6aeb35c13d7a3cd9a9905e913e0bf23e09e9	a 2.4-ghz 1.5-mw digital multiplying delay-locked loop using pulsewidth comparator and double injection technique		In this paper, we propose a low-jitter low-power digital multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) with a self-calibrated double reference injection scheme. To reduce jitter, the noisy edge of the oscillator is replaced by both the rising and falling edges of the clean reference, which results in 6-dB reduction in phase noise compared with a conventional single-edge injection MDLL. Reference spur caused by a frequency error of the oscillator, duty-cycle error of the reference, and circuit imperfection, such as offset and mismatch, is removed by employing three background feedback loops with a shared analog pulsewidth comparator. Implemented in 28-nm CMOS, the proposed digital MDLL generates 2.4-GHz clock and achieves a spur of −51.4 dBc and an rms jitter of 699  ${\mathrm{ fs}}_{\mathrm{ rms}}$  while consuming 1.5 mW from 1-V supply.	cmos;cpu shielding;comparator;delay-locked loop;duty cycle;feedback;in-phase and quadrature components;low-power broadcasting;multiplexer;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillator	Hyunik Kim;Yongjo Kim;Taeik Kim;Hyung-Jong Ko;Seonghwan Cho	2017	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2017.2734910	comparator;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;phase noise;control theory;dbc;computer science;delay-locked loop;bandwidth (signal processing);cmos;jitter	EDA	60.70444619782882	49.78817401097839	73357

df733dafba67a3ce9213e6a167b195fc57e917e2	a discontinuous current-source gate driver with gate voltage boosting capability	logic gates;mosfet;inductors;switching loss;capacitance;voltage control;switches	In this paper, a novel discontinuous current-source driver (CSD) is proposed, in which the power MOSFET gate-source voltage is increased to more than the drive supply voltage. The proposed CSD is able to recover gate energy dissipated in a conventional driver. In comparison to the conventional gate driver, the proposed CSD achieves fast switching speed to reduce switching losses. A wide range of operating duty cycle, low circulating losses, and high Cdv/dt immunity are other features of the proposed CSD. In comparison to previous discontinuous CSDs, the special advantage of the proposed circuit is power MOSFET gate voltage boosting, which leads to reduction of Rds(on) and, thus, the conduction loss. The proposed circuit is appropriate for voltage regulators (VRs) with synchronous rectifier and also it is suitable for two-stage 48-V power pod applications and low-voltage converters. Two-stage VR for laptop computer CPUs is another application of this gate driver circuit to improve light load performance. A prototype of the circuit operating at 1 MHz is implemented, and the experimental waveforms justify the theoretical analysis.	active rectification;cambridge structural database;central processing unit;current source;driver circuit;duty cycle;gate driver;laptop;power mosfet;prototype;rectifier;thyristor;voltage regulator	Iman Abdali Mashhadi;Ramin Rahimzadeh Khorasani;Ehsan Adib;Hosein Farzanehfard	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2674626	gate turn-off thyristor;electronic engineering;ground bounce;gate driver	EDA	62.80984556947472	43.101802096471225	73434

The IPMSM in the study is capable of being operated either from a single supply or from two converters in an open winding configuration. In this study, the phase windings are open connected to two separate voltage source converters: a dc-supplied main bridge, capable or supply real and reactive power, and a floating bridge (FB), connected to a capacitor and only capable of supplying reactive power to the motor. Vector diagram analysis and two-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) are presented to illustrate the extension of the capabilities of the IPMSM compared to the usual Y connection. The open winding IPMSM is built and performance experimentally investigated over a wide range of speeds. The results demonstrate 10–15% higher power capability using an open winding and FB, compared to the single inverter drive by experiments.	diagram;experiment;finite element method;power inverter;voltage source;y-δ transform	Mohammad Sedigh Toulabi;John Salmon;Andrew M.

e15c1d4f34cfc7568199bc43a55a45534798aaa7	exploration of second-order effects in high-performance continuous-time $\sigma\delta$  modulators using discrete-time models	optimisation;delta sigma modulation;numerical analysis;analogue digital conversion	This paper proposes a method for the discretization of continuous-time sigma-delta modulators (CT-ΣΔMs) with various circuit nonidealities. Recurrence equations for the sampled states of a CT-ΣΔM are derived to find the equivalent discrete-time (DT) transfer functions of CT loop filters along with several second-order effects, such as finite DC gain, finite unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) of an amplifier, and excess loop delay (ELD), etc. This allows a synthesis flow that considers these nonidealities at the system level. The proposed approach generalizes existing works relating to the DT modeling of a CT-ΣΔM, and is applicable to arbitrary-order loop filters with unconstrained digital-to-analog converter (DAC) output waveforms. According to the DT model, a third-order low-pass modulator design based on a numerical optimization shows that the second-order effects of a CT-ΣΔM can be noticeably mitigated by the appropriate coefficient scaling.	amplifier;ct scan;coefficient;delta-sigma modulation;digital-to-analog converter;discretization;filter design;for loop;image scaling;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;offset binary;recurrence relation;requirement;simulation;system requirements	Wei-Lin Chen;Chih-Cheng Hsieh	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2012.2206436	control engineering;electronic engineering;numerical analysis;computer science;engineering;delta-sigma modulation;control theory;mathematics	EDA	65.51318154194523	50.53943030292017	73610

Several cconductors were used to connect two frames, which might provide another return path of signal current loop, and reduce the DM (Differential Mode) radiation from the cable. To prove the effectiveness of the conductor connection, we investigated two cases: (1) without any conductor below cable, (2) installing three different conductors of small, medium, and large sized-conductors. The results were obtained from both measurement and full-wave simulation, and we observed that EMI decreased about 1 to 10 dB μV in the frequency range from 30MHz to 1GHZ.	bounce address;cable modem;current loop;emi;frequency band;interference (communication);simulation	Eun-Kwang Koh;Min-Kyu Shim;Eun-Ju Hong;Jai-Yeol Lee;Seung-Hun Park;In-Gu Kwak;Wansoo Nah	2008		10.1145/1352793.1352870	emi;electromagnetic interference;telecommunications;computer science;conducted electromagnetic interference;slit;conductor	EDA	66.41914746430518	56.87836538847985	73637
71cce23fd37c258609e9e8d36833f30c7c86773d	an algorithm for reduction of extracted power from photovoltaic strings in grid-tied photovoltaic power plants during voltage sags	fault ride through capability;active power reduction;conference paper;active reactive power injection;dc dc converter;photovoltaic systems	Due to the high penetration of the installed distributed generation units in the power system, the injection of reactive power is required for the medium-scale and large-scale grid-connected photovoltaic power plants (PVPPs). Because of the current limitation of the grid-connected inverter, the injected active power should be reduced during voltage sags. In order to obtain a constant dc-link voltage in a multi-string PVPP, the extracted power from PV strings should be equal to the injected power to the grid in all operating conditions (excluding power losses). Therefore, the extracted power of PV strings should be reduced during voltage sags. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for determining the reference voltage of the PV string which results in a reduction of the output power to a certain amount. The proposed algorithm calculates the reference voltage for the dc/dc converter controller, based on the characteristics of the power-voltage curve of the PV string and therefore, no modification is required in the the controller of the dc/dc converter. Simulation results on a 50-kW PV string verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing the power from PV strings under different irradiation and reference power values.	algorithm;maximum power transfer theorem;null-terminated string;page view;power inverter;simulation	Hossein Dehghani Tafti;Ali Iftekhar Maswood;Josep Pou;Georgios Konstantinou;Vassilios G.

21c216b5984a45b98c1b78cf9c8b7ebbd4849b97	what form of control function can drive a discontinuous-mode boost converter to chaos via period-doubling?	control of chaos;boost converter;feedback control	Period-doubling routes to chaos in dc/dc converters operating in discontinuous mode have been reported in Reference 1 for the boost-type converter, and in Reference 2 for the buck-type converter. The chaotic behaviour associated with such systems is due to the presence of the feedback controller since these systems are open-loop stable.3 Thus, the choice of the feedback control function is very important to the identi cation and control of chaos in such systems. Up to now, no rigorous attempts have been made to derive formally the condition leading to chaos in such systems. In this letter we establish condition on the form of control function that may give rise to period-doubling cascades in the boost regulator operating in discontinuous mode. In Reference 1 a closed-form iterative map that describes the dynamics of the boost regulator operating in discontinuous mode has been derived. Using this map, period-doubling cascades have been predicted when the regulator is controlled under a simple proportional feedback, the bifurcation parameter being the feedback gain. Experimental measurement bears witness to the predicted chaos.1 Although the work op. cit. gives no theoretical insights into the underlying cause of chaos in such systems, it does prompt the important practical question of what form of feedback control may give rise to chaotic behaviour. This letter attempts to answer this question in the light of the Schwarzian derivative. The system under study is periodically driven with period T , and is in general described by a rst-order iterative map of the form:	bifurcation theory;boost converter;buck converter;circa;control of chaos;control theory;feedback;iterative method;john d. wiley;period-doubling bifurcation;small-signal model;switched-mode power supply;virtual 8086 mode;voltage regulator	William C.

The results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis. Some errors exist in the measurement results because of the unsatisfactory experimental environment. Single conducting cylindrical block measurement error was less than 0.5 dB, and single man block measurement error in the school laboratory was less than 1 dB, while in the factory laboratory environment, the peak to peak error reached 1.6 dB. Human body block attenuation was about 5.9–9.2 dB lower than that of the single conducting cylinder. A human body and a conducting cylinder were used together as a block in model (c) and model (d), but the positions of the cylinder in the two models were different. The measurement results showed that the attenuation of model (d) is about 3 dB higher than that of model (c).	cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;decibel;emoticon;experiment;experimental system;simulation;uniform theory of diffraction	Xingrong Li;Yongqian Li;Baogang Li	2017	Information	10.3390/info8020050	telecommunications	Metrics	67.51262805192569	58.51043217594759	73880

A current generation circuit injects the RF test current at the gate of the LNA; this approach has the advantage that the matching network is not affected by the test circuitry. The technique can be used without design changes to measure the voltage gain during on-wafer test and to measure S21 during final test in the presence of gate inductance and package parasitics. Furthermore, the current injection testing technique enables accurate gain measurements in order to detect faulty impedance matching networks. The proposed current-based BIT requires an on-chip voltage source, two on-chip power detectors (PDs), and an accurate external resistor. On-chip or external equipment resources are only required to measure the dc output of the PDs. As a proof of concept, a 2.1-GHz inductor-degenerated common-source LNA with a gain of 23.9 dB was designed in 0.13-mum CMOS technology together with the BIT circuitry (14% area overhead). The gain predicted by the current injection RF BIT agrees with the simulated gain using corner models within 0.8-dB error.	built-in self-test;cmos;characteristic impedance;chip carrier;current injection technique;electronic circuit;fault coverage;impedance matching;low-noise amplifier;output impedance;overhead (computing);radio frequency;sensor;simulation;voltage source;wafer testing	Xiaohua Fan;Marvin Onabajo;Félix O.

Nowadays, the interest is even growing towards implementing the RF PA in CMOS technology. Cost reduction, diversifying means of fabrication and the addition of performance enhancement circuitry are the main reasons behind this growing interest. However, implementing RF PAs for 3G/4G standards in CMOS is quite challenging: The low breakdown voltage of nanoscale CMOS causes a ruggedness problem at typical average output power (Pavg) levels of 26dBm or more. In the paper, power-combining techniques were used to reach PA output power (Pout) of 33dBm. However, amplification of signals with high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) requires also a high degree of linearity. Significant AM-PM distortions caused by the voltage-dependent parasitics are a fundamental problem in CMOS PAs. Thus far, predistortion is used to meet EVM requirements. To overcome these challenges, this work presents a new class of operation, termed as Class-O, demonstrated by the design and the measurement of a single-stage PA implemented in 0.13μm CMOS and operating from a 3.3V supply.	amplifier;cmos;compaq lte;digital signal processing;distortion;electronic circuit;power architecture platform reference;radio frequency;requirement;semiconductor device fabrication;semiconductor industry;transceiver	Ahmed Farouk Aref;Renato Negra;Muhammad Abdullah Khan	2015	2015 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC) Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062915	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;fo4;cmos	EDA	59.53322874588578	55.19640439889933	73905

Integrating capacitive sensors into a small wireless sensor system is challenging due to their large power consumption relative to the total system power/energy budget, which can be as low as a few nW [4]. Typical capacitance-to-digital converters (CDCs) use charge sharing or charge transfer between capacitors to convert the sampled capacitance to voltage, which is then measured with an ADC [1-6]. This approach requires complex analog circuits, such as amplifiers and ADCs, increasing design complexity and often increasing power consumption. Moreover, the initial capacitance to voltage conversion essentially limits the input capacitance range because of output voltage saturation. This paper presents a fully digital CDC that is based on the observation that when a ring oscillator (RO) is powered from a charged capacitance, the number of RO cycles required to discharge the capacitance to a fixed voltage is naturally linear with the capacitance value. This observation enables a simple, fully digital conversion scheme that is inherently linear.

The filter is based on Active-Gm-RC biquadratic cell. With respect to Active-Gm-RC, this filter exploits an additional input RC-net, increasing the low-pass filtering order up to 3, while maintaining single-Opamp topology. In particular, Opamp frequency response has been optimized, exploiting a proper algorithm, that allows to minimize power and maximize loop gain phase margin. A prototype of the filter has been designed in CMOS 0.13μm technology, complying with ultra-wide-band receivers specifications. The filter consumes 1.2mW, while processing a 0.7Vzero-peak differential signal, and maintaining noise power spectral density under 237μVrms. The overall Signal-to-Noise-Ratio is 65dB.	algorithm;analogue filter;cmos;frequency response;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;noise power;operational amplifier;phase margin;prototype;quartic function;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density;the filter;ultra-wideband	Marcello De Matteis;Stefano D'Amico;Andrea Costantini;Alessandro Pezzotta;Andrea Baschirotto	2012	2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS 2012)	10.1109/ICECS.2012.6463751	butterworth filter;rc circuit;adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;engineering;control theory;electronic filter;constant k filter;band-stop filter;electronic filter topology;filter design;prototype filter;high-pass filter;active filter;m-derived filter	EDA	62.53986715272392	50.758237298881234	74071

43e5186f4ce9af45ad11f192c5081c9f35cf0e77	bidirectional dc-dc converter topologies for low-voltage battery interface: comparative assessment		The growing interest towards efficient and reliable bidirectional DC-DC converter topologies for interfacing low-voltage (LV) batteries, eg. 48 V, with a high-voltage (HV) DC-link, eg. 400 V, has driven the research toward the investigation of many different topologies. In this paper, three isolated and bidirectional topologies have been selected and compared to each other, where these topologies are seen as the state-of-the-art topologies for battery-fed systems. The introduced comparison includes the number of used semiconductor devices and passive elements, the rated voltage and current of the different semiconductor devices, the forecasted switching and conduction losses using PLECS, and the estimated volume and power losses of the employed magnetic elements. Furthermore, the comparison includes simulation results using PLECS considering a 1.5 kW power level.

0254843066ede572184f6841cbd7356cce21471f	a new dual-channel measurement method for accurate characterization of low-permittivity and low-loss materials		A dual-channel attenuation measurement system has been developed to measure the dielectric properties of low-permittivity and low-loss homogenous materials. The scattering parameters are derived from a series of transmission measurements, which were performed under different reflection coefficients of the source and load ports set by a pair of automatic tuners. The reflection coefficients of the automatic tuners were calibrated with the vector network analyzer (VNA) before the measurements. The mismatch error is effectively eliminated with the measurement and calculation process. The measurement scattering parameters are of much smaller uncertainties than those with the VNA. A polyimide aerogel sample is measured at X-band frequencies, its permittivity is about 1.075, and the loss tangent is about 0.001. The corresponding standard uncertainties are 0.0014 and 0.00048, respectively. The uncertainty of the loss tangent is reduced by one order compared to the results based on VNA. For validation of the proposed method, measurements of two polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) samples with different thicknesses were also conducted. This paper provides a broadband method for dielectric characterization with improved accuracy for low-permittivity and low-loss materials and can easily be extended to other waveguide bands.	coefficient;multi-channel memory architecture;packet analyzer;scattering parameters;system of measurement;technical standard	Xu Hao;Liang Weijun;Gao Qiulai	2018	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2018.2795847	network analyzer (electrical);waveguide;permittivity;attenuation;electronic engineering;dielectric;mathematics;dissipation factor;scattering parameters;communication channel	Visualization	67.24551777367661	56.15555640489054	74392

The processing performed by a signal chain of this system is very complicated. Thus, it is not easy to obtain the output values only by analytical mean. The aim of this paper is to obtain a simple model of a flickermeter for a case of frequency modulation (FM) of the input signal. There is still a lack of a International Electrotechnical Commission flickermeter standard specification for that case. In this paper, a proposal was made to determine such a model at FM with slowly varying signals and signals in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 155 Hz. The quality of characteristic approximation evaluated was based on numerical simulations with sinusoidal as well as rectangular waveforms as input signals. The presented model makes it possible to clearly understand the flickermeter signal chain operation and helps to verify the functioning of a real measuring device in the considered frequency range.	approximation;fm broadcasting;flicker (screen);frequency band;modulation;numerical analysis;signal chain;simulation	Grzegorz Wiczynski	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2006724	computer simulation;frequency modulation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Visualization	69.43550818106783	48.27813196591777	74434

To this end, in addition to a quick introduction into ESR and its potential applications in food quality control, we discuss the shortcomings of a conventional ESR spectrometer concerning its miniaturization and cost reduction capabilities and highlight how IC technology based approaches can be used to overcome these limitations. As an extension to the state-of-the-art in IC-based ESR, we present an analytical model and experimental results for VCO-based rapid scan ESR experiments, which can be used to improve the achievable sensitivity in inductively detected ESR.	electron;experiment;integrated circuit;resonance;sensor;theory;voltage-controlled oscillator	Anh Chu;Benedikt Schlecker;Jonas Handwerker;S.

A current clamp based measuring system with high-resolution digitizer was developed. In order to adapt the system for different capacitors, the current clamp sensor is designed for a.c. currents in the rant of 150 μA to 12 A, while the acieved accuracy of the sensor is better than 0.1%. An implemented high quality analogue a.c. integrator processes the measuring signal to get a proportional scaled high voltage waveform at the sensors output. This feature is helpful for calculating the narmonics distortion in the HV grid. If a high-quality and well-known HV capacitor is available, accurate measurements within 0.5% for rms valuse and phase angles are possible in the HV grid under on-site conditions. Such accuracies are ususally more than adequate for monitoring purposes.	clamping (graphics);display resolution;distortion;image resolution;sensor;waveform	Enrico Mohns;Soeren Fricke;C.

At very low and zero speeds of operation, the identification of the rotor position is carried out by applying test voltage signals within the regular commutation process for predictive torque control, in order to detect the machine saliency produced by the stator magnetic saturation. Then, the acquired signals that are function of the rotor position are digitally processed through a quadrature phase-locked loop tracking observer. At middle-and-high speeds of operation the angular position of the rotor is estimated by using a predictive sliding-mode observer of the stator flux. A changeover algorithm is programmed for coupling both estimated values of the angular position of the rotor. Experimental results in a wide-speed-range obtained by using a hybrid digital system which consist of a digital signal processor (DSP) and of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) verify the effectiveness of the proposed encoderless predictive control scheme.	algorithm;angularjs;arnold tongue;coupling (computer programming);digital electronics;digital signal processor;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;flux qubit;hd radio;in-phase and quadrature components;phase-locked loop;r.o.t.o.r.;signal processing;transducer	Roberto Morales-Caporal;Edmundo Bonilla Huerta;Concepción Hernández Flores;Marco A.

b4e2bc95e7490b1a92a9c4ab6950b648ac8e2db4	geofilter: geometric selection of mesh filter parameters	second order;error processing;triangle mesh	When designing a lowpass filter to eliminate noise in a triangle mesh, the cutoff frequency is typically chosen by a cumbersome trial-and-error process. Therefore, it is important to provide a guideline in selecting filter frequencies. Here, we explore the relation between the frequencies in a mesh filter and the geometric measures of user-selected features. In addition, by combining previously proposed implicit and explicit formulations, we develop a second order filter that can act as lowpass, bandpass, highpass, notch, and band exaggeration/reduction filters. The proposed GeoFilter framework allows the user to choose the frequencies for that filter based on the physical size of a blob (ellipsoid) automatically fit to a user-selected feature in the mesh. For example, the size of a bump in a noisy pattern can be used as a cutoff frequency in a lowpass filter, while the size of a nose may be used to smoothen a face or to exaggerate its features as in a caricature.	discrete laplace operator;ellipsoid method;implicit curve;laplacian matrix;low-pass filter;thermal copper pillar bump;triangle mesh	ByungMoon Kim;Jarek Rossignac	2005	Comput.

The transformers used in this paper are connected to the output of the respective HBCs, and the secondary sides of all the transformers are connected in series for generating the final output voltage. Only one of the transformers, in particular, has a different turn ratio for increasing the output voltage level.

The proposed modulator consists of a parallel combination of linear class AB and switching class D power amplifiers that are controlled digitally. In the previous analog architectures, the requirements needed for the AB operational amplifier such as high-current driving capability, high bandwidth and large output swing is usually obtainable at high overall static power dissipation. The digitally controlled power opamp presented here not only provides the aforementioned requirements but also reduces power dissipation compared with previous work. Furthermore, the digital control of the modulator makes it adaptive to the input signal variations in comparison with conventional analog parallel hybrid envelope modulators. The digital processor of the modulator is evaluated with a 45-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The overall power consumption of the digital processor is around 142mW at 1.5-GHz clock frequency. As an application, the designed digital class AB is incorporated in a complete envelope modulator architecture. The overall efficiency of the modulator, including the digital processor power consumption, is around 82% at an average 32dBm output power for a 5-MHz input signal.

a5ada52e2d644f9c6481a51d53ec47a9f888bd1c	analysis and design of a quasi-resonant fast on-load tap changing regulator	on load tap changing regulators;analysis and design;resonant;model;parasitic	The main function of the on-load tap changing (OLTC) regulators consists of maintaining a constant voltage in order to feed critical loads despite the load changes or voltage changes in the ac mains. The traditional regulators are still used nowadays, but present several disadvantages, like a slow response, which reaches from 100 ms to several seconds. These drawbacks can be overcome if the OLTC regulators would have shorter response time, commuting several times every cycle of the mains. There are two basic topologies for fast OLTC regulators, the first one consists of several taps and uses hard switching. The second one consists of two main switches commuting at high frequency, using softswitching in order to reduce the power losses. The present topology is of the second type. This paper presents a mathematical model of the power stage of the proposed regulator. The model includes the parasitic resistances and the leakage inductances in order to obtain a better comprehension of the regulator operation. A parametric analysis has been done in order to observe the influence of the parasitic elements in the performance of the main parameters of the topology. The model is verified by experimental results obtained using a 500 W prototype.	constant-voltage speaker system;entry point;mathematical model;network switch;parasitic element (electrical networks);prototype;response time (technology);spectral leakage	Rodolfo Echavarría;V.

The paper briefly discusses the magnetic design optimization procedure and then optimizes another recently proposed secondary pad design (generally used in lumped IPT systems), called the double-D quadrature pad (DDQP), for distributed AGV applications and compares its performance with the BPP. A four conductor single phase track topology is used here as primary. Both the pads discussed in this paper have already been shown to perform well in lumped IPT systems and hence the work presented in this paper highlights and validates the possibility of using these pads in mixed distributed/lumped IPT systems. A 3-D finite element modeling tool is used to evaluate and compare all the models presented in this paper. To validate these results, a prototype system is built with a BPP secondary driving a load through a controller circuit. A modification in the traditional control topology is proposed and shown to improve the overall system efficiency; before finally highlighting some of the practical design issues needed to be considered when building such a system.	bpp (complexity);d-pad;finite element method;information processes and technology;mathematical optimization;prototype	Adeel Zaheer;Grant Covic;Dariusz Kacprzak	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2281167	control engineering;magnetic flux;electronic engineering;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;ferrite;magnetic resonance imaging;finite element method;electrical conductor;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	67.503024166259	42.215574855810544	74846

A new evolutionary algorithm, called New Hybrid Shuffled Frog Leaping (NHSFL) Algorithm, is proposed to deal with the equality and inequality constraints in the problem and to deduce the device sizes optimizing the performance of the circuits. For this, a new frog leaping rule is proposed to improve the local exploration and performance of the standard SFLA. Also, to improve the convergence velocity of the algorithm, the mutation operator is used for generating new frog, instead of random mechanism. By linking MATLAB and HSPICE the system evaluates the circuit performance during electrical simulation, in the optimization loop in the MATLAB environment, to be selected as an appropriate circuit topology. To assess the system, complex and hard-to-design analog blocks with restricted design requirements are presented in 0.18@mm CMOS process technology. The simulation results obtained from the proposed system verify that the design requirements are closely satisfied, even in tough conditions. Furthermore, some comparisons are made with available methods like Genetic algorithm (GA) and Imperialist Competitive algorithm (ICA) showing that the presented algorithm offers excellent qualifications in terms of time, efficiency and robustness.	algorithm;cmos;integrated circuit	Ali Jafari;Ehsan Bijami;Hasan Rekabi Bana;Saeed Sadri	2012	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2012.05.010	electronic engineering;engineering;artificial intelligence;computer aided design;engineering drawing	EDA	72.49896445186727	40.119122666557864	74932
45e448bd83241f0aaba067f3d61efc1958b9842e	a novel and fast mppt method suitable for both fast changing and partially shaded conditions		In this study, a novel and fast maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm for a photovoltaic generation system is proposed. The main idea is to remove the random number in the voltage calculation equation of the conventional cuckoo search method. The advantages of the proposed method include 1) fast maximum power point (MPP) tracking speed and high MPP tracking accuracy under both uniform insolation and partially shaded conditions (PSCs), 2) simple MPPT structure, and 3) consistent solution can be achieved with only three particles and only one parameter is required to be tuned. In order to validate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method, both simulation and experiments are carried out on a 300 W prototyping circuit. According to the experimental results, the proposed MPPT method can improve the tracking time by 46.42% and 11.76% comparing to conventional perturb and observe (P&O) and variable-step P&O technique, respectively. In addition, the proposed method can successfully track the global MPP in 249 of 252 different PSC patterns. The tracking accuracies under both uniform irradiance and PSC conditions are all higher than 99.8%.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);cuckoo search;experiment;goodyear mpp;maximum power transfer theorem;multi-function printer;random number generation;shading;simulation	Bo-Ruei Peng;Kun-Che Ho;Yi-Hua Liu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2736484	insolation;control theory;control engineering;irradiance;engineering;correctness;voltage;maximum power principle;maximum power point tracking;photovoltaic system	Vision	69.87872053826705	40.70607892438204	75091
7b474cb57f0542d2fc102281ae6df0be356bc451	review of power decoupling methods for microinverters without using electrolytic capacitors		In single-phase photovoltaic (PV) systems, power mismatching between input and output terminal leads to power pulsation, seriously affecting maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Paralleling an electrolytic capacitor (e-cap) across PV panel to smooth power pulsation seems to be an unreliable method owing to its short lifetime. Various power decoupling methods used in micro-inverters have been proposed to solve the problem. These methods were categorized. Some of them were introduced in this paper regarding efficiency, cost and technical features. Besides, some special novel methods proposed in recent years were presented to show the development trend of microinverter. Then, conclusion and caparison were made. Finally, a potential technological route was proposed by author for further study on power decoupling.	capacitor device component;categorization;complexity;coupling (computer programming);electric capacitance;input/output;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;maximum power transfer theorem;numerous;penicillin v;power inverter;prototype;review [publication type];ripple effect;solar micro-inverter;voltage	Yonggao Zhang;Jian Xiong;Zengqiang Wang;Shuai Wang;Lingtao Kong	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216254	control engineering;decoupling (cosmology);electrolytic capacitor;solar micro-inverter;capacitor;engineering;input/output;maximum power point tracking;capacitance;photovoltaic system	EDA	61.6079054477882	41.09664834501245	75135

The converter topology is the cascaded connection of a three-level ANPC converter and an H-bridge per phase. The voltage of the H-bridge is actively maintained to the required level through selection of the switching states of the converter. The topology is operated under selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation (SHE-PWM), maintaining the switching frequency of the converter to a minimum. The operating principles, voltage balancing methods, and limitations of the converter are analyzed together with extensive simulation results of the topology. Experimental results from a low-power laboratory prototype are presented that verify the operation of the hybrid converter under SHE-PWM.	clock rate;h bridge;hysteresis;low-power broadcasting;multiple encryption;network switch;prototype;pulse-width modulation;ripple effect;sandy bridge;semiconductor;simulation;voltage regulation	Sridhar R.

The ADC has an integrated input buffer with a new linearization technique that improves its distortion by 5-10 dB and lowers its power consumption by 70% relative to the state of the art. It demonstrates a new background calibration technique to correct the residue amplifier (RA) gain errors and lower its power consumption. This summing node sampling (SNS) calibration technique is based on sampling the summing-node voltage of the residue amplifier and using it with the corresponding residue to estimate the amplifier open loop gain. The ADC achieves an SNDR of 76.5 dB and consumes 850 mW from a 1.8 V supply, while the input buffer consumes 150 mW from a 3 V supply. Up to 125 MS/s, the SFDR is greater than 100 dB for input frequencies up to 100 MHz and 90 dB up to 300 MHz input frequency. At 250 MS/s, the SFDR is greater than 95 dB up to 100MHz and 85 dB up to 300 MHz.	16-bit;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;bass amplifier;bicmos;data buffer;decibel;distortion;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);spurious-free dynamic range;traffic collision avoidance system	Ahmed M.

It includes a signal conditioning circuit that can support up to 15 force sensors, a 433MHz RF front-end for data transmission, an 8-bit low-power microprocessor, and a FIFO with a digital filter. Idle and wake-up modes are well designed to reduce the power consumption since the device should be used for the whole surgical procedure. Test results show that the signal conditioning circuit with 16-bit single line output can operate under a wide voltage range, which is from 1.2V to 3.6V. The minimal power consumption is 139μ.W@1.2V with a 200KHz clock. Experimental results demonstrated in static and body tests are given in the paper also. The chip will be used in an aided monitoring system for Total Knee Arthroplasty in the future work.	16-bit;8-bit;arthroplasty, replacement, partial knee;conditioning (psychology);digital filter;knee replacement arthroplasty (procedure);low-power broadcasting;microprocessor;operative surgical procedures;radio frequency;system on a chip;total disc replacement;sensor (device);voltage	Ming Liu;Hong Chen;Xin Zhang;Chun Zhang;Hanjun Jiang;Zhihua Wang	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091449	system on a chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;digital filter;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;system of measurement	EDA	56.33423600804532	50.73216760023287	75670
