We present here an approach for reducing dead-time by generating a deconvolution digital filter based on optimizing the Fisher linear discriminant. In brief, two classes are defined, one in which a photon event is initiated at the origin of the digital filter, and one in the photon event is non-coincident with the filter origin. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then performed to optimize the digital filter that best resolves the coincident and non-coincident training set data.1 Once trained, implementation of the filter can be performed quickly, significantly reducing dead-time issues and measurement bias in photon counting applications. Experimental demonstration of the LDA-filter approach was performed in fluorescence microscopy measurements using a highly convolved impulse response with considerable ringing. Analysis of the counts supports the capabilities of the filter in recovering deconvolved impulse responses under the conditions considered in the study. Potential additional applications and possible limitations are also considered. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

bbf0d8087b8f629fc28c02e333931f8429f53aa6	interference cancellation in two-channel nuclear quadrupole resonance measurements		Given its high specificity, the use of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy allows for a reliable identification and quantification of substances containing quadrupolar nuclei, such as the 14N nucleus prevalent in many explosives, medicines, and narcotics. Regrettably, the measured signals are typically weak and suffers from interference signals often being several orders of magnitude stronger than the signal of interest. In this work, we propose a two-channel setup allowing for interference cancellation in applications such as demining. The proposed techniques forms an estimate of the interference using the secondary channel, and then removes it from the primary channel. The improved performance of the resulting detector is illustrated using real measurements of NaNO2.	interference (communication);primary channel;resonance;sensitivity and specificity	Tommaso Piatti;Shiwen Lei;Jamie Barras;Andreas Jakobsson	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7952777	nuclear magnetic resonance;mathematical optimization;radio frequency;single antenna interference cancellation;nuclear quadrupole resonance;spectroscopy;primary channel;computer science;detector;interference (wave propagation);communication channel	Robotics	58.33390288794992	-82.98073764748227	91298
90d6c7eb6697d5c5f9191867a3d5deff0f318d34	plant root system analysis from mri images	juser;websearch;publications database	We present a novel method for deriving a structural model of a plant root system from 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data of soil grown plants and use it for plant root system analysis. The structural model allows calculation of physiologically relevant parameters. Roughly speaking, MRI images show local water content of the investigated sample. The small, local amounts of water in roots require a relatively high resolution, which results in low SNR images. However, the spatial resolution of the MRI images remains coarse relative to the diameter of typical fine roots, causing many gaps in the visible root system. To reconstruct the root structure, we propose a three step approach: 1) detect tubular structures, 2) connect all pixels to the base of the root using Dijkstras algorithm, and 3) prune the tree using two signal strength related thresholds. Dijkstras algorithm determines the shortest path of each voxel to the base of the plant root, weighing the Euclidean distance measure by a multi-scale vesselness measure. As a result, paths running within good root candidates are preferred over paths in bare soil. We test this method using both virtually generated MRI images of Maize and real MRI images of Barley roots. In experiments on synthetic data, we show limitations of our algorithm with regard to resolution and noise levels. In addition we show how to use our reconstruction for root phenotyping on real MRI data of barley roots and snow pea in soil. Extending our conference publication (schulz123d), we show how to use the structural model to remove unwanted structures, like underground weeds.	branching factor;dijkstra's algorithm;euclidean distance;experiment;image resolution;pixel;resonance;shortest path problem;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data;system analysis;voxel	Hannes Schulz;Johannes Auke Postma;Dagmar van Dusschoten;Hanno Scharr;Sven Behnke	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-38241-3_28	computer science;data science;data mining;information retrieval	Vision	55.20310332710414	-83.35357771181494	120566

Thermoacoustic waves from biological tissue samples excited by microwave pulses are measured by a wide-band unfocused ultrasonic transducer, which is set on a spherical surface enclosing the sample. Sufficient data are acquired from different directions to reconstruct the microwave absorption distribution. An exact reconstruction solution is derived and approximated to a modified backprojection algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the reconstructed images agree well with the original samples. The spatial resolution of the system reaches 0.5 mm.	approximation algorithm;filtered backprojection;microwave;tomography;transducer;ultrasonics (sound)	Minghua Xu;Lihong V.

The new algorithm leads to reduction of tissue component and increase the specificity while optimizing the sensitivity to the UCA. The algorithm is demonstrated experimentally using images from in vivo kidney after bolus injection with UCA. Illustrative images of the kidney of a juvenile pig were obtained before and after infusion of contrast agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Geneva, Switzerland) at various concentrations. The imaging results given in this paper indicate that a signal processing approach to this clinical challenge is feasible.	beamforming;bolus tracking;convolution;experiment;medical ultrasound;nonlinear system;sensitivity and specificity;signal processing;switzerland;unicode collation algorithm;video-in video-out	Mamoun F.

However, medical video transmission requires significant bandwidth and high compression ratios, only accessible with lossy compression. Therefore research effort has been focussed on video compression algorithms such as MPEG-2. In this paper, we are interested in determining compression thresholds and associated bit-rates which are acceptable with respect to the quality required in the field of medical video transmission. To evaluate MPEG-2 compressed medical video quality, we performed a subjective assessment test with a panel of human observers (experienced surgeons) using a DSCQS (Double-Stimuli Continuous Quality Scale) protocol derived from the International Telecommunication Union recommendations (ITU-R BT-500-11). Promising results estimate that 3 Mbits/s could be sufficient (compression ratio around threshold compression level around 90∶1 compared to the original 270 Mbits/s) as far as perceived quality is concerned.	algorithm;data compression;digital revolution;level of measurement;lossy compression;mpeg-2;megabit;numerical analysis;robot	Nedia Nouri;Denis Abraham;Jean-Marie Moureaux;Michel Dufaut;Jacques Hubert;Manuela Perez	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490064	data compression;medical imaging;subjective video quality;computer vision;simulation;medicine;computer science;video quality;mathematics;multimedia;statistics	EDA	57.75209590113731	-80.4585478969549	142598

Remote surgery and surgery training can benefit in particular from 3D video due to the added dimension of depth. This paper envisages a wireless health system which transmits 3D surgical video over next generation wireless networks. Asymmetric coding of 3D video to provide effective medical services over band limited wireless networks is investigated in this paper. The quality of the compressed 3D medical video with the proposed method is measured both objectively and subjectively for a range of compression levels.	bandlimiting;computer simulation;data compression symmetry;next-generation network;remote surgery;symmetric multiprocessing	Chaminda T.

59e51eb309df256155b03d1158b17af41c38148d	dictionary learning in fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy		Modern high-resolution microscopes, such as the scanning tunneling microscope, are commonly used to study specimens that have dense and aperiodic spatial structure. Extracting meaningful information from images obtained from such microscopes remains a formidable challenge. Fourier analysis is commonly used to analyze the underlying structure of fundamental motifs present in an image. However, the Fourier transform fundamentally suffers from severe phase noise when applied to aperiodic images. Here, we report the development of a new algorithm based on nonconvex optimization, applicable to any microscopy modality, that directly uncovers the fundamental motifs present in a real-space image. Apart from being quantitatively superior to traditional Fourier analysis, we show that this novel algorithm also uncovers phase sensitive information about the underlying motif structure. We demonstrate its usefulness by studying scanning tunneling microscopy images of a Co-doped iron arsenide superconductor and prove that the application of the algorithm allows for the complete recovery of quasiparticle interference in this material. Our phase sensitive quasiparticle interference imaging results indicate that the pairing symmetry in optimally doped NaFeAs is consistent with a sign-changing s+- order parameter.	3d scanner;algorithm;dictionary;doping (semiconductor);fourier analysis;image resolution;information sensitivity;interference (communication);machine learning;mathematical optimization;motif;phase noise;quasiparticle;tunneling protocol	Sky Cheung;John Y.

The measurements are in the frequency domain, and the objective is to retrieve an artifact-free spatial domain description of the specimen. In this paper, we develop a new technique for model-based retrieval of spatial domain data from the frequency domain data. We use a piecewise-constant model for the refractive index profile that is suitable for multi-layered specimens. We show that the estimation of the layered structure parameters can be mapped into a harmonic retrieval problem, which enables us to use high-resolution spectrum estimation techniques. The new technique that we propose is efficient and requires few measurements. We also analyze the effect of additive measurement noise on the algorithm performance. The experimental results show that the technique gives highly accurate parameter estimates. For example, at 25 dB signal-to-noise ratio, the mean square error in the position estimate is about 0.01 % of the actual value.	algorithm;biological specimen;image resolution;mean squared error;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density estimation;tomography;utility functions on indivisible goods	Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula;Himanshu Nazkani;Thierry Blu;Michael Unser	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366707	computer vision;image resolution;image retrieval;computer science;mathematics;tomography;frequency domain;statistics	Visualization	54.18736537707679	-80.79618671442638	162761

However, lack of sufficient bandwidth in active military theaters limit the ability to implement real-time video communication capability, and hence render such clinically beneficial programs undeliverable. Region-of-interest (ROI) video-coding presents a possible solution to this problem. By allocating more bits to the ROI as compared to the rest of the frame (also known as background (BG)), ROI encoding of surgical videos can increase the bandwidth perceived by the telementoring application. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and interactive ROI in a low-complexity, H.264-compliant and diagnostically lossless (DL) fashion to enable remote mentoring of surgical procedures in very low-bandwidth scenarios. Further, subjective evaluations by surgeons indicate that ROI-encoded videos are preferred over the uniformly-encoded videos for the purpose of surgical evaluation and telementoring.	dvd region code;data compression;interactivity;job control (unix);lossless compression;programming paradigm;real-time clock;region of interest	Sourabh Khire;Scott Robertson;Nikil Jayant;Elena A.

Whereas, a data obtain from an ultrasonic tomography in transmission mode is not able to be used for reconstruction a characteristic image of soft tissue which naturally shadowed by a bone or hard tissue. An ultrasonic tomography in reflection mode is realized to be a solution for this problem. However the implementation to identify the projection by using an integrated attenuation coefficient of tissue from the pulsed wave ray path in reflection mode is still more complicated. In this paper, we propose a simulation in 2D of a reflection-mode ultrasonic tomographic system by using the linear array transducer and also a frequency centroid shift method to calculate the projection data. The imaging setup system was enhanced by wave reflecting plate in order to increase an echo wave path. The ultrasound wave paths of our simulation system were intend to focus on the fan beam trajectory which is rather close to a real propagation of the ultrasound wave travelling through soft tissue and ART was used finally as an image reconstruction algorithm. The obtained output shows that our system is more practical and possible toward for using in a clinical trial.

However, numerous studies have questioned its ability to accurately measure the anatomic pocket depth. In this paper, an ultrasonic periodontal probing method is described, which involves using a hollow water-filled probe to focus a narrow beam of ultrasound energy into and out of the periodontal pocket, followed by automatic processing of pulse-echo signals to obtain the periodontal pocket depth. The signal processing algorithm consists of three steps: peak detection/characterization, peak classification, and peak identification. A dynamic wavelet fingerprint (DWFP) technique is first applied to detect suspected scatterers in the A-scan signal and generate a two-dimensional black and white pattern to characterize the local transient signal corresponding to each scatterer. These DWFP patterns are then classified by a two-dimensional FFT procedure and mapped to an inclination index curve. The location of the pocket bottom was identified as the third broad peak in the inclination index curve. The algorithm is tested on full-mouth probing data from two sequential visits of 14 patients. Its performance is evaluated by comparing ultrasonic probing results with that of full-mouth manual probing at the same sites, which is taken as the “gold standard.”	algorithm;fast fourier transform;fingerprint;medical ultrasound;signal processing;wavelet	Jidong Hou;S.
