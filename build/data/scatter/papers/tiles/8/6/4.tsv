aa0819eae77e8821bee29c0700aa71ef3dcd0ebc	on the piecewise-spectral homotopy analysis method and its convergence: solution of hyperchaotic lü system	piecewise spectral homotopy analysis method;hyperchaotic system;spectral collocation;banach s fixed point theorem	Abstract — In this paper, a novel modification of the spectral-homotopy analysis me thod (SHAM) technique for solving highly nonlinear initial value problems that mo del systems with chaotic and hyper-chaotic behaviour is presented. The proposed m ethod is based on implementing the SHAM on a sequence of multiple intervals thereby increasing it’ radius of convergence to yield highly accurate method which is referred to as the piec -wise spectral homotopy analysis method (PSHAM). We investigate the application of the PSH AM to the Lü system [20] which is well known to display periodic, chaotic and hyper-c haotic behaviour under carefully selected values of it’s governing parameters. Existenc e a d uniqueness of solution of SHAM that give a guarantee of convergence of SHAM, has b een discussed in details. Comparisons are made between PSHAM generated results and re ults f om literature and Runge–Kutta generated results and good agreement is observed.	authentication;chaos theory;download;library technical services;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polythematic structured subject heading system;runge–kutta methods	Sandile Sydney Motsa;Hassan Saberi Nik;Sohrab Effati;Jafar Saberi-Nadjafi	2014	J.

However, implementation of KLT has always been the main concern. Therefore, fixed transforms like discrete Fourier (DFT) and discrete cosine (DCT) with efficient algorithms have been successfully used as good approximations to KLT for popular applications spanning from source coding to digital communications. In this paper, we propose a simple method to derive explicit KLT kernel, or to perform PCA, in closed-form for first-order autoregressive, AR (1), discrete process. It is a widely used approximation to many real world signals. The merit of the proposed technique is shown. The novel method introduced in this paper is expected to make real-time and data-intensive applications of KLT, and PCA, more feasible.	algorithm;approximation;autoregressive model;data compression;data-intensive computing;discrete cosine transform;factor analysis;file spanning;first-order predicate;kernel (operating system);perturbation theory;principal component analysis;real-time transcription	Mustafa U.

However, the PBFDAF algorithm introduces an inherent delay. Delayless PBFDAF algorithms have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, the complexity of the existing delayless PBFDAF algorithms is high. Some have high average complexity, but others have high peak complexity. A computationally efficient delayless PBFDAF algorithm is proposed in this letter to reduce both the average and peak complexity. Moreover, a delay compensation method is presented to compensate the error path delay and thus speed up the convergence rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the convergence and tracking performance of the new algorithm with delay compensation is comparable with that of the PBFDAF algorithm.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;echo suppression and cancellation;rate of convergence;simulation	Feiran Yang;Ming Wu;Jun Yang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2013.2240877	adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;convergence;computer science;control theory;tracking;computational complexity theory;frequency domain	EDA	60.82500558631914	13.172654576914166	23633

An arc describing the interaction strength between two agents is said to be persistent if its weight function has an infinite l1 norm. We discuss two balance conditions on the interactions between agents which generalize the arc-balance and cut-balance conditions in the literature respectively. The proposed conditions require that such a balance should be satisfied over each time window of a fixed length instead of at each time instant. We prove that in both cases global consensus is reached if and only if the persistent graph, which consists of all the persistent arcs, contains a directed spanning tree. The convergence rates are also provided in terms of the number of node interactions that have taken place.	approximation algorithm;consensus (computer science);discrete-time signal;file spanning;interaction;multi-agent system;persistent data structure;rate of convergence;spanning tree;taxicab geometry;weight function	Weiguo Xia;Guodong Shi;Ziyang Meng;Ming Cao;Karl Henrik Johansson	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8263753	mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;weight function;arc (geometry);computer science;instant;multi-agent system;spanning tree;convergence (routing);consensus	Theory	64.7070775947425	6.80929234079378	23690

To this end, we propose a synthesis system composed of digital fractional delay filters. The overall system (i.e., nonuniform sampling and the proposed synthesis system) can be viewed as a generalization of timeinterleaved ADC systems to which the former reduces as a special case. Compared with existing reconstruction techniques, our method has major advantages from an implementation point of view. To be precise, 1) we can perform the reconstruction as well as desired (in a certain sense) by properly designing the digital fractional delay filters, and 2) if properly implemented, the fractional delay filters need not be redesigned in case the time skews are changed. The price to pay for these attractive features is that we need to use a slight oversampling. It should be stressed, however, that the oversampling factor is less than two as compared with the Nyquist rate. The paper includes error and quantization noise analysis. The former is useful in the analysis of the quantization noise and when designing practical fractional delay filters approximating the ideal filters.	analog-to-digital converter;bandlimiting;nonuniform sampling;nyquist rate;oversampling;particle filter;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing)	Håkan Johansson;Per Löwenborg	2002	IEEE Trans.

Although existing cross relation based blind channel identification algorithm can achieve promising results, one of the drawbacks is the performance degradation in a noisy environment. In this work, we show that the degradation in convergence performance of MCLMS is due to an implicit constraint imposed by the cross relation cost function. This constraint requires the estimated impulse responses to be of the same energy which is often untrue in practice. We next propose a new algorithm exploiting revised cost function to improve the robustness of MCLMS to noise. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can gain significant improvement in steady-state performance.	adaptive algorithm;additive white gaussian noise;elegant degradation;loss function;monte carlo method;signal processing;simulation;steady state;utility functions on indivisible goods	Lei Liao;Xiaoli Li;Andy W.

The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct “pseudospectral optimal control theory”, a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.	pseudospectral optimal control	I.

82323cdc1ea2dbe9e617613b671b6433955b51f1	hamilton-jacobi reachability: a brief overview and recent advances		Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is an important formal verification method for guaranteeing performance and safety properties of dynamical systems; it has been applied to many small-scale systems in the past decade. Its advantages include compatibility with general nonlinear system dynamics, formal treatment of bounded disturbances, and the availability of well-developed numerical tools. The main challenge is addressing its exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of state variables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachability theory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools, including an efficient GPU-parallelized implementation of a Level Set Toolbox for computing reachable sets. In addition, we review some of the current work in high-dimensional HJ reachability to show how the dimensionality challenge can be alleviated via various general theoretical and application-specific insights.	computational complexity theory;curse of dimensionality;dynamical system;formal verification;game theory;graphics processing unit;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;heterojunction;jacobi method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;parallel computing;reachability;system dynamics;time complexity	Somil Bansal;Mo Chen;Sylvia L.

For example, Morlet wavelet has shown good performance in tasks like audio coding and image enhancement. Unfortunately, wavelet transforms are unstable when the input signal is shifted in position. Prior works formalize this problem by defining a type of translation invariance called shiftability. Shiftability constraint is equivalent to the constraint that the response power of the transform in the sub-band is preserved with respect to translations of the input signal. In this paper, we propose constraints for filter bank design that guarantee shiftability. Also, we use the proposed constraints to design a filter bank that implements the Morlet wavelet transform. We use the Morlet wavelet based on the fact that it has good properties in joint time-frequency localization and it has shown approximate shiftability. The filter bank proposed presents good results with respect to shiftability.	approximation algorithm;computer science;control theory;filter bank;image editing;image scaling;morlet wavelet;numerical analysis;signal processing;transformation matrix;wavelet transform;window function	Gonzalo Hernández;Bernd Reusch;Marcelo Mendoza;Luis Salinas	2004	XXIV International Conference of the Chilean Computer Science Society	10.1109/QEST.2004.19	wavelet;stochastic process;speech recognition;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;mathematics;wavelet transform	Robotics	58.56850096164921	17.246177553793526	23882

For this class of problems, several methods have already been developed. Sequential convex programming (SCP) is one of the state-of-the-art methods and involves solving a sequence of convex subproblems by linearizing the concave parts. These convex problems are e.g. solved by a log barrier method which solves a sequence of log barrier problems. To reduce the computational load we propose a sequential convex log barrier (SCLB) method where the main difference with SCP is that we search for an approximated solution of the convex subproblems by only solving one log barrier problem. We prove convergence of the proposed algorithm and we give some numerical examples that illustrate the decrease in computational load and similar convergence behaviour for a practical robotics application.	approximation algorithm;computation;concave function;convex optimization;finite element method;interior point method;iteration;mathematical optimization;newton;numerical analysis;optimization problem;robotics;stationary process	Frederik Debrouwere;Goele Pipeleers;Jan Swevers	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7172086	robot;convex analysis;subderivative;mathematical optimization;conic optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convex optimization;convex combination;convergence;ellipsoid method;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear programming;computer science;convex hull;friction;mathematics;effective domain;approximation algorithm;proper convex function	Robotics	73.45776061101381	25.433861181841383	24112

We show that these Mateacutern splines admit a stable representation in a B-spline-like basis. We specify the Mateacutern B-splines (causal and symmetric) and identify their key properties; in particular, we prove that these generate a Riesz basis and that they can be written as a product of an exponential with a fractional polynomial B-spline. We also indicate how these new functions bridge the gap between the fractional polynomial splines and the cardinal exponential ones. We then show that these splines provide the optimal reconstruction space for the minimum mean-squared error estimation of Mateacutern signals from their noisy samples. We also propose a digital Wiener-filter-like algorithm for the efficient determination of the optimal B-spline coefficients	algorithm;b-spline;basis function;causal filter;coefficient;mean squared error;polynomial;spectral density;spline (mathematics);stochastic process;t-spline;time complexity;whitening transformation;wiener filter	Sathish Ramani;Michael Unser	2006	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2006.872396	signal reconstruction;minimum mean square error;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;digital filter;mathematics;wiener filter;spectral density;statistics;box spline	ML	54.079773371178845	14.742386324507244	24131

Often in engineering a multitude of matrices with common latent structure are available. Suppose we have a set of matrices for which we wish to find two orthogonal matrices and such that all products are as close as possible to rectangular diagonal form. We show that the problem can be solved efficiently by iterating either power iterations followed by an orthogonalization process or Givens rotations. The two proposed algorithms can be seen as a generalization of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) algorithms to the bilinear orthogonal forms. Indeed, if the input matrices are symmetric and , the optimization problem reduces to that of orthogonal AJD. The effectiveness of the algorithms is shown with numerical simulations and the analysis of a large database of 84 electroencephalographic recordings. The proposed algorithms open the road to new applications of the blind source separation framework, of which we give some example for electroencephalographic data.	approximation algorithm;bilinear filtering;blind signal separation;computer simulation;electroencephalography;iterated function;iteration;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;singular value decomposition;source separation	Marco Congedo;Ronald Phlypo;Dinh-Tuan Pham	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2087018	algorithm design;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;orthogonal matrix;power iteration;electroencephalography;linear algebra;mathematics;blind signal separation;matrix decomposition;singular value decomposition;symmetric matrix	ML	65.05983831213565	19.84467374877375	24228

First, we consider a simple model of Dirichlet type, derive a symmetry result, and prove an intermediate energy theorem. For this model, we show that if the optimal domain (or its complement) is a ball centered at the origin, then the original domain must be a ball. As for the intermediate energy theorem, we show that if α, β denote the optimal values of corresponding minimization and maximization problems, respectively, then every γ in (α, β) is achieved by solving a max-min problem. Second, we investigate a similar symmetry problem for the Dirichlet problems where the energy functional is nonlinear. Finally, we show the existence and uniqueness of rearrangement minimization problems associated with the Robin problems. In addition, we shall obtain a symmetry and a related asymptotic result.	expectation–maximization algorithm;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;program optimization	Yichen Liu;Behrouz Emamizadeh	2017	SIAM J.

Sufficient conditions for the LP well-posedness are studied under the assumptions of compactness of the feasible set, closedness of the set of minimal solutions and continuity of the objective function. The continuity assumption is then weakened to cone lower semicontinuity for vector-valued functions. A notion of LP minimizing sequence of sets is studied to establish another set of sufficient conditions for the LP well-posedness of the vector problem. For a quasiconvex vector optimization problem, sufficient conditions are obtained by weakening the compactness of the feasible set to a certain level-boundedness condition. This in turn leads to the equivalence of LP well-posedness and compactness of the set of efficient solutions. Some characterizations of LP well-posedness are given in terms of the upper Hausdorff convergence of the sequence of sets of approximate efficient solutions and the upper semicontinuity of an approximate efficient map by assuming the compactness of the set of efficient solutions, even when the objective function is not necessarily quasiconvex. Finally, a characterization of LP well-posedness in terms of the closedness of the approximate efficient map is provided by assuming the compactness of the feasible set.	mathematical optimization;quasiconvex function;vector optimization;well-posed problem	C.

We develop low-complexity algorithms with superior performance based on the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The proposed algorithms are referred to as PRIME: Phase Retrieval vIa the Majorization-minimization techniquE. They are preferred to existing benchmark methods since at each iteration a simple surrogate problem is solved with a closed-form solution that monotonically decreases the original objective function. In total, three algorithms are proposed using different majorization-minimization techniques. Experimental results validate that our algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of successful recovery and mean-square error under various settings.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);iteration;loss function;mean squared error;optimization problem;phase retrieval;time series	Tianyu Qiu;Prabhu Babu;Daniel Pérez Palomar	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2016.2585084	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;noise measurement;linear programming;theoretical computer science;mathematics;phase retrieval;statistics	Vision	62.161744616795595	11.116227198151169	24589
dab2c82b3fd3d65f17ad69614f238bf422c8cf03	linear modelling of multivariable systems with pseudo-random binary input signals	multivariable system	"""A STRUCTURE which, when subjected to the same input signals as a system, produces signals identical to the output signals of the system is a perfect model of the system. In practice, it is impossible to obtain a model of a physical system which performs perfectly: the actual performance of a model depends on the sophistication of its structure and the nature of the input signals. The simplest form of model structure is a linear one, which is satisfactory in many situations. For linear models, the superposition principle allows each pair of input and output signals to be considered separately, and the problem of modelling a multivariable system is therefore decomposed into a number of elemental problems, each of modelling a system with single input and output signals. In order that a multivariable model may be unequivocally synthesized from the individual models obtained in this way, it is necessary that the crosscorrelation function of each pair of input signals is identically zero. For other demonstrable reasons, it is also desirable that each input signal has a single impulse autocorrelation function. These are attributes of """"white"""" noise signals to which the correlation functions of certain deterministic signals approximate, and it is the use of these """"pseudo-random"""" signals in linear modelling which is now discussed. The properties and use of such signals have received a considerable amount of attention in the digital communications field [1]. Previously reported work related to the present investigation is confined to conventional crosscorrelation analysis of systems with single input and output signals [2, 3]."""	approximation algorithm;autocorrelation;constant function;cross-correlation;elemental;input/output;linear model;pseudorandomness;superposition principle;white noise	H.

A typical example is found in audio coding, where audio signals are segmented as different block sizes using different analysis filter banks with the aim to eliminate the pre-echo phenomenon. Such a technique usually called window-switching. However, there was not any reasonable theoretical support for such techniques. In this work, we have generally studied time-varying cosine-modulated filter banks. The general PR conditions for an LTV cosine-modulated filter bank are given. Applying the theory in analyzing a special time-varying cosine-modulated filter bank, namely time-varying modulated lapped transforms (LTV MLTs), we have provided a solid theoretical support for the well-known window-switching techniques.	filter bank;modulation	Guangyu Wang	2005	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2004.09.007	adaptive filter;raised-cosine filter;digital filter;voltage-controlled filter;lti system theory;kernel adaptive filter;telecommunications;root-raised-cosine filter;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;filter design;m-derived filter	EDA	58.217502012884566	17.484432051978175	24664

Here, we consider the spectrum based on exponential dichotomy of Sacker and Sell [J. Differential Equations, 7 (1978), pp. 320–358] and the spectrum defined in terms of upper and lower Lyapunov exponents. A main goal of ours is to understand to what extent these spectra are computable. By using an orthogonal change of variables transforming the system to upper triangular form, and the assumption of integral separation for the diagonal of the new triangular system, we justify how popular numerical methods, the so-called continuous QR and SVD approaches, can be used to approximate these spectra. We further discuss how to verify the property of integral separation, and hence how to a posteriori infer stability of the attained spectral information. Finally, we discuss the algorithms we have used to approximate the Lyapunov and Sacker–Sell spectra and present some numerical results.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;computable function;computation;dual ec drbg;fundamental matrix (computer vision);linear system;lyapunov fractal;numerical aperture;numerical method;poincaré–steklov operator;qr code;singular value decomposition;time complexity;triangular matrix;ut-vpn	Luca Dieci;Erik S.

Results for the nondegenerate case derived earlier [H. Gfrerer, SIAM J. Control Optim., 45 (2006), pp. 972–997] are extended to the degenerate case. For the mathematical programming problem, where the constraints are given by equality and finitely many inequality constraints, our approach applies to the degenerate case, when the equality constraints are not regular; our results appear to be new even in this special case. Our second-order necessary conditions are contained in the gap between the standard necessary and sufficient conditions, where the only difference is the change from a nonstrict to a strict inequality. Our results are formulated in such a way to be applicable also to vector optimization problems.	mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;optimization problem;social inequality;vector optimization	Helmut Gfrerer	2007	SIAM Journal on Optimization	10.1137/050641387	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;nonlinear programming;mathematics;constraint;vector optimization;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;second-order logic	Theory	71.10305468200788	22.17962777498401	24923

From the computer algebra point of view, the most basic of them is well known for the local analysis of plane algebraic curves f(x,y)=0 and consists in expanding y as Puiseux series in the variable x. A similar algorithm has been developped for multi-variate algebraic equations and for linear differential equations, using the same basic tools: a “regular” case, associated with a “simple” class of solutions, and a “simple” method of calculus of these solutions; a Newton polygon; changes of variable of type ramification; changes of unknown function of two types y=ct μ+ϕ or y=exp (c/t μ)ϕ. Our purpose is first to define a “regular” case for nonlinear implicit differential equations f(t,y,y′)=0. We will then apply the result to an explicit differential equation with a parameter y′=f(y,α) in order to make a link between the expansions of the solutions obtained by our local analysis and the classical theory of bifurcations.	algebraic equation;algorithm;bifurcation theory;exptime;linear algebra;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;point of view (computer hardware company);ramification problem;symbolic computation	Nisrine Achachi;Françoise Richard-Jung	2003	Numerical Algorithms	10.1023/B:NUMA.0000005356.66967.7c	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;symbolic computation;equation;calculus;linear differential equation;mathematics;algebraic curve;algebraic differential equation;differential algebraic geometry;differential equation;quantum mechanics;algebra	Theory	79.34665927827618	12.324998145491948	25036

Theorem 10 in the article requires stronger assumptions than those listed in its statement. Specifically, it must be assumed that the packet dropout effect μ should be sufficiently small. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Validity of Theorem 10 in Ma and Gupta (2012) requires stronger assumptions than those listed in its statement. Specifically it must be assumed that μ should be sufficiently small. Furthermore, the proof of the base case in Lemma 5 is not correct. The following discussion identifies these two problems and explains that they can be corrected. In the proof of Theorem 10, the ISS of the system is guaranteed by the discrete ISS Lyapunov function. To ensure the decrease of the Lyapunov function, the authors introduced Proposition 8 and Lemma 9. Assumptions 1–4 do not suffice to guarantee the decrease, because the actual state trajectory x̃ (ki) (known as f i  x, ω 0  in Proposition 8) may be outside of the feasible set Xf (N), which makes it impossible to compare the Lyapunov function at different times. In particular, according to the proof of Proposition 8, the following relations must hold: f̄ i+d (x) ∈ Ωji+d ∼ L i+d μ , ∀x ∈ Xf (N) , (1) φ̄i ∈ Ωji+d ∼ L i μ ∈ Xi.

However, the assumption that μ is small enough is required to ensure that Ωji+d ∼ L i+d μ is not empty. Hence, Theorem 10 does not hold with only Assumptions 1–4, unless Assumption 1 holds with μ sufficiently small. Remark 1. Note that a similar result has been obtained in Theorem 9 of Lazer and Heemela (2009), where the authors clarified that μ > 0 should be sufficiently small so that 0 ∈ int  Ωj0 ∼ L N−1 μ  ≠ ∅. In addition, the proof of the base case in Lemma 5 is incorrect because f 1 (x, ω (0)) = f̄ 1 (x) + ω (0) holds only if ∂ fj ∂ω = 1 and o (ω) = 0 hold.	control theory;dropout (neural networks);emoticon;fax;feasible region;hybrid system;lyapunov fractal;network packet;recursion;regular expression	Chunhe Hu	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.07.006	control engineering;lyapunov function;control theory;mathematics;statistics;hybrid system	Theory	68.23374933056037	5.65454444803801	25065

The set of discrete frequency values is the set of locations along the frequency axis at which (real and/or imaginary parts of) the Fourier transform of the signal x(t) cross certain levels (especially zero level). Analogously, invoking time-frequency duality, a set of time instants denoting the zero/level crossings of a waveform x(t) can be used to represent a bandlimited spectrum X(f) . The proposed signal representation is based on a simple bandpass signal model that exploits our prior knowledge of the bandwidth/timewidth of the signal. We call it a Sum-of-Sincs (SOS) model, where Sinc stands for the familiar sinx/x function. Given the discrete fequency/time locations, we can accurately reconstruct the signal x(t) or the spectrum X(f) by solving a simple eigenvalue or a least squares problem. Using this approach as the basis, we propose an analysis/synthesis algorithm to decompose and represent complex multicomponent signals like speech over the entire time-frequency region. The proposed signal representation is an alternative to standard analog to discrete conversion based on the sampling theorem, and in principle, possesses some of the desirable attributes of signal representation in natural sensory systems.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;analog signal;apache axis;bandlimiting;centrality;discrete frequency domain;imaginary time;interpolation;least squares;neural oscillation;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;shannon (unit);signal reconstruction;sinc function;waveform	Ramdas Kumaresan;Nitesh Panchal	2010	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2009.2022432	fourier transform;discrete mathematics;speech recognition;discrete-time signal;analog signal;mathematics;continuous signal;speech synthesis;statistics	ML	56.694216767165365	15.541056333333938	25247

It is shown that the pointwise iteration-complexity of the new method is better than the corresponding one for the standard ADMM method and that, up to a logarithmic term, is identical to the ergodic iteration-complexity of the latter method. Our analysis is based on first presenting and establishing the pointwise iteration-complexity of a regularized non-Euclidean hybrid proximal extragradient framework whose error condition at each iteration includes both a relative error and a summable error. It is then shown that the new method is a special instance of the latter framework where the sequence of summable errors is identically zero when the ADMM stepsize is less than one or a nontrivial sequence when the stepsize is in the interval [1, (1 + √ 5)/2). 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 47H05, 47J22, 49M27, 90C25, 90C30, 90C60, 65K10.	approximation error;augmented lagrangian method;constant function;convex optimization;ergodicity;iteration;mathematics subject classification	Max L.

Here we generalize this technique to the case of two parameters, and construct a type of parametric BWFBs with two free parameters. The closed-form parameter expressions of the BWFBs are derived, with which any two-parameter family of BWFBs having preassigned VMs can be constructed, and six families, i.e., 9/11, 10/10, 13/11, 10/14, 17/11, and 10/18 families, are considered here. Two parameters provide two degrees of freedom to optimize the resulting BWFBs with respect to other criteria. In particular, in each family, three specific rational-coefficient BWFBs with attractive features are obtained by adjusting the parameters: the first is not only very close to a quadrature mirror filter (QMF) bank, but has optimum coding gain; the second possesses characteristics that are close to the irrational BWFB with maximum VMs by Cohen et al.; and the last which has binary coefficients can realize a multiplication-free discrete wavelet transform. In addition, two BWFBs are systematically verified to exhibit performance competitive to several state-of-the-art BWFBs for image compression, and yet require lower computational costs.	biorthogonal wavelet;filter bank	Zaide Liu;Chengxiu Gao	2008	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-008-0050-y	data compression;parametrization;computer vision;discrete mathematics;linear phase;image processing;quadrature;image compression;computer science;quadrature mirror filter;calculus;coding gain;filter bank;diophantine equation;mathematics;geometry;multiplicity;discrete wavelet transform;algorithm	Vision	55.073357774287494	21.677694913517524	25481

Based on methods from computational algebraic geometry, the approach achieves a full description of the solution space and thus avoids the local minima issue of adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, unlike most symbolic methods, the computational cost is kept low by a split of the problem into two stages. First, a symbolic pre-computation is done offline once for all, to get a more convenient parametric trace-matrix representation of the problem using normal forms. The solutions of the problem are then easily obtained from this representation by solving a single univariate polynomial equation. This approach is quite general and can be applied to a wide variety of problems: SISO channel identification of PSK modulations but also filter design and possibly MIMO blind source separation by deflation.	algebraic equation;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;blind signal separation;computational complexity theory;database normalization;feasible region;filter design;linear algebra;mimo;matrix representation;maxima and minima;modulation;online and offline;pre-shared key;precomputation;quadratic function;signal processing;simulation interoperability standards organization;source separation;symbolic computation;system of polynomial equations	Jérôme Lebrun;Pierre Comon	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;gröbner basis;equation;mathematics;algebraic function;square-free polynomial;polarization of an algebraic form;polynomial	Vision	62.89611434951159	19.89137693788091	25485

Such functions appear as solutions of elliptic PDEs with lognormal diffusion coefficients. We outline a general L2-convergence theory based on previous work by Bachmayr et al. (2016) and Chen (2016) and establish an algebraic convergence rate for sufficiently smooth functions assuming a mild growth bound for the univariate hierarchical surpluses of the interpolation scheme applied to Hermite polynomials. We verify specifically for Gauss-Hermite nodes that this assumption holds and also show algebraic convergence w.r.t. the resulting number of sparse grid points for this case.

All the vehicles can have different dynamics. A design method for a distributed adaptive protocol is given which guarantees that all the networked systems synchronize to the motion of a target system. The dynamics of the networked systems, as well as the target system, are all assumed unknown. A neural network (NN) is used at each node to approximate the distributed dynamics. The resulting protocol consists of a simple decentralized proportional-plus-derivative term and a nonlinear term with distributed adaptive tuning laws at each node. The case with nonconstant NN approximation error is considered. There, a robust term is added to suppress the external disturbances and the approximation errors of the NNs. Simulation examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	anatomic node;anatomy, regional;approximation algorithm;approximation error;artificial neural network;assumed;biological neural networks;controllers;directed graph;distributed control system;drug vehicle;graph - visual representation;lyapunov fractal;nn304;nonlinear system;parkinson disease;simulation;topological graph theory	Gang Chen;Frank L.

The new algorithm combines conjugate gradients with gradient projection techniques, as the algorithm of Mor e and Toraldo (SIAM J. on Optimization 1, pp. 93-113) and other well-known methods do. A new strategy for the decision of leaving the current face is introduced, that makes it possible to obtain nite convergence even for a singular Hessian and in the presence of dual degeneracy.

The method uses the loudspeaker response as starting point in order to obtain the desired electro-acoustical target. The algorithm uses a bank of parametric second order filters, known as peak filters in the audio field, to equalize and approximate the filtered response to the desired one. When the recursive process is finished, the parameters that define the filters (frequency, gain and Q) are obtained in correction order of importance; first the ones that provide deep correction in the response. This characteristic allows the implementation of scalable systems with different degrees of complexity and correction.	approximation algorithm;complexity;direct method in the calculus of variations;infinite impulse response;loudspeaker;mathematical optimization;random optimization;recursion;scalability	Germán Ramos;José J.

As a blackbox-type software, MultRoot requires the polynomial coefficients as the only input, and outputs the computed roots, multiplicities, backward error, estimated forward error, and the structure-preserving condition number. The most significant features of MultRoot are the multiplicity identification capability and high accuracy on multiple roots without using multiprecision arithmetic, even if the polynomial coefficients are inexact.

Thus, maintaining the connectivity of the communication graph is a fundamental issue. In this paper we develop a strategy based on Sabattini et al., Decentralized Connectivity Maintenance for Networked Lagrangian Dynamical Systems, 2012 for guaranteeing connectivity in the presence of data corruption. In fact, when dealing with real systems, several sources of data corruption can appear. For instance, sensor noise is one of the primary sources of data corruption. Moreover, when dealing with interconnected robotic systems, assuming instantaneous exchange of data is often unrealistic; communication delays are then another important source of data corruption. For this reason, we provide a solution to the connectivity maintenance problem for interconnected Lagrangian dynamical agents, in the presence of data corruption. & 2013 European Control Association.

The keys to the superior performance and resource usage over existing solution methods for model predictive pulse pattern control are an appropriate problem reformulation and a newly derived result for the projection on the truncated monotone cone that composes the feasible set in this application. Using a coldstarted classic gradient method in fixed-point arithmetic, a numerically stable implementation is shown to require less than 300 clock cycles to meet the stringent accuracy specification for problems with at most three switching transitions per phase. For the case of four (five) transitions, only about 550 (690) cycles are required. At the same time, merely two digital signal processor (DSP)-type multipliers on an FPGA are used for all problem sizes. These results indicate a speed improvement of ten times and a resource reduction by 17 times in terms of DSP-type multipliers for the case of three transitions per phase compared with an existing solution method. When there are four or five transitions per phase, the resource reduction is even more impressive.	clock signal;condition number;converge;digital signal processor;feasible region;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;fixed-point arithmetic;gradient method;mathematical optimization;numerical stability;signal processing;monotone	Stefan Richter;Tobias Geyer;Manfred Morari	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2577000	control engineering;electronic engineering;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;digital signal processing;control theory;predictive modelling;field-programmable gate array	EDA	61.48454716361599	20.321764816052916	25708

The size and the location of a small opening in the domain of integration of an elliptic equation is identified on the basis of an observation. The observation includes the finite number of shape functionals. The approximation of the shape functionals by using the so-called topological derivatives is used to perform the learning process of an artificial neural network. The results of computations for 2D examples show, that the method allows to determine an approximation of the global solution to the inverse problem, sufficiently closed to the exact solution. The proposed method can be extended to the problems with an opening of general shape and to the identification problems of small inclusions. However, the mathematical theory of the proposed approach still requires futher research. In particular, the proof of global convergence of the method is an open problem.	numerical partial differential equations	Lidia Jackowska-Strumillo;Jan Sokolowski;Antoni Zochowski;A.

Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a necessary and sufficient condition for robust discrete-time consensus is proposed. Then, we investigate the robust discrete-time consensus with positive weighted network, and a necessary and sufficient condition is also provided based on the property of an uncertain matrix. Corresponding sufficient conditions for robust discrete-time consensus are derived by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem built by exploiting sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomials.

A dyadic tree-structured CCFB can be used to perform a discrete wavelet transform suitable for coding based on symmetric extension methods. This paper derives two types of efficient implementation techniques for the tree-structured CCFB: one using complex arithmetic and one using only real arithmetic. In addition, the present paper analyzes in detail the perfect reconstruction (PR) condition for the two-channel CCFB and shows that this condition is much less restrictive than that of usual two-channel filterbanks. When each of the two-channel CCFBs constituting a tree-structured CCFB is designed to be PR, the whole system is PR. A quadrature mirror filter (QMF) CCFB having the PR property is demonstrated to be easily designed using a standard filter design subroutine. In contrast, designing a linear-phase PR FIR QMF bank that has good frequency response is not possible when filters are realized by linear convolutions.	binary tree;circular convolution;computation;discrete wavelet transform;dyadic transformation;extension method;filter bank;filter design;finite impulse response;frequency response;linear phase;quadrature mirror filter;subroutine	Hideo Murakami	2004	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2003.819979	computer vision;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;finite impulse response;mathematics	Visualization	58.58311194393544	18.872709986419988	25836

Spectral-gain calculation incorporates adaptive control of a spectral-gain floor for an appropriate balance between residual noise and distortion in the enhanced speech. Use of a common spectral gain among channels calculated from a down-mix signal helps reduce computations on gain calculation compared to independent spectral-gain calculation. Subjective evaluation results demonstrate that the difference in the 5-grade mean opinion score with and without the multipurpose noise suppressor in the downlink is improved by as much as 0.5. When it is used as an uplink noise suppressor, the enhanced-speech quality is statistically better than or equal to that with a conventional noise suppressor.

The main contributions of this paper are the proposition and the analysis of a class of inertial proximal ADMMs, which unify the basic ideas of the inertial proximal point method and the proximal ADMM, for linearly constrained separable convex optimization. This class of methods are of inertial nature because at each iteration the proximal ADMM is applied to a point extrapolated at the current iterate in the direction of last movement. The recently proposed inertial primal-dual algorithm [1, Algorithm 3] and the inertial linearized ADMM [2, Eq. (3.23)] are covered as special cases. The proposed algorithmic framework is very general in the sense that the weighting matrices in the proximal terms are allowed to be only positive semidefinite, but not necessarily positive definite as required by existing methods of the same kind. By setting the two proximal terms to zero, we obtain an inertial variant of the classical ADMM, which is new to the best of our knowledge. We carry out a unified analysis for the entire class of methods under very mild assumptions. In particular, convergence, as well as asymptotic o(1/ √ k) and nonasymptotic O(1/ √ k) rates of convergence, are established for the best primal function value and feasibility residues, where k denotes the iteration counter. The global iterate convergence of the generated sequence is established under an additional assumption. We also present extensive experimental results on total variation based image reconstruction problems to illustrate the profits gained by introducing the inertial extrapolation steps.	convex optimization;diffusing update algorithm;first-order predicate;iteration;iterative reconstruction;mathematical optimization;program counter	Caihua Chen;Raymond H.

The agents are sparsely connected and each of them observes a strict subset of the state vector. The distributed algorithm that we propose enables each agent to estimate any arbitrary linear dynamical system with bounded mean-squared error. To achieve this, the ratio of the algebraic connectivity and the largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian has to be larger than a lower bound determined by the spectral radius of the system's dynamics matrix. This extends the notion of Network Tracking Capacity introduced by other authors in prior work.

Traditional model reduction approaches to discrete delay systems are based on transforming delay systems into non-delay equivalent systems. However, when the state delay is large, they are computationally demanding. The proposed model reduction method can be efficiently computed irrespective of the state delay. To do this, a diagonal balanced realization is proposed based on block diagonal gramian-like matrices, and properties of truncation of the diagonal balanced realization are investigated.	truncation	Young Soo Suh	1999	Automatica	10.1016/S0005-1098(99)00094-1	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;elmore delay;discrete system;control theory;mathematics	EDA	69.85926859957357	6.08118460426993	26072

Here, unlike conventional blind deconvolution where some assumptions on the statistical properties of the white source signal are needed to be made, an initial estimation of the original input, to be identified based on some prior knowledge, is whitened and used instead of the usual I.I.D input. We first justify the basis of our proposed algorithm, using an iterative blind deconvolution method based on Shalvi-Weinstein criterion, in which the deconvolution filter is updated using the previous estimation of the input signal iteratively. Then, the algorithm is further developed by using an initial model, as the first estimation of the input signal, as there are applications such as glottal flow estimation where such a model exists. Furthermore, constrained optimization is used to estimate the deconvolution filter to satisfy more than just one criterion. This optimization contains an objective function that is Shalvi-Weinstein criterion (normalized kurtosis maximization) and, a nonlinear equality in which the mean square error (MSE) between the estimated input and the initial model is kept lower than a limit. The proposed algorithm is applied to simulated cases to assess its performance."""	blind deconvolution;constrained optimization;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;finite impulse response;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;minimum phase;nonlinear system;optimization problem;speech synthesis	Milad Lankarany;Mohammad Hasan Savoji	2010	CCECE 2010	10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575252	econometrics;mathematical optimization;knowledge base;constrained optimization;computer science;finite impulse response;mathematics;blind deconvolution;statistics	ML	60.04923465905111	10.349992440930487	26092

The optimization is performed over a multiagent networked system, and each local function depends only on a subset of the variables. An asynchronous and distributed alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) method that allows the nodes to defer or skip the computation and transmission of updates is proposed in the paper. The proposed algorithm utilizes different approximations in the update step, resulting in proximal and majorized ADMM variants. Both variants are shown to converge to a local minimum under certain regularity conditions. The proposed asynchronous algorithms are also applied to the problem of cooperative localization in wireless ad hoc networks, where it is shown to outperform the other state-of-the-art localization algorithms.	agent-based model;algorithm;approximation;computation;consensus (computer science);converge;hoc (programming language);mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;observable	Sandeep Kumar;Rahul Jain;Ketan Rajawat	2017	IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks	10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2593896	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;estimation;convergence;information processing;computer science;linear programming;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics	Robotics	63.580595793459445	8.55183046231974	26192

Therefore, the common NLMS-algorithm has been modified to incorporate hidden orthogonal Ipatovand Huffmansequences for fast systemidentification. Using this method, the speed and accuracy of the identification of the LRM-System is increased and the overall-performance of an echo and noise cancellation has been improved. Introduction The use of orthogonal sequences for system identification and channel equalization is well established in mobile communications or radar detections or various spread spectrum applications. The system identification of an acoustical Loudspeaker-Room-Microphone (LRM-) system using orthogonal sequences, as e.g. NMaximum-, Ipatov-, Barkeror Huffmansequences, is more difficult due to the fact that these signals are perceptible by human beings and therefore not suitable for acoustical system identification. In common echo and noise cancellation systems the use of adaptive algorithms is well known. In speech applications, the NLMS algorithm is appreciated for its stability and low computing complexity, but it has the disadvantage of slow convergence and adaption speed. This paper presents an algorithm and an implementation of orthogonal perfect correlation sequences for acoustical system identification using psychoacoustical masking effects. As result, speed and accuracy of the identification of the LRM-System using the NLMSalgorithm is increased and the overall-performance of an echo and noise cancellation has been improved. Psychoacoustical Masking Effects The process of human acoustical perception is not fully discovered yet, and it is main topic of extensive research for at least twenty years. It turned out, that due to psychoacoustical masking effects, not all the details of speech (and all other acoustical signals) are perceptible. This behavior is used for instance in speech compression methods (MPEG) or for codecs in Fifth International Symposium on Signal Processing and its Applications, ISSPA '99, Brisbane, Australia, 22-25 August, 1999 Organised by the Signal Processing Research Centre, QUT, Brisbane, Australia <(k+1) = E r ( k ) + s ( k ) ( l E ) (1) shown in (2). with psychoacoustical parameters E and v.

0e57b985f4a99aaae5a20d3a54734b67d5c10244	a sequential ℓ1 quadratic programming method for robust nonlinear optimal power flow solution	linear systems;quadratic programming;minimization;convergence;vectors;ip networks;sparse matrices	Large-scale nonlinear optimal power flow (OPF) problems have been solved lately by primal-dual interior point (IP) methods. In spite of their success, there are many situations in which IP-based OPF programs can fail to find a solution. On the other hand, with power systems operating heavily loaded there is an increasing need for globally convergent OPF solvers. Trust region schemes have been used to enforce convergence, but they are by nature computationally expensive. This paper aims at developing a trust region OPF algorithm less expensive than the one proposed by Sousa et al. The major difference lies in how they handle inconsistent constraints in the solution of the trust region subproblems. The algorithm proposed here employs a sequential ℓ1 quadratic programming (S ℓ1QP) approach, while the one of Sousa et al. employs the Byrd-Omojokun technique. Thus, rather than solving two quadratic programming (QP) problems per iteration as in the Byrd-Omojokun technique, the Sℓ1QP approach solves a single, but slightly larger, QP problem. The developed algorithm is tested on the IEEE test systems of up to 300-bus, with all QP problems solved by primal-dual IP algorithms. The numerical results indicate that the Sℓ1QP method is competitive in processing time when compared to the Byrd-Omojokun approach.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;epub;effective method;experiment;ibm power systems;interior point method;iteration;lagrange multiplier;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quadratic programming;solver;trust region	Vicente R.

However, when the parameter space is large, the system identification problem becomes more challenging. In this paper, we focus on the identification of bilinear forms, where the bilinear term is defined with respect to the impulse responses of a spatiotemporal model. In this framework, we develop a proportionate normalized least-mean-square algorithm tailored for the identification of such bilinear forms. Simulation results indicate the good performance of the proposed algorithm, in terms of both convergence rate and computational complexity.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;brainfuck;computational complexity theory;least mean squares filter;neural coding;rate of convergence;simulation;sparse matrix;system analysis;system identification	Constantin Paleologu;Jacob Benesty;Camelia Elisei-Iliescu;Cristian Stanciu;Cristian Anghel;Silviu Ciochina	2018	2018 41st International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2018.8441255	rate of convergence;bilinear form;parameter space;normalization (statistics);computational complexity theory;computer science;system identification;algorithm;bilinear interpolation;adaptive filter	Robotics	60.75318321474594	12.47297984437685	26311
2281da46a1ae9fffc80644e1091b32e23f52731e	singular points of quadratic systems: a complete classification in the coefficient space r12	singular points;quadratic systems;singular point	Planar quadratic differential systems occur in many areas of applied mathematics. Although more than one thousand papers were written on these systems, a complete understanding of this class is still missing. Classical problems, and in particular, Hilbert’s 16th problem [Hilbert, 1900], are still open for this class. Even when not dealing with limit cycles, still some problems have remained unsolved like a complete classification of different phase portraits without limit cycles. For some time it was thought (see [Coppel, 1966]) there could exist a set of algebraic functions whose signs would completely determine the phase portrait of a quadratic system. Nowadays we already know that this is not so, and that there are some analytical, nonalgebraic functions that also play a role when dealing with limit cycles and separatrix connections. However, it is possible to find out a set of algebraic functions whose signs determine the characteristics of all finite and infinite singular points. Most of the work up to now has dealt with this problem studying it using different normal forms adapted to some subclasses of quadratic systems. A general work useful for any quadratic system regardless of affine changes has only been done for the study of infinite singular points [Schlomiuk et al., 2005]. In this paper, we give a complete global classification of quadratic differential systems according to their topological behavior in the vicinity of the finite singular points. Our classification Main Theorem gives us a complete dictionary describing the local behavior of finite singular points using algebraic invariants and comitants which are a powerful tool for algebraic computations. Linking the result of this paper with the main one of [Schlomiuk et al., 2005] which uses the same algebraic invariants, it is possible to complete the algebraic classification of singular points (finite and infinite) for quadratic differential systems.	algebraic equation;coefficient;computation;database normalization;dictionary;limit cycle;linear algebra	Joan C.

Usually the filter gain is given a fixed value determined due to dynamic and measurement conditions. Most studies provide analytical solutions for optimal gains in particular scenarios. In practice, due to a lack of information (or under timevarying conditions) these recipes are mostly inapplicable and the kinematic filter requires appropriate adaptation tools instead. In its simplest form, the problem may be formulated as the gain adaptation under the tracking index uncertainty. We suggest a simple adaptive-gain kinematic filter based on minimization of the innovation variance which is known to give the optimal Kalman gain. The study deals with commonly used kinematic models of order 2-4. As shown, for any order of the kinematic filter its transfer function matches the moving-averaging (MA) model parameterized by the filter gain. In this view, the adaptive kinematic filter may be implemented in a variety of forms either based on the MA identification or by a direct gain adaptation. Optimal closed-form solutions may be incorporated into the adaptive filter as constraints. With the optimally constrained gain-vector components, the multipleparameter adaptive filter is translated into a beneficial single-parameter version. The simulation study demonstrates behavior of suggested filters in a wide range of conditions.

3a7ea156004710fd07d358f071ab8b3300645034	gridless compressed sensing under shift-invariant sampling		Parameter estimation has applications in many fields of signal processing, such as spectral analysis or direction-of-arrival estimation. Subspace-based methods like root-MUSIC and ESPRIT provide high parameter resolution at low computational complexity by exploiting specific sampling structure, namely uniform linear sampling and shift-invariant sampling, respectively. On the other hand, compressed sensing has been shown to outperform subspace-based methods in difficult scenarios such as low number of measurement vectors, high noise power or correlated signals. While it is well known that uniform sampling admits gridless compressed sensing methods, e.g., based on atomic norm minimization, no such approaches are known for shift-invariant sampling. In this paper we present a novel approach for gridless compressed sensing under shift-invariant sampling. We show by numerical experiments that the proposed method outperforms ESPRIT in difficult scenarios.	compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;estimation theory;experiment;noise power;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;spectral density estimation	Christian Steffens;Wassim Suleiman;Alexander Sorg;Marius Pesavento	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953055	mathematical optimization;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;sampling (statistics);principal component analysis;signal processing;estimation theory;invariant (mathematics);subspace topology;mathematics	Robotics	53.78875436219184	8.201798916663465	26425

An algorithm will be described which uses an intermediate (and variable) amount of storage and which demonstrates convergence which is also intermediate, that is, generally better than that observed for conjugate gradient algorithms but not so good as in a quasi-Newton approach. The new algorithm uses a strategy of generating a form of conjugate gradient search direction for most iterations, but it periodically uses a quasi-Newton step to improve the convergence. Some theoretical background for a new algorithm has been presented in an earlier paper; here we examine properties of the new algorithm and its implementation. We also present the results of some computational experience.	algorithm;conjugate gradient method;newton;quasi-newton method	Albert G. Buckley	1978	Math.

The algorithm solves a sequence of (separable) strongly convex problems. Convergence to a stationary solution of the original nonconvex optimization is established. Our framework is very general and flexible; it unifies several existing Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based algorithms such as (proximal) gradient or Newton type methods, block coordinate (parallel) descent schemes, difference of convex functions methods, and improves on their convergence properties. More importantly, and differently from current SCA schemes, it naturally leads to distributed and parallelizable schemes for a large class of nonconvex problems. The new method is applied to the solution of a new rate profile optimization problem over Interference Broadcast Channels (IBCs); numerical results show that it outperforms existing ad-hoc algorithms.	approximation algorithm;broadcast domain;convex function;convex optimization;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mathematical optimization;newton;numerical analysis;optimization problem;proximal gradient methods for learning;stationary process;stationary state	Gesualdo Scutari;Francisco Facchinei;Lorenzo Lampariello;Peiran Song	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853715	computer vision;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;mathematics	Robotics	63.7984749980376	9.478630352525006	26754

Compared to traditional l1-optimization-based methods, the proposed algorithm minimizes l1 norm of a portion (instead of all) of nonzero coefficients. In this way, some nonzero coefficients at crucial positions are not affected by l1 norm utilized in the objective function. The proposed algorithm employs an iterative procedure and the index set of these crucial coefficients is updated in each iteration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better design results than both greedy methods and traditional l1-optimization-based methods.	coefficient;filter design;finite impulse response;greedy algorithm;iteration;linear phase;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;selection rule;simulation;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry	Aimin Jiang;Hon Keung Kwan;Yanping Zhu;Xiaofeng Liu;Ning Xu;Xiao Yao	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760234	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Robotics	62.078886221232295	11.748549136126455	26811

ERP generated due to hand movement is filtered through Adaptive Noise Canceller (ANC) from the EEG signals. ANCs are also implemented with Least Mean Square (LMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. Performance of the algorithms is evaluated in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB, correlation between resultant and template ERP, and mean value difference. Testing of their noise attenuation capability is done on contaminated ERP with white noise at different SNR levels. A comparative study of the performance of conventional gradient based methods like LMS, RLS, and ABC algorithm is also made which reveals that ABC algorithm gives better performance in highly noisy environment.	adaptive filter;artificial bee colony algorithm;british informatics olympiad;erp;electroencephalography;genetic algorithm;gradient;least mean squares filter;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;refinement (computing);resultant;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;white noise	Mitul Kumar Ahirwal;Anil Kumar;Girish Kumar Singh	2014	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2013.10.019	adaptive filter;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;signal-to-noise ratio	AI	59.930797585373725	14.17782344857326	26824

Based on these, various techniques for estimating the properties of such processes have been developed. This paper provides theoretical analysis of a new wavelet-based approach which has the advantages of having low computational complexity and being able to handle the case where the 1/f/sup /spl gamma// noise might be embedded in a further white-noise process. However, the analysis conducted here shows that these advantages are balanced by the fact that the wavelet-based scheme is only consistent for spectral exponents /spl gamma/ in the range /spl gamma//spl isin/(0, 1). This is in contradiction to the results suggested in previous empirical studies. When /spl gamma//spl isin/(0, 1) this paper also establishes that wavelet-based maximum-likelihood methods are asymptotically Gaussian and efficient. Finally, the asymptotic rate of mean-square convergence of the parameter estimates is established and is shown to slow as /spl gamma/ approaches one. Combined with a survey of non-wavelet-based methods, these new results give a perspective on the various tradeoffs to be considered when modeling and estimating 1/f/sup /spl gamma// noise processes.	pink noise	Brett Ninness	1998	IEEE Trans.

The method of characteristics reduces the age-structured model to a system of differential equations with a state-dependent delay. A detailed stability analysis is performed. A sufficient condition for the global asymptotic stability of the trivial steady state is obtained using a Lyapunov–Razumikhin function. A unique positive steady state is shown to appear through a transcritical bifurcation of the trivial steady state. The analysis of the positive steady state behavior, through the study of a first order exponential polynomial characteristic equation, concludes the existence of a Hopf bifurcation and gives criteria for stability switches. A numerical analysis confirms the results and stresses the role of each parameter involved in the system on the stability of the positive steady state.	bifurcation theory;computable function;exponential polynomial;hopf bifurcation;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;network switch;numerical analysis;population model;steady state	Mostafa Adimy;Fabien Crauste;My Lhassan Hbid;Redouane Qesmi	2010	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/080742713	transcritical bifurcation;mathematical analysis;population model;calculus;control theory;mathematics;hopf bifurcation;bifurcation diagram	Metrics	78.09435534111964	4.658690843821048	27071

Employment of traditional identification methods for EIV systems will result in biased parameter estimates. The existing methods of EIV identification like Bias Eliminated Least Squares (BELS), and Subspace EIV methods may not always yield good parameter estimates. To address these open issues, this paper presents a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated with an experimental study.	computation;dynamical system;errors-in-variables models;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;input/output;iterative method;least squares;state space	Ouyang Wu;K.

Nevertheless, those results involve approximations (e.g., density estimation), so that they do not constitute an absolute proof. In this letter, the problem is tackled from a theoretical point of view. An example is provided for which it is rigorously proved that spurious minima can exist in both mutual information and negentropy optima. The proof is based on a Taylor expansion of the entropy.	approximation;blind signal separation;entropy (information theory);information theory;maxima and minima;mutual information;negentropy;simulation;source separation	Dinh-Tuan Pham;Frédéric Vrins	2005	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2005.856868	independent component analysis;minimisation;mathematical optimization;density estimation;taylor series;maxima and minima;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind signal separation;mutual information;statistics	ML	72.71892217004527	27.438367013272547	27441

With the usage of the metamodeling techniques, PLRS proposes a new approximate function $${\hat{F}}$$F^ to describe the lower bounds of the real function $$f$$f in a compact way, i.e., making the approximate function $${\hat{F}}$$F^ closer to $$f$$f. By adjusting a parameter $${\hat{K}}$$K^ (an estimate of the Lipschitz constant $$K$$K), $${\hat{F}}$$F^ could approximate $$f$$f in a fine way to favor local exploitation in some interesting regions; $${\hat{F}}$$F^ can also approximate $$f$$f in a coarse way to favor global exploration over the entire domain. When doing optimization, PLRS cycles through a set of identified potential estimates of the Lipschitz constant to construct the approximate function from fine to coarse. Consequently, the optimization operates at both local and global levels. Comparative studies with several global optimization algorithms on 53 test functions and an engineering application indicate that the proposed algorithm is promising for expensive black box functions.	black box;global optimization;mathematical optimization;procedural parameter;response surface methodology	Haitao Liu;Shengli Xu;Ying Ma;Xiaofang Wang	2015	J.

(2007), we present an improved generalized conjugate residual squared (IGCRS) algorithm that is designed for distributed parallel environments. The new improved algorithm reduces two global synchronization points to one by changing the computation sequence in the GCRS algorithm in such a way that all inner products per iteration are independent so that communication time required for inner products can be overlapped with useful computation. Theoretical analysis and numerical comparison of isoefficiency analysis show that the IGCRS method has better parallelism and scalability than the GCRS method, and the parallel performance can be improved by a factor of about 2. Finally, some numerical experiments clearly show that the IGCRS method can achieve better parallel performance with a higher scalability than the GCRS method and the improvement percentage of communication is up to 52.19% averagely, which meets our theoretical analysis.	algorithm;parallel computing	Xian-yu Zuo;Li-Tao Zhang;Tongxiang Gu	2014	J.

In practice, the calculations are efficient only if the filter parameters fit into the processor's cache. With long filters, the computation is slowed down since the filter data do not fit into the cache at once. By computing the filter in multiple segments, more efficient cache utilization can be achieved. The presented optimization method works when multiple samples are processed in row.

The first phase of the algorithm involves finding the Euclidean center and radius of the maximal inscribed hypersphere contained in the polytope defined by Ax >~ b. We develop a method of steepest ascent which locates this center by maximizing a piecewise linear function. The computation of the direction of steepest ascent involves the solution of a simple quadratic program. The starting point is arbitrary. The second phase of the algorithm is concerned with maximization of the objective function over the feasible region. A simplex that encloses the feasible region is determined by the maximal hypersphere determined in the first phase. If the optimum of the objective function over this simplex is feasible, the algorithm terminates and the solution is found. If not, a new maximal hypersphere problem is solved in the next iteration. Here we describe the algorithm with an emphasis on its geometrical aspects and provide a proof of finite convergence. 1.

62e841f9d375dd43e492f89e33d39267f6e48756	fixed-lag smoothing with linear equality constraints		The problem of fixed-lag smoothing with linear equality constraint (LEC) is considered. Fixed-lag smoothing algorithms are developed by applying the state-augmentation approach to several popular constrained filtering methods, including model reduction, pseudo measurement, estimate projection and other two LEC filtering methods based on conversion or direct elimination method. After a briefly review, they are extended to address the smoothing problem with LEC. The nonlinear radar measurements in polar coordinate are converted to Cartesian coordinate by applying unbiased measurement conversion method. Thus the nonlinear smoothing problem is converted to a linear one and the proposed smoothing algorithms are formulated for linear system. The performance of the proposed smoothers are evaluated using a comparison against traditional unconstrained fixed-lag smoothing algorithm. Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of fixed-lag smoothing algorithms with LEC, where a significant performance improvement over the unconstrained smoothing algorithm can be observed. And the impact of the lag (time delay) on the performance is discussed. A small lag is recommended in the practical applications.	algorithm;broadcast delay;linear equation;linear system;measurement in quantum mechanics;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;radar;simulation;smoothing	Keyi Li;Gongjian Zhou;Linfeng Xu	2017	2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009835	filter (signal processing);cartesian coordinate system;nonlinear system;smoothing;linear system;lag;mathematical optimization;polar coordinate system;mathematics	EDA	58.42099999536946	6.152606767935452	28034

Part I of this paper proposed an alternative distributed Newton-type algorithm for solving NUM problems with self-concordant utility functions. For each primal iteration, this algorithm features distributed exact stepsize calculation with finite termination and decentralized computation of the dual variables using a finitely truncated iterative scheme obtained through novel matrix splitting techniques. This paper analyzes the convergence properties of a broader class of algorithms with potentially different stepsize computation schemes. In particular, we allow for errors in the stepsize computation. We show that if the error levels in the Newton direction (resulting from finite termination of dual iterations) and stepsize calculation are below a certain threshold, then the algorithm achieves local quadratic convergence rate in primal iterations to an error neighborhood of the optimal solution, where the size of the neighborhood can be explicitly characterized by the parameters of the algorithm and the error levels.	apriori algorithm;computation;distributed algorithm;error-tolerant design;expectation–maximization algorithm;first-order logic;first-order predicate;gradient;in the beginning... was the command line;iteration;iterative method;lagrangian relaxation;loss function;matrix splitting;network utility;newton;newton's method;optimization problem;rate of convergence;self-concordant function;subgradient method	Ermin Wei;Asuman E.

The conversion method proposed by the authors (SIAM Journal on Optimization, vol. 11, pp. 647–674, 2000, and Mathematical Programming, Series B, vol. 95, pp. 303–327, 2003) is a preprocessing of sparse semidefinite programs based on matrix completion. This article proposed a new version of the conversion method which employs a flop estimation function inside its heuristic procedure. Extensive numerical experiments are included showing the advantage of preprocessing by the conversion method for very sparse semidefinite programs of certain classes.	experiment;flops;heuristic;linear programming;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;preprocessor;semidefinite programming;shadow volume;sparse matrix	Katsuki Fujisawa;Mituhiro Fukuda;Kazuhide Nakata	2006	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556780512331319523	mathematical optimization;linear programming;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;sparsity-of-effects principle;preprocessor	ML	75.55409055639325	25.654570485000654	28152

However, there exists no algorithm to determine the minimum total model-order of the appropriate truncated inverse filter to achieve a specified Li approximation error. In this paper, we design a novel model-order determination algorithm, which can be utilized for efficient dynamic memory allocation on cost-effective transceiver platforms since such a minimum total-model-order is proportional to the memory usage for implementing any inverse filter (equalizer).	algorithm;approximation error;bit error rate;communications of the acm;digital signal processing;equalization (communications);finite impulse response;inverse filter;memory management;signal processing;transceiver	Shih Yu Chang;Hsiao-Chun Wu	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.106	mathematical optimization;finite impulse response;signal processing;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	60.4026890717375	21.226832293881273	28185

An important design problem is to choose the degree of interconnection of the subsystems to achieve a good trade-off between a small number of interconnections and a fast convergence to the consensus state, which is the average of the initial opinions under mild conditions. This paper addresses this problem through l1-norm and l0-“pseudo-norm” regularized versions of the well-known Fastest Mixing Markov-Chain (FMMC) problem. We show that such versions can be interpreted as robust forms of the FMMC problem and provide results to guide the choice of the regularization parameter.	augmented lagrangian method;consensus (computer science);convex optimization;emoticon;fastest;interconnection;lasso;markov chain;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry;telephone exchange;whole earth 'lectronic link	Giorgio Gnecco;Rita Morisi;Alberto Bemporad	2014	IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039729	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Vision	63.57326098872244	7.78104949446293	28350

The mean convergence of the modified LS type method is comprehensively studied. The practical implication of the knowledge of the noise variance ratio is investigated through sensitivity analysis. This analysis results in the establishment of an alternative identification method that can work efficiently under a much relaxed condition on the knowledge of the noise variance ratio.

A scheme for solving FD problem for discrete-time MJLS, which is subject to the Gaussian disturbances, is proposed. The Kalman filter (KF) is used as a residual generator. Once a residual signal is generated, it will be evaluated whether faults occur or not. Residual evaluation function is selected such that the maximum fault detection rate (FDR) is achieved, for a given false alarm rate (FAR). Finally, threshold is computed by using an estimation of the variance of evaluation function in the fault-free case. To demonstrate the performance of this proposed method, a numerical example is given.	evaluation function;fault detection and isolation;kalman filter;linear system;markov chain;numerical analysis	Jedsada Saijai;Ali Abdo;Waseem Damlakhi;Steven X.

Throughout the steps of the procedure the adjusted Banzhaf index generating function polynomial is transformed to the standard representation used for the calculation of this index.

Although successful implementations have been reported, a solid analysis with respect to the convergence of these iterations has not been established. The aim of this paper is to present a thorough analysis of a specific iterative algorithm that involves nonparametricH∞-norm estimation. The pursuedmethodology involves a novel frequency domain approach that addresses both additive stochastic disturbances and input normalization. The results of the convergence analysis are twofold: (1) the presence of additive disturbances introduces a bias in the estimation procedure, and (2) the iterative procedure can be interpreted as experiment design for H∞-norm estimation, revealing the value of iterations and limits of accuracy in terms of the Fisher information matrix. The results are confirmed by means of a simulation example. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique is applied to the problem of interpolation of data in a plane by a cubic spline function which is subject to obstacles. The obstacles may be piecewise cubic polynomials over the original knot set. A characterization result is obtained which is used to develop a Newton-type algorithm for the numerical solution.	approximation;cubic function;hilbert space;interpolation;spline (mathematics)	Lars-Erik Andersson;Tommy Elfving	1995	SIAM J.

Each iteration of the algorithm is implemented in barycentric coordinates, the number of which is equal to m. The method is based on a new procedure for finding the projection of the gradient of the objective function onto a simplicial cone in R, which is the tangent cone at the current point to the simplex defined by the usual constraints on barycentric coordinates. It is shown that this projection can be computed in O(m log m) operations. For strictly convex quadratic functions, the basic method can be refined to a noniterative method terminating with the optimal solution.	algorithm;barycentric subdivision;convex function;convex hull;geographic coordinate system;gradient;iteration;loss function;newman's lemma;optimization problem;quadratic function	Nikolai D.

The new algorithm has N/sup 2/+1 coefficients, in contrast to N/sup 2/ coefficients of the conventional algorithms. >	adaptive filter;algorithm;least mean squares filter	Sau-Gee Chen;Yung-An Kao	1994		10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408947	adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;recursive least squares filter	Vision	60.177713785096145	13.362048337040807	28928

Models of such systems are important in for example cascade control applications. The aim is to present and analyze some fundamental limitations in the quality of an identified model of a cascade system under the condition that the true subsystems have certain common dynamics. The model quality is analyzed by studying the asymptotic (large data) covariance matrix of the Prediction Error Method parameter estimate. The analysis will focus on cascade systems with three subsystems. The main result is that if the true transfer functions of the first and second subsystem are identical, the output signal information from the second and third subsystems will not affect the asymptotic variance of the estimated model of the first subsystem. This result implies that for a cascade system with two subsystems, where the dynamics of the first subsystem is a factor of the dynamics of the second one, the output signal information from the second subsystem will not improve the asymptotic quality of the estimate of the first subsystem. The results are illustrated by some simple FIR examples.	finite impulse response;transfer function	Bo Wahlberg;Håkan Hjalmarsson;Jonas Mårtensson	2009	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2009.01.020	econometrics;systems modeling;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	58.196774208046435	8.083657456972517	28972

The emphasis is on the nonlinear stability of multistep methods. It is shown that every A-stable linear multistep method with piecewise constant or linear interpolation can preserve the asymptotic stability of a class of nonlinear systems, which is an extension of the well known GP-stability result to the nonlinear case. As a comparison, it is also proved that strict stability at infinity is necessary to the asymptotic stability of one-leg methods for non-autonomous equations.	linear multistep method;nonlinear system	Chengming Huang	2008	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2008.04.003	linear stability;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;nonlinear system;calculus;delay differential equation;control theory;mathematics;circle criterion;linear multistep method;backward differentiation formula;algorithm	Theory	82.64122273896625	11.522119837600052	29040

In this paper, we generalize Kramer's theorem toN dimensions (N ≥ 1) and show how the kernel function and the sampling points in Kramer's theorem can be generated. We then investigate the relationship between this generalization of Kramer's theorem andN-dimensional versions of both the WSK theorem and the Paley-Wiener interpolation theorem for band-limited signals. It is shown that the sampling series associated with this generalization of Kramer's theorem is nothing more than anN-dimensional Lagrange-type interpolation series.		Ahmed I. Zayed	1992	Multidim.

2c820b1b1e5b20d3a44c6c6d9e687ca3ade4b447	the asymptotic stability of stable and time-autonomous discrete multidimensional behaviors		We generalize the important paper D. Napp-Avelli, P. Rapisarda, P. Rocha, ’Time-relevant stability of 2D systems’, Automatica 47(2011), 2373-2382, to discrete time-autonomous (ta) (=time-relevant), but not necessarily square-autonomous behaviors in arbitrary dimensions. This paper and therefore also the present one were essentially influenced by the papers J. Wood, V.R. Sule, E. Rogers, ’Causal and Stable Input/Output Structures on Multidimensional Behaviors’, SIAM J. Control Optim. 43(2005), 1493-1520, and J.-C. Willems, ’Stability and Quadratic Lyapunov Functions for nD Systems’, Proc. International Conference on Multidimensional (nD) Systems, Aveiro, Portugal, 2007. In the present paper the discrete domain of the independent variables is the lattice of vectors of integers of arbitrary (but fixed) length whose first component is a natural number and interpreted as a discrete time instant. The stability of an autonomous behavior is defined by a spectral condition on its characteristic variety. The behavior is time-autonomous if each trajectory is determined by a fixed number of its initial values. Under a weak additional condition a discrete stable and time-autonomous behavior is asymptotically stable in the sense that under suitable initial conditions its trajectories converge to zero when the time tends to infinity. We derive algorithms for the constructive verification of the assumptions of most of our results and in particular establish a constructive normal form of ta behaviors in arbitrary dimensions. The Fourier transform on finitely generated free abelian groups plays an important part in the derivations as it already did in the quoted papers. Stability and stabilization of multidimensional discrete behaviors were previously discussed by various colleagues, for instance by Bisiacco, Bose, Fornasini, Lin, Marchesini, Pillai, Quadrat, Rogers, Shankar, Sule, Valcher, Wood, but only partly from the analytic point of view.

A novel model is proposed to describe the random observation delays and packet dropouts, and a robust optimal fusion filter for the addressed networked multisensor fusion systems is designed using the innovation analysis method. The dimension of the designed filter is the same as that of the original system, which helps to reduce computation cost compared with the augmentation method. Moreover, robust reduced-dimension observation-fusion Kalman filters are proposed to further reduce the computation burden. Note that the designed fusion filter gain matrices can be computed off-line, as they depend only on the upper bounds of random delays and on the occurrence probabilities of delays and sensor failures. Some sufficient conditions are presented for stability and optimality of the designed fusion filters, and a steady-state fusion filter is also given for the networked multisensor fusion systems. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed fusion filters.	computation;computer simulation;kalman filter;network packet;online and offline;oracle fusion middleware;steady state	Bo Chen;Wen-an Zhang;Guoqiang Hu;Li Yu	2015	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2015.130803	kalman filter;control engineering;stochastic process;estimation;uncertainty;noise;control theory;mathematics;sensor fusion;extended kalman filter;statistics;robustness	Robotics	58.12038222764788	4.374465954347848	29276

In this paper, the analysis of mono- and multi-component signals is addressed using higher-order TFR. A computationally feasible implementation of the Wigner bispectrum and trispectrum (i.e., WHOS in the third- and fourth-order domains) is proposed considering two-dimensional slices of the time-multifrequency domain of support of WHOS. It is shown that these simplified formulations provide us with information about the evolution of higher-order spectra of a signal with similar resolution and complexity as bilinear TFRs. The problem of cross-terms cancellation is also considered by defining reduced interference distributions as extensions of the Choi-Williams distribution in the fourth-order domain. A simplified implementation, that employs only the principal slice of WHOS, is also proposed for practical purposes.		Javier Rodríguez Fonollosa;Chrysostomos L.

We then believe to have fixed the ‘denominations’ associated with Medar’s (et al.) work, up to a point of having it all matching the existing literature in the field [which precedes their work (by long)]. We also expand his work scope by introducing s1-convexity concepts to his group of definitions, which encompasses only convex and its proper extension, s2-convex, so far. This article is a long version of our previous review of Medar’s work, published by FJMS (Pinheiro, M.R.: S-convexity revisited. FJMS, 26/3, 2007).	fuzzy logic;non-convexity (economics)	M. R.

To avoid ill-posedness, a regularization term is added to the objective function; this leads to the so-called regularized TLS (RTLS) problem. A further complication arises when the matrix A and correspondingly the correction matrix must have a specific structure. This is modelled by the regularized structured TLS (RSTLS) problem. In general this problem is nonconvex and hence difficult to solve. However, the RSTLS problem arising from image deblurring applications under reflexive or periodic boundary conditions possess a special structure where all relevant matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable (SD). In this paper we introduce an algorithm for finding the global optimum of the RSTLS problem with this SD structure. The devised method is based on decomposing the problem into single variable problems and then transforming them into one-dimensional unimodal real-valued minimization problems which can be solved globally. Based on uniqueness and attainment properties of the RSTLS solution we show that a constrained version of the problem possess a strong duality result and can thus be solved via a sequence of RSTLS problems.	algorithm;deblurring;global optimization;linear system;loss function;optimization problem;periodic boundary conditions;real-time locating system;strong duality;the matrix;total least squares;transport layer security;well-posed problem	Amir Beck;Aharon Ben-Tal;Christian Kanzow	2008	SIAM J.

The first is a double-row DFE algorithm that outperforms previous approaches. Under the no-error-propagation assumption, the algorithm will perform exactly like a serially adapting DFE. The multiplication complexity of the double-row DFE algorithm is of the same order as that of the parallel DFE algorithm and the extended least-mean-square (LMS) method. The previous algorithms and the double-row DFE algorithm may become impractical to implement due to their large computational complexity, so three additional parallel implementations of the DFE, which lead to considerable hardware savings and avoid the coding loss of the former approaches, are presented. The different algorithms are compared on the basis of convergence analysis and simulation results. >		Kalavai J. Raghunath;Keshab K. Parhi	1993	IEEE Trans.

Although such amplifiers are nonlinear and distributed parameter devices, an extremum seeking design is demonstrated to be a promising approach for achieving the stated amplifier control objectives.	maxima and minima;nonlinear system;optical amplifier;raman scattering;wavelength-division multiplexing	Peter M.

The underlying algorithm is a sequential Monte Carlo method known as the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter or RBPF. In this paper, we show that the complexity of the RBPF algorithm can be reduced by applying the Kalman updating step to only one representative particle of a group particles gathering in a particular state. The time consumption for the algorithm to complete computation is substantially reduced especially for systems employing large number of particles. Simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed reduced-complexity algorithm or RC-RBPF in terms of percentage estimation errors is identical to that of the standard RBPF which in turn much better than that of the particle filtering.	algorithm;computation;particle filter;rc circuit;reduction (complexity);simulation	Peerapol Yuvapoositanon	2011	2011 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2011.6146170	quasi-monte carlo method;econometrics;mathematical optimization;hybrid monte carlo;particle filter;markov chain monte carlo;auxiliary particle filter;mathematics;monte carlo integration;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	54.39259217655985	4.496618869251069	29877

Lasry and P.-L. Lions, describe, roughly speaking, situations with large number of identical agents taking into account in their strategies the mass of the other co-players. Such model gives rise to a coupled system of PDEs, namely a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the value function of the average player coupled with a Fokker-Planck equation for the density of the players. In this talk we discuss the behavior as the time horizon tends to infinity and the convergence towards a stationary ergodic mean field game, both in case of local and nonlocal coupling in the cost functional. We also prove that convergence holds at exponential rate, and we discuss similar features occurring in the long horizon behavior of a large class of optimality systems.	aharonov–bohm effect;bellman equation;ergodicity;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;mean field particle methods;stationary process;time complexity	Pierre Cardaliaguet;Jean-Michel Lasry;Pierre-Louis Lions;Alessio Porretta	2012	NHM	10.3934/nhm.2012.7.279	mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;mathematical economics;statistics	ML	75.7435096665876	8.900465819981155	30017

In this paper, we propose a new expression of the estimates along with time-varying coordinate system. This modification can be done efficiently with additional multiplications of orthogonal complement matrices. Numerical experiments show that the modified scheme has better stability compared with the original scheme [NTY'12].	adaptive algorithm;continuation;experiment;instability;numerical stability	Kenji Kakimoto;Daichi Kitahara;Masao Yamagishi;Isao Yamada	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472466	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;generalized eigenvector	Robotics	80.21233267932904	21.2715360119838	30041

The core idea is to recast each optimisation subproblem, present in the hierarchy, as a multi-parametric programming problem, with parameters being the optimisation variables belonging to the remaining subproblems. This then transforms the multilevel problem into single-level linear/convex optimisation problems. For decentralised systems, where more than one optimisation problem is present at each level of the hierarchy, Nash equilibrium is considered. A three person dynamic optimisation problem is presented to illustrate the mathematical developments.	mathematical optimization;parametric programming	Nuno P. Faísca;Pedro M.

The directivity patterns are obtained by optimizing a cost function which is a convex combination of a front-back energy ratio and uniformity within a frontal sector of interest. Most of the standard directivity patterns - omnidirectional, cardioid, subcardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid - are particular solutions of this optimization problem with specific values of two free parameters: the angular width of the frontal sector and the convex combination factor. More general solutions of practical use are obtained by varying these two parameters. Many of these optimal directivity patterns are trigonometric polynomials with complex roots. A new differential array structure that enables the implementation of general higher order directivity patterns, with complex or real roots, is then proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed design framework and the implementation structure are illustrated by design examples, simulations, and measurements.	angularjs;circuit complexity;coefficient;loss function;mathematical optimization;microphone;optimization problem;radiation pattern;simulation;trigonometric polynomial;weight function;white noise	Enzo De Sena;Hüseyin Hacihabiboglu;Zoran Cvetkovic	2012	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2011.2159204	speech recognition;acoustics;computer science;signal processing;speech processing;mathematics;beamforming	Visualization	62.75004950779353	17.532877271892545	30151

Unfortunately, this generality comes at a price, the calculation of such solutions is typically intractible for systems with more than moderate state space size due to the curse of dimensionality. This work combines recent results in the structure of the HJB, and its reduction to a linear Partial Differential Equation (PDE), with methods based on low rank tensor representations, known as a separated representations, to address the curse of dimensionality. The result is an algorithm to solve optimal control problems which scales linearly with the number of states in a system, and is applicable to systems that are nonlinear with stochastic forcing in finite-horizon, average cost, and first-exit settings. The method is demonstrated on inverted pendulum, VTOL aircraft, and quadcopter models, with system dimension two, six, and twelve respectively.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;bellman equation;control theory;curse of dimensionality;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;inverted pendulum;jacobi method;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;optimal control;state space;stochastic process	Matanya B.

When the state-space and the generator are known a priori, the best estimator of /spl alpha/(t) (in terms of mean square error) under noisy observation is the classical Wonham filter. This note addresses the estimation issue when values of the state-space or values of the generator are unknown a priori. In each case, we propose a (suboptimal) filter and prove its convergence to the desired Wonham filter under simple conditions. Moreover, we obtain the rate of convergence using both the mean square and the higher moment error bounds.	kalman filter;markov chain;mean squared error;rate of convergence;state space	Xingjie Guo;George Yin	2006	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2005.864192	econometrics;markov chain;mathematical optimization;convergence;state space;continuous-time markov chain;technical report;approximation;mathematics;mean squared error;markov process;rate of convergence;statistics	ML	57.15982022645973	8.32449638346566	30503

Actually it is a diffusion process evolving in a 2D assets space, where the first asset is the commodity's spot price and the second asset is the convenience yield. By applying semi-discretization and a finite differences scheme this multi-asset PDE is transformed into a state-space model consisting of ordinary nonlinear differential equations. For the local subsystems, into which the commodities PDE is decomposed, it becomes possible to apply boundary-based feedback control. The controller design proceeds by showing that the state-space model of the commodities PDE stands for a differentially flat system. Next, for each subsystem which is related to a nonlinear ODE, a virtual control input is computed, that can invert the subsystem's dynamics and can eliminate the subsystem's tracking error. From the last row of the state-space description, the control input (boundary condition) that is actually applied to the multi-factor commodities' PDE system is found. This control input contains recursively all virtual control inputs which were computed for the individual ODE subsystems associated with the previous rows of the state-space equation. Thus, by tracing the rows of the state-space model backwards, at each iteration of the control algorithm, one can finally obtain the control input that should be applied to the commodities PDE system so as to assure that all its state variables will converge to the desirable setpoints.	aggregate data;algorithm;black–scholes model;converge;discretization;feedback;finite difference;iteration;nonlinear system;open dynamics engine;recursion;semiconductor industry;state space	Gerasimos G.

A method for estimating the delay of the signal received at two separated sensors in a system identification approach has been developed. The inaccurately known parameter (the time delay) forms a part of the state vector of EKF, which is used to recursively estimate the DOA. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of this method to estimate DOA both for narrow band and broadband signals, to a reasonable degree of convergence.	direction of arrival;extended kalman filter	K.

The system consists of a linear FIR (finite impulse response) subsystem of known order, followed by a nonlinear function with a known parametrization structure. The parameters of both linear and nonlinear parts are unknown. Input design, identification algorithms, and their essential properties are presented under the assumptions that the distribution function of the noise is known and the nonlinearity is continuous and invertible. It is shown that under scaled periodic inputs, identification of Wiener systems can be decomposed into a finite number of core identification problems. The concept of joint identifiability of the core problem is introduced to capture the essential conditions under which the Wiener system can be identified with binary-valued observations. Under scaled full-rank conditions and joint identifiability, a strongly convergent algorithm is constructed. The algorithm is shown to be asymptotically efficient for the core identification problem, hence achieving asymptotic optimality in its convergence rate. For computational simplicity, recursive algorithms are also developed. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The most straightforward approach computes X ∈ Rm×n from the solution of an mn×mn linear system, typically limiting the feasible values of m,n to a few hundreds at most. Our new approach exploits the fact that X can often be well approximated by a low-rank matrix. It combines greedy low-rank techniques with Galerkin projection and preconditioned gradients. In turn, only linear systems of size m × m and n × n need to be solved. Moreover these linear systems inherit the sparsity of the coefficient matrices, which allows to address linear matrix equations as large as m = n = O(10). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well for generalized Lyapunov equations. Even for the case of standard Lyapunov equations our methods can be advantageous, as we do not need to assume that C has low rank.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;experiment;galerkin method;gradient;greedy algorithm;iterative method;linear system;low-rank approximation;lyapunov fractal;numerical linear algebra;numerical partial differential equations;preconditioner;solver;sparse matrix	Daniel Kressner;Petar Sirkovic	2015	Numerical Lin.

The emphasis is on high-noise applications, in particular, for which the clean signal is contaminated with 100% or more noise (signal to noise ratio less than or equal to zero). We discuss conventional methods, and suggest a new method based on time delay embedding using coordinates generated by local low-pass filtering, which we call a low-pass embedding. The singular value decomposition can then be used locally in embedding space to distinguish between the dynamics and the noise. Conventional algorithms and the proposed new algorithm are evaluated for chaotic signals generated by the Lorenz and Rossler systems, to which Gaussian white noise has been added.© (1992) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The paper described a design of the proposed nonorthogonal Meixner filter, numerically stable algorithm to optimize the filter parameters, as well as the results of computer experiments corroborating efficiency of the nonorthogonal Meixner filters for solution of practical problems.

A ‘nonparametric’ Box-Jenkins approach is studied: the parametric noise model is replaced by a nonparametric model that is obtained in a preprocessing step, and this without any user interaction. The major advantage for the user is that i) one method can be used to replace the classical ARX, ARMAX, OE, and Box-Jenkins models; ii) no noise model order should be selected. This makes the identification much easier to use for a wider public; iii) a bias on the plant model does not create a bias on the noise model. The disadvantage of the proposed nonparametric approach is a small loss in efficiency with respect to the optimal parametric choice. These results are illustrated on a series of well selected problems.	arx;complex systems;dynamical system;jenkins;jenkins–traub algorithm;maxima and minima;preprocessor;soft-in soft-out decoder;thinking outside the box;usability	Johan Schoukens;Yves Rolain;Gerd Vandersteen;Rik Pintelon	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160204	identification;linear dynamical system;econometrics;system identification;interpolation;engineering;noise measurement;noise;time series;control theory;mathematics;linear system;frequency domain;statistics;box–jenkins;polynomial	Robotics	57.63061015930938	7.771019063646173	31000

For each value of c spaced regularly in a rectangular region of the complex plane, an initial complex number z0 (usually 0) is iterated using the equation z' = f ( z ) + c until either (a) the value of z goes outside the radius-2 circle centered at the origin (which means that the point is being attracted to infinity), or (b) the number of iterations reaches some arbitrary limit N. Denote by V the number of iterations required to satisfy either (a) or (b). The V values for all points in the region form a rectangular array of integers, where each integer is a measure of the """"velocity"""" with which each point is being attracted to infinity. Such arrays, usually displayed using a different color for each possible value 1 N, yield complex and beautiful pictures. The problem of how to represent these numerical arrays pictorially has, however, received relatively little attention. This is surprising, since the artistic and scientific value of the pictures produced depends heavily on the choices used in the integer-topixel mapping.

These methods approximate the nonlinear function by a quadratic polynomial, and a trust-region radius determines the size of the sphere in which the quadratic approximation of the nonlinear function is deemed to be accurate. The trust-region radius has to be computed repeatedly during the minimization process. Each trust-region radius is computed by determining a zero of a nonlinear function ψ(x). This is often done with Newton’s method or a variation thereof. These methods give quadratic convergence of the computed approximations of the trust-region radius. This paper describes a cubically convergent zero-finder that is based on the observation that the second derivative ψ ′′ ( x ) $\psi ^{\prime \prime }(x)$ can be evaluated inexpensively when the first derivative ψ ′ ( x ) $\psi ^{\prime }(x)$ is known. Computed examples illustrate the performance of the zero-finder proposed.	approximation algorithm;computation;maxima and minima;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;polynomial;quadratic function;rate of convergence;trust region	Maged Alkilayh;Lothar Reichel;Jin Yun Yuan	2016	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-016-0260-2	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics;geometry;statistics;algebra	Vision	79.66785665223014	17.664494944257473	31252

Outre l'existence des trames, nous etudions les techniques de calcul des trames duales basees sur ces nouvelles conditions. Les conditions equivalentes facilitent l'analyse theorique des trames. En pratique, une formulation simple est souhaitable pour l'implementation. Sur la base de ces conditions equivalentes, nous presentons deux methodes pratiques pour verifier qu'un ensemble constitue une trame et pour calculer la trame duale: la methode determinante de Gram (GD) et la methode de la function simili-bi-orthogonale (BLF). Les principales caracteristiques de la methode GD sont une plus grande rapidite de calcul par rapport aux methodes traditionnelles, la possibilite d'exprimer la trame duale au moyen d'un petit nombre de coefficients et l'affranchissement de l'estimation des limites de trames par rapport a la condition usuelle. Une des contributions majeures de cet article est la decouverte qu'un ensemble de fonctions obtenu par translation et modulation d'une seule fonction dans le cas d'un surechantillonnage constitue une trame si et seulement si un ensemble similaire pour la meme fonction satisfait une condition de bi-orthogonalite dans le cas d'un sous-echantillonnage.

It allows finding the optimal number of basis functions for describing array steering vectors, according to the manifold separation principle. The proposed solution does not require heuristic design parameters and achieves asymptotically optimal (in the MSE sense) modeling of array nonidealities from calibration measurements. The normalized minimum description length (nMDL) is extended to complex-valued data and employed to choosing the optimal number of modes in the orthogonal decomposition of the array steering vector. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the more recent exponentially embedded family (EEF) rules are employed as well, along with convenient expressions to the problem at hand. Extensive simulations using a real-world antenna array are included and the various order selection rules are compared. The results illustrate that the nMDL is a consistent estimator of the optimal number of modes and has a performance close to the minimum mean-squared error.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;basis function;bayesian information criterion;coefficient;embedded system;heuristic;mean squared error;minimum description length;polarimetry;polarization (waves);rate of convergence;selection rule;separation principle;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Mário Costa;Andreas Richter;Visa Koivunen	2011	2011 Conference Record of the Forty Fifth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers (ASILOMAR)	10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190079	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;sensor array;statistics	Robotics	55.19855140948791	9.13749894034979	31464

Roughly speaking, the error bound of a system of inequalities is said to be stable if all its “small” perturbations admit a (local or global) error bound. We first establish subdifferential characterizations of the stability of error bounds for semi-infinite systems of convex inequalities. By applying these characterizations, we extend some results established by Azé & Corvellec [3] on the sensitivity analysis of Hoffman constants to semi-infinite linear constraint systems.

First, we introduce the second order model with disturbance for agent. The network topology among agents is undirected and connected, and information of reference is allowed to be available to at least one agent. Second, we propose the control law consists of graph theory, consensus algorithm and RISE. Graph theory and consensus algorithm are utilized to converge the states of agents to reference value, and RISE is utilized to suppress the disturbance. Then, we show the proposed control law guarantees the agents achieve synchronization, and derive the condition to achieve the control objective. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control law.	agent-based model;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;consensus dynamics;converge;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;network topology;optimal control;simulation	Yoshihiro Tachibana;Toru Namerikawa	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963030	computer science;control theory;graph theory;control engineering;robustness (computer science);network topology;synchronization;multi-agent system;convergence (routing);distributed computing	ML	64.08755415582031	5.403345018328306	31568

In the situation where no measurements are available the filter works as an uncertainty propagator. The most computationally demanding part of the Kalman filter is to propagate the covariance through the dynamical system, which may be completely infeasible in high-dimensional models. The reduced rank square-root (RRSQRT) filter is a special formulation of the Kalman filter for large-scale applications. In this formulation, the covariance matrix of the model state is expressed in a limited number of modes M. In the classical implementation of the RRSQRT filter the computational costs of the truncation step grow very fast with the number of modes (>M^3). In this work, a new approach based on the Lanzcos algorithm is formulated. It provides a more cost-efficient scheme and includes a precision coefficient that can be tuned for specific applications depending on the trade-off between precision and computational load.	kalman filter;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation	Dimitri Treebushny;Henrik Madsen	2005	Future Generation Comp.

The idea is thatmultiple agents track the average of multiple time-varying input signals, each of which is available to only one agent, under local interaction with neighbors. We consider two cases. First, a distributed algorithm and filter are proposed, where each agent needs its own and neighbors’ filter outputs obtained through communication besides its local relative positions and its input signal, input velocity and input acceleration. Here, the requirement for either absolute or relative velocity measurements is removed. The algorithm is robust to initialization errors and can deal with a wide class of input signals with bounded deviations in input signals, input velocities, and input accelerations. Second, a distributed algorithm and filter are proposed to remove the requirement for communication. Here, each agent needs to measure the relative positions between itself and its neighbors and its own velocity. However, the requirement for relative velocity measurements between the agent and its neighbors is removed. The algorithm is robust to initialization errors and can deal with the case, where the input signals, input velocities and input accelerations are all bounded. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We first rewrite the multi-agent systems into the corresponding reduced-order systems based on the graph theory and the reduced-order transformation. Then, the linear matrix inequality approach is used to consider the consensus of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with time-varying delays in directed networks. As a result, sufficient conditions for consensus and H∞ consensus of heterogeneous multi-agent systems in terms of linear matrix inequalities are established in the cases of fixed and switching topologies. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	computer simulation;consensus (computer science);cultural consensus theory;first-order predicate;graph theory;linear matrix inequality;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;rewrite (programming);social inequality	Beibei Wang;Yuangong Sun	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17063631	consensus;linear matrix inequality;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	AI	65.04110238889187	5.08917765899049	31681

This scheme reduces initial multidimensional problem to a set of univariate subproblems connected recursively. That enables to apply efficient univariate algorithms for solving the multidimensional problems. The nested optimization scheme served as the source of many methods for optimization of Lipschitzian function. However, in all of them there is the problem of estimating the Lipschitz constant as the parameter of the function optimized and, as a consequence, of tuning to it the optimization method. In the methods proposed earlier, as a rule, a global estimate (related to whole search domain) is used whereas local Lipschitz constants in some subdomains can differ significantly from the global constant. It can slow down the optimization process considerably. To overcome this drawback in the article the finer estimates of a priori unknown Lipschitz constants taking into account local properties of the objective function are considered and used in the nested optimization scheme. The results of numerical experiments presented demonstrate the advantages of methods with mixed (local and global) estimates of Lipschitz constants in comparison with the use of the global ones only.	algorithm;coupling constant;dimensionality reduction;experiment;global optimization;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;performance tuning;program optimization;recursion	Victor P.

This paper has the following contributions toward this problem. The leader-following consensus problem in hybrid varying directed topology is first addressed, and an online leader switching method is proposed, which reduces the dependence on some global conditions and the connectivity assumptions on the selection of leaders. Second, we generalize the Lipschitz condition and the combined condition of one-sided Lipschitz and quadratically inner-boundedness conditions to a new generalized linear incremental condition, which gives us a more generalized result in the Lyapunov proof and better performance in simulation. Third, an observer-based consensus protocol is constructed with two sufficient observability and controllability conditions and two optimal control design algorithms. Finally, an example of teleoperating multirobotic manipulator joint network is provided to illustrate the performance improvement by comparing with the existing results.	algorithm;anatomy, regional;consensus (computer science);increment;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;reflections of signals on conducting lines;simulation	Yang Cao;Liangyin Zhang;Chanying Li;Michael Z.

The problem may involve a very large number of potential bars so as to allow a rich variety of topologies. The original formulation is in terms of two sets of variables: m bar volumes and n nodal displacements. Several equivalent convex reformulations of this problem are presented. These convex problems, although highly nonlinear, possess nice analytical structure, and therefore can be solved by an interior point potential reduction method associated with appropriate logarithmic barrier for the feasible domain of the problem. For this method, to improve the accuracy of the current a proximate solution by an absolute constant factor, it suffices in the worst case to perform $O( \sqrt{km} )$ Newton steps with $O( k^3 n^3 + k^2 n^2 m )$ operations per step.	time complexity	Aharon Ben-Tal;Arkadi Nemirovski	1994	SIAM Journal on Optimization	10.1137/0804033	time complexity;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;convex optimization;interior point method;mathematics;geometry	EDA	74.66490131527338	27.228611343895746	31901

While the algorithm is stable in the mean square and l2-sense for time-invariant matrices, the treatment of time-variant matrices requires additional approximations. These approximations are discarded in this paper which allows us to analyse the robustness in terms of l2-stability for actually time-variant matrix step-sizes. This provides important results, as the algorithm in its variants also occurs in other fields of adaptive filtering such as cascaded filter structures. By simulations as well as by theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in general, even small variations of the matrix step-size are sufficient for the algorithm to loose its robustness. Only in special cases, where specific constraints are imposed additionally, robustness can be guaranteed.	adaptive filter;algorithm;approximation;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;numerical analysis;robustness (computer science);simulation;the matrix;time-invariant system	Robert Dallinger;Markus Rupp	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638754	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;non-linear iterative partial least squares;stability;computer science;mathematics;statistics;recursive least squares filter	Robotics	60.13803138205766	12.379752760353233	32019

Four types of multifractional processes are synthesised to test the tracking performance and robustness of these 12 sliding-windowed Hurst estimators. They are (i) noise-free multifractional process; (ii) multifractional process corrupted by 30-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) white Gaussian noise; (iii) multifractional process corrupted by 30-dB SNR impulse noise; and (iv) multifractional stable process, which has no finite second-order statistics. Furthermore, the standard error of different sliding-windowed Hurst estimators are calculated in order to quantify the accuracy and robustness. This study provides a guideline and principle in the selection of Hurst estimators for noise-free multifractional process, noise-corrupted multifractional process and multifractional process with infinite second-order statistics. The results of this analysis show that the sliding-windowed Kettani and Gubner's method provides the best-tracking performance for multifractional processes with linear trend local Holder exponent and good robustness to noise.

The variational Bayes (VB) procedure is used to restore conjugacy. The resulting Bayesian recursive identification procedure has many of the desirable computational properties of the classical RLS procedure. During each time-step, an iterative variational EM (VEM) procedure is required to obtain the necessary moments. The procedure is used to reconstruct an outlier-corrupted AR process and a noisy speech segment. The VB scheme appears to offer improved performance over the related quasi-Bayes (QB) scheme in the case of time-variant component weights.	autoregressive model;burst noise;calculus of variations;computation;convex conjugate;em (typography);expectation–maximization algorithm;filter bank;gnutella2;international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing;iterative method;online and offline;quickbasic;recursion;recursive least squares filter;speech processing;variational principle	Václav Smídl;Anthony Quinn	2005	Proceedings.

Parameters in S-systems contain important biological information and yet can not be obtained directly from experiments. Therefore, the parameter estimation methods are a choice to estimate parameters in S-systems. However, the parameter estimation for this model turns out to be a complex nonlinear optimization problem. A novel method, alternating weighted least squares (AWLS), is proposed in this paper to estimate the parameters in S-systems. The fast deterministic AWLS method takes advantage of the special structure of the S-system model and reduces solving the nonlinear optimization problem into alternately solving weighed least squares problems which have analytical solutions. The effectiveness of AWLS is demonstrated by the simulation studies and the results show that the AWLS outperforms the existing alternating regression method.	algorithmic efficiency;alternating turing machine;biological system;computation;estimation theory;experiment;hessian;lasso;least squares;mass action law (electronics);mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation	Li-Zhi Liu;Fang-Xiang Wu;Wen-Jun Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE 6th International Conference on Systems Biology (ISB)	10.1109/ISB.2012.6314104	generalized least squares;total least squares;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;non-linear least squares;estimation theory;least squares;nonlinear regression;statistics	Robotics	64.16505145362498	12.640274244041803	32238

In particular, in applications involving mobile sensor networks and multiagent systems, a great new challenge is the development of distributed motion algorithms that guarantee connectivity of the overall network. Motivated by the inherently discrete nature of graphs as combinatorial objects, we address this challenge using a key control decomposition. First, connectivity control of the network structure is performed in the  discrete  space of graphs and relies on local estimates of the network topology used, along with algebraic graph theory, to verify link deletions with respect to connectivity. Tie breaking, when multiple such link deletions can violate connectivity, is achieved by means of gossip algorithms and distributed market-based control. Second, motion control is performed in the  continuous  configuration space, where nearest-neighbor potential fields are used to maintain existing links in the network. Integration of the earlier controllers results in a distributed, multiagent, hybrid system, for which we show that the resulting motion always ensures connectivity of the network, while it reconfigures toward certain secondary objectives. Our approach can also account for communication time delays as well as collision avoidance and is illustrated in nontrivial computer simulations.		Michael M. Zavlanos;George J.

Examples of such models have been given in [8], which also includes the systems considered here. In particular, models for systems with delay in the control occur in the study of gaspressurized bipropellant rocket systems, in population models and in some complex economic systems [3]. More specifically, models for systems with distributed delays in the control occur in the study of agricultural economics [2] and in population dynamics [1]. We shall consider the nonlinear systems which are perturbations of linear systems. Using the measure of noncompactness of a set and Darbo's fixed point theorem, controllability of nonlinear systems with implicit derivative has been studied by Dacka [4]. In [5] Dacka has extended the method to other types of nonlinear systems with delays in control and implicit derivative. Controllability of nonlinear systems with distributed delays in control has been considered by Klamka [6, 7], with the aid of Schauder's fixed point theorem. In this paper we shall examine the controllability of nonlinear systems with distributed delays in control and implicit derivative by the method of Dacka.	fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point theorem;linear system;nonlinear system;population dynamics	Krishnan Balachandran;D.

abaeb8dde3f7b2ebb202d1b789e301952c165b35	characterization of several classes of second-order odes by using differential invariants	second order;differential invariant	The classical theory of differential invariants for second-order ODEs (e.g., see [24, 25, 36, 37, 39, 52, 53]) has experienced a notable development in the last decade. It is due to the interest of its geometric applications (see [2, 14, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 34, 35, 42, 45, 49]) and, very specially, due to the new computational aspects of that theory in applying it to a wide class problems, such as symmetries, conservation laws, order reduction; for example, see [3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 29, 30, 31, 32, 38, 43, 44, 48, 50]. The goal of this paper is to characterize several classes of second-order ODEs by using differential invariants with respect to the subgroups of horizontal and vertical transformations of the plane, which are defined and studied in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 below. Basically, the method supplies a criterion to know whether a given second-order ordinary differential equation can be put, after a change of variables belonging to one of the two groups under consideration, into a specific normal form. In each case, the criterion reduces to check the vanishing of several algebraic expressions written in terms of differential invariants and, hence, we can recognize whether a concrete equation belongs to a specific normal form by simply running an algorithm in polynomial time. The problem of characterization of ordinary differential equations has been tackled by some authors in the last decades (see, e.g., [5, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 34, 35]). All these works are based on the Cartan’s equivalence method, as well as Tresse’s original papers, and their solutions rely also on differential invariants, which derive from their own theory. Nevertheless, in this paper we propose a rather different approximation to this problem: we calculate explicitly the basis of differential invariants (of each order), and starting from them we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the reduction. The proposed method is applied to five classes of second-order ODEs: autonomous differential equations, equations of the second homogeneous type (as defined in [33]), special equations, Painlevé	algorithm;approximation;autonomous robot;computation;linear algebra;polynomial;time complexity;turing completeness	Ángel Martín del Rey;Jaime Muñoz Masqué	2005	Int.

Unlike most existing nonconvex optimization techniques, the RE algorithm is not based on either stochastic or multi-point searches, therefore, it can achieve fast global optimization. Moreover, the RE algorithm is easy to implement and successful in high-dimensional optimization. The RE algorithm exhibits excellent empirical performance in terms of k-means clustering, point-set registration, optimized product quantization, and blind image deblurring.	algorithm;cluster analysis;deblurring;global optimization;k-means clustering;least squares;mathematical optimization;point set registration	Daiki Ikami;Toshihiko Yamasaki;Kiyoharu Aizawa	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	10.1109/CVPR.2017.762	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;meta-optimization;mathematics	Vision	76.31550434805362	24.293777408028856	32332

In this paper, weighted average consensus with respect to a monotonic function, which means that the trajectories of the monotonic function along the state of each agent reach the weighted average of their initial values, is studied for a group of kinematic agents with time-varying topology. By constructing a continuous nonlinear distributed protocol, such a consensus problem can be solved in finite time even though the time-varying topology involves unconnected graphs. Then the distributed protocol is employed to compute the maximum-likelihood estimation of unknown parameters over sensor networks. Compared with the existing results, the estimate scheme proposed here may reduce the costs of data communication, storage memory, book-keeping and computational overheads.

Furthermore, if the matrices are circulant, then the QCQP can be equivalently reformulated as a linear program, which can be solved very efficiently.

258d4ebc35e6a18d505121d3d713695fd45bb396	self-adaptive conjugate method for a robust and efficient performance measure approach for reliability-based design optimization		The advanced mean value and hybrid mean value methods are commonly used to evaluate the probabilistic constraint of reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems. These iterative methods can yield unstable solutions to highly nonlinear performance functions. The conjugate gradient analysis (CGA) and modified chaos control (MCC) algorithms have recently been employed to achieve the stabilization of reliability analysis in RBDO problems. However, the CGA and the MCC methods can be inefficient for convex performance functions. In this paper, a self-adaptive conjugate gradient (SCG) method is proposed to improve the efficiency of the minimum performance target point (MPTP) search based on an adaptive conjugate scalar factor for highly nonlinear concave and convex problems. With this aim, the conjugate search direction is adaptively computed using the mean value of the previous performance function with a limited conjugate scalar factor. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed SCG algorithm are compared with those of different reliability methods using five nonlinear concave/convex reliability problems and two mathematical/structural RBDO examples. The results indicate that the SCG method accurately converges after less iterations compared to other existing reliability methods. The SCG method is a robust iterative formula for inverse reliability analysis and RBDO.	algorithm;chaos control;concave function;conjugate gradient method;control theory;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system	Behrooz Keshtegar;Shahrizan Baharom;Ahmed El-Shafie	2017	Engineering with Computers	10.1007/s00366-017-0529-7	robustness (computer science);scalar (physics);mathematical optimization;iterative method;conjugate;mathematics;nonlinear system;conjugate gradient method;nonlinear conjugate gradient method;control theory;conjugate residual method	EDA	78.86981436304104	26.357831517758004	32617

At the transmitter end, two different chaotic systems are coupled and used to construct a new hyperchaotic system. One of the outputs of the hyperchaotic system is used as a carrier for the encrypted data. At the receiving end, the discrete-time Regularized Least Square (RLS) estimator is used to reconstruct the chaotic signal and hence retrieve the encoded data. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	chaos theory;encryption;recursive least squares filter;secure communication;simulation;transmitter	Mohamed Fahim Hassan	2015	2015 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon) Proceedings	10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116739	computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;distributed computing	Embedded	59.71723457751102	5.212172097079166	32761

The functional, to be extremized, combines energy concentration measures using a weighting function in the spatial domain, multiplicative weights in the spectral domain, and a total energy constraint. This leads to two formulations of the signal design problem on the 2-sphere, one a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain and the other an infinite matrix equation in the spectral domain. The framework is illustrated by deriving the key equations for the two classical spatio-spectral concentration problems on the 2-sphere, and for an isotropic filter design that maximizes the filtered energy. In addition, using the proposed framework, we formulate a joint 3-D beamforming application which achieves optimal directivity and spatial resolution simultaneously.	beamforming;calculus of variations;filter design;stationary process;variational principle;weight function;whole earth 'lectronic link	Liying Wei;Rodney A.

More precisely, we shall develop a quadrature method for the approximation of the 1-D PSWFs. Then, we extend this method to the construction of the 2-D PSWFs that are concentrated on the unit disk. Also, we give a brief review of the quality of approximation of almost band-limited functions by the 1-D PSWFs. Moreover, we use some numerical tests to compare between PSWFs and wavelets as signal processing tools. In particular, we give some numerical tests that highlight the efficiency of the PSWFs in processing band-limited signals.	prolate spheroidal wave function	Abderrazek Karoui	2011	J.

Since then FB theory has grown to include FBs with more than two channels, tree-structured FBs etc. A rich theory for the design and implementation of FBs exists. Wavelets were originally developed as an alternative to the STFT for non-stationary signal analysis [26]. Since then it has been realized that this is one of several techniques for decomposition of non-stationary signals into time-frequency (TF) atoms. FBs and these TF decompositions (one discrete-time and the other continuous-time) are closely related theoretically and practically. This paper explores this relationship.	filter bank;short-time fourier transform;signal processing;speech coding;stationary process;tf–idf;wavelet	Ramesh A. Gopinath;C.

In particular, the leaders’ control inputs are nonzero, bounded, and not available to any follower. Based on the relative states among neighbouring agents, a discontinuous adaptive protocol is first proposed to ensure that the containment errors of each follower converge to zero asymptotically, i.e. the states of the followers asymptotically converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. To eliminate the chattering effect caused by the discontinuous protocol, a continuous adaptive protocol is further designed based on the boundary layer technique and the σ-modification technique. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.	multi-agent system;nonlinear system	Ping Wang;Yingmin Jia	2015	Int. J.

64e9b83e6cf1025f4dda809b8431a96bce78e14d	noise covariances estimation for kalman filter tuning		Abstract   Kalman filter tuning is based on process and measurement noise covariances that are parameters of Riccati equation. Based on the Riccati equation solution, Kalman gain is calculated and further used for state estimator. Noise covariances are generally not known. Several methods have been published since 70s. The latest methods and their modifications were published in 2005 and later.  In many parts of technical science the Bayesian approach can be used for various estimation problems. However many scientists and researchers a priori consider Bayesian principles to be unpractical because in most cases it is very difficult to work with probabilities or likelihood functions. The probability or likelihood functions cannot be solved analytically for most problems. In this paper we will discuss the performance of some published methods and compare them with the maximum likelihood approach using numerical methods. The key goal is to demonstrate quality of maximum likelihood approach that can effectivelly use information from given data. A very simple algorithm demonstrates using maximum likelihood approach for noise covariances estimation of a scalar system.	kalman filter	Peter Matisko;Vladimir Havlena	2010		10.3182/20100826-3-TR-4015.00009	econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics	Robotics	56.396382209068726	5.650217134771316	33187

The main focus is on the analysis of second-order characteristics of spline signals, i.e. auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions and sequences are calculated. The signal analysis as well as synthesis steps are analyzed and an algorithm for estimating the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions and sequences is derived.	spline (mathematics)	André Neubauer	2004	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2004.05.012	spline interpolation;econometrics;speech recognition;cross-correlation;signal processing;mathematics;thin plate spline;m-spline;statistics	ML	56.360949527265504	15.10363878751563	33204

To obtain accurate theoretical results for the APA, we here consider the dependency between the weight-error vector and past noise in the mean-square analysis presented by Shin and Sayed in [“Mean-square performance of a family of affine projection algorithms,” IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 52, no. 1, pp. 90-102, January 2004]. Through this work, we can also theoretically analyze the behavior of the periodic APA, which updates its weights periodically.

290837377ce9871ad0b0f0229668800450eaf421	implicit surrogate models for trust region based methods		Abstract In this paper, theoretical and practical aspects of Taylor based surrogate models for trust region (TR) optimization are discussed. We propose two surrogate models: one of them based on convex combinations of first order Taylor polynomials while the other one is based on that of quadratic Taylor expansions. During optimization steps of TR methods, the proposed models are built as follows: samples from the cost function are taken about the current solution and then, a linear or a quadratic Taylor polynomial is built about each sampled point. All Taylor expansions are convexly combined by using radial basis functions in order to propose a surrogate model for the optimization step. Theoretically, we prove that, the proposed models are fully linear or fully quadratic depending on whether they are built based on convex combinations of linear or quadratic Taylor expansions, respectively. This guaranties that, regardless the initial guess of the iterative process, the optimization method will converge to local solutions where at least first order optimality conditions are satisfied. Discussions on how to solve the surrogate optimization problems among iterations are presented as well. Experimental results are carried out making use of a sequential data assimilation problem. The results reveal that, the use of our proposed models in such context can improve the quality of analysis states in terms of root-mean-square-error values while uncertainties can be decreased across different assimilation cycles.	trust region	Elias D.

Using this approach a new filtering method for distributed parameter systems is developed, for estimating option prices variations without knowledge of initial conditions. The proposed filtering method is the so-called Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter and is based on a decomposition of the nonlinear partial-differential equation of the financial system into a set of ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Next, each one of the local models associated with the ordinary differential equations is written in the linear canonical form through a transformation which is based on differential flatness theory. This transformation provides a model of the nonlinear dynamics of the option pricing model for which state estimation is possible by applying the standard Kalman Filter recursion. Based on the obtained state estimate, validation of the Black-Scholes PDE model can be performed and the existence of inconsistent parameters in the Black-Scholes PDE model can be concluded.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;black–scholes model;discretization;experiment;initial condition;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;recursion;simulation;volatility	Gerasimos G.

Both the Mosquito and human populations are divided into susceptible and infective class. Susceptible class of mosquito population is further divided into mature and immature. The model is analyzed by using stability theory of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Basic reproduction ratio is derived which is found to be the decreasing function of maturation delay and larvicidal activity. In addition, it is observed that biting rate of mosquito, transmission efficiency of parasitic infection from infective human to mosquito and critical value of maturation delay are the key parameters determining the stability switch in the system.

7e3656f3337852048ef016f38d27fa6bcebdcea4	infinitely divisible matrices		Assembling natural numbers in such nice patterns often has interesting consequences, and so it is in this case. Each of the aforementioned matrices is endowed with positive definiteness of a very high order: for every positive real number r the matrices with entries a-, b-, c-, and dare positive semidefinite. This special property is called infinite divisibility and is the subject of this paper. Positive semidefinite matrices arise in diverse contexts: calculus (Hessians at minima of functions), statistics (correlation matrices), vibrating systems (stiffness matrices), quantum mechanics (density matrices), harmonic analysis (positive definite functions), to name just a few. Many of the test matrices used by numerical analysts are positive definite. One of the interests of this paper might be the variety of examples that are provided in it. The general theorems and methods presented in the context of these examples are, in fact, powerful techniques that could be used elsewhere. In this introductory section we begin with the basic definitions and notions related to positive semidefinite matrices.

The L2 norm of the error vector e is taken as a performance index to measure this kind of synchronizability. For the equilibrium synchronization case, it is shown that there is a close relationship between the L2 norm of the error vector e and the H2 norm of the transfer function G of the linearized network about the equilibrium point. Consequently, the effect of the network coupling topology on the H2 norm of the transfer function G is analyzed. Finally, an optimal controller is designed, according to the so-called LQR problem in modern control theory, which can drive the whole network to its equilibrium point and meanwhile minimize the L2 norm of the output of the linearized network.	apollonian network;complex network;control theory;numerical analysis;optimal control;overshoot (signal);stationary process;transfer function	Chao Liu;Zhisheng Duan;Guanrong Chen;Lin Huang	2007	CoRR			ML	65.73728133482237	4.792051015146815	33598

In contrast with its predictor-corrector counterpart proposed by Miao, the method does not depend on the handicap κ of the problem. The method has O((1 + κ)√nL)-iteration complexity, the same as Miao’s method, but our error estimates are sightly better. The algorithm is quadratically convergent for problems having a strictly complementary solution. We also present a family of infeasible higher order corrector-predictor methods that are superlinearly convergent even in the absence of strict complementarity. The algorithms of this class are globally convergent for general positive starting points. They have O((1 + κ)√nL)-iteration complexity for feasible, or “almost feasible”, starting points and O((1 + κ)2nL)-iteration complexity for “sufficiently large” infeasible starting points.	algorithm;complementarity theory;complexity;kerrison predictor;linear complementarity problem;predictor–corrector method;rate of convergence	Filiz Gürtuna;Cosmin G.

Guidelines for efficient approach for evaluation of the KF performance optimality and sensitivity analysis are presented. Performance degradation due to uncertainty in process and measurement noise statistics is discussed. Consistency check between the filter-calculated covariances versus actual mean square errors are provided, which can be used not only as a verification procedure for the filtering correctness, but also as a approach for making trade-off in designing a suitable Kalman filter. In addition to numerical algorithms, useful Matlab programs are accompanied where necessary to the readers for getting better insight in practical implementation. Exploration of the behaviour of some innovation based parameters useful in adaptive filter and system integrity designs, including covariance of innovation sequence, degree of mismatch (DOM), and degree of divergence (DOD), etc., is also involved. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, Inouye and Habe introduced a multistage criterion for attaining blind deconvolution of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this correspondence, based on their criterion, we present iterative algorithms for solving the blind deconvolution problem of MIMO LTI systems. However, their criterion should be subjected to several constraints of equations. Therefore, they proposed a new constraint-free multistage criterion for accomplishing the blind deconvolution of MIMO LTI systems. Based on their unconstrained criterion, we show iterative algorithms for solving the blind deconvolution of multichannel LTI systems.	algorithm;blind deconvolution;iterative method;multistage amplifier	Y.

Such problems include image reconstruction where one is required to deconvolve a known point spread function from the image to produce a clearer image. The method described here is related to the truncated singular function expansion for solving linear inverse problems. The method consists of choosing the non-negative solution with minimum 2-norm whose singular function expansion agrees with the truncated singular function expansion solution in its first N terms. The fact that only the first N singular function coefficients, which are easily derived from the data, are used gives the method robustness with respect to noise and the method is not computationally very demanding.	algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio	Geoffrey de Vüliers	1996			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;singular solution;mathematics;inverse function	ML	76.85423758231188	18.423076536945217	34059

Nyquist-like criterion for formation stabilization is used in literature for the problem of relative formation stabilization. For this purpose, spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix are used in evaluating desirable structural properties of formations. Establishing measures of near-periodicity are useful in quantifying formation stability margins. In this paper, we analyze constructions to create non-3-periodic persistent formations, i.e., we study the constructions to create 3-cycle-free persistent formations. Central to the development of our analysis will be the use of tools from rigidity theory and graph Laplacians.	consensus dynamics;directed acyclic graph;persistence (computer science)	Tolga Eren	2009		10.3182/20090921-3-TR-3005.00030	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	62.94259473978317	4.5018349853857895	34327

In more sophisticated models of population dynamics, the growth rate is assumed to be a function of the population N. If the growth rate is denoted by r(N), then the differential equation describing population growth takes the form dN d--T = r ( N ( t ) , t )N ( t ) . It is legitimate to regard r ( N ( t ) , t) as formally describing a self-regulatory mechanism. Of course, most populations do not live a life unmolested by outside influences. We will study the dynamics of a population affected by harvesting. The following general differential equation d N dt = r ( N ( t ) , t ) N ( t ) E ( N ( t ) , t) (1) will be considered, where E ( N , t) is a harvesting strategy for the population. Function E represents the rate at which individuals are harvested. In 1959, Holling [1] identified three basic types of functional """"predator"""" responses: • Type I (linear): E ( N , t ) = a N +~, • Type II (cyrtoid): E ( N , t) = a N / ( N + fl), • Type III (sigmoid): E ( g , t ) = aN2/(72 + •Y 2) (a, ~, and 7 are positive functions of t). In this paper, we will focus on the response of Type I. If r ( N ) = N ( a bN), where a > 0, b > 0 are constants, then we have a logistic-like equation with the harvesting strategy d N dt = g ( a bN) E ( N , t). (2) Below, some applied models of population dynamics are described. EXAMPLE 1.1. METAPOPULATION MODEL. One of the first metapopulation models was developed in 1969 by Levins [2]. It considered immigration of organisms (e.g., birds) from a continent to islands in the ocean. The proportion of islands colonized by a species, N, is given by a natural logistic growth term offset by losses linearly proportional to the birds population (Type I) d--N = c ( t ) N ( 1 e ( t )N , where c is a colonization rate, e is an extinction rate. EXAMPLE 1.2. LOBSTER FISHERY. For fishery management and many other harvesting situations, it is unreasonable to assume that the harvesting rate is constant (i.e., independent of the population). Thus, for modeling the marine fishery, we will assume that the harvesting rate H is proportional to the population N (Type 1). The differential equation [3-5] is then d N dt r N ( K N ) Q C N , where Q is a biological characteristic of the population which is not subject to human control, while C is under the control of the lobster fishery. Note that a loss rate due to harvesting, in general, depends both on the fishing effort and on the fish population density. The same is true for whaling industries and commercial forestries. The last few decades have seen an expanding interest in retarded models of population dynamics involving logistic differential equations with delay. There have been many attempts [6-10] to find reasonable mathematical models with time lags to describe certain complex biological systems. For example, the delay logistic differential equation in population ecology d N _ r ( t ) Y ( t ) (1 Y ( h ( t ) ) ~ h(t) < t, dt \ K / ' Delay Differential Logistic Equations 1511 is known as Hutchinson's equation [11], where r and K are positive constants and h(t) = t T with a positive constant T. The delays are used in immunology to represent the time needed for immune cells to divide, or become destined to die. In modeling the spread of infections, Cooke et al. [9] used the following delay differential equation d N d---t= r ( N ( t T) )N ($ -~-) -cN(t), where c > 0 and T > 0 are suitable constants. Consider a logistic-like equation with a harvesting (hunting) strategy where we do not know the population N(t) at the exact time. However, we need (Example 1.2) it to determine the hunting quota. There is always a delay in processing and distributing field information. The quota must be set long before the hunting season begins. The time lags in ecological systems can be justified as a discovery time: predator requires time to discover the prey is very abundant. In the case of metapopulation (Example 1.1), time lags can be a result of the situation where prey population becomes sufficiently rare, such that the predator switches to alternative prey or an alternative source of prey (different island). It might be reasonable to consider a predation function as a function of the delayed estimate of the true population. It is important to be able to model this delay because it has serious implications for the long-term behavior of populations. Time lags yield specific insights into the management of complex ecological systems. It is considered that the major effect of delays is to make them less stable than the analogous models without delays. The introduction of delays into existing mathematical ecology equations is supported by general arguments that the interacting species somehow rely on resources and harvesting that have been accumulated in the past. It is now a well-known fact that small delays may cause some otherwise inexplicable periodic oscillations. Equation (1) with delays can be rewritten in the following form d N d t r ( g ( h ( t ) ) , t ) Y ( t ) c ( t ) g ( g ( t ) , t ) , h( t ) < t, g ( t ) < t. (3) In this paper, we consider equations of type (3) with several delays in the logistic and the harvesting parts. Here we restrict ourselves to the linear harvesting function E = c ( t ) N ( t ) (Type I of response). Such functions were used in Examples 1.1 and 1.2. We will obtain here sufficient conditions for positiveness, boundedness, and extinction of solutions of equation (3). Similar problems for the equation with constant harvesting were studied in [12,13]. In [14,15], a general logistic delay equation without harvesting was investigated, a pr ior i upper bounds of solutions were obtained and applied to derive explicit conditions of global[ stability for these equations. In the present paper, we also find a pr ior i upper bound of solutions for equations with harvesting and use this estimate to study the positiveness of solutions. Our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 includes relevant results for linear and nonlinear delay differential equations. Section 3 contains main results on the existence of positive solutions which do not tend to zero. This corresponds to nonextinction of the population. Some estimates for positive solutions are also presented. In the end of Section 3, we apply these results to the metapopulation model and to the lobster fishery equation with delay (see Examples 1.1 and 1.2). In Section 4, the results are discussed and illustrated by numerical examples. 2.

It is well known that if $A = M - N$, where $M$ is invertible and $M* + N$ is also positive definite, then the iterative method for solving $Au = b$, based on this decomposition, is convergent. A new proof of this convergence is given, providing an explicit estimate for the spectral radius of $M^{-1}N$. Also, a new method to estimate the optimal relaxation parameter for certain large matrices is suggested.	iterative method;linear system	Fred B. Weissler	1995	SIAM J.

Since the ANC system using the perturbation method does not need the secondary path model, it has an advantage that can track the path changes. However, the conventional perturbation method has a problem that the cancellation performance deteriorates as the frequency of noise becomes high. The proposed method can improve the cancellation performance for the noise at the higher frequency to consider the damping of acoustic wave.

In this paper, we propose two new variants of PVD for the constrained case. For the case of block-separable constraints, we develop a parallel sequential quadratic programming algorithm. This is the first PVD-type method which does not assume convexity of the feasible set for convergence. For inseparable convex constraints, we propose a PVD method based on suitable approximate projected gradient directions.

In the covariance matching method, the noise-free input signal is not explicitly modeled and only assumed to be a stationary process. The asymptotic normalized covariance matrix, valid for a large number of data and a small sampling interval, is derived. This involves the evaluation of a covariance matrix of estimated covariance elements and estimated derivatives of such elements, and large parts of the paper are devoted to this task. The latter covariance matrix consists of two parts, where the first part contains integrals that are approximations of Riemann sums, and the second part depends on the measurement noise variances.	errors-in-variables models	Torsten Söderström;Yasir Irshad;Magnus Mossberg;Wei Xing Zheng	2013	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.07.010	whitening transformation;covariance mapping;matérn covariance function;estimation of covariance matrices;econometrics;covariance intersection;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;law of total covariance;covariance and correlation;cma-es;energy technology;engineering;covariance;mathematics;estimation theory;rational quadratic covariance function;statistics;covariance function	Robotics	56.264909655926374	7.145061440010145	34605

The main contributions of this paper are: i) Based on the derived Givens transform-like ellipse equation, we construct a GMDS matrix characterized by three unknown auxiliary parameters (UAPs), which are functions of several ellipse parameters; ii) Since the GMDS matrix will have low rank when the UAPs are correctly determined, its recovery and the estimation of UAPs are formulated as a rank minimization problem. We then apply the alternating direction method of multipliers as the solver; iii) By utilizing the fact that the noise subspace of the GMDS matrix is orthogonal to the corresponding manifold, we determine the remaining ellipse parameters by solving a specially designed least squares problem. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

R n and showed that the Fr echet derivative of a Fr echet diierentiable function, the Clarke generalized Jacobian of a locally Lips-chitzian function, the Bouligand subdiierential of a semismooth function, and the C-diierential of a C-diierentiable function are particular instances of H-diierentials. In this paper, we consider two applications of H-diierentiability. In the rst application, we derive a necessary optimality condition for a local minimum of an H-diierentiable function. In the second application, we consider a nonlinear complementarity problem corresponding to an H-diierentiable function f and show how, under appropriate conditions on an H-diierential of f, minimizing a merit function corresponding to f leads to a solution of the nonlinear complemen-tarity problem. These two applications were motivated by numerous studies carried out for C 1 , convex, locally Lipschitzian, and semismooth function by various researchers.	clarke's generalized jacobian;complementarity theory;edmund m. clarke;jacobian matrix and determinant;maxima and minima;nonlinear complementarity problem;nonlinear system	M.

In this note, we study general spreading dynamical behaviors in small-world evolving networks when control strategies are applied to suppress the propagation of diseases, viruses, and disasters. After proposing a novel Watts-Strogatz (W-S) spreading model to capture the general spreading mechanism in small-world networks, we investigate the stability and Hopf bifurcations of delay-controlled spreading models with linear and nonlinear feedback controllers, where parameters of small-world rewiring probability, feedback control gain, and time delay are analyzed for the oscillating behaviors.

This enables the development of higher split-radix FFT algorithms from lower split-radix FFT algorithms without any increase in the arithmetic complexity. Specifically, an arbitrary radix-2/2s FFT algorithm for any value of s, 4les sles m, is proposed and its arithmetic complexity analyzed. It is shown that the number of arithmetic operations (multiplications plus additions) required by the proposed radix-2/2s FFT algorithm is independent of s and is (2m-3)2m+1+8 regardless of whether a complex multiplication is carried out using four multiplications and two additions or three multiplications and three additions. This paper thus provides a variety of choices and ways for computing the length-2m DFT with the same arithmetic complexity.	computation;fast fourier transform;recursion;split-radix fft algorithm;twiddle factor	Saad Bouguezel;M.

7a80e6048c20674402414fae0bf4dad217c5640d	a gradient descent implementation of the adaptive robust narrowband constrained lms beamformer		Classical adaptive beamforming strategies have been shown to exhibit a substantial performance degradation if an error exists in the estimation of the angle of arrival (AOA). The optimization problem can be modified to incorporate an improved constraint allowing for robustness to AOA imperfections. In this paper, we propose a gradient descent implementation of the robust adaptive beamformer whereby a direct relation is established between the Lagrange multiplier and the adaptation step size. This allows for the heuristic approximation of one of the parameters while establishing a valid range for the other. Computer simulations have been used to confirm the findings of this study and illustrate the performance of the developed algorithm.	beamforming;gradient descent;least mean squares filter	Roshdy K.

This technique considers the analytic signals of the given signals and uses the fact that, if a signal is distorted by a linear time-scale distortion, the contour of the analytic signal in the complex plane is unaltered. It is found that the analytic signal contours of signals subject to nonlinear time-scale distortion also match very closely. Constraints are derived on the allowed distortion characteristics of the sample instants in order to obtain analytic contours which are essentially coincident. Analytic contours which contain loops are also considered, and methods of overcoming the problems of comparing dissimilar signals are described. >	pattern recognition;signal processing	A.

A sufficient condition is given to ensure bounded synchronization whose boundary can be sufficiently and arbitrary small. Especially, when oscillators are identical and phase lags are uniform, the exponential convergence criteria are derived. The proposed control strategies are valid for arbitrary distributions of phase lags with a boundary.

Based on saddle point condition and conic duality theorem, we first derive a sufficient condition for the zero duality gap between a quadratically constrained QP and its Lagrangian dual or SDP relaxation. We then use a distance measure to characterize the duality gap for nonconvex QP with linear constraints. We show that this distance can be computed via cell enumeration technique in discrete geometry. Finally, we revisit two sufficient optimality conditions in the literature for two classes of nonconvex QPs and show that these conditions actually imply zero duality gap.	duality gap;quadratic programming	Xiaojin Zheng;Xiaoling Sun;Duan Li;Yifan Xu	2012	J.

In this paper we study a model for the harvesting of marine resources, described by an elliptic equation. Since the cost functionals have sublinear growth w.r.t. the pointwise intensity of fishing effort, optimal solutions are in general measure-valued. For the control problem, we prove the existence of optimal strategies. Uniqueness is established within a class of measures with small total mass. We also study the differential game, modeling the presence of several competing fishing companies, and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium solution. This is obtained as a fixed point of a continuous transformation in a space of positive Radon measures.	fixed point (mathematics);nash equilibrium;optimal control	Alberto Bressan;Wen Shen	2009	SIAM J.

This interpretation is now studied in detail in terms of different filter impulse responses in full-band and partial-band cases. The approach to a fixed-point error analysis as known for, e.g., the radix-2 decimation-in-time Cooley-Tukey (CT-) FFT is applied to the SB-FFT. A comparison between the two FFT's is given for the full-band case. The effect of coefficient errors on the zero-pattern of the filter-bank is explained. A new measure for the coefficient error is introduced. According to this measure, the coefficient error in a channel k can be described by adding the linear distortion in this channel to the sum of the aliasing effects of all other channels on channel k. In a partial-band case, the approximation errors inherent in the SB-FFT combine with the coefficient error; this is described in a recursive form and explained by means of a numerical example for a simulated case. >"""	fast fourier transform;filter bank	Ulrich Heute;Abdulnasir Hossen	1994		10.1109/ISCAS.1994.408975	fast fourier transform;mathematical optimization;approximation error;electronic engineering;impulse response;filter bank;mathematics;fixed point;algorithm;statistics	EDA	56.80914807538877	16.73148955599169	35849

It then goes on to give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of general inverses with finite delay and gives procedures for constructing a class of such inverses. The discussion considers both the transfer function matrix description and the structural matrix description of the linear sequential circuit, together with the complementary nature of the results obtained from these two viewpoints. Finally, a large part of the work is motivated by results and techniques which have been applied in the study of continuous-time linear dynamical systems and thus serves to point out the advantages which may accrue through simultaneous study of both continuous-time systems and linear sequential circuits.	dynamical system;feedforward neural network;sequential logic;transfer function	James L.

The expression is valid for finite sample size and for a class of model structures, which includes finite impulse response, Laguerre and Kautz models, when the number of estimated parameters coincides with the number of excitation frequencies of the input. The expression gives direct insight into how excitation frequencies and amplitudes affect the accuracy of frequency function estimates. With the help of this expression, a severe sensitivity of the accuracy with respect to the excitation frequencies is exposed. The relevance of the expression when more excitation frequencies are used is also discussed.	parsing expression grammar	Håkan Hjalmarsson;Brett Ninness	2006	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2005.12.021	finite impulse response;calculus;control theory;mathematics;least squares;statistics	EDA	55.44213261533082	12.030059932575222	35913

It was found that Newton iterations, with exact line searches, did not converge to a stationary point of the natural merit function, i.e., the Euclidean norm of the residuals. Extensive numerical simulation of Powell's equations produced the unexpected result that Newton iterations converged to the solution from all initial points, where the function is defined, or from those points where the Jacobian is nonsingular, if no line search is used. The significance of Powell's example is that an important requirement exists when utilizing Newton's method to solve such a system of nonlinear equations. Specifically, a merit function, which is used in a line search, must have properties consistent with those of a Lyapunov function to provide sufficient conditions for convergence. This implies that level sets of the merit function are properly nested, either globally, or in some finite local region. Therefore, they are topologically equivalent to concentric spherical surfaces, either globally or in a finite local region. Furthermore, an exact line search at a point, far from the solution, may be counterproductive. This observation, and a primary aim of the present analysis, is to demonstrate that it is desirable to construct new Newton iterations, which do not require a merit function with associated line searches.	algebraic equation;newton	B.

However, for most existing variable step-size sign algorithm against impulsive noise, either the performance is not good enough, or the calculation is complex. In this paper, a correntropy inspired variable step-size method for sign algorithm is proposed. The new variable step-size method is computationally simple and robust to impulsive noises.

Two QR decomposition-based recursive algorithms are introduced based on the classical Gauss-Newton (GN) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithms in nonlinear unconstrained optimization or least squares problems. Instead of using the matrix inversion formula, recursive QR decomposition is employed, which is known to be numerically more stable in finite wordlength implementations. A family of p-A-QR-LS algorithms is then proposed to solve the LS problem resulting from the linearization of the NLS problem. It achieves different complexity-performance tradeoffs by retaining a different number of diagonal plus off-diagonals (denoted by an integer p) of the triangular factor of the augmented data matrix. Simulation results on identifying a nonlinear perceptron are provided to illustrate the principle of the new algorithms.	approximation algorithm;gauss–newton algorithm;grid north;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;mathematical optimization;newton;non-linear least squares;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical stability;perceptron;qr decomposition;recursion;simulation;the matrix;triangular matrix	Shing-Chow Chan;Yimin Zhou;W.

We show that by associating with both analysis and synthesis operators a set of boundary lters, it is possible to make the analysis structure vary arbitrarily in time, and yet reconstruct the input with a similarly time-varying synthesis section. There is no redundancy or distortion introduced. This gives a solution to the problem of applying lter banks to nite length signals; it suuces to apply the boundary lters at the beginning and end of the signal segment. This also allows the construction of orthogonal and non-orthogonal bases with essentially any prescribed time and frequency localization, but which, nonetheless, are based on structures with eecient lter bank implementations.	distortion;filter bank;redundancy (engineering)	Cormac Herley	1994		10.1109/ISCAS.1994.409071	filter;adaptive filter;control engineering;network synthesis filters;nonlinear filter;electronic engineering;digital filter;low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;electronic filter;constant k filter;electronic filter topology;filter design;prototype filter;high-pass filter;composite image filter;half-band filter;m-derived filter	Theory	58.84203049867395	17.775291137424908	36495

In contrast to other interval based techniques, the actual computation of enclosures to the solution is not based on the code list (term representation) of the vector field that defines the equation, but assumes instead that the vector field is approximated to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. By using approximations defined over rational or dyadic numbers, we obtain proper data types for approximating both the vector field and the solution.

The nullspace-based approach can be formulated as an optimization problem. We show that this formulation implies a new subspace-based approach that uses matrix operations. This new approach has the same advantages as the nullspace-based one but requires less computational complexity. Under some mild conditions, its complexity is equal to that of the FFT. Furthermore, the relation among the nullspace-based approach, the direct deconvolver estimation and the new subspace-based approach is studied.	circuit restoration;computational complexity theory;fast fourier transform;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;image restoration;kernel (linear algebra);mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Hung-Ta Pai;Alan C.

We establish the emergence of a delocalization phase for the PageRank vector when network parameters are changed. For networks with localized PageRank, eigenvalues of the matrix in the complex plane with a modulus above a certain threshold correspond to localized eigenfunctions while eigenvalues below this threshold are associated with delocalized relaxation modes. We argue that, for networks with delocalized PageRank, the efficiency of information retrieval by Google-type search is strongly affected since the PageRank values have no clear hierarchical structure in this case.	emergence;google matrix;information retrieval;linear programming relaxation;modulus of continuity;pagerank;the matrix;world wide web	Olivier Giraud;Bertrand Georgeot;Dima L.

This approach rapidly becomes computationally expensive and is often tractable only for problems of small sizes. We propose an iterative scheme that improves the semidefinite relaxations without incurring exponential growth in their size. The key ingredient is a dynamic scheme for generating valid polynomial inequalities for general polynomial programs. These valid inequalities are then used to construct better approximations of the original problem. As a result, the proposed scheme is in principle scalable to large general combinatorial optimization problems. For binary polynomial programs, we prove that the proposed scheme converges to the global optimal solution for interesting cases of the initial approximation of the problem. We also present examples illustrating the computational behaviour of the scheme and compare it to other methods in the literature. ?

We first apply the p-power convexification of the Lagrangian function in the NCNO problem. The proposed NN is a gradient model which is constructed by an NCP function and an unconstrained minimization problem. The main feature of this NN is that its equilibrium point coincides with the optimal solution of the original problem. Under a proper assumption and utilizing a suitable Lyapunov function, it is shown that the proposed NN is Lyapunov stable and convergent to an exact optimal solution of the original problem. Finally, simulation results on two numerical examples and two practical examples are given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed NN. VC 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The composite responses of these filterbanks are very flat and have a stopband rejection of approximately 60 dB. Also, for purposes of speech recognition, energy estimates from filterbank output are frequently used, and are derived from oversampled, rectified input. A very substantial reduction in the number of calculations can be made if filter outputs are decimated while introducing a tolerable amount of error. This idea has been experimentally evaluated.	finite impulse response;speech recognition	Jay T. Rubinstein;Harvey F.

dbbc048cf78afe230848a5f84abd305cba373dff	procedure for the steady-state verification of modulation-based noise reduction systems in hearing instruments	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Hearing instrument verification involves measuring the performance of modulation-based noise reduction systems. The article proposes a systematic procedure for their verification. The procedure has the potential for application in the verification of other signal processing systems, because it is independent of the hearing instrument domain. Its key concept, the separation of abstract and concrete design of test signals, has been adopted from the embedded systems domain. Specifically for modulation-based noise reduction systems in hearing instruments, the article shows a complete implementation of the verification procedure, proposing improvements of existing measurement techniques. To fully cover the verification procedure, a new measurement approach based on maximum length sequences and DFT processing is introduced, revisiting concepts of system identification that came up in the 1970s. These can easily be used with the computational resources of today’s microcomputers. Sample measurements with existing hearing instruments demonstrate the verification procedure with different measurement techniques.	computational resource;embedded system;maximum length sequence;microcomputer;modulation;noise reduction;rewriting;signal processing;steady state;system identification	Jesko G.

We use an embedding of a symplectic map in a quasi-periodic non-autonomous flow and a KAM result of Jorba and Villaneuva (J Nonlinear Sci 7:427–473, 1997) to show that periodic orbits persist in the new flow, but with slightly perturbed period and an additional degree of freedom when the map is non-resonant with the periodic orbit. The same result holds for lower-dimensional tori with more degrees of freedom. Numerical experiments with the two degree of freedom Hénon–Heiles system are used to show that in the case where the method is resonant with the periodic orbit, the orbit is destroyed and replaced by two invariant sets of periodic points—analogous to what is understood for one degree of freedom systems.	autonomous robot;discretization;experiment;hénon map;nonlinear programming;quasiperiodicity;symplectic integrator	Robert I.

Hence, the time structure of the signals is exploited. The paper provides new insight into the algebraic and geometric structure of the problem, which is crucial for the development of solutions. The presented viewpoint is unifying in two senses. Firstly, the developed theory is general with respect to the considered order of the cumulants. Secondly, all types of statistical variability in the data, for example, the nonstationarity and the nonwhiteness, are incorporated into the problem in a unified manner.	linear algebra;mimo;spatial variability	Jakob van de Laar	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1327169	identification;computer science;development theory;blind equalization;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics;cumulant	Robotics	54.105885512546415	17.51840364323956	37253

We derive a sufficient condition for fl(Ak) 0 as k x) and a bound on [[fl(Ak)[[, both expressed in terms of the Jordan canonical form of A. Examples show that the results can be sharp. We show that the sufficient condition can be rephrased in terms of a pseudospectrum of A when A is diagonalizable, under certain assumptions. Our analysis leads to the rule of thumb that convergence or divergence of the computed powers of A can be expected according as the spectral radius computed by any backward stable algorithm is less than or greater than 1.	algorithm;converge;emoticon;pseudospectrum	Nicholas J.

Related systems of linear equations are thus usually huge. Studying relations between subspaces of the solution spaces is important for obtaining efficient preconditioning. For a hierarchy of polynomials of random variables we introduce upper bounds to the strengthened Cauchy–Bunyakowsky–Schwarz (CBS) constants with respect to the scalar product defined by the operator of the weak form of the underlying equation. Small values of the CBS constant indicate that certain additive or multiplicative two-by-two block preconditioners reduce enough the condition number of the system.Moreover,we show that a recursivemultiplicative two-by-twoblock preconditioning can be used, resulting in the algebraic multilevel iterative (AMLI) method. We present the conditions under which the AMLI preconditioning is of an optimal order. Numerical experiments confirm the introduced theoretical estimates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithms are derived from Mallows theory for nonlinear selection type smoothers, which states that the closest linear filter to a selection type smoother in the mean square error sense is the one having as coefficients the sample selection probabilities (SSPs) of the smoother. The new design method overcomes the severe limitations of previous approaches that require the construction of high order polynomial functions and high dimensional matrices. As such, previous approaches could only provide solutions for filters of very small sizes. The proposed method is based on a new closed-form function used to derive the SSPs of any WM smoother. This function allows for an iterative approach to WM filter design from the spectral profile of a linear filter. This method is initially applied to solve the median filter design problem in the real domain, and then, it is extended to the complex domain. The final optimization algorithm allows the design of robust weighted median filters of arbitrary size based on linear filters having arbitrary spectral characteristics.	algorithm;coefficient;experiment;filter design;frequency response;gradient descent;iterative method;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;median filter;nonlinear system;polynomial;simulation;stochastic process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Sebastian Hoyos;Jan Bacca Rodríguez;Gonzalo R.

A constraint is imposed so that the tumour size must decrease at or faster than a specified rate. The system is solved using an established numerical solution technique known as control parametrization, and analytical gradients are constructed of all the constraints so that the resulting non-linear programming problem is solvable using currently available software. An interesting feature of the constraints o n the rate of decrease of the tumour size is that the corresponding co-state functions are discontinuous in time. Numerical solutions suggest that the best way of reducing the tumour burden after a fixed period of treatment is to keep the rate of decrease of the tumour size to a minimum initially, and then give high-intensity treatment towards the end of the treatment period.	decision problem;gradient;linear programming;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;scheduling (computing)	R.

Using the fidelity of the low-rank approximation to the original data as the cost function, this paper offers an analytic expression of the projected gradient which, on one hand, furnishes the first order optimality condition and, on the other hand, can be used as a numerical means for solving this problem.	central processing unit;desktop computer;feasible region;gradient;iterative method;loss function;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;open dynamics engine;singular value decomposition	Moody T.

Since SVD is used frequently in computations of the real-time EEG system, a low-latency and high-accuracy SVD processor is essential. During the EEG system process, the proposed SVD processor aims to solve the diagonal, inverse and inverse square root matrices of the target matrices in real time. Generally, SVD requires a huge amount of computation in hardware implementation. Therefore, this work proposes a novel design concept for data flow updating to assist the pipeline VLSI implementation. The SVD processor can greatly improve the feasibility of real-time EEG system applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). The proposed architecture is implemented using TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology. The sample rate of EEG raw data adopts 128 Hz. The core size of the SVD processor is 580×580 um2, and the speed of operation frequency is 20MHz. It consumes 0.774mW of power during the 8-channel EEG system per execution time.	brain-computer interfaces;cmos;cordic;central processing unit;coefficient;computation;convergence (action);dataflow;electroencephalography phase synchronization;hertz (hz);independent component analysis;methods of computing square roots;online and offline;parallel computing;real-time clock;recursion;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);singular value decomposition;square micrometer;steady state;very-large-scale integration;system process	Kuan-Ju Huang;Wei-Yeh Shih;Jui-Chung Chang;Chih-Wei Feng;Wai-Chi Fang	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609908	independent component analysis;electronic engineering;real-time computing;neuroscience;electroencephalography;computer science;inverse problem;theoretical computer science;machine learning;very-large-scale integration;singular value decomposition;cmos	Embedded	59.94353228903232	22.093516823639888	37516

In order to assess the approximation error introduced by shifting a spline signal, the approximation error norm and its average are evaluated.

We propose a continuous-time annihilation framework for a class of FRI signals. In particular, we show that FRI signals of sum-of-weighted exponential form can be annihilated by a composition of translation operators and show that the parameters of the signal can be estimated in the periodic non-uniform sampling (PNU) scenario. We discuss the advantages of PNU sampling over uniform sampling and extend it for general FRI signal sampling and reconstruction. Simulations are performed and the results are compared with state-of-the-art methods for signal-to-noise ratios ranging from -20 to 100 dB. An improvement in the estimation accuracy of 15-55 dB in terms of bias and mean-square error is achieved over conventional methods by a rearrangement of uniform samples to follow PNU sampling.	computer simulation;digital signal processing;mean squared error;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;signal-to-noise ratio;time complexity	Satish Mulleti;Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179112	signal reconstruction;coherent sampling;sampling;computer vision;mathematical optimization;estimation;kernel;computer science;noise reduction;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Vision	55.30100361564353	13.220181408651918	37668

Melman, Symmetric centrosymmetric matrix-vector multiplication, Linear Algebra Appl. 320 (2000) 193-198] for symmetric centrosymmetric matrices, another was presented by Fassbender and Ikramov [H. Fassbender, K.D. Ikramov, Computing matrix-vector products with centrosymmetric and centrohermitian matrices, Linear Algebra Appl. 364 (2003) 235-241] for general centrosymmetric matrices. In this note we further discuss this topic of computing Ax, where A is a generalized centrosymmetric matrix. We firstly investigate the reducibility of a generalized centrosymmetric matrix and then provide an algorithm which can be viewed as a generalization of one [H. Fassbender, K.D. Ikramov, Computing matrix-vector products with centrosymmetric and centrohermitian matrices, Linear Algebra Appl. 364 (2003) 235-241]. We show that our algorithm is suitable for computing many matrix-vector products with the same matrix. Furthermore, we show that similar results can be obtained for certain subclasses of generalized centrosymmetric matrices, as compared to the case of a centrosymmetric matrix, and analogue gains are available for generalized skew-centrosymmetric or generalized centrohermitian matrices.

In the present paper the semi-inner product of the generalized Sobolev space is set up by a vector distributional operator P consisting of finitely or countably many distributional operators Pn, which are defined on the dual space of the Schwartz space. The types of operators we now consider include not only differential operators, but also more general distributional operators such as pseudo-differential operators. We deduce that a certain appropriate full-space Green function G with respect to L := P∗T P now becomes a conditionally positive function. In order to support this claim we ensure that the distributional adjoint operator P∗ of P is well-defined in the distributional sense. Under sufficient conditions, the native space (reproducing-kernel Hilbert space) associated with the Green function G can be imbedded into or even be equivalent to a generalized Sobolev space. As an application, we take linear combinations of translates of the Green function with possibly added polynomial terms and construct a multivariate minimum-norm interpolant s f ,X to data values sampled from an unknown generalized Sobolev function f at data sites located in some set X ⊂ Rd.

The difficulties arising from the structure of the constraint set are overcome by means of generalized constraint qualification assumptions based on the concept of quasi relative interior of a convex set. An application to a general evolutionary network model, which includes as special cases traffic, spatial price and financial equilibrium problems, concludes the paper.

Superlinear convergence of the sequence of dual estimates is also established. For homogeneous LP problems having the origin as the unique optimal solution, we also show that 2 is a sharp upper bound on the (fixed) stepsize that provably guarantees that the sequence of primal iterates converge to the optimal solution along a unique direction of approach. Since the point to which the sequence of dual estimates converge depend on the direction of approach of the sequence of primal iterates, this result gives a plausible (but not accurate) theoretical explanation for why ~ is a sharp upper bound on the (fixed) stepsize that guarantees the convergence of the dual estimates.	affine scaling;algorithm;converge;image scaling;iteration;linear programming;rate of convergence	Takashi Tsuchiya;Renato D.

This network has a hidden layer that is independent of f and that transforms the n-tuples (x(1), em leader, x(n)) into the 2n + 1 variables y(q), and an output layer in which f is computed. Kůrková has shown that such a network has an approximate implementation with arbitrary activation functions of sigmoidal type. Actual implementation is, however, impeded by the lack of numerical algorithms for the hidden layer which contain continuous functions of the formy(q)=Sigma(n)(p=1)alpha(p)psi(x(p)+qa) with constants a and alpha(p). This paper gives an explicit numerical implementation of the hidden layer that also enables the implementation of the output layer. Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd		David A.

In this note we focus on a recently proposed method to compute abstractions whose state space is a cover of the state space of the plant by congruent hyper-intervals. The problem of how to choose the size of the hyper-intervals so as to obtain computable and useful abstractions is unsolved. This note provides a twofold contribution towards a solution. Firstly, we present a functional to predict the computational effort for the abstraction to be computed. Secondly, we propose a method for choosing the aspect ratio of the hyper-intervals when their volume is fixed. More precisely, we propose to choose the aspect ratio so as to minimize a predicted number of transitions of the abstraction to be computed, in order to reduce the computational effort. To this end, we derive a functional to predict the number of transitions in dependence of the aspect ratio. The functional is to be minimized subject to suitable constraints. We characterize the unique solvability of the respective optimization problem and prove that it transforms, under appropriate assumptions, into an equivalent convex problem with strictly convex objective. The latter problem can then be globally solved using standard numerical methods. We demonstrate our approach on an example.	computable function;computation;constraint (mathematics);convex function;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;state space	Alexander Weber;Matthias Rungger;Gunther Reissig	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2642794	control engineering;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Robotics	68.62980886030535	8.012295037508432	38135

487bbd978d44e75f1bf2a026f7f91ce34123aaa4	multi-agent systems with compasses	nonlinear systems	In this paper, we first study agreement protocols for coupled continuous-time nonlinear dynamics over cooperative multi-agent networks. To guarantee convergence for such systems, it is common in the literature to assume that the vector field of each agent is pointing inside the convex hull formed by the states of the agent and its neighbors. This convexity condition is relaxed in this paper, as we show that it is enough that the vector field belongs to a strict tangent cone based on a local supporting hyperrectangle. The new condition has the natural physical interpretation of a compass, as each agent needs only to know in which orthant each of its neighbor is. It is proven that the multi-agent system achieves exponential state agreement if and only if the time-varying communication topology is uniformly jointly quasistrongly connected. Cooperative–antagonistic multi-agent networks are also considered. For these systems, the (cooperative–antagonistic) relation matrix has a negative element for arcs corresponding to antagonistic interactions. State agreement may not be achieved for cooperative–antagonistic multi-agent systems. Instead it is shown that asymptotic absolute state agreement is achieved if the time-varying communication topology is uniformly jointly strongly connected.	arcs (computing);control theory;convex hull;interaction;lagrangian relaxation;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;strongly connected component;time complexity	Ziyang Meng;Guodong Shi;Karl Henrik Johansson	2013	CoRR			AI	64.59234552399433	6.5352164490121485	38223

In this paper we present, an algorithm for implementing the Multi-User Kurtosis (MUK) constrained optimization criterion suggested by these conditions. The algorithm is derived directly from the MUK cost function via a stochastic-gradient update at each iteration, followed by a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to project onto the criterion's constraint. A convergence analysis of the derived algorithm reveals that it, is globally convergent (in the absence of noise) to a desired setting that recovers all the input sources, up to an arbitrary phase rotation each.	algorithm;blind signal separation;constrained optimization;gradient;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-user;schmidt decomposition;source separation	Constantinos B.

ca3765c60ff05eb470541522390ab9e2e4ac38fa	minimum sobolev norm interpolation of scattered derivative data		Abstract We study the problem of reconstructing a function on a manifold satisfying some mild conditions, given data of the values and some derivatives of the function at arbitrary points on the manifold. While the problem of finding a polynomial of two variables with total degree ≤ n given the values of the polynomial and some of its derivatives at exactly the same number of points as the dimension of the polynomial space is sometimes impossible, we show that such a problem always has a solution in a very general situation if the degree of the polynomials is sufficiently large. We give estimates on how large the degree should be, and give explicit constructions for such a polynomial even in a far more general case. As the number of sampling points at which the data is available increases, our polynomials converge to the target function on the set where the sampling points are dense. Numerical examples in single and double precision show that this method is stable, efficient, and of high-order.	interpolation	Shivkumar Chandrasekaran;C. H. Gorman;Hrushikesh Narhar Mhaskar	2018	J.

A particular emphasis is on upper Hessenberg problems, where the challenge lies in leaving all zero-by-definition elements of the LS matrix unperturbed. Analytical solutions for optimal perturbation matrices are given, including upper Hessenberg matrices. Finally, the upper Hessenberg LS problems represented by unsymmetric ASF that indicate a normwise backward stability of the problem (which is not the case in general) are identified. It is observed that such problems normally arise from Arnoldi factorization (for example, in the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm). The problem is illustrated with a number of practical (arising in the GMRES algorithm) and some ‘purpose-built’ examples.

Recent results for such generation have been somewhat ad hoc, Le., not sufficiently general. In this paper, a general procedure is outlined for the generation of such transfer matrices E ( z ) . The procedure is based on a cascaded-lattice structure, derived from a state-space viewpoint. The structure is such that it generates only M X M lossless FIR transfer matrices (regardless of parameter values), and conversely, any M X M lossless FIR transfer matrix can he obtained by a suitable choice of parameters. These parameters turn out to be angles Ok, and the structure is such that the number of angles is minimal. A design example is presented to demonstrate the main results.	crystal structure;filter bank;finite impulse response;hoc (programming language);lossless compression;quadrature mirror filter;state space;transfer matrix	Zinnur Doganata;Palghat P.

We show that in the biorthogonal case, such filter banks (BOFBs) are conveniently parameterized by the recently reported M-channel lifting factorization, which appropriately confines the degrees of freedom within the remaining M - 1 filters while guaranteeing H/sub 0/(z) as prescribed. On the other hand, for the orthogonal case, such filter banks (PUFBs) with a prescribed scaling filter H/sub 0/(z) of a certain length can be completed by the order-one factorization of an M /spl times/ 1 lossless system proposed in this paper - the constraint on McMillian degree of the resulting PUFBs previously present in the literature has been relaxed, and PUFBs with better performance are thus obtained.

For the case of fixed topology and zero communication time-delay, a necessary and sufficient condition for the consensus is established. The parameter design of the protocol is also discussed. Under switching topology, the consensus is investigated for two cases: the case of zero communication time-delay and the case of nonuniform communication time-delays. For each case, a sufficient condition for the consensus is provided. Moreover, for a group of double/triple-integrator agents with fixed topology and uniform constant time-delay, some necessary and sufficient conditions for the consensus are given.

We obtain some criteria and characterizations of these two types of extended well-posedness, further generalizing most results obtained by Zolezzi for the extended well-posedness of scalar optimization problems. In the mean time, many results obtained by us for the extended well-posedness of vector optimization problems have been generalized to set-valued optimization. Finally, we present an approximate variational principle for set-valued maps, derive a necessary approximate optimality condition for set-valued optimization, based on which we introduce a condition, which is somewhat analogous to the Palais-Smale condition (C), and provide sufficient conditions for the extended and strongly extended well-posedness of set-valued optimization problems.	mathematical optimization;well-posed problem	X.

Their application to real problems usually requires the satisfaction of a set of linear constraints that can be incorporated with an additional violation term. Another option proposed in the literature lies in confining the search space onto the subspace of constraints in such a way that the neuron outputs always satisfy the imposed restrictions. This paper proposes a computationally efficient subspace projection method that also includes variable updating step mechanisms.

This type of approximation enables us to obtain more powerful results than in the classical aspects of approximation theory settings. An application of this result is also given. Furthermore, we compute the rates of this statistical fuzzy convergence of the operators via the fuzzy modulus of continuity.	approximation	George A.

The classes are built through the approach of weight functions and these obtained classes reach the optimal order four using one function and two first derivative evaluations per full cycle. This shows that our classes can be considered as Jarratt-type schemes. The accuracy of the classes is tested on a number of numerical examples. And eventually, it is observed that our contributions take less number of iterations than the compared existing methods of the same type to find more accurate approximate solutions of the nonlinear equations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In these models, the key point is to know the asymptotical behavior of their solutions {xn}n, obtained by fixing a set of arbitrary initial conditions {x0, x1, . . . , xk−1} and applying the rule determined by f . Among other properties, the dynamics related to the aspects of periodicity of solutions is one of the most studied in the last years. In this paper, we present some advances in the study of the (global) periodic character of difference equations xn+k = f(xn+k−1, . . . , xn+1, xn) of order k with positive initial conditions, where f is a continuous map defined from (0,∞)k to (0,∞). Since R. C.

However, the magnitude response of this filter has a high passband droop and poor selectivity. One technique for improving the response is sharpening. In the design of sharpened CIC filters, the Kaiser-Hamming method is well established. It results in maximally flat filters. Recently, the weighted least-squares method has been proposed. It improves the response better than the Kaiser-Hamming method. In this paper, we present a method for the design of sharpened CIC filters by using the weighted minimax error criterion. The method is based on the iterative reweighted least-squares procedure. The features of the presented method are illustrated with the design of narrowband and wideband filters. It is shown that the proposed filters are preferable compared to the maximally flat and the weighted least-squares counterparts.	butterworth filter;cascaded integrator–comb filter;decimation (signal processing);iteration;iterative method;least squares;minimax;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;selectivity (electronic);unsharp masking;window function	Goran Molnar;Mladen Vucic	2013	2013 IEEE 20th International Conference on Electronics, Circuits, and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2013.6815552	butterworth filter;adaptive filter;network synthesis filters;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;chebyshev filter;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;mathematics;filter design;prototype filter;m-derived filter	Robotics	60.55761293474987	16.328370110341254	39162

It has a rich history dating back to the early 19th century when Carl Friedrich Gauss developed the method of least squares of a system of linear equations — its solutions can be viewed as fixed points of averaged projections onto hyperplanes. A powerful generalization of this problem is to find fixed points of averaged resolvents (i.e., firmly nonexpansive mappings). This paper concerns the relationship between the set of fixed points of averaged resolvents and certain fixed point sets of compositions of resolvents. It partially extends recent work for two mappings on a question of C. Byrne. The analysis suggests a reformulation in a product space. Algorithmic consequences are also presented. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 47H05, 47H09; Secondary 47J25, 65K05, 65K10, 90C25.	algorithm;fixed point (mathematics);least squares;linear equation;mathematics subject classification;system of linear equations	Heinz H.

More precisely, this fractance is a fractional integrator. Practical realizations of this fractional integrator based on hydropneumatic RC cells are presented in a limited frequency band. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of the hydropneumatic RC cell nonlinearities, which constitute the hydropneumatic networks of the CRONE suspension, on the stability degree robustness when varying the sprung mass. First, the achievement of a nonlinear validation model is emphasized, and then, a linear synthesis model is presented. These two models are used in the second part of this paper to analyze the obtained performances and to show the influence of the nonlinearities. This analysis of performances is made first from a qualitative standpoint using the functional domain of each Ri and Ci element and then from the quantitative standpoint using the Volterra series. In fact, the difference between the response of the nonlinear model and the one of the first-order kernel (which represents the linear response of the system) allows the determination of the influence of the nonlinearities on the dynamic behavior for a particular signal input. The results obtained show that the RC cell nonlinearities composing the hydropneumatic networks of the CRONE suspension do not modify the stability degree robustness versus sprung mass variations, thus extending in a nonlinear context this robustness that is present in the linear context.	characteristic impedance;first-order predicate;frequency band;guarded suspension;linear algebra;nonlinear system;performance	Roy Abi Zeid Daou;Xavier Moreau;Clovis Francis	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2174168	resistor;control engineering;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;kernel;computer science;engineering;first-order logic;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;robustness;lifting equipment	Vision	66.82757171492149	11.443228629306244	39606

Such models may be badly conditioned and possibly degenerate. The problem considered here is the selection of maximal cardinality subsets of the physical input, output sets, such as the resulting model is nondegenerate and satisfies additional properties such as controllability and observability and avoids the existence of high order infinite zeros. This problem is part of the early design task of select­ ing well-conditioned progenitor models on which successive design has to be carried out. The conditions for different type of degeneracy are investigated and this leads to necessary and sufficient conditions required to guarantee nondegeneracy. The sufficient conditions for nondegeneracy also lead to models with no infinite zeros. Furthermore, additional condi­ tions are derived which guarantee controllability and observability of the resulting model. The results are then used to develop a selection procedure for natural subsets of inputs and outputs, which guarantee transfer function and input, output nondegeneracy, as well as controllability and observability of the resulting system. A parameterisation of solutions that satisfy the above requirements is given.		Nicos Karcanias;Konstantinos G.

In the limit as the penalty constant tends to ∞, one recovers the constrained solution. In the exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value penalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty constant. In practice, the kinks in the penalty and the unknown magnitude of the penalty constant prevent wide application of the exact penalty method in nonlinear programming. In this article, we examine a strategy of path following consistent with the exact penalty method. Instead of performing optimization at a single penalty constant, we trace the solution as a continuous function of the penalty constant. Thus, path following starts at the unconstrained solution and follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the process, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various constraints. For quadratic programming, the solution path is piecewise linear and takes large jumps from constraint to constraint. For a general convex program, the solution path is piecewise smooth, and path following operates by numerically solving an ordinary differential equation segment by segment. Our diverse applications to a) projection onto a convex set, b) nonnegative least squares, c) quadratically constrained quadratic programming, d) geometric programming, and e) semidefinite programming illustrate the mechanics and potential of path following. The final detour to image denoising demonstrates the relevance of path following to regularized estimation in inverse problems. In regularized estimation, one follows the solution path as the penalty constant decreases from a large value.	convex optimization;convex set;emoticon;geometric programming;mathematical optimization;mechanics;noise reduction;non-negative least squares;nonlinear programming;numerical analysis;penalty method;piecewise linear continuation;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program;relevance;semidefinite programming;slide (glass microscope)	Hua Zhou;Kenneth Lange	2015	Computational optimization and applications	10.1007/s10589-015-9732-x	ordinary differential equation;regularization;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;geometric programming;penalty method;mathematics;semidefinite programming	ML	76.01067835393705	26.41596460009664	39666

A procedure is presented to identify, on the basis of time domain measurement data, a reduced order finite impulse response (FIR) model together with an upper bound on the model error of the corresponding transfer function, using only minor prior information. We assume the measurement data to be contaminated with a stochastic noise disturbance with unknown spectral properties. By applying a procedure similar to Bartlett’s procedure of periodogram averaging, in conjunction with a periodic input signal, the statistics of the model error asymptotically can be obtained from the data. The model error consists of two parts: a probabilistic part, due to the stochastic noise disturbance, and a worst-case part, due to the unmodelled dynamics. The latter is explicitly bounded with a hard error bound, while for the former a confidence interval can be specified asymptotically. This enables an explicit trade-off between undermodelling (bias) and variance terms. The resulting error bound appears to be tight.	bartlett's bisection theorem;bartlett's method;best, worst and average case;exponent bias;finite impulse response;fractal dimension;higher-order function;nyquist plot;requirement;robust control;spectral density estimation;transfer function;weight function;xfig	Douwe K. de Vries;Paul M.

Different variable partition yields different multi-homogenous Bézout number, which gives the upper bound of the number of isolated solutions. However, the computation of the multi-homogenous Bézout number is hard. In this paper, the permanent formulation of the multi-homogenous Bézout number is considered. The intensive and systemic computations are made for the method of row expansion with memory, the precise and the approximate permanent methods. Each of these methods has its own advantage. Hence a hybrid algorithm is naturally presented. This method works for n about 30 contrasting with 15 before, where n is the number of the variables of the polynomial system. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

0e6e1e9eae673f902328f3f83d4acd73fa31859b	unified systems of fb-spdes/fb-sdes with jumps/skew reflections and stochastic differential games		We study four systems and their interactions. First, we formulate a unified system of coupled forward and backward stochastic partial differential equations (FB-SPDEs) with Lévy jumps, which is vector-valued and whose drift, diffusion, and jump coefficients may involve partial differential operators. Under generalized local linear growth and Lipschitz conditions, the well-posedness concerning adapted strong solution to the FB-SPDEs is proved. Second, we consider a unified system of FB-SDEs, a special form of the FBSPDEs, however, with skew reflections. Under generalized linear growth and Lipschitz conditions together with a general completely-S condition on reflection matrices, we prove the well-posedness of adapted weak solution to the FB-SDEs. In particular, if the spectral radii in certain sense for both reflection matrices are strictly less than the unity, a unique adapted strong solution will be concerned. Third, we formulate a stochastic differential game (SDG) problem with general number of players based on the FB-SDEs. By a solution to the FB-SPDEs, we determine a solution to the FB-SDEs under a given control rule and then obtain a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to the non-zero-sum SDG problem. Fourth, we study the application of the FB-SPDEs in a queueing system and discuss how to use the queueing system to motivate the SDG problem.	amiga reflections;coefficient;diffuse reflection;fully buffered dimm;interaction;linear function;nash equilibrium;pareto efficiency;queueing theory;reflection (computer graphics);well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wanyang Dai	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;mathematics;statistics	ML	77.398501790909	8.36083392046727	39808

It has been shown previously that nonuniform sampling has the advantage of unambiguous estimates beyond the Nyquist frequency; however, the effect of sampling on the Cramer-Rao bounds is not well known. This paper first derives the maximum likelihood estimators and Cramer-Rao bounds for the parameters with known, arbitrary sampling times. It then outlines two methods for incorporating random sampling times into the lower variance bounds, describing one in detail. It is then shown that for a signal with additive white Gaussian noise the bounds for the estimation with nonuniform sampling tend toward those of uniform sampling. Thus, nonuniform sampling overcomes the ambiguity problems of uniform sampling without incurring the penalty of an increased variance in parameter estimation.	estimation theory;monte carlo method;polynomial;propagation constant;sampling (signal processing)	Jonathan A.

We describe here the generalization of discrete cyclic convolution to convolution over these groups and show how it reduces to multiplication in the spectral domain. Finite group-based convolution is de ned in both the spatial and spectral domains and its properties established. We pay particular attention to wreath product cyclic groups and further describe convolution properties from a geometric view point, in terms of operations with speci c signals and lters. Group-based correlation is de ned in a natural way and its properties follow from those of convolution. We nally consider an application of convolution: the detection of similarity of perceptually similar signals, and an application of correlation: the detection of similarity of group transformed signals. Several examples using images are included to demonstrate the ideas pictorially.

This question naturally arises in the stability analysis of switching systems with constrained switching sequences.  Our main contribution is a sufficient condition for the boundedness of all the possible products of matrices that may occur in a marginally unstable system. We show that this condition can be expressed in terms of products of finite lengths, and is therefore algorithmically checkable.  We then compare our condition with a second one, inspired by a lifting procedure introduced by Kozyakin, and prove that our condition is at least as powerful as this second one.	algorithm;automaton;control theory;electronic switching system;lifting scheme;petri net;probabilistically checkable proof;regular language	Matthew Philippe;Raphaël M.

Unlike recently proposed multichannel blind equalization techniques, the methods described herein employ a model based on physical channel parameters rather than unstructured singleinput, multi-output FIR filters. The algorithms exploit similarities between a model for the data in the frequency domain and the standard direction-of-arrival estimation problem. This connection between the two problems suggests several different approaches based on, for example, maximum likelihood, MODE, IQML, and ESPRIT. These approaches are developed in some detail, and the results of several simulation examples are included to compare their performance.	algorithm;blind equalization;direction of arrival;finite impulse response;multipath propagation;regular expression;simulation;stationary process	A.

In general the presence of delay in differential equations can change the stability of an equilibrium to instability and causes the appearance of oscillatory solutions. In this paper we consider a SIS epidemiological model with demographic effects: birth, mortality and mortality caused by infection. The delay is the period of infection. We define the concept of oscillation in the sense that solutions of the model studied fluctuate around a steady state. Our goal is to show that in this model, there are oscillating solutions for certain parameters values. We determine a large set of initial data for which solutions of this model are slowly oscillating.	instability;multi-compartment model;steady state	Abderrhaman Iggidr;K. Niri;E.

1f123d44ec223a96b66945a646872faf4849163d	estimation of stochastic signals under partially missing information	least squares linear estimate;estimation of missing signals	A new method for the estimation of a large set of stochastic signals is proposed and justified. A specific restriction is that a priori information on the set of input-output signal pairs can only be obtained, in the form of covariance matrices (or their estimates), for a small subset of signal pairs. Nevertheless it is required to estimate each reference signal. We call this procedure signal estimation under partially missing information. The conceptual foundation of the proposed filter is an optimal least squares Hadamard-quadratic estimate of the incremental change to the observed signal pairs, extended by a natural linear interpolation to an estimated value for each intermediate reference signal. The new filter is expressed in terms of Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrices and therefore is always well-defined. HighlightsThe piecewise linear interpolation filter is developed to estimate missing signals.A priori information can be obtained on only a few signals.The filter is defined in terms of pseudo-inverse matrices and therefore is always well defined.The proposed filter mitigates to some extent the difficulties associated with known approaches.

The recursive state and parameter estimator is built on the framework of polynomial chaos theory and maximum likelihood estimation. The estimator quantifies the reliability of its estimate in real-time by recursively calculating a signal-to-noise ratio. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indicates how well the output of the reduced-order estimation model matches the actual system output. A detection algorithm makes decisions to trust or distrust the current estimate by comparing the current value of the SNR ratio against a threshold value. This paper applies the proposed techniques to estimate the sprung mass of an actual vehicle. It uses a reduced-order model to approximate the complex ride dynamics of the vehicle. Despite the modeling approximations and simplifications, the proposed technique is able to reliably estimate the sprung mass of the vehicle to within 10% of the true value.	approximation algorithm;chaos theory;distrust;experiment;mass effect trilogy;polynomial;real-time clock;recursion (computer science);sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;state space	Benjamin L.

Assuming that the fluid limit model associated to the queueing network satisfies a state space collapse condition, we show that the queueing network is stable provided that any solution of an associated linear Skorokhod problem is attracted to the origin in finite time. We also give sufficient conditions ensuring this attraction in terms of the reflection matrix of the Skorokhod problem, by using an adequate Lyapunov function. State space collapse establishes that the fluid limit of the queue process can be expressed in terms of the fluid limit of the workload process by means of a lifting matrix.	lambda lifting;lyapunov fractal;queueing theory;state space	Rosario Delgado	2010	Math.

The linear chain trick technique is employed to prove the upper boundedness of solutions of the impulsive delay differential equations and scaling method techniques for inequalities and classification method are used to study the permanence of the high-dimensional system. We also prove that the ‘infection-free’ periodic solution of the system is globally attractive when R1 < 1 and the system is permanent under R2 > 1. Moreover, numerical simulation for impulsive and delayed system is presented to illustrate our main conclusions which shows that time delays and pulse vaccination have significant effects on the dynamics behaviors of the model. The feature of the present paper is that the double epidemic hypothesis have different forms of delays to more realistically describe the spread of epidemic though which makes the highdimensional system more complex. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Soc. Indust. Appl. Math., 11 (1963), pp. 205--211] describes a novel and very useful method for resolving degeneracy in the Simplex method for Linear Programming (LP). The simplicity and reliability of the method makes it an excellent choice in this author's opinion. The method is described here in the context of an active set method (ASM) format for LP. The method solves recursively generated subproblems that are smaller than the original, which contributes to efficiency. Data structures are described that enable the recursive aspect of the method to be implemented very easily with minimal storage overhead. The method is extended to solve a general form of linearly constrained optimization problem that includes quadratic programming (QP) and allows simple bounds on the variables and both equation and inequality general linear constraints. Issues of round-off error are discussed and heuristics are described that have proved to be very reliable in practice.

This paper proposes an O(n) algorithm by encoding the inverse matrices required for the solution of the linear system to a few parameters in order to obtain an approximate solution for the harmonic model.

7ca503c644ac282c56a2bcede72c3d516d5f9da5	recursive linearly constrained minimum variance estimator in linear models with non-stationary constraints		Abstract In parameter estimation, it is common place to design a linearly constrained minimum variance estimator (LCMVE) to tackle the problem of estimating an unknown parameter vector in a linear regression model. So far, the LCMVE has been mainly studied in the context of stationary constraints in stationary or non-stationary environments, giving rise to well-established recursive adaptive implementations when multiple observations are available. In this communication, provided that the additive noise sequence is temporally uncorrelated, we determine the family of non-stationary constraints leading to LCMVEs which can be computed according to a predictor/corrector recursion similar to the Kalman Filter. A particularly noteworthy feature of the recursive formulation introduced is to be fully adaptive in the context of sequential estimation as it allows at each new observation to incorporate or not new constraints.	linear model;recursion (computer science);stationary process	François Vincent;Eric Chaumette	2018	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.03.016	sequential estimation;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;linear model;estimator;mathematical optimization;recursion;kalman filter;mathematics;linear regression;estimation theory	ML	57.08309428621088	5.494434548141923	40736

They are transformed using a wavelet-based Galerkin method into a symmetric """"block-slanted Toeplitz (BST)"""" system of equations. Levinson-like and Schur-like fast algorithms are developed for solving the symmetric BST system of equations. The significance of these algorithms is as follows. If the kernel of the integral equation is not a Calderon-Zygmund operator, the wavelet transform may not sparsify it. The kernel of the Krein and Wiener-Hopf integral equations does not, in general, satisfy the Calderon-Zygmund conditions. As a result, application of the wavelet transform to the integral equation does not yield a sparse system matrix. There is, therefore, a need for fast algorithms that directly exploit the (symmetric block-slanted Toeplitz) structure of the system matrix and do not rely on sparsity. The first such O(n/sup 2/) algorithms, viz., a Levinson-like algorithm and a Schur (1917) like algorithm, are presented. These algorithms are also applied to the factorization of the BST system matrix. The Levinson-like algorithm also yields a test for positive definiteness of the BST system matrix. The results obtained are directly applicable to the problem of constrained deconvolution of a nonstationary signal, where the locations of the smooth regions of the signal being deconvolved are known a priori."""	levinson recursion;time complexity;toeplitz hash algorithm;wavelet	Rajashri R.

The proposed filter uses two observation windows and it can be described as a locally adaptive linear filter. One window (usually the largest) collects the inputs of the linear filter while the threshold decomposition of the other one is used to compute the weights. As in the case of ETBF, the new filter possesses an MSE-optimal design similar to linear filters. An efficient iterative design algorithm is developed for the proposed filter which also applies for ETBF. Experimental results show that the new method can provide better filtering performance than ETBF.

In this context, the second-order statistics of the data are often unknown a priori or their direct computation is too intensive, and they have to be estimated on-line from the related signals. In the context of batch optimization of an objective function being the sum of a data fidelity term and a penalization (e.g. a sparsity promoting function), Majorize-Minimize (MM) subspace methods have recently attracted much interest since they are fast, highly flexible and effective in ensuring convergence. The goal of this paper is to show how these methods can be successfully extended to the case when the cost function is replaced by a sequence of stochastic approximations of it. Simulation results illustrate the good practical performance of the proposed MM Memory Gradient (3MG) algorithm when applied to 2D filter identification.	algorithm;approximation;computation;gradient;loss function;machine learning;mathematical optimization;online and offline;optimization problem;simulation;sparse matrix;stochastic optimization	Emilie Chouzenoux;Jean-Christophe Pesquet;Anisia Florescu	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		adaptive filter;stochastic approximation;mathematical optimization;kernel adaptive filter;theoretical computer science;stochastic optimization;online machine learning;machine learning;mathematics	ML	61.46990758498325	11.171105199834699	40855

We tackle the problem from a switching systems perspective in which available information known on the packet loss signal, e.g., there cannot be more than a given maximum number of consecutive losses, is modelled through an automaton. For the resulting constrained switching system, we reformulate the controllability problem into an easier-to-study formulation through an algebraic characterization.  We show that the particular case where the packet loss signal does not contain more than N consecutive dropouts (N G N) boils down to a similar controllability problem with switching delays previously studied in the literature. For the general case, i.e., for an arbitrary automaton describing the lossy behaviour, we exploit the algebraic characterization and establish that our controllability problem of constrained switching systems is algorithmically solvable. This latter result is obtained by connecting it with the celebrated Skolem Theorem from linear algebra.	linear system;network packet	Raphaël M. Jungers;W. P. M. H.

In this article, semi-invariants are used to construct explicitly Lyapunov functions useful for studying the stability of the origin, for continuous-time systems. Moreover, using well-known tools from differential geometry such as (orbital) symmetries, it is shown how semi-invariants can be found for several classes of systems. Important connections with centre manifold theory are pointed out. By using the proposed general techniques, a new proof of a result claimed to Bendixson (Bendixson, I.

As a case study of ZMI with examples, the online solution of ZMI is investigated in this paper. Specifically, different Zhang functions (ZFs), which lead to different effective Z-type models (i.e., Zhang neural nets), are proposed and implemented as the error basis functions for ZMI. Meanwhile, a specific relationship between the Z-type model and others' model/method [i.e., the Getz and Marsden (G-M) dynamic system] is presented. Eventually, the MATLAB Simulink modeling and simulative verifications with examples using such different Z-type models are further researched. Both theoretical analysis and modeling results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed Z-type models which originate from different ZFs for ZMI.	artificial neural network;basis function;computer simulation;dynamical system;electronic circuit;inline linking;matlab;problem solving;simulink;time complexity;zope	Dongsheng Guo;Binbin Qiu;Zhende Ke;Zhi Yang;Yunong Zhang	2014	2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889367	convergence;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical model;mathematics;algorithm	AI	73.48544094701242	5.777759691990676	41369

Shekhtman, L. Skrzypek, On the non-uniqueness of minimal projections in Lp spaces]). The aim of this paper is examine the connection of the Chalmers–Metcalf operator (introduced in [B.L. Chalmers, F.T. Metcalf, A characterization and equations for minimal projections and extensions, J. Oper. Theory 32 (1994) 31–46]) to the uniqueness of minimal projections. The main theorem of this paper is Theorem 2.2. It relates uniqueness of minimal projections to the invertibility of the Chalmers–Metcalf operator. It is worth mentioning that to a given minimal projection (even unique) we may find many different Chalmers–Metcalf operators, some of them invertible, some not—see Example 2.6. The main application is in Section 3, where we have proven that minimal projections onto symmetric subspaces in smooth Banach spaces are unique (Theorem 3.2). This leads (in Section 4) to the solution of the problem of uniqueness of classical Rademacher projections in Lp[0, 1] for 1 < p < ∞. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

More precisely, we use Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms to produce a smaller SDP whose solution preserves feasibility or approximates the value of the original problem with high probability. These techniques allow to improve both complexity and storage space requirements. They apply to problems in which the Schatten 1-norm of the matrices specifying the SDP and of a solution to the problem is constant in the problem size. Furthermore, we provide some no-go results which clarify the limitations of positive, linear sketches in this setting. Finally, we discuss numerical examples to benchmark our methods.	analysis of algorithms;benchmark (computing);complexity;dimensionality reduction;map;numerical analysis;numerical method;requirement;semidefinite programming;with high probability	Andreas Bluhm;Daniel Stilck Franca	2017	CoRR	10.1016/j.laa.2018.11.012	mathematics;combinatorics;dimensionality reduction;matrix (mathematics);mathematical optimization;sketch	Theory	74.61144298953153	26.62062740078877	41450

Then we obtain an optimal measure which is approximated by a finite combination of atomic measures, and by using atomic measures we change this one to an finite dimensional linear programming problem. Finally we find the approximated trajectory functions. Some examples are given show the procedure. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These constraints are understood as ones in the Hilbert space (L_2). A major advantage of the constraints of the original problem which are understood as ones in (L_2) is that the resulting dual regularization algorithm is stable with respect to errors in the input data and leads to the construction of a minimizing approximate solution in the sense of J. Warga. Simultaneously, this dual algorithm yields the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for minimizing sequences, namely, the stable, with respect to perturbation of input data, sequential or, in other words, regularized Lagrange principle in nondifferential form and Pontryagin maximum principle for the original problem. Regardless of the fact that the stability or instability of the original optimal control problem, they stably generate a minimizing approximate solutions for it. For this reason, we can interpret these regularized Lagrange principle and Pontryagin maximum principle as tools for direct solving unstable optimal control problems and reducing to them unstable inverse problems.	control theory;distributed computing;optimal control;pontryagin's maximum principle	Mikhail Sumin	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-55795-3_46	diffusing update algorithm;hilbert space;parabola;inverse problem;regularization (mathematics);mathematical optimization;optimal control;pointwise;mathematics;hamiltonian (control theory)	Theory	77.18762366250205	24.639647388689692	41573

This original concept is interested in the reconstruction of the state only on a subregion Γ of the boundary of the system evolution domain ∂Ω . We give definition and some properties of this notion and we show that under some hypothesis, the regional boundary observability is guarantied. We use the analytical case by sectorial property of the considered dynamic operator and converted to a fixed point problem, and we show that it is possible to reconstruct such a state on a desired subregion Γ . This approach leads to interesting results which are performed through numerical example and simulations.	commutation theorem;fixed point (mathematics);numerical analysis;semilinear response;simulation	Ali Boutoulout;Hamid Bourray;Fatima-Zahrae El Alaoui	2015	IMA J.

A main advantage of the present PWGM over the existing wavelet Galerkin methods lies in that the wavelet expansion coefficients are exactly obtained without calculating the wavelet integrations. Therefore, the computational cost is low whereas the accuracy is high. After discretization, the linear and nonlinear integral equations is converted into a system of linear and nonlinear equations respectively, and for the linear case the matrix can be converted into a sparse and symmetrical one by Fast wavelet transform (FWT). Numerical experiments show that the PWGM has a good degree of accuracy. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Motivated by the disease paradigm articulated by Ross, atherogenesis is viewed as an inflammatory spiral with a positive feedback loop involving key cellular and chemical species interacting and reacting within the intimal layer of muscular arteries. The inflammatory spiral is initiated as an instability from a healthy state which is defined to be an equilibrium state devoid of certain key inflammatory markers. Disease initiation is studied through a linear, asymptotic stability analysis of a healthy equilibrium state. Various theorems are proved, giving conditions on system parameters guaranteeing stability of the health state, and a general framework is developed for constructing perturbations from a healthy state that exhibit blow-up, which are interpreted as corresponding to disease initiation. The analysis reveals key features that arterial geometry, antioxidant levels, and the source of inflammatory components (through coupled third-kind boundary conditions or through body sources) play in disease initiation.	instability;interaction;perturbation theory;positive feedback;programming paradigm;systems modeling	Akif Ibragimov;Laura Rylie Ritter;Jay R.

For such systems, we consider the problem of designing controllers that minimize the expected cost of meeting demand, while respecting distribution system and resource constraints. Employing a linear approximation of the branch flow model, we formulate this problem as the design of a decentralized disturbance-feedback controller that minimizes the expected value of a convex quadratic cost function, subject to convex quadratic constraints on the state and input. As such problems are, in general, computationally intractable, we derive an inner approximation to this decentralized control problem, which enables the efficient computation of an affine control policy via the solution of a conic program. As affine policies are, in general, suboptimal for the systems considered, we provide an efficient method to bound their suboptimality via the solution of another conic program. A case study of a 12 kV radial distribution feeder demonstrates that decentralized affine controllers can perform close to optimal.	computation;computational complexity theory;control theory;distributed control system;inverter (logic gate);linear approximation;loss function;radial (radio);solar inverter	Weixuan Lin;Eilyan Bitar	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778777	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.93891667260091	31.76584312949753	42212

SLRA can be described as the problem of finding a low rank approximation of an observed matrix which has the same structure as this matrix (such as Hankel). We demonstrate that the optimization problem arising is typically very difficult: in particular, the objective function is multiextremal even for simple cases. The main theme of the paper is to suggest that the difficulties described in approximating a solution of the SLRA problem open huge possibilities for the application of stochastic methods of global optimization.	algorithm;global optimization;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem	Jonathan Gillard;Anatoly A.

We derive sufficient conditions guaranteeing that the tracking error remains bounded to second order with the size of the time step even if the LCP is solved only approximately. We use these results to derive a fast, augmented Lagrangian tracking algorithm and demonstrate the developments through a numerical case study.	nonlinear programming;real-time clock	Victor M.

028d9534c09a9977e2d6c20b25321fca1022fa5d	solving conic optimization problems via self-dual embedding and facial reduction: a unified approach		We establish connections between the facial reduction algorithm of Borwein and Wolkowicz and the self-dual homogeneous model of Goldman and Tucker when applied to conic optimization problems. Specifically, we show the self-dual homogeneous model returns facial reduction certificates when it fails to return a primal-dual optimal solution or a certificate of infeasibility. Using this observation, we give an algorithm, based on facial reduction, for solving the primal problem that, in principle, always succeeds. (An analogous algorithm is easily stated for the dual problem.) This algorithm has the appealing property that it only performs facial reduction when it is required, not when it is possible; e.g., if a primal-dual optimal solution exists, it will be found in lieu of a facial reduction certificate even if Slater’s condition fails. For the case of linear, second-order and semidefinite optimization, we show the algorithm can be implemented assuming oracle access to the central-path limit-point of an extended-embedding, a strictly feasible conic problem with strictly feasible dual. We then give numerical experiments illustrating barriers to practical implementation.	algorithm;conic optimization;duality (optimization);experiment;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;tucker decomposition	Frank Permenter;Henrik A.

c8b20ec68f680f734995610bddeea4122aee8066	an algorithm for the numerical evaluation of the associated legendre functions that runs in time independent of degree and order		We describe a method for the numerical evaluation of normalized versions of the associated Legendre functions P−μ ν and Q −μ ν of degrees 0 ≤ ν ≤ 1, 000, 000 and orders −ν ≤ μ ≤ ν on the interval (−1, 1). Our algorithm, which runs in time independent of ν and μ, is based on the fact that while the associated Legendre functions themselves are extremely expensive to represent via polynomial expansions, the logarithms of certain solutions of the differential equation defining them are not. We exploit this by numerically precomputing the logarithms of carefully chosen solutions of the associated Legendre differential equation and representing them via piecewise trivariate Chebyshev expansions. These precomputed expansions, which allow for the rapid evaluation of the associated Legendre functions over a large swath of parameter domain mentioned above, are supplemented with asymptotic and series expansions in order to cover it entirely. The results of numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of our approach are presented, and our code for evaluating the associated Legendre functions is publicly available.	algorithm;chebyshev polynomials;double-precision floating-point format;experiment;ieee 754-1985;laguerre polynomials;numerical analysis;polynomial;precomputation;prolate spheroidal wave function	James Bremer	2018	J.

Much of the nontrivial dynamics of this map occur when its fixed point or periodic orbit hits the switching manifold resulting in the so-called border collision bifurcation. We study the local and global bifurcation phenomena resulting from such borderline collisions. The conditions for the occurrence of nonsmooth period-doubling, saddle-node, and Neimark–Sacker bifurcations are derived. We show that dangerous border collision bifurcation can also occur in this map. Global bifurcations arise in connection with the occurrence of nonsmooth Neimark–Sacker bifurcation by which a spiral attractor turns into a saddle focus. The global dynamics are systematically explored through the computation of resonance tongues and numerical continuation of modelocked invariant circles. We demonstrate the transition to chaos through the breakdown of modelocked torus by degenerate period-doubling bifurcation, homoclinic tangency, etc. We show that in this map a mode-locked torus can be transformed into a quasiperiodic torus if there is no global bifurcation.	bifurcation theory;chaos theory;computation;control theory;dissipative system;emoticon;fixed point (mathematics);global optimization;jacobian matrix and determinant;map;numerical analysis;numerical continuation;pdf/a;period-doubling bifurcation;quasiperiodicity;resonance;rössler attractor	Soma de;Partha Sharathi Dutta;Soumitro Banerjee;Akhil Ranjan Roy	2011	I.

The Fourier transform of the fractional time derivative in the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo senses, however, involves a complex power function of the fractional order. In this study, a positive time derivative of fractional or odd integer order is introduced to respect the positivity in modeling the anomalous diffusions.	mathematical model	Weiteng Chen	2002	CoRR		fourier transform;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;power function;fractional calculus;fractional fourier transform;time derivative;calculus;mathematical model;mathematics;anomalous diffusion;generalizations of the derivative	Theory	79.00405622625237	10.337768396934274	42715

In this paper, we prove that signal resampling based on polynomial interpolation can be reversible even for integer signals, i.e., the original signal can be reconstructed losslessly from the resampled data. By using matrix factorization, we also propose a reversible method for uniform shifted resampling and uniform scaled and shifted resampling. The new factorization yields three elementary integer-reversible matrices. The method is actually a new way to compute linear transforms and a lossless integer implementation of linear transforms with the factor matrices. It can be applied to integer signals by in-place integer-reversible computation, which needs no auxiliary memory to keep the original sample data for the transformation during the process or for ldquoundordquo recovery after the process. Some examples of low-order resampling solutions are also presented in this paper and our experiments show that the resampling error relative to the original signal is comparable to that of the traditional irreversible resampling.	arithmetic underflow;auxiliary memory;computation;experiment;in-place algorithm;lossless compression;matrix representation;polynomial interpolation;propagation of uncertainty;resampling (statistics);reversible computing;rounding;runge–kutta methods;scott continuity;software propagation;spline (mathematics)	Pengwei Hao	2009	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.2008243	stirling number;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;image processing;signal processing;mathematics;matrix decomposition;statistics	Visualization	57.320539946181015	20.510579028836055	42719

A positive invariant set is a subset of the state-space such that if the initial state of the system belongs to this set, then the state of the system remains inside the set for all future time instances. In this work, we present a procedure that constructs an invariant set, iteratively, starting from an initial polyhedron that forms a “guess” at the invariant. At each iterative step, our procedure attempts to prove that the given polyhedron is a positive invariant by setting up a non-linear optimization problem for each facet of the current polyhedron. This is relaxed to a linear program through the use of the blossoming principle for polynomials. If the current iterate fails to be invariant, we attempt to use local sensitivity analysis using the primal-dual solutions of the linear program to push its faces outwards/inwards in a bid to make it invariant. Doing so, however, keeps the face normals of the iterates fixed for all steps. In this paper, we generalize the process to vary the normal vectors as well as the offsets for the individual faces. Doing so, makes the procedure completely general, but at the same time increases its complexity. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the new approach allows our procedure to recover from a poor choice of templates initially to yield better invariants.	boyce–codd normal form;complexity;computation;degeneracy (graph theory);dynamical system;invariant (computer science);iteration;iterative method;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;polyhedron;polynomial;state space	Mohamed Amin Ben Sassi;Antoine Girard;Sriram Sankaranarayanan	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7040384	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;invariant polynomial;invariant measure;invariant;control theory;mathematics	Vision	76.3384328730148	26.643296888958137	42739

In some cases these rational functions achieve approximation of much higher quality than the classical polynomial interpolants, which, e.g., are ill-conditioned and lead to Runge’s phenomenon if the interpolation nodes are equispaced. For such nodes, however, the condition of Floater–Hormann interpolation deteriorates exponentially with increasing d. In this paper, an extension of the Floater–Hormann family with improved condition at equispaced nodes is presented and investigated. The efficiency of its applications such as the approximation of derivatives, integrals and primitives of functions is compared to the corresponding results recently obtained with the original family of rational interpolants.

For economy and speed, intermediate results are truncated so that the least-significant digits correspond to values only a few orders of magnitude smaller than the error estimate. Type definitions and the standard arithmetic operations, together with conversions to and from integers, are provided in one package. The mathematical constants π and Euler's gamma are incorporated to a maximum precision of 320 digits in a package that also contains all of the standard elementary functions.

The proposed strategy embraces two-experiment approach to the system identification, in which system is excited with random process in passive experiment and with binary process in active experiment. The proposed approach uses both parametric (least squares) and nonparametric (kernel estimates) identification tools.

In particular, we derive the following: (1) a recursive algorithm to invert a full matrix whose inverse is structured as a block tridiagonal matrix; (2) a recursive algorithm to compute the inverse of a structured block tridiagonal matrix. These algorithms are exact. They reduce the computational complexity respectively by two and one orders of magnitude over the direct inversion of the associated matrices. We apply these algorithms to develop a computationally e cient approximate implementation of the Kalman-Bucy lter (KBf) that we refer to as the local KBf. The computational e ort of the local KBf is reduced by a factor of I over the exact KBf while exhibiting near-optimal performance.	approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;computation;computational complexity theory;open road tolling;recursion (computer science)	Amir Asif;José M.

Simulation results verify that the resulted risk estimator gives better indication on threshold selection comparing with the traditional GCV method. Improved denoising performance is then achieved particularly for higher multiplicity multiwavelet shrinkage.	cross-validation (statistics);noise power;noise reduction;simulation	Tai-Chiu Hsung;Daniel Pak-Kong Lun	2004	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2004.827924	shrinkage estimator;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics;wavelet transform	Robotics	56.66774473094468	10.86565966737255	43165

Different techniques have been recently proposed to reduce this computational load. For those working on blocks of data, the number of flops required is generally O(N/sup 2/P), where P, which is the dimension of the subspace (the number of sources), is often quite small as compared with N, which is the number of sensors. The method we propose is a HR technique that requires O(NP/sup 2/)+O(P/sup 3/) flops, i.e., that is linear in the number of sensors. The price to be paid for this drastic computational saving is a reduction in performance. Although the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the variance of the direction estimates is of the order T/sup -1/ N/sup -3/ (with T the number of snapshots), this variance is of order T/sup -1/ N/sup -2/ for the proposed procedure. The idea behind the method is to apply a Pisarenko method to a rectangular matrix extracted from the Toeplerized estimated covariance matrix, and it is this Toeplerization that allows preservation of the O(T/sup -1/ N/sup -2/) level of performance.	pisarenko harmonic decomposition	Jean-Jacques Fuchs	1996	IEEE Trans.

An fuzzy logical system-based adaptive distributed controller is designed to achieve the synchronization. The asymptotic convergence of synchronization errors is analyzed by combining algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory. In contrast to the existing results, the proposed synchronization control method is applicable for the CDN with system uncertainties and unknown topology. Especially, the considered uncertainties are allowed to occur in the node local dynamics as well as in the interconnections of different nodes. In addition, it is shown that a unified controller design framework is derived for the CDN with or without coupling delays.

Rather than recomputing the preconditioner from scratch, it is potentially more efficient to update the previous preconditioner. Unfortunately, it is not always known how to update a preconditioner, for example, when the preconditioner is an incomplete factorization. A recently proposed iterative algorithm for computing incomplete factorizations, however, is able to exploit an initial guess, unlike existing algorithms for incomplete factorizations. By treating a previous factorization as an initial guess to this algorithm, an incomplete factorization may thus be updated. We use a sequence of problems from model order reduction. Experimental results using an optimized GPU implementation show that updating a previous factorization can be inexpensive and effective, making solving sequences of linear systems a potential niche problem for the iterative incomplete factorization algorithm.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computer;graphics processing unit;incomplete lu factorization;iteration;iterative method;krylov subspace;linear system;model order reduction;niche blogging;numerical analysis;parallel computing;precomputation;preconditioner;qr decomposition;the matrix	Hartwig Anzt;Edmond Chow;Jens Saak;Jack J.

At the core of algebraic signal processi ng is the concept of a linear signal model defined as a triple(A, M, Φ), where familiar concepts like the filter space and the signal s pace are cast as an algebraA and a module M, respectively, and Φ generalizes the concept of thez-transform to bijective linear mappings from a vector space of, e.g., signal samples, into t he moduleM. A signal model provides the structure for a particular linear signal processing application, such as infinite and fi nite discrete time, or infinite or finite discrete space, or the var ious forms of multidimensional linear signal processing. As soo n as a signal model is chosen, basic ingredients follow, includi ng the associated notions of filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. The shift operator q, which is at the heart of ergodic theory and dynamical systems, is a key concept in the algebraic theo ry: it is the generator of the algebra of filters A. Once the shift is chosen, a well-defined methodology leads to the associate d signal model. Different shifts correspond to infinite and finite time models with associated infinite and finitez-transforms, and to infinite and finite space models with associated infinite and fi nite C-transforms (that we introduce). In particular, we show that the 16 discrete cosine and sine transforms are Fourier transfor ms for the finite space models. Other definitions of the shift naturally lead to new signal models and to new transforms as associated Fourier transforms in one and higher dimensions, separableand non-separable. We explain in algebraic terms shift-invariance (the algebr a of filters A is commutative), the role of boundary conditions and signal extensions, the connections between linear transfo rms and linear finite Gauss-Markov fields, and several other concept s and connections. Finally, the algebraic theory is a means to dis cover, concisely derive, explain, and classify fast transform alg orithms, which is the subject of a future paper.	algebraic signal processing;boundary case;dynamical system;ergodic theory;ergodicity;fractional fourier transform;limbo;linear algebra;markov chain	Markus Püschel;José M.

777e765e3339d4b902475e607e658d83cf59c09f	iterative construction of complete lyapunov functions		Dynamical systems describe the evolution of quantities governed by differential equations. Hence, they represent a very powerful prediction tool in many disciplines such as physics and engineering, chemistry and biology and even in economics, among others. Their importance relies on their capability of predicting, as a function of time, future states of the corresponding system under consideration by means of the current, known state. Many difficulties arise when trying to solve such systems. Complete Lyapunov functions allow for the systematic study of complicated dynamical systems. In this paper, we present a new iterative algorithm that avoids obtaining trivial solutions when constructing complete Lyapunov functions. This algorithm is based on mesh-free numerical approximation and analyzes the failure of convergence in certain areas to determine the chain-recurrent set.	approximation algorithm;collocation;computation;dynamical system;failure;iteration;iterative method;lyapunov fractal;molecular orbital;numerical analysis;time complexity	Carlos Argáez;Peter Giesl;Sigurdur F.

The channel noise floor is often adaptively estimated from the FFT filter bank output and Tn is mostly computed by solving a non-linear equation, which can be reliably accomplished when, L, the number of input data blocks, and, N, the number of FFT bins assigned to a channel, are both relatively small. However, when L or N is large, numerical procedures often break down, yielding invalid results. This paper provides new theoretical results concerning the computation of Tn. Using two inequalities involving positively weighted sums of central χ2 random variables, it is shown that the Tn for overlapped input data with an overlap ratio not exceeding 50% is larger than the Tn for non-overlapped input data, assuming that the same number of input data blocks is processed by the FFT. This inequality can be used as a first level of sanity check when verifying results obtained by procedures such as the Newton-Ralphson and the golden section search algorithms.	channel (communications);computation;fast fourier transform;filter bank;linear equation;newton;newton–cotes formulas;noise (electronics);noise floor;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sanity check;search algorithm;sensor;social inequality;verification and validation	Sichun Wang;Robert J.

Artificial neural networks commonly transform the weighted sum of inputs to describe overall similarity relationships of trained and new testing input patterns. Differential polynomial neural networks form a new class of neural networks, which construct and solve an unknown general partial differential equation of a function of interest with selected substitution relative terms using non-linear multi-variable composite polynomials. The layers of the network generate simple and composite relative substitution terms whose convergent series combinations can describe partial dependent derivative changes of the input variables. This regression is based on trained generalized partial derivative data relations, decomposed into a multi-layer polynomial network structure. The sigmoidal function, commonly used as a nonlinear activation of artificial neurons, may transform some polynomial items together with the parameters with the aim to improve the polynomial derivative term series ability to approximate complicated periodic functions, as simple low order polynomials are not able to fully make up for the complete cycles. The similarity analysis facilitates substitutions for differential equations or can form dimensional units from data samples to describe real-world problems.

In addition, preprocessing is an essential step for efficiency in both simplex type and interior-point methods. However, the theory and preprocessing techniques can fail for cone programming over nonpolyhedral cones. We take a fresh look at known and new results for duality, optimality, constraint qualifications, CQ, and strict complementarity, for linear cone optimization problems in finite dimensions. One theme is the notion of minimal representation of the cone and the constraints. This provides a framework for preprocessing cone optimization problems in order to avoid both the theoretical and numerical difficulties that arise due to the (near) loss of the strong CQ, strict feasibility. We include results and examples on the surprising theoretical connection between duality gaps in the original primal-dual pair and lack of strict complementarity in their homogeneous counterpart. Our emphasis is on results that deal with Semidefinite Programming, SDP.	algorithm;complementarity (physics);complementarity theory;conic optimization;conjunctive query;convex cone;interior point method;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;linear programming;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;preprocessor;semidefinite programming;strong duality	Levent Tunçel;Henry Wolkowicz	2012	Comp.

8f5a2be6d28903a7cfe4f6d73e09527b95054072	a unified perspective of evolutionary game dynamics using generalized growth transforms		In this paper, we show that different types of evolutionary game dynamics are, in principle, special cases of a dynamical system model based on our previously reported framework of generalized growth transforms. The framework shows that different dynamics arise as a result of minimizing a population energy such that the population as a whole evolves to reach the most stable state. By introducing a population dependent time-constant in the generalized growth transform model, the proposed framework can be used to explain a vast repertoire of evolutionary dynamics, including some novel forms of game dynamics with non-linear payoffs.	dynamical system;nonlinear system	Oindrila Chatterjee;Shantanu Chakrabartty	2018	CoRR			ML	74.68163080414122	5.989507153268324	43649

An exact expression for the ML criterion is derived in terms of the linear prediction polynomial of the signal, and an iterative al0096-3518/86/1000-1081$01.00 O 1986 IEEE cannot be tolerated. Unfortunately, direct maximization of the likelihood function, which is highly nonlinear in the unknown signal parameters, requires a computationally expensive multidimensional search. We take here a different route (see also [MI), deriving an exact expression for the ML criterion in terms of the prediction polynomial of the noiseless signal. An iterative algorithm for the minimization of the ML criterion is then presented, which requires only the solution of a quadratic minimization problem at each step and converges in a small number of steps, to produce the ML estimate of the pr diction polynomial. By the invariance principle of the ML estimate, the roots of the polynomial are the ML estimates of the signal exponential parameters. An important aspect of our approach is that it is equally applicable in cases of signal coherence in the array problem, which have required specific treatment in previous approaches, such as in the work of Evans et al. [ 191 and Shan et al. [20]. Almost identical algorithms have been derived independently of ours by Kumaresan et al. [21] and by Kumaresan and Shaw [22], respectively, for the time series and the array problems, by adapting an algorithm for filter design of Evans and Fischl [23]. The differences between our algorithm and theirs are pointed out in Section IV. In particular, we describe an extension of the algorithm to the case when, rather than the signals themselves, only their sample covariance is available. In addition to the practical value of the algorithm described in this paper, the present formulation is used to interpret previous methods such as the methods of Prony , Pisarenko, and modifications thereof (e.g., [4]-[6], and [9]), as (often poor) approximations to the exact ML; some of them can, in fact, be shown to result from the first iteration of our algorithm. Furthermore, our formulation provides a unifying framework in two respects: 1) complex, real, either damped or undamped sinusoids are treated by the same approach, by imposing various constraints on the solution .polynomial; 2) the same formulation encompasses the single-experiment (time series) and the multiexperiment (or array) problems. 11.

A typical example is an academy of sciences. The problem is formalized by an infinite horizon optimal control model for a first order PDE with nonlocal dynamics (a McKendrick-type equation). Based on the nonstandard necessary optimality condition proved in the paper, the following results are established: (i) stationarity of the optimal recruitment density; (ii) strong ergodicity of the optimal solution; (iii) principle of “bipolar"""" recruitment in the case where the productivity of the organization is measured by the average age of the members. The analysis involves a new type of transversality condition for the costate system, the stability with respect to perturbations of the optimal solution of a noncoercive (bang-bang type) problem, boundedness, and stability of the solution of a specific Volterra integral equation of the second kind."""	distributed control system	Gustav Feichtinger;Vladimir M.

In contrast to their work, which improves an existing algorithm that is based on the HRVW/KSH/M search direction, we present a primal-dual path-following algorithm that is based on a new search direction, which, roughly speaking, is defined completely within the space of partial symmetric matrices. We show that the proposed algorithm computes a primal-dual solution to the SDP problem having duality gap less than a fraction ε > 0 of the initial duality gap in O(n log(ε−1)) iterations, where n is the size of the matrices involved. Moreover, we present computational results showing that the algorithm possesses several advantages over other existing implementations.	algorithm;computation;duality gap;iteration;semidefinite programming;sparse matrix	Samuel Burer	2003	SIAM Journal on Optimization	10.1137/S105262340240851X	large margin nearest neighbor;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;quadratically constrained quadratic program;mathematics;semidefinite embedding;sparsity-of-effects principle;semidefinite programming;symmetric matrix	Theory	78.8424578257759	24.164956510898204	43956

The purpose of this letter is to introduce a new convolution structure for the LCT that preserves the convolution theorem for the Fourier transform and is also easy to implement in the designing of filters. Some of well-known results about the convolution theorem in FT domain, fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) domain are shown to be special cases of our achieved results.	convolution;fractional fourier transform;linear canonical transformation;signal processing	Deyun Wei;Qi-Wen Ran;Yuanmin Li;Jing Ma;Li-Ying Tan	2009	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2009.2026107	overlap–add method;fourier transform;discrete hartley transform;constant q transform;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;hartley transform;convolution theorem;harmonic wavelet transform;projection-slice theorem;short-time fourier transform;continuous wavelet transform;fractional fourier transform;circulant matrix;discrete fourier transform;signal processing;fourier inversion theorem;mathematics;circular convolution;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;convolution;non-uniform discrete fourier transform	Theory	56.077633037670154	19.181015154660034	44018

Here we apply combinations of symbolic computation methods for mixed equality/inequality systems, specifically virtual substitution, lazy real triangularization and cylindrical algebraic decomposition. We determine multistationarity of an 11-dimensional MAPK network when numeric values are known for all but potentially one parameter.

Shadowing has also been seen to have a role in state estimation and forecasting of nonlinear systems. Shadowing trajectories are guaranteed to exist in hyperbolic systems, but this is not true of non-hyperbolic systems, indeed it can be shown there are systems that cannot have long shadowing trajectories. In this paper we consider what might be called shadowing pseudo-orbits. These are pseudo-orbits that remain close to a given pseudo-orbit, but have smaller mismatches between forecast state and verifying state. Shadowing pseudo-orbits play a useful role in the understanding and analysis of gradient descent noise reduction, state estimation and forecasting nonlinear systems, because their existence can be ensured for a wide class of non-hyperbolic systems. New theoretical results are presented that that extend classical shadowing theorems to shadowing pseudo-orbits. These new results provide some insight into the convergence behaviour of gradient descent noise reduction methods. The paper also discusses, in the light of the new results, some recent numerical results for an operational weather forecasting model when gradient descent noise reduction was employed.	algorithm;chaos theory;control theory;dynamical systems theory;gradient descent;halting problem;noise reduction;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;relevance;verification and validation	Kevin Judd	2008	J.

Robust parameter design aims to make the signal-response relationship insensitive to the noise variation by choosing appropriate levels for the control factors. Taguchi's dynamic signal-to-noise ratio has several limitations for the optimization in multiple target systems.

We prove that around a local minimizer, a second-order stationarity residual can be driven to zero while controlling the growth of Lagrange multipliers and tangent multipliers, which gives a new second-order optimality condition without constraint qualifications stronger than previous ones associated with global convergence of algorithms. We prove that second-order variants of augmented Lagrangian and interior point methods generate sequences satisfying our optimality condition. We present also a companion minimal constraint qualification, weaker than the ones known for second-order methods, that ensures usual global convergence results to a classical second-order stationary point.

We present the conditions for the selection of optimal parameters which are the weights and the memory depth of the filter. The conditions for these two set of parameters are decoupled from each other. This allows a matched filter implementation which gives an estimate of the memory depth. INTRODUCTION Gamma filter is a special case of a broader class of linear systems called the generalized feedforward filters [1 ]. Gamma filter is essentially an IIR filter where the recursion is kept local. It proves to be effective particularly in the identification of systems with long impulse responses. There is a close relationship between the gamma filter and the Laguerre filter such that the Laguerre filter is an orthogonalized form of the gamma filter [2]. Parameters of the gamma filter are the weights w’s and the memory depth λ. Their optimum values can be found by solving the extended Wiener-Hopf equations [1 ] either offline or adaptively. Due to the non-convex nature of the performance with respect to the memory depth, one faces the problem of local minima. In this paper we present a method to estimate the values of the local minima of the memory depth. This method decouples the solution of the memory depth λ from that of the weights. The method is based on constructing a matched filter for the optimal condition, and passing the desired signal through such a structure. The zero crossings of the output define the optimal values of the memory depth parameter. We present the theory that gave rise to the method, and present an example. GAMMA FILTER OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the generalized feedforward filters. For the gamma filter G(s) is given by ( 1) which means that the system transfer function is ( 2) In the identification of a signal d(t), the optimal coefficients can be obtained by minimizing the output mean square error, i.e. solving for (3) G s ( ) λ s λ + = Y s ( ) wiG s ( ) i i 1 = K ∑ = ∂J ∂wi 0 = i 1...K = and ∂J ∂λ 0 = where J is the mean square error defined as the average of (d(t)-y(t))2 over all t’s. For a given λ the optimal value for Figure 1 Generalized feedforward filter the weights is trivially obtained by solving the WienerHopf equation [3]. The optimal value for λ can be obtained in the following manner. The minimum value of J when the weights are set to their optimum values is called the Schur complement [4], and occurs when the error of approximation is orthogonal to all the bases g 1(t)...gK(t) (2)	approximation;coefficient;diagram;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;gamma correction;infinite impulse response;linear system;matched filter;maxima and minima;mean squared error;online and offline;optimization problem;recursion;transfer function	Jyh-Ming Kuo;Samel Çelebi	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389803	adaptive filter;computer vision;computer science;signal processing;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;mathematics;filter design;matched filter;neural engineering;m-derived filter	ML	61.199602327399454	16.066689565377846	44665

This method is a first-order method, hence requires much less computational cost each iteration than second-order approaches such as interior-point methods. In each iteration of our method, we solve an eigenvalue minimization problem inexactly, and solve a small convex quadratic semidefinite programming as a subproblem. We give a proof of the global convergence of this method using techniques from the analysis of the standard bundle method, and provide a global error bound under a Slater type condition for the problem in question. Numerical experiments with matrices of order up to 3000 are performed and the computational results establish the effectiveness of this method.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;experiment;first-order reduction;interior point method;iteration;local convergence;mathematical optimization;semidefinite programming;subgradient method	Huiling Lin	2012	Comp.

Complete and Incomplete Discrete Wavelet Transforms in conjunction with row and column permutations are used in the construction of these preconditioners. With these Wavelet Transform, the transformed matrix is permuted to band forms. The efficiency of our preconditioners with several Krylov subspace methods is illustrated by solving matrices from Harwell Boeing collection and Tim Davis collection. Also matrices resulting in the solution of Regularized Burgers Equation, free convection in porous enclosure are tested. Our results indicate that the preconditioner based on Incomplete Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform is both cheaper to construct and gives good convergence. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The examples we have in mind span both cases of real dynamics, such as crowd in motion, but also virtual dynamics, such as opinion formation in social networks. The model is based on a measure theoretic approach, where the space of Radon measure with finite mass is endowed with a generalized Wasserstein metric. The latter allows the comparison of measures with different mass, thus including models in which the total mass of the measure may vary in time. The control paradigm is a centralized sparse control algorithm: A centralized controller is free to act on any agent of the system, but with the constraint of acting only on a small number of agents at the same time. We show some results in the completely discrete case and some new approach to deal with the continuum and mixed cases.	algorithm;centralized computing;flocking (behavior);information theory and measure theory;programming paradigm;social dynamics;social network;sparse matrix;triune continuum paradigm	Benedetto Piccoli;Francesco Rossi	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6859038	mathematical optimization;simulation;mathematics;mathematical economics	Robotics	62.43276932083307	6.727481237438782	45183

0750f6e82839cefc1b1122f4ff13c0cefdf8c53d	event-triggered consensus of multi-agent systems under directed topology based on periodic sampled-data		The event-triggered consensus problem of first-order multi-agent systems under directed topology is investigated. The event judgements are only implemented at periodic time instants. Under the designed consensus algorithm, the sampling period is permitted to be arbitrarily large. Another advantage of the designed consensus algorithm is that, for systems with time delay, consensus can be achieved for any finite delay only if it is bounded by the sampling period. The case of strongly connected topology is first investigated. Then, the result is extended to the most general topology which only needs to contain a spanning tree. A novel method based on positive series is introduced to analyze the convergence of the closed-loop systems. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.		Kaien Liu;Zhijian Ji;Xianfu Zhang	2018	CoRR			Embedded	65.68144982855598	5.32588271371511	45288

To establish this result we build upon insights from several algorithms for linear and nonlinear programs (the ellipsoid algorithm, the method of centers of gravity, the method of inscribed ellipsoids, and Vaidya's algorithm) to develop a unifying geometric framework for solving variational inequality problems. The analysis rests upon the assumption of strong-f-monotonicity, which is weaker than strict and strong monotonicity. Since linear programs satisfy this assumption, the general framework applies to linear programs.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;calculus of variations;ellipsoid method;iteration;linear programming;nonlinear system;polynomial;social inequality;variational inequality;variational principle	Thomas L.

It is described in detail how to convert several application problems to SOCP. Moreover, a proof is given of the existence of the step for the infeasible long-step path-following method. Furthermore, variants are developed of both long-step path-following and of predictor-corrector algorithms.

Both FIR and llR filter designs are considered, and it is shown that by expToiting the duality with system identification, the nonlinear llR filter can be configured as a recurrent radial basis function network. Details of network training that is based on a combined k-means clustering and Givens routine, the inclusion of linear dynamic network links, and metrics for performance monitoring are also discussed. Examples are included to demonstrate the degree of noise suppression that can be achieved based on the new design.

For DFT modulated filter bank, the authors derive the symmetric property of the overall transfer function and aliasing transfer functions which can be efficiently calculated by using the orthogonal property of the DFT matrix. By invoking the Mth band condition and new property, an efficient algorithm is proposed to design DFT modulated filter banks. The convergence of the algorithm is also proved. Several numerical examples and comparison with the conventional methods are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	filter bank;modulation	Jun-Zheng Jiang;Fang Zhou;Shan Ouyang;Guisheng Liao	2014	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2013.0287	adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;computer science;dft matrix;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;filter design;modulation	EDA	59.41281808808601	18.191841375166867	45638

Explicit preconditioned iterative schemes in conjunction with approximate inverse matrix techniques are presented for the efficient solution of symmetric linear systems.

Line search termination criteria used in such quasi-Newton methods usually possess two important properties. First, they guarantee the existence of such a local quadratic approximation. Second, under suitable conditions, they allow one to prove that the limit of the component of the gradient in the normalized search direction is zero. This is usually an intermediate result in proving convergence. Collinear scaling algorithms proposed initially by Davidon in 1980 are natural extensions of quasi-Newton methods in the sense that they are based on normal conic local approximations that extend positive definite local quadratic approximations, and that they interpolate values of both the gradient and the function at the current and new iterates. Line search termination criteria that guarantee the existence of such a normal conic local approximation, which also allow one to prove that the component of the gradient in the normalized search direction tends to zero, are not known. In this paper, we propose such line search termination criteria for an important special case where the function being minimized belongs to a certain class of convex functions.	algorithm;approximation;computation;convex function;convex optimization;experiment;gradient;image scaling;interior point method;interpolation;line search;loss function;mathematical optimization;newton;optimization problem;quasi-newton method	K.

PDEs can have partial derivatives with respect to (1) an initial value variable, typically time, and (2) boundary value variables, typically spatial variables. Therefore, two fractional PDEs can be considered, (1) fractional in time (TFPDEs), and (2) fractional in space (SFPDEs). The two volumes are directed to the development and use of SFPDEs, with the discussion divided as: •Vol 1: Introduction to Algorithms and Computer Coding in R •Vol 2: Applications from Classical Integer PDEs. Various definitions of space fractional derivatives have been proposed. We focus on the Caputo derivative, with occasional reference to the Riemann-Liouville derivative. In the second volume, the emphasis is on applications of SFPDEs developed mainly through the extension of classical integer PDEs to SFPDEs. The example applications are: •Fractional diffusion equation with Dirichlet, Neumann and Rob...	numerical integration	Younes Salehi;William E.

The well-known representation theorem for BSS machines elucidates the structure of the functions computable in the BSS model: the domain of such a function partitions into countably many semi-algebraic sets, and on each of those sets the function is a polynomial resp. rational function. In this paper, we study whether the representation theorem can, in the univariate case, be extended to analytic machines, i.e. whether functions computable by analytic machines can be represented by power series in some part of their domain. We show that this question can be answered in the negative over the real numbers but positive under certain restrictions for functions over the complex numbers. We then use the machine model to define computability of univariate complex analytic (i.e. holomorphic) functions and examine in particular the class of analytic functions which have analytically computable power series expansions. We show that this class is closed under the basic analytic operations composition, local inversion and analytic continuation.	blum blum shub;blum axioms;branching factor;coefficient;computability theory;computable function;continuation;converge;emulator;linear algebra;oracle machine;polynomial;real computation;runge–kutta methods;semiconductor industry;turing machine;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tobias Gärtner;Günter Hotz	2011	Theory of Computing Systems	10.1007/s00224-011-9374-z	non-analytic smooth function;rice's theorem;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;complex dynamics;monodromy theorem;global analytic function;analytic function;complex-valued function;complex analysis;quasi-analytic function;analytic continuation;analytic capacity;mathematics;flat function;μ-recursive function;computable function;algorithm;computable analysis;algebraic geometry and analytic geometry	Theory	76.20290217245098	14.097287086232788	45899

Furthermore, these images allow with one glimpse the identification of a number of system properties: coexistence of attractors, superstable curves, order by alternation of chaotic processes, and chaos by periodic resetting from a stable into an unstable fixed point.	logistic map;lyapunov fractal	Mario Markus;Benno Hess	1989	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/0097-8493(89)90019-8	combinatorics;iteration;logistic map;dynamical system;calculus;mathematics;computer graphics;lyapunov exponent;attractor;function	ML	75.34018686167603	10.540393305251207	46112

Then we introduce Newton-HSS methods with a backtracking strategy and analyse their global convergence. Finally, these globally convergent Newton-HSS methods are shown to work well on several typical examples using different forcing terms to stop the inner iterations.

However, in reality, samples are rarely noiseless. In this paper, we introduce a novel stochastic algorithm to reconstruct a signal with finite rate of innovation from its noisy samples. Even though variants of this problem have been approached previously, satisfactory solutions are only available for certain classes of sampling kernels, for example, kernels that satisfy the Strang-Fix condition. In this paper, we consider the infinite-support Gaussian kernel, which does not satisfy the Strang-Fix condition. Other classes of kernels can be employed. Our algorithm is based on Gibbs sampling, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our algorithm.	coefficient;compressed sensing;computation;estimation theory;gamma correction;gibbs sampling;least squares;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;rejection sampling;root-finding algorithm;sampling (signal processing);simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;synthetic data	Vincent Yan Fu Tan;Vivek K.

The intention is to eliminate the amplitude correction required to compensate the short-range leakage produced by nonflat-mainlobe windows in case of asynchronous sampling. The performance of the standard rise cosine filter, a generalized raised-cosine filter and a Hanning window, all of them with the same bandwidth, is compared in the simulation results. It is concluded that the accuracy of the estimates provided by the shaping pulses without amplitude compensation in the asynchronous case is relatively better than that of the amplitude compensated estimates obtained with the Hanning window. The generalized raised-cosine filter can achieve lower sidelobe levels but it does not improve the accuracy of the amplitude estimates of the standard raised-cosine filter.	hann function;ibm power systems;microsoft windows;noise shaping;quantum phase estimation algorithm;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spectral leakage;window function	José Antonio de la O.

In practical implementations, the detection threshold is obtained as the product of the channel noise power, which is adaptively estimated from the FFT filter bank output, and the theoretical normalized detection threshold Tn corresponding to the desired probability of false alarm. Since the probability of false alarm Pfa is a strictly decreasing function of Tn, Tn is usually computed by finding the root of a non-linear equation using the Newton-Ralphson or golden section search algorithm. The initialization of the numerical procedures, however, hinges on good a priori knowledge of lower and upper bounds for Tn. In this article, a new and easily computable lower bound for Tn, the Okamoto lower bound, is derived. This lower bound is larger than the lower bounds derived earlier by the authors and hence should be preferred when initializing the numerical procedures in the computation of Tn.	cognitive radio;computable function;computation;embedded system;fast fourier transform;filter bank;linear equation;newton;newton's method;noise (electronics);noise power;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;search algorithm;sensor	Sichun Wang;Robert J.

It is based on existing solutions to pertinent matrix nearness problems. It is shown that the key point in constructing the nearest passive transfer function, is to find a good rational approximation of the well-known ramp function over an interval defined by the minimum and maximum dissipation of H(s). The proposed algorithms rely on the stable anti-stable projection of a given transfer function. Pertinent examples are given to show the scope and accuracy of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;approximation theory;imaginary time;mimo;minimax;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;relevance;simple rational approximation;soft-in soft-out decoder;state space;transfer function;whole earth 'lectronic link	Luc Knockaert	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;statistics	ML	70.12509079299369	10.564346411280553	46345

Our approach is based on the theory of abstract and regular linear systems introduced by Salamon (Math Syst Theor 21:147–164, 1989) and Weiss (Isr J Math 65:17–43, 1989).

f5b98d47f033ce9ad3e2cee6fb2abdd35f99ecf3	simplex-type algorithm for second-order cone programmes via semi-infinite programming reformulation	simplex method;second order cone programme;linear semi infinite programme	The (linear) second-order cone program (SOCP) is to minimize a linear function over the intersection between a polyhedral set and an affine transformation of Cartesian product of second-order cones. For solving such a problem, the primal-dual interior-point method has been studied extensively so far and said to be the most efficient method by many researchers. On the other hand, the simplex type method for SOCP is much less spotlighted, while it still keeps an important position for linear programming (LP) problems. Actually, some researchers have tried to apply such a method to the SOCPs. However, in those existing studies, the proposed algorithms were not implemented practically, or could be applied only to some restricted class of problems. In this paper, we apply the dual-simplex primal-exchange (DSPE) method, which was originally developed for solving linear semi-infinite programs (LSIP), to the SOCP by reformulating the second-order cone constraint as an infinite number of linear inequality constraints. Especially, by means of some numerical experiments, we observe that such a simplex type method can be more efficient than the existing interior-point based method, when we solve multiple SOCPs having similar data structures successively applying the so-called “hot start” technique.	cartesian closed category;data structure;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;interior point method;linear function;linear inequality;linear programming;numerical analysis;polyhedron;second-order cone programming;semi-infinite programming;semiconductor industry;simplex algorithm;social inequality	Shunsuke Hayashi;Takayuki Okuno;Yoshihiko Ito	2016	Optimization Methods and Software	10.1080/10556788.2015.1121487	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;geometry;simplex algorithm	PL	72.30557508241846	23.60752722263535	46385

The conditions obtained can be applied to a large variety of optimal search problems involving moving targets when effort is infinitely divisible in space. Moreover, the conditions have been used to construct very efficient algorithms for solving these problems.

We use several transition filters to obtain a near perfect-reconstruction (PR) nonuniform lapped transform with significantly reduced overall distortion.

The new receiver overcomes several disadvantages available in literature in this area by accomplishing modulus equalization and phase recovery in two independent operations. The proposed structure enables alternative and independent approaches to be taken for the design of the modulus and phase equalizer respectively, and in the context we propose two new algorithms for the modulus equalizer and the phase shifter. In particular, we propose a new constant modulus (CM) and modulus decision directed (MDD) hybrid algorithm for the equalizer. The CM and MDD both influence the adaptation of equalizer weight taps simultaneously. This enhances both the convergence rate and the steady state performance. The selection of step sizes for the modulus equalizer and the phase shifter is discussed. We compare the performance of our receiver with other previous receivers via computer simulations.	blind equalization;carrier recovery;computer simulation;equalization (communications);filter design;hybrid algorithm;loss function;model-driven engineering;modulus of continuity;modulus robot;rate of convergence;steady state	Shujun Chen;Anthony G.

Nodes try to maximize the aggregate cost function, while they exchange information only with their neighbors. We modify the dual decomposition method to incorporate a curvature correction inspired by the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method. The resulting dual D-BFGS method is a fully decentralized algorithm in which nodes approximate curvature information of themselves and neighbors through the satisfaction of a secant condition. Dual D-BFGS is of interest in consensus problems that are not well conditioned, making first order decentralized methods ineffective, and in which second order information is not readily available, making decentralized second order methods infeasible. Asynchronous implementation is discussed and convergence of D-BFGS is established formally for synchronous and asynchronous implementations. Performance advantages relative to alternative decentralized algorithms are shown numerically.	aggregate data;approximation algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;concave function;consensus (computer science);descent direction;duality (optimization);duality gap;fletcher's checksum;gradient descent;lagrangian relaxation;loss function;mathematical optimization;newton's method;numerical analysis;quasi-newton method;rewrite (programming);secant method;social inequality;the matrix	Mark Eisen;Aryan Mokhtari;Alejandro R.

Both the undecimated and decimated cases will be considered. The filter functions are polynomials and can be implemented efficiently without the need for any eigendecomposition, which is computationally expensive for large graphs. Polynomial filters also have the advantage of the vertex localization property. The construction is achieved by designing suitable transformations that are used on traditional multirate filter banks. It will be shown how the classical quadrature-mirror-filters and linear phase, critically/over- sampled filter banks can be used to construct spectral graph wavelets that are almost tight.

We first propose a fully distributed adaptive sliding-mode control algorithm combined with distributed sliding-mode estimators, without requiring the upper bounds of the derivatives of the leaders’ states and any other global information to be known by each follower. To reduce the effect on the varying gain during the adaption mainly caused by the initial error, fully distributed adaptive time-varying sliding-mode control is presented for controller design. To tackle the chattering effect caused by the discontinuous controller, we further propose a fully distributed continuous adaptive controller, under which both the containment errors and the adaptive gains are ultimately bounded. Simulation results are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

[Boundary value methods for the reconstruction of Sturm–Liouville potentials, Appl. Math. Comput. 219 (2012), pp. 2960–2974] for computing Sturm–Liouville potentials from two spectra is discussed. In Aceto et al. (2012), a continuous approximation of the unknown potential belonging to a suitable function space of finite dimension is obtained by forming an associated set of nonlinear equations and solving these with a quasi-Newton approach. In our paper, convergence of the quasi-Newton approach is established and convergence of the estimate of the unknown potential, provided by the exact solution of the nonlinear equation, to the true potential is proved. To further investigate the properties of the BVM in Aceto et al. (2012), some other spaces of functions are introduced. Numerical examples confirm the theoretically predicted convergence properties and show the accuracy and stability of the BVM.	sturm's theorem	Qin Gao;Xiaoliang Cheng;Zhengda Huang	2014	Int. J.

The motivation for such FBs is to develop more general theories, factorizations and designs to overcome the limitations of traditional works with unnecessary length constraint L = KM, and to achieve a better trade-off between the design and computational complexities and the filter length. The existence conditions and lattice factorizations are developed for both paraunitary and perfect reconstruction FBs with any number of channels M ≥ 2. Furthermore, it can be shown that the novel derived lattice factorization is complete for any FIR paraunitary FB and for any order-one perfect reconstruction FB. Finally, a design example is presented to validate the proposed lattice structure.	analysis of algorithms;computation;crystal structure;filter bank;finite impulse response;ibm systems network architecture;norm (social);performance rating;reconstruction filter	Zhiming Xu;Anamitra Makur	2008	2008 16th European Signal Processing Conference		adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;electronic engineering;mathematics;filter design;prototype filter;m-derived filter	Vision	59.41165679887672	18.612327308473237	47494

Global nonlinear consensus protocols augmented with a variable structure are constructed with the aid of Lyapunov functions for each single-integrator agent dynamics in the presence of external disturbances. In particular, it is shown that the finite settling time of the proposed general framework for robust consensus design is upper bounded for any initial condition. This makes it possible for network consensus problems to design and estimate the convergence time offline for a multi-agent team with a given undirected information flow. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our finite-time protocols.	multi-agent system;nonlinear system	Zongyu Zuo;Lin Tie	2016	Int. J.

Many of these estimators assume a complex-valued signal model, typically formed using the discrete-time Hilbert transform. For a large number of observations, or with frequencies being neither too high nor too low, this approach works well, whereas it might well cause considerable problems otherwise. One way to handle these situations is to instead form the frequency estimation algorithm assuming a real-valued signal. In this paper, we show how the principle of angles between subspaces can be applied to this problem to alleviate some of the shortcomings of subspace-based frequency estimation using the MUSIC algorithm and demonstrate the resulting attractive properties via computer simulations.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;closing (morphology);computer simulation;hilbert transform;spectral density estimation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Mads Græsbøll Christensen;Andreas Jakobsson	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;mathematical optimization;multiple signal classification;mathematics;spectral density estimation;statistics	DB	55.802006188867374	11.801790878681873	47667

Such s-power series yield, over finite intervals, better approximations for CAD purposes, as they are polynomial and hence expressible in the Bernstein–Bézier standard, can be pieced together in a smooth Hermitian spline and, in general, display better convergence.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike other penalty functions, a parameter involved in the unconstrained reformulation can be easily determined by the spectrum radius of the Hessian of the objective function in the original quadratic program.

Moreover, these methods solve the problem only suboptimally. We revisit this problem and develop a new beamforming method based on a new solution for the corresponding optimization problem. The new proposed method is iterative and is based on a reformulation and then linearization of a single non-convex difference-of-two-convex functions (DC) constraint. Our simulation results confirm that the new proposed method finds the global optimum of the problem in few iterations and outperforms the state-of-the-art robust adaptive beamforming methods for general-rank signal model with PSD constraint.	adaptive beamformer;algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;convex function;convex optimization;global optimization;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;semiconductor industry;simulation	Arash Khabbazibasmenj;Sergiy A.

The method is based on repeatedly dividing the original problem into two subproblems that involve the solution of systems containing the Schur complement of the leading principal submatrix of the previous level. The idea is to solve the linear systems S m y = d, where S m is the Schur complement of T 2m (the principal submatrix of T n ), by using a self preconditioned iterative methods. The preconditioners, which are the approximate inverses of S m , are constructed based on famous Gohberg–Semencul formula. All occurring matrices are represented by proper generating vectors of their displacement rank characterization. We show that, for well conditioned problems, the proposed method is efficient and robust. For ill-conditioned problems, by using some iterative refinement method, the new method would be efficient and robust. Numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of our new method.	approximation algorithm;condition number;displacement mapping;experiment;iterative method;iterative refinement;linear system;newton's method;numerical method;preconditioner;recursion (computer science);refinement (computing);robustness (computer science);toeplitz hash algorithm	Faezeh Toutounian;Nasser Akhoundi	2012	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-012-9603-9	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;iterative method;algebra	EDA	81.50826917171315	22.35662238858578	47940

A method which in simulation can extract narrow-band signal well is put forward. The proposed method is a mixed model which combines the local linear (LL) model and varying-coefficient regression model (LLVCR). We first use LL model to predict the short-term chaotic signal. Since the varying-coefficient model can fit the narrow-band signal well. We mix them and establish a mixed model to estimate the narrow-band signal in strong chaotic background. For estimating simply and effectively, we develop an efficient algorithm to select and optimize the parameters of LLVCR model those are hard to be exhaustively searched for. In the proposed algorithm, based on the short-term predictability and sensitivity to initial conditions of chaos motion, the minimum fitting error criterion is used as the objective function to get the estimation of parameters of the presented LLVCR model. In addition, the center frequencies can be detected from the fitting error of LL model by using periodogram at first. The simulation results show that LLVCR model and its estimation algorithm have appreciable flexibility to extract the narrow-band signal in different chaotic background [Lorenz, Henon and Mackey-Glass (M-G) equations].	approximation algorithm;backfitting algorithm;coefficient;conjunctive query;detection theory;experiment;initial condition;interference (communication);ll parser;linear approximation;loss function;mixed model;numerical analysis;optimization problem;sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density estimation	Liyun Su;Chenlong Li	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-017-4275-3	econometrics;artificial intelligence;mathematics;statistics	Vision	56.19479525167986	12.706179129982011	48199

These expressions are then used to obtain the analytic performance of FIR system identification methods as a function of the coefficients and the statistics of the input sequence. The lower bound in the variance is also compared for different sets of sample statistics to provide insight about the information carried by each sample statistic. Finally, the effect that the presence of noise has on the accuracy of the estimates is studied analytically. The results are illustrated graphically with plots of the variance of the estimates as a function of the parameters or the signal-to-noise ratio.

The results cover several Farkas-type results for convex or DC systems and are general enough to face with unpublished situations. As applications of these results, nonconvex optimization problems with composite functions, convex composite problems with conic constraints are examined at the end of the paper. There, strong duality, stable strong duality results for these classes of problems are established.

We assume that the cost of impulses is a positive function. We prove that the value function of the control problem is the unique viscosity solution of the related first order Hamilton–Jacobi quasi-variational inequality.1 We then propose time discretization schemes of this QVI, where we consider two approximations of the ‘‘Hamiltonian hH ’’, including a natural one. We prove that the approximate value function uh exists, that it is the unique solution of the approximate QVI and that it forms a uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous family. We also prove that the approximate value function converges locally uniformly, towards the value function of the control problem, when the discretization step h goes to zero; the rate of convergence is proved to be in h , where 0 < σ < 1/2. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

121774e650f7595ab43851fa0afd3916d526fdc6	double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition for joint blind source separation		Joint blind source separation (J-BSS) is an emerging data-driven technique for multi-set data-fusion. In this paper, J-BSS is addressed from a tensorial perspective. We show how, by using second-order multi-set statistics in J-BSS, a specific double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (DC-CPD) problem can be formulated. We propose an algebraic DC-CPD algorithm based on a coupled rank-1 detection mapping. This algorithm converts a possibly underdetermined DC-CPD to a set of overdetermined CPDs. The latter can be solved algebraically via a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based scheme. Therefore, this algorithm is deterministic and returns the exact solution in the noiseless case. In the noisy case, it can be used to effectively initialize optimization based DC-CPD algorithms. In addition, we obtain the deterministic and generic uniqueness conditions for DC-CPD, which are shown to be more relaxed than their CPD counterpart. We also introduce optimization based DC-CPD methods, including alternating least squares, and structured data fusion based methods. Experiment results are given to illustrate the superiority of DC-CPD over standard CPD based BSS methods and several existing J-BSS methods, with regards to uniqueness and accuracy.	algorithm;blind signal separation;collaborative product development;least squares;mathematical optimization;source separation	Xiao-Feng Gong;Qiu-Hua Lin;Fengyu Cong;Lieven De Lathauwer	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2830317	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Vision	75.83785662045803	27.11598830429157	48428

The results presented here are based on a complete characterization of the solution of the associative functional equation F[F(x, y),z] — F[x, F(y, z)] due to J. Aczel, leading to a class of invertible binary operators that includes addition, multiplication, and infinitely many others. We present some illustrative examples of these dynamic models, give a simple explicit representation for their inverses, and present sufficient conditions for bounded-input, bounded-output stability. Finally, we propose a generalization of this model class and we demonstrate that these models have classical state-space realizations, unlike arbitrarily structured NARMA models.	bibo stability;linear model;nonlinear system;state space	Ronald K.

The NRLM algorithm with p-modulus and q-norm makes adaptive filters fast convergent and robust against two types of impulse noise: one is found in observation noise and another at filter input. We develop theoretical analysis of the algorithm for calculating filter convergence. Through experiment with simulations and theoretical calculations, effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. We also find that the filter convergence does not critically depend on the value of p or q, allowing use of p = q = infinity that makes it easiest to calculate the p-modulus and q-norm. The theoretical convergence is in good agreement with the simulation results which validates the analysis.	algorithm;impulse noise (audio);modulus of continuity;recursion (computer science);simulation	Shin'ichi Koike	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;digital filter;multidelay block frequency domain adaptive filter;kernel adaptive filter;control theory;mathematics;filter design;recursive filter;recursive least squares filter	ML	59.62944023058661	12.5041850497704	48589

It is defined by a complexification of two canonical complex signals, which can be considered as an inverse operation of the Cayley-Dickson form of the quaternion. Inspired by the polar form of an analytic signal where the real instantaneous envelope and phase can be determined, this paper presents a novel method to generate a polar representation of the hyperanalytic signal, in which the continuously complex envelope and phase can be uniquely defined. Comparing to other existing methods, the proposed polar representation does not have sign ambiguity between the envelope and the phase, which makes the definition of the instantaneous complex frequency possible.	analytic signal;magma	Boqiang Huang;Angela Kunoth	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853622	instantaneous phase;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;mathematics;geometry	Robotics	54.340768690730194	17.672391352817417	48810

The two algorithms automatically adjust their step-sizes and adapt the weight vector by minimizing the p-th moment of the a posteriori error, where p is the order with 1 ≤ p ≤ 2, thus they are named as variable step-size normalized least mean p-th norm (VSS-NLMP) algorithms. The proposed adaptive VSS-NLMP algorithms are applied to both realand complex-valued systems using lowcomplexity time-averaging estimation of the lower-order moments. Simulation results show that the misalignment of the proposed VSS-NLMP algorithms with a smaller p converges faster and achieves lower steady-state error in impulsive interference and/or colored input environment. The adaptive VSS-NLMP algorithms also perform better than the adaptive Fixed Step-Size (FSS) NLMP in both Gaussian and impulsive interference environment. A theoretical model for the steady-state excess mean-square error is also provided for convergence rate in both Gaussian and Bernoulli-Gaussian interference.

7226ab080f40cfd9f7a2c61a9265a7e646bdd044	spectrally constrained unimodular sequence design without spectral level mask		Due to the freedom degree loss resulted from the unimodular constraints, it is not easy to specify proper and feasible stopband and passband levels for frequency grids of interest in spectrally constrained sequence design problems. In an attempt to avoid this difficulty, we devise a cost function that minimizes the ratio of the maximal stopband level to the minimal passband level. Next, we introduce auxiliary variables to simplify the optimization problem via decoupling the numerator and denominator. Then, the feasible solution is obtained by approximating the nondifferentiable objective function with a smooth function. We also apply an acceleration scheme to increase the algorithm convergence speed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via numerical examples.	approximation algorithm;coupling (computer programming);mathematical optimization;maximal set;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;unimodular polynomial matrix	Yang Jing;Junli Liang;Deyun Zhou;Hing Cheung So	2018	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2018.2836219	mathematical optimization;mathematics;acceleration;smoothness;approximation algorithm;stopband;passband;linear programming;unimodular matrix;optimization problem	EDA	74.99537549149807	27.361204298745054	48871

The proposed method converts the DCT matrix into an alternative transformation matrix that can be decomposed into sparse matrices of low multiplicative complexity. The method is capable of scaled and exact DCT computation and its associated fast algorithm achieves the theoretical minimal multiplicative complexity for the 8-point DCT. Depending on the nature of the input signal simplifications can be introduced and the overall complexity of the proposed algorithm can be further reduced. Several types of input signal are analyzed: arbitrary, null mean, accumulated, and null mean/accumulated signal. The proposed tool has potential application in harmonic detection, image enhancement, and feature extraction, where input signal DC level is discarded and/or the signal is required to be integrated.	algorithm;computation;discrete cosine transform;feature extraction;image editing;matrix multiplication;sparse matrix;transformation matrix	Diego F.

The method is used to estimate the waveform of event-related signals which have a transient behaviour with unknown shapes and time delays which vary randomly after a known event time. The quality of the estimate depends on the choice of the set of basis functions. Two different sets of basis functions are designed from a template, which contains a priori information, by using one uniform and one non-uniform bandpass filter bank, respectively. Each of the two sets is enlarged by a number of delayed copies of each basis function by employing FIR-filters, the coefficients of which are determined in terms of squared error. The method is evaluated and compared with the Karhunen-LoCve expansion.	basis function;coefficient;filter bank;finite impulse response;randomness;series expansion;waveform	Farook Sattar;Göran Salomonsson	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.390046	finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;statistics	Vision	55.379357114215296	14.724031040167844	49217

The main theme of this work is to study the inverse problem: given a specific forward-backward behavior, find a family of polynomial matrices A(σ), such that the system A(σ)β(k) = 0 has exactly the prescribed behavior. As we shall see, the problem can be reduced either to a linear system equation problem or to an interpolation problem.	computation;feasible region;interpolation;linear algebra;linear system;polynomial matrix;recurrence relation;wolfram mathematica	Lazaros Moysis;Nicholas P.

Similar to other algorithms pipelined using the matrix lookahead transformation. The proposed architecture can operate at arbitrarily high sample rates, and consists of only Givens rotations which may be mapped on to a Jacobi speciic dataaow processor. It requires a complexity of O(MNp 2) Givens rotations per sample time, where p is the number of antenna elements, N is the number of tapped delay elements on each antenna, and M is the pipelining level. The combination of the result in this report and the one in 1] will lead to a ne-grain pipelined multi-channel QRD-LSL MVDR adaptive beamforming algorithm.	adaptive beamformer;adaptive filter;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;beamforming;cordic;computation;eb-eye;jacobi method;parsing;pipeline (computing);qr decomposition;recursion;recursive least squares filter;sampling (signal processing);the matrix	John G.

c03ff6e972f532db530affef1321fa774852849f	new results and algorithms for computing storage functions: the lossless/all-pass cases	bezoutian;algebraic riccati equation are;hamiltonian systems;optimal control	Storage functions, which are also the Algebraic Riccati Inequality (ARI) solutions, play an important role in many optimal control/estimation problems. Extreme storage functions are solutions to the corresponding Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE). While storage functions exist under assumption of dissipativity, a key assumption in formulation of the ARE/ARI is certain `regularity conditions' on the feedthrough term in the input/state/output representation of the system. For example, lossless and all-pass systems do not meet such regularity conditions (nonsingularity of D + DT and I - DTD respectively). And hence the ARE does not exist for such systems. Consequently, computation of storage functions for lossless/all-pass systems is not possible by conventional ARE based methods, and therefore, for such systems, different techniques are needed. In this paper we present three new algorithms for computation of storage functions for lossless/all-pass systems and compare them for numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. Each of the proposed methods presented in this paper comes from different viewpoints. One is linked to the notion of Bezoutian of two polynomials, while another is motivated by Foster realization of LC circuits and the third method is linked to the notion of trajectories of minimal dissipation in the behavioral approach. A comparative study among the three methods shows that the method based on the Bezoutian is the best from both perspectives: computational time and numerical accuracy.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;algorithm;bézout matrix;computation;lossless compression;numerical analysis;optimal control;polynomial;time complexity	Sandeep Kumar;Chayan Bhawal;Debasattam Pal;Madhu N.

When the data is two-dimensional, i.e. the boundary of a planar map, these kernels may be conveniently expressed using complex number algebra, simplifying much of the notation and results. In this paper we develop some of the basic complex-valued algebra needed to describe these planar maps, and use it to define similarity kernels, a natural alternative to the usual barycentric kernels. We develop the theory behind similarity kernels, explore their properties, and show that the transfinite versions of the popular three-point barycentric coordinates (Laplace, mean value and Wachspress) have surprisingly simple similarity kernels. We furthermore show how similarity kernels may be used to invert injective transfinite barycentric mappings using an iterative algorithm which converges quite rapidly. This is useful for rendering images deformed by planar barycentric mappings.	algorithm;barycentric subdivision;contour line;iterative method;map;planar graph;transfinite induction;transfinite interpolation	Renjie Chen;Craig Gotsman	2016	Comput.

In many practical systems, the observation signal has a sparse representation in a continuous parameter space. This situation rises the possibility of use of the CS reconstruction techniques in the practical problems. In order to utilize CS techniques, the continuous parameter space have to be discretized. This discritization brings the well-known off-grid problem. To prevent the off-grid problem, this study offers a recursive approach which discritizes the parameter space in an adaptive manner. The simulations show that the proposed approach can estimate the parameters with a high accuracy even if targets are closely spaced.	cs games;compressed sensing;discretization;recursion;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;whole earth 'lectronic link	Oguzhan Teke;Orhan Arikan;Ali Cafer Gürbüz	2014	2014 22nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2014.6830436	computer vision;mathematical optimization;information theory;computer science;sensor;theoretical computer science;machine learning;signal processing;compressed sensing;statistics;robustness;matching pursuit	Graphics	54.54836136950512	7.295224117137302	49761

In general, the existing results on asymptotic stability and boundedness of SFDEs require (i) the coefficients of the SFDEs obey the local Lipschitz condition and the linear growth condition; (ii) the diffusion operator of the SFDEs acting on a $C^{2,1}$-function be bounded by a polynomial with the same order as the $C^{2,1}$-function. However, there are many SFDEs which do not obey the linear growth condition. Moreover, for such highly nonlinear SFDEs, the diffusion operator acting on a $C^{2,1}$-function is generally bounded by a polynomial with a higher order than the $C^{2,1}$-function. Hence the existing criteria on stability and boundedness for SFDEs are not applicable and we see the necessity to develop new criteria. Our main aim of this paper is to establish new criteria where the linear growth condition is no longer needed while the up-bound for the diffusion operator may take a much more general form.

This situation occurs when the number of tap coefficients of the adaptive filter exceeds that of the complex sinusoids in the input signal.

The missing measurements from different sensors are described by a group of Bernoulli distributed random variables. Using the projection theory, the optimal linear estimators including filter, predictor and smoother for the state and white noise are derived in the linear minimum variance sense. Furthermore, the centralised optimal estimators for ARMA signals with multiple sensors of different missing measurement rates are obtained. The previous estimation algorithms under complete measurement data in references have lost the optimality when there are missing measurements of sensors. At last, the stability of the proposed estimators is analysed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal linear estimators.		Shu-Li Sun;Xiu-Ying Li;S. W.

Two iterations of the algorithm attains the Cram&-Rao hound on the variance of the frequency and decay rate estimate for a complex exponential in white Gaussian noise. The algorithm uses an adaptive window that changes its shape with the estimate of the decay rate. Formulas are derived for the bias and variance of the estimator, and its performance is demonstrated in simulations. I . INTRODUCTION ARAMETER estimation for sinusoidal signals in backP ground noise is a well-studied subject in signal processing. The frequency estimation of single complex exponential in white Gaussian noise can be thought of as a classic problem in this area because it is very simple and well defined. There is no interference from other sinusoidal signals, which allows a nonautoregressive model to produce a satisfactory result. A straightforward approach for such a problem is the calculation of DFT followed by the search for the bin with the maximum magnitude [l]. In fact, this algorithm can be demonstrated to be the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the frequency of the sinusoid for this problem. To avoid the calculation of the DFT with infinitely small bin distance, k f e has proposed an ingenious interpolation formula for finding the spectral peak of the DFT for a single complex exponential [2], [3]. It is quite effective, and in the absence of noise, it gives the exact value of the original frequency. Unfortunately, in the presence of background noise, Rife’s interpolation formula is not an efficient estimator, i.e., the variance of the frequency estimate is slightly larger than the Cram&-Rao (CR) bound. Therefore, Rife has proposed a hybrid procedure, which finds a coarse estimate by interpolation and then switches to Newton-Raphson search for a better estimate [4]. Later, Abatzoglou improved the computational efficiency of the procedure, and it has been accepted as the most effective frequency estimator based on the FFT for a single exponential in noise [5] . On the other hand, Tretter and Kay have shown that the ML estimate of the frequency can also be obtained using only the phase information of the sequence [6], [7]. This is surprising because it suggests that the magnitude of the original sequence is unnecessary for the MLE of the exponential’s frequency. In other words, it says that the original sequence conveys Manuscript received November 21, 1994; revised October 2, 1995.

In this paper, we propose a generalized version of Rife’s frequency estimator derived from the finite difference equation for a single complex exponential. Dividing two DFT samples gives the angular frequency and decay rate of the sequence. In comparison with Rife’s original formula, it has the following advantages. 1) It estimates the frequency and decay rate simultaneously. 2) The DFT size need not be the sequence length. 3) Arbitrary window shapes can be incorporated into the estimator. (Rife’s formula works exactly only with Power of Cosine Bell-type windows [9], and it is only an approximation for other windows.) 4) In the presence of white Gaussian noise, the simple iteration of the algorithm leads to an ML estimate of the frequency and decay rate. A novel feature of the algorithm is that the shape of the window adapts based on the current estimate of the decay rate for MLE of the frequency and decay rate. Under the assumption of uniform Gaussian white noise, the window weights the portions of the sequence with large amplitude more heavily to minimize the effect of noise. In the absence of any decay, the window is a parabolic curve, which is consistent with previously reported work [51, [61, [71. As was proved by Tretter and Kay, at high SNR linear regession of the phase term provides the best estimate of the frequency. This suggests that the decay rate might be estimated from linear regression on the magnitude of the sequence. Such an estimator can be formulated. However, the estimator proposed in this paper is superior to it in both simplicity and computational efficiency. In Section 11, a simple estimator is derived from the difference equation of a single complex exponential. Section I11 introduces a noise term to the signal, which is treated as a perturbation, and the convergence of the recursive algorithm is discussed. Variance analysis of the estimator and the optimal window shape are discussed in Section IV. Section V illustrates the algorithm with a simple example and gives numerical results. Section VI compares the algorithm to the previous work described above. 11. ESTIMATOR FOR COMPLEX EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION Let x [ n ] be an N-point discrete-time sequence.

The approximation algorithms use only n function values at adaptively or nonadaptively chosen points. We construct a nonadaptive algorithm Anon r,n that, for the functions with at most one singular point, enjoys the best possible convergence rate n−r. This is in sharp contrast to results concerning discontinuous functions. For r ≥ 3, this optimal rate of convergence holds only in the asymptotic sense, i.e., it occurs only for sufficiently large n that depends on f in a way that is practically impossible to verify. However, it is enough to modify Anon r,n by using (r + 1) (r − 1)/2 extra function evaluations to obtain an adaptive algorithm Aada r,n with error satisfying ‖f − Aada r,n f‖C ≤ CrT ‖f‖L n−r for all n ≥ n0 and n0 independent of f . This result cannot be achieved for functions with more than just one singular point. However, the convergence rate n−r can be recovered asymptotically by a nonadaptive algorithm A r,n that is a slightly modified Anon r,n . Specifically, lim supn→∞ ‖f −A r,n f‖C ·nr ≤ CrT ‖f‖L for all r-smooth functions f with finitely many singular points.	adaptive algorithm;approximation algorithm;approximation theory;cathode ray tube;expanded memory;rate of convergence	Leszek Plaskota;Grzegorz W.

A recent approach for saddle point computation is specialized, by way of a speci c perturbation technique and unique scaling method, to convex optimization problems with di erentiable objective and constraint functions. In each iteration the update directions for primal and dual variables are determined by gradients of the Lagrangian. These gradients are evaluated at perturbed points which are generated from current points via auxiliary mappings. The resulting algorithm suits massively parallel computing. Sparsity can be exploited e ciently. Employing simulation of parallel computations, an experimental code embedded into GAMS is tested on two sets of nonlinear problems. The rst set arises from multi-stage stochastic optimization of the US energy economy. The second set consists of multi-currency bond portfolio problems. In such stochastic optimization problems the serial time appears approximatively proportional to the number of scenarios, while the parallel time seems independent of the number of scenarios. Thus, we observe that the serial time of our approach in comparison with Minos increases slower with the problem size. Consequently, for large problems with reasonable precision requirements, our method appears faster than Minos even in a serial computer.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;computation;convex optimization;embedded system;gams;gradient;image scaling;iteration;iterative method;line search;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;parallel computing;requirement;serial computer;simulation;sparse matrix;stochastic optimization	Markku Kallio;Charles H.

Firstly, under the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition, the uniqueness of solution for the minimization model with a given sparsity s is obtained through the theoretical analysis. With a mild condition, we get that the larger of the q, the more effective of the sparse recovery model under sensing matrix satisfies RIP conditions at fixed p. Secondly, using a smoothing approximate method, we propose the smoothing inertial projection neural network (SIPNN) algorithm for solving the proposed general model. Under certain conditions, the proposed algorithm can converge to a stationary point. Finally, convergence behavior and successful recover performance experiments and a comparison experiment confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SIPNN algorithm.

The performance of the corresponding `p minimization problem can be characterized by its null space constant. In spite of the NP-hardness of computing the constant, its properties can still help in illustrating the performance of `p minimization. In this letter, we show the strict increase of the null space constant in the sparsity level k and its continuity in the exponent p. We also indicate that the constant is strictly increasing in p with probability 1 when the sensing matrix A is randomly generated. Finally, we show how these properties can help in demonstrating the performance of `p minimization, mainly in the relationship between the the exponent p and the sparsity level k.	compressed sensing;kernel (linear algebra);linear system;np-hardness;procedural generation;scott continuity;sparse matrix;with high probability	Laming Chen;Yuantao Gu	2015	IEEE Signal Process.

Whereas in stabilization of one single Lur'e system the conditions of passivity and sector boundedness for the nonlinear feedback loop are commonly assumed, in our context of networked Lur'e systems we adopt the stronger assumptions of incremental passivity and incremental sector boundedness. Throughout this paper the interconnection topologies among these Lur'e systems are assumed to be undirected and connected. The conventional a priori assumption on the existence of a synchronization manifold is not employed in this paper. Both for the case of incrementally passive as well as incrementally sector bounded nonlinearities we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the sufficient distributed robustly synchronizing protocols. The static feedback gains are computed by solving LMI's in terms of the matrices defining the individual agent dynamics.	feedback;graph (discrete mathematics);interconnection;linear matrix inequality;matlab;nonlinear system	Fan Zhang;Harry L.

This means that no probabilistic assumption is imposed on the distributions of initial state and noises besides the knowledge of their supports. These are the same assumptions that are used in set-membership estimation. By exploiting a formulation of set-membership estimation in terms of set of probability measures, we derive the equations of the set-membership PHD filter, which consist in propagating in time compact sets that include with guarantee the targets' states. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the comparison with a sequential Monte Carlo PHD filter which instead assumes that initial state and noises have uniform distributions.	algorithm;approximation;ibm notes;linear system;monte carlo method;numerical linear algebra;simulation;switzerland	Alessio Benavoli;Francesco Papi	2013	Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Robotics	54.019518586267125	5.420125145435699	50675
1d612e217b1fa7f55f0c859746de03ef5c5be82f	convergence of the expectation-maximization algorithm through discrete-time lyapunov stability theory		In this paper, we propose a dynamical systems perspective of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. More precisely, we can analyze the EM algorithm as a nonlinear state-space dynamical system. The EM algorithm is widely adopted for data clustering and density estimation in statistics, control systems, and machine learning. This algorithm belongs to a large class of iterative algorithms known as proximal point methods. In particular, we re-interpret limit points of the EM algorithm and other local maximizers of the likelihood function it seeks to optimize as equilibria in its dynamical system representation. Furthermore, we propose to assess its convergence as asymptotic stability in the sense of Lyapunov. As a consequence, we proceed by leveraging recent results regarding discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory in order to establish asymptotic stability (and thus, convergence) in the dynamical system representation of the EM algorithm.	cluster analysis;control system;dynamical system;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;limit cycle;local convergence;lyapunov fractal;machine learning;nonlinear system;parallels desktop for mac;rate of convergence;state space;time complexity	Orlando Romero;Sarthak Chatterjee;Sergio Daniel Pequito	2018	CoRR		dynamical systems theory;mathematical optimization;cluster analysis;dynamical system;expectation–maximization algorithm;lyapunov stability;mathematics;density estimation;lyapunov function;exponential stability	ML	72.51624870343981	4.483518528143937	50697

The ACW cepstrum is derived from a pole-zero transfer function whose denominator is the pth-order LP polynomial A(z). The numerator is a (p 1)th-order polynomial that is up to now found as follows. The roots ofA(z) are computed, and the corresponding residues obtained by a partial fraction xpansion of 1=A(z) are set to unity. Therefore, the numerator is the sum of all the (p 1)th-order cofactors of A(z). In this correspondence, we show that the numerator polynomial is merely the derivative of the denominator polynomial A(z). This greatly speeds up the computation of the numerator polynomial coefficients since it involves a simple scaling of the denominator polynomial coefficients. Root finding is completely eliminated. Since the denominator is guaranteed to be minimum phase and the numerator can be proven to be minimum phase, two separate recursions involving the polynomial coefficients establishes the ACW cepstrum. This new method, which avoids root finding, reduces the computer time significantly and imposes negligible overhead when compared with the approach of finding the LP cepstrum.	acorn business computer;cepstrum;coefficient;computation;image scaling;minimum phase;overhead (computing);polynomial;recursion;root-finding algorithm;speaker recognition;transfer function	Mihailo S.

Firstly, conditions to be satisfied for the data of the problem to ensure the existence of a unique solution is established and, after using a matrix separation of variables technique, an exact series solution is constructed. Each term in the series solution must solve a linear system of non-autonomous differential equations with oscillatory solutions. In order to approximate numerically the formal series solution, schemes based on the Magnus expansions are considered, and we show that commutator-free Magnus integrators are of great interest for solving this problem. We show that this family of methods admit a recursive relation which provides numerical approximations for all terms in the series solution. This iterative recursion has similar error growth as the exact solution, and this ensures the convergence of the numerical solution. These exponential integrators usually often provide good results, generally better than other standard numerical methods, both from the standpoint of preserving qualitative properties of the problem and the computational cost. Finally, numerical experiments are considered in order to test the behavior of the constructed algorithm.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;computation;experiment;exponential integrator;iterative method;linear system;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;recurrence relation;recursion;time complexity	Enrique Ponsoda;Sergio Blanes	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2014.05.050	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;exponential integrator;calculus;mathematics;magnus expansion;order of accuracy	HPC	82.8688209768379	14.558767389257214	50769

Recently, Pei et al. exploited the idea of obtaining higher order DFT-commuting matrices, which was introduced by Candan previously. The upper bound of O(h) approximation to N N commuting matrix is 2kþ1rN in Candan’s work and Pei et al. improved the proximity by removing this upper bound at the expense of higher computational cost. In this paper, we derive an exact closed form expression of infinite-order Taylor series approximation to discrete second derivative operator and employ it in the definition of excellent DFT commuting matrices. We show that in the limit this Taylor series expansion converges to a trigonometric function of second-order differentiating matrix. The commuting matrices possess eigenvectors that are closer to the samples of Hermite–Gaussian eigenfunctions of DFT better than any other methods in the literature with no additional computational cost. & 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our algorithms are inspired by the spectral method of Barnard, Pothen and Simon (1995), which derives a permutation for reducing the envelope-size of a sparse matrix by computing the second eigenvector of the associated Laplacian matrix. Two main modifications of that method are proposed and tested. The first is based on the experimental observation that it is often preferable to perform only few iterations of an iterative method converging to the second eigenvector; the second is the introduction of a weighted Laplacian. These simple ideas allow us to obtain a family of spectral methods that have been carefully tested on a set of matrices whose size ranges from few hundred to one million.	algorithm;cholesky decomposition;heuristic;iteration;iterative method;laplacian matrix;sparse matrix;spectral method	Gianna M.

f44f06b0c30595628aa3f1f6a6c140aceac3e62a	numerical modelling of thin elastic solids in contact. (modélisation numérique de solides élastiques minces en contact)		This Part deals with the existence and uniqueness of the acceleration and contact forces for Lagrangian systems subject to bilateral and/or unilateral constraints with or without sliding Coulomb’s friction. Sliding friction is known to yield singularities in the system, such as Painlevé’s paradox. Our work aims at providing sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system so that singularities are avoided (i.e., the contact problem is at least solvable). To this end, the frictional problem is treated as a perturbation of the frictionless case. We provide explicit criteria, in the form of calculable upper bounds on the friction coefficients, under which the frictional contact problem is guaranteed to remain well-posed. The results exposed in this part correspond to the contents of our publication [5]. Introduction. Lagrangian systems subject to (frictional) bilateral and unilateral constraints are considered. Such systems, mathematically described in Equation (1.1) below, feature a very rich dynamics, because they are nonlinear, nonsmooth, and set-valued. A large number of studies have been led on their well-posedness. Their goal is to formulate conditions under which (1.1) possesses a solution, that is, a trajectory (q(·), q̇(·)) belonging to a certain functional space (with absolutely continuous positions and right-continuous velocities of local bounded variations), and satisfying (1.1) for all t > 0. Well-posedness also consists in determining whether a solution is unique for given initial data (q(0), q̇(0)), whether solutions depend continuously on initial data or not, whether they converge to some equilibrium state (stability and control analysis [7]), etc. Besides such analysis, one may in turn be interested in properties of least mathematical relevance, but of high interest for mechanical engineers. Typically, are the contact forces calculable during persistent motion phases ? Are they calculable in a unique way ? If some solvability results can be obtained in the absence of friction, what happens when Coulomb friction is added at some contacts ? More generally, how does the system evolve during persistent contact phases in the presence of friction, e.g., does the dynamics exhibit some singular states ? In multibody systems dynamics, these questions are to be examined by studying the so-called contact problem, which assumes the mechanical state (q(t), q̇(t)) to be known at a given time t, and considers the acceleration q̈(t) and the contact forces at time t as unknowns. It thus results in a merely algebraic system, for which well-posedness remains a difficult question. Studying the contact problem is of high interest in multibody systems where one often wants to calculate the contact forces at a certain given time. Another motivation comes from event-driven numerical integration methods, where one has to solve the contact problem at a given time where possibly the state of the system may switch to another mode [8]. In this part our goal is to study conditions under which the contact problem is solvable. We first focus on frictionless systems, then on systems with sliding friction (single-valued law).

0a7aca7d46eae1bb70a43aa34aee6036f8e2cb56	a riemannian low-rank method for optimization over semidefinite matrices with block-diagonal constraints		We propose a new algorithm to solve optimization problems of the form min f(X) for a smooth function f under the constraints that X is positive semidefinite and the diagonal blocks ofX are small identity matrices. Such problems often arise as the result of relaxing a rank constraint (lifting). In particular, many estimation tasks involving phases, rotations, orthonormal bases or permutations fit in this framework, and so do certain relaxations of combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. The proposed algorithm exploits the facts that (1) such formulations admit low-rank solutions, and (2) their rank-restricted versions are smooth optimization problems on a Riemannian manifold. Combining insights from both the Riemannian and the convex geometries of the problem, we characterize when second-order critical points of the smooth problem reveal KKT points of the semidefinite problem. We compare against state of the art, mature software and find that, on certain interesting problem instances, what we call the staircase method is orders of magnitude faster, is more accurate and scales better.

The fibrewise attractor is the graph of an upper semicontinuous function θ → φ̂∞(θ) ∈ R+. For many choices of ĝ, φ̂∞ has a residual set of zeros, but φ̂∞ > 0 μSRB-almost surely, where μSRB is the Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measure of Ŝ−1. In such situations, we evaluate the stability index of the global attractor of the system, which is the subgraph {(θ, x) ∈ Θ × R+ : 0 x φ̂∞(θ)} of φ̂∞, at all regular points (θ, 0) in terms of the local exponents Γ̂(θ) := limn→∞(1/n) log ĝn(θ) and Λ̂(θ) := limn→∞(1/n) log |DuŜ−n(θ)| and of the positive zero s∗ of a certain thermodynamic pressure function associated with Ŝ and ĝ. (In queuing theory, an analogue of s∗ is known as Loynes’ exponent [R. M. Loynes, ‘The stability of a queue with non-independent inter-arrival and service times’, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 58 (1962) 497–520].)

9fa854919ba25ba8f8181339753fe9b2d50b8fc4	fast distributed subspace projection via graph filters		A significant number of linear inference problems in wireless sensor networks can be solved by projecting the observed signal onto a given subspace. Decentralized approaches avoid the need for performing such an operation at a central processor, thereby reducing congestion and increasing the robustness and the scalability of the network. Unfortunately, existing decentralized approaches either confine themselves to a reduced family of subspace projection tasks or need an infinite number of iterations to obtain the exact projection. To remedy these limitations, this paper develops a framework for computing a wide class of subspace projections in a decentralized fashion by relying on the notion of graph filtering. To this end, a methodology to obtain the shift matrix and the corresponding filter coefficients that provide exact subspace projection in a nearly minimal number of iterations is proposed. Numerical experiments corroborate the merits of the proposed approach.	central processing unit;coefficient;experiment;iteration;network congestion;scalability	Thilina Weerasinghe;Daniel Romero;Cesar Asensio-Marco;Baltasar Beferull-Lozano	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462110	mathematical optimization;robustness (computer science);wireless sensor network;filter (signal processing);scalability;shift matrix;filter design;subspace topology;convergence (routing);computer science	Robotics	62.9915114825276	10.025985770266532	51265

00b81ae50bea45e59ab1d4a81a92277b30702bc1	a class of switched piecewise quadratic systems for coupling gene expression with growth rate in bacteria		In this paper we propose a novel qualitative formalism to model gene expression dynamics dependent on dilution due to growth rate of the cell. We extend the piecewise linear (PL) systems by keeping the use of step functions to model the interactions between the elements and adding a growth rate expression to model the dilution effect. Focusing on the global gene expression machinery in bacteria, we model the growth rate as the minimum of two limiting factors: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosomes. The resulting system is a switched system with two piecewise quadratic (PQ) modes. We study the stability of such switched piecewise quadratic (SPQ) system starting from the stability analysis of the (PQ) modes. We also present and analyze by means of phase-planes a bidimensional SPQ model involving RNAP and ribosomes concentrations, which brings out the important differences with respect to PL systems. Finally, we qualitatively show that our growth rate expression acts well in different biological conditions.	interaction;pq tree;piecewise linear continuation;quadratic function;reflections of signals on conducting lines;relevance;semantics (computer science);synthetic biology;transcription (software)	Alfonso Carta;Madalena Chaves;Jean-Luc Gouzé	2013		10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00140	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Comp.	76.19528099038368	4.547234845632923	51319

When this system is linear, we can use the convolut ion sum to obtain a characterization of the output as a linear combinat ion of past inputs. Hill and McMurtry [4] showed that if we choose a Legendre binary noise sequence as input to a linear system, then the least squares approximation to the characterizing coefficients is expressible in a computationally feasible form, even when a large number of coefficients is involved. In this cor respondence we characterize a nonl inear system by a Manuscript received December 21, 1971; revised April 23, 1972, and May 9, 1972. The author is with the Department of Mathematics, California State University, Los Angeles, Calif. 90032. general ization of the convolut ion sum and show that if we choose Golomb’s maximal linear recurring binary-noise sequence [2] as input, then the least squares approximation to the characterizing coefficients is expressible in a computationally feasible form. Thus, the maximal linear recurring sequence occupies the same role in investigating certain nonl inear systems that the Legendre sequence occupies in investigating linear systems.	approximation;coefficient;golomb ruler;input/output;least squares;linear system;maximal set;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;time-invariant system	H.

By showing that these methods are special cases of the hybrid proximal extragradient method introduced by Solodov and Svaiter, we derive iteration-complexity bounds for them to obtain different types of approximate solutions. In the context of saddle-point problems, we also derive complexity bounds for these methods to obtain another type of an approximate solution, namely, that of an approximate saddle point. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of the above results by applying them to a large class of linearly constrained convex programming problems, including, for example, cone programming and problems whose objective functions converge to infinity as the boundaries of their effective domains are approached.	approximation algorithm;conic optimization;converge;convex optimization;iteration	Renato D.

Such systems arise in various applications including electromechanical systems, aerodynamics, structural analysis, robotics and vibration systems, in which the stabilization and improved performance play a crucial role. Due to the fact that the coefficient matrices of vector differential systems have special structures, it is of particular interest to maintain their structural properties while performing the design. The class of Metzlerian matrices is used as a constraint in the stabilization problem. Specifically, we provide a simple method to construct a stable feedback control law such that the closed-loop system matrix has the desired eigenvalues and maintains its original block companion structure with Metzlerian blocks.	algorithm;coefficient;dynamical system;feedback;numerical linear algebra;optimal control;polynomial matrix;robotics;structural analysis	Bahram Shafai;Rasoul Ghadami;Burak Yilmaz	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5280932	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	70.37083228603683	4.421864673129727	51432

It is an extension of FORTRAN IV which permits the use of the computer to perform the tedious algebraic computations that arise in many different fields. Among the areas in which it has been successfully used are: differentiation of complicated expressions; expansion of truncated power series, solution of simultaneous equations with literal coefficients, nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation, tensor analysis, and generation of the coefficients of equations in Keplerian motion. These types of analysis—which arose in the solution of specific practical problems in physics, engineering, astronomy, statistics and astronautics—are discussed in the paper. In addition to its usage for specific problem solutions, FORMAC can also be used to automate the analysis phase in certain production programming. Several such applications are presented.	admissible numbering;coefficient;compiler;computation;computer;dspace;formac (programming language);fortran;literal (mathematical logic);nonlinear system;problem solving;symbolic computation	Robert G.

b080235c1343e46cf197f04bae97df42a9836d03	distributed coestimation in heterogeneous sensor networks with time-varying active and passive node roles		In this paper, we address the problem of system-theoretic dynamic information fusion in time-varying heterogeneous sensor networks. This class of sensor networks involves nodes that receive observations from a process of interest (active nodes) and nodes that do not receive any information (passive nodes), where the active and passive node roles can be varying with respect to time. At any given time, in addition, active nodes are allowed to have nonidentical modalities such that they can observe different measurements from the process. Specifically, we propose a new distributed input and state “coestimation” architecture for time-varying heterogeneous sensor networks, where time evolution of input and state updates of each node both depend on the local input and state information exchanges. The stability and performance of the overall sensor network are guaranteed once the local sufficient stability conditions for each node are satisfied. As compared with our recent distributed input and state “estimation” approach for the same problem, where time evolution of input (respectively, state) update of each node only depends on the local input (respectively, state) information exchange, our illustrative numerical example also demonstrates a substantially improved dynamic input and state fusion performance.	distributed algorithm;information exchange;numerical analysis;theory	Dzung Tran;Tansel Yucelen;Sarangapani Jagannathan;David W.

This adds to the (still short) list of important problems where quantum computers are of help. Specifically, we show that the inverse of a well conditioned matrix can be approximated in quantum logspace with intermediate measurements. This should be compared with the best known classical algorithm for the problem that requires Ω(log2 n) space. We also show how to approximate the spectrum of a normal matrix, or the singular values of an arbitrary matrix, with ε additive accuracy, and how to approximate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix whose singular values are well separated.  The technique builds on ideas from several previous works, including simulating Hamiltonians in small quantum space (building on [2] and [10]), treating a Hermitian matrix as a Hamiltonian and running the quantum phase estimation procedure on it (building on [5]) and making small space probabilistic (and quantum) computation consistent through the use of offline randomness and the shift and truncate method (building on [8]).	approximation algorithm;computation;computer;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);l (complexity);online and offline;quantum computing;quantum phase estimation algorithm;randomness;simulation;singular value decomposition;truncation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Amnon Ta-Shma	2013		10.1145/2488608.2488720	quantum operation;quantum fourier transform;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;time-evolving block decimation;quantum t-design;quantum tomography;density matrix;quantum capacity;density matrix renormalization group;mathematics;quantum channel;quantum computer;povm;quantum process;quantum algorithm;algorithm;quantum phase estimation algorithm;quantum error correction	Theory	55.92070423812732	20.992972909011794	51933

In the first part, we describe a general framework for bound-constrained problems and analyze its convergence toward stationary points, using the Clarke–Jahn directional derivative. In the second part, we consider inequality constrained optimization problems where both objective function and constraints can possibly be nonsmooth. In this case, we first split the constraints into two subsets: difficult general nonlinear constraints and simple bound constraints on the variables. Then, we use an exact penalty function to tackle the difficult constraints and we prove that the original problem can be reformulated as the bound-constrained minimization of the proposed exact penalty function. Finally, we use the framework developed for the bound-constrained case to solve the penalized problem. Moreover, we prove that every accumulation point, under standard assumptions on the search directions, of the generated sequence of iterates is a stationary point of the original constrained problem. In the last part of the paper, we report extended numerical results on both bound-constrained and nonlinearly constrained problems, showing that our approach is promising when compared to some state-of-the-art codes from the literature.	code;constrained optimization;directional derivative;edmund m. clarke;first-order reduction;line search;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;penalty method;social inequality;stationary process;tree accumulation	Giovanni Fasano;Giampaolo Liuzzi;Stefano Lucidi;Francesco Rinaldi	2014	SIAM Journal on Optimization	10.1137/130940037	optimization problem;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;mathematical analysis;derivative-free optimization;penalty method;mathematics;mathematical economics	ML	74.29540166114089	24.220217073080686	51974

In general, the EKF performs well in Gaussian noises. But its performance may deteriorate substantially when the system is disturbed by heavy-tailed impulsive noises. In order to improve the robustness of EKF against impulsive noises, a new filter for nonlinear systems is proposed in this paper, namely the maximum correntropy extended Kalman filter (MCEKF), which adopts the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) as the optimization criterion instead of using the MMSE. In MCEKF, the state mean and covariance matrix propagation equation are used to obtain a prior estimation of the state and covariance matrix, and then a fixed-point algorithm is used to update the posterior estimates. The robustness of the new filter is confirmed by simulation results.	algorithm;extended kalman filter;fixed-point iteration;iterative method;kernel (operating system);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nonlinear system;performance;simulation;software propagation	Xi Liu;Hua Qu;Ji-hong Zhao;Badong Chen	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727408	covariance intersection;mathematical optimization;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics	Robotics	59.270478904349595	11.319548679300018	52014

For that purpose, using two well known test functions in optimization theory, a computer program was developed in MAPLE to examine this idea. It was seen that the improved method is giving better results than the previous method in the sense that converging the optimal point more rapidly.	fibonacci search technique;mathematical optimization	Murat Subasi;Necmettin Yildirim;Bünyamin Yildiz	2004	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/S0096-3003(02)00828-7	mathematical optimization;fibonacci number;applied mathematics;golden section search;fibonacci search technique;calculus;mathematics;algorithm;lucas number;algebra	Theory	76.79489928481932	21.0718364871362	52149
24ddf95fd579099befa37275eaea0bd3c076944a	convex quadratic relaxations for mixed-integer nonlinear programs in power systems		This paper presents a set of new convex quadratic relaxations for nonlinear and mixed-integer nonlinear programs arising in power systems. The considered models are motivated by hybrid discrete/continuous applications where existing approximations do not provide optimality guarantees. The new relaxations offer computational efficiency along with minimal optimality gaps, providing an interesting alternative to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming relaxations. Three case studies in optimal power flow, optimal transmission switching and capacitor placement demonstrate the benefits of the new relaxations.	approximation;ibm power systems;nonlinear system;semidefinite programming	Hassan L.

Such a recurrent neural network (termed Zhang neural network, ZNN) is designed based on an indefinite error-function instead of a norm-based energy function. Theoretical analysis and results of convergence and stability are presented to show the desirable properties (e.g., large-scale exponential convergence) of ZNN via two different activation-function arrays for solving systems of time-varying nonlinear equations. Computer-simulation results substantiate further the theoretical analysis and efficacy of ZNN for solving systems of time-varying nonlinear equations.	activation function;artificial neural network;computation;computer simulation;converge;mathematical optimization;network model;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;recurrent neural network;scientific literature;time complexity	Yunong Zhang;Lin Xiao;Bingguo Mu	2012	2012 8th International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2012.6234592	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	73.4970369630007	4.757020884179062	52388

By virtue of the Bell’s polynomials, an effective and straightforward way is presented to explicitly construct its bilinear form and soliton solution. Furthermore, based on the bilinear formalism and the extended homoclinic test method, the kinky breather wave solutions and rational breather wave solutions of the equation are well constructed. It is hoped that our results can be used to enrich the dynamical behavior of the (3 + 1)dimensional nonlinear wave fields. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We first consider the correspondence between Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points and regularity conditions for the general NSDP and its reformulation via slack variables. Then, we obtain a pair of “no-gap” second-order optimality conditions that are essentially equivalent to the ones already considered in the literature. We conclude with the analysis of some computational prospects of the squared slack variables approach for NSDP.	computation;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;netgear nsdp;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;semidefinite programming;slack variable;tucker decomposition	Bruno F.

Although multiplication and related operations are easy in both real and complex systems, addition and subtraction are hard, especially when interpolation is used to implement the system. Both real and complex logarithmic arithmetic benefit from the use of co-transformation, which converts an addition or subtraction from a region where interpolation is expensive to a region where it is easier. Two co-transformations that accomplish this goal are introduced. The first is an approximation based on real analysis of the subtraction logarithm. The second is based on simple algebra that applies for both real and complex values and that works for both addition and subtraction.	algorithm;approximation;cordic;complex systems;fast fourier transform;interpolation;iterative method;logarithmic number system;sign bit;singularity project;technological singularity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mark G.

A dynamical flow network is modeled as a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed acyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at the origin. Routing policies regulate the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle density, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current particle density on that link through a flow function. The robustness of distributed routing policies is evaluated in terms of the network's weak resilience, which is defined as the infimum sum of link-wise magnitude of disturbances under which the total inflow at the destination node of the perturbed dynamical flow network is positive. The weak resilience of a dynamical flow network with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper-bounded by the network's min-cut capacity, independently of the initial flow conditions. Moreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on local information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to that, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that locality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do not cause loss of weak resilience.	directed acyclic graph;dynamical system;flow network;locality of reference;maxima and minima;maximal set;minimum cut;real-time locating system;routing	Giacomo Como;Ketan Savla;Daron Acemoglu;Munther A.

A step is then computed by solving an equality constrained quadratic program based on this active-set estimate. This approach respresents an extension of the standard sequential linear-quadratic programming (SLQP) algorithm. It can also be viewed as an attempt to implement a generalization of the gradient projection algorithm for nonlinear programming. To this effect, we explore the relation between the parametric method and the gradient projection method in the bound constrained case. Numerical results compare the performance of this algorithm with SLQP and gradient projection.

In general, the search for such functions is a hard problem. As a result, numerous techniques have been developed to search for polynomial differential variants that yield positive invariants and polynomial Lyapunov functions that prove stability, for systems defined by polynomial differential equations. However, the systematic search for non-polynomial functions is considered a much harder problem, and has received much less attention. In this paper, we combine ideas from computer algebra with the Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) relaxation for polynomial positive semi-definiteness to find non polynomial differential variants and Lyapunov functions for polynomial ODEs. Using the well-known concept of Darboux polynomials, we show how Darboux polynomials can, in many instances, naturally lead to specific forms of Lyapunov functions that involve rational function, logarithmic and exponential terms.We demonstrate the value of our approach by deriving non-polynomial Lyapunov functions for numerical examples drawn from the literature.	dynamical system;linear programming relaxation;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;polynomial;reachability;semiconductor industry;shapiro polynomials;symbolic computation;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Eric Goubault;Jacques-Henri Jourdan;Sylvie Putot;Sriram Sankaranarayanan	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6859330	mathematical optimization;polynomial matrix;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;symmetric polynomial;alternating polynomial;lyapunov function;stable polynomial;equation;resultant;lyapunov equation;degree of a polynomial;mathematics;monic polynomial;stability theory;factorization of polynomials;matrix polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;polynomial remainder theorem;square-free polynomial;polynomial	Theory	72.2616944512612	5.351495074757824	53074

The bias of such estimators is typically O(1/b/sup 2/), where b is the length of the short blocks. Much of the current research on multitapering has been focusing on reducing the proportionality constant implicit in the term O(1/b/sup 2/). In this letter, we show how-with the use of complex-valued tapers-the bias of the spectral estimator can be reduced by orders of magnitude becoming O(1/b/sup p/) for (possibly) high p. Expressions for the estimators' variance and MSE are presented with an aim toward optimal estimation. An automatic method of optimally choosing the block size b is given. Finally, the usage of multiple complex tapers is proposed in an effort to reduce sidelobe size and improve finite-sample performance.	block size (cryptography);newton's method;spectral density estimation	D.

Moreover, it is proved that the new detector can be generalized to the integration of the nth-power (2 < n) modulus of the fractional Fourier transform via mathematical derivation.

Current self-triggered strategies are known to be quite conservative whereas event-triggered approaches are costly to implement on distributed systems that rely on wireless communication for information transmission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel class of team-triggered coordination laws that combine ideas from event- and self-triggered control, are implementable on networked systems, and maintain desired levels of performance. We characterize the asymptotic convergence properties of team-triggered strategies and show that they perform no worse than self-triggered approaches in terms of required communication.

cb45c5c4c112386acfe0584d85357550c7c629cb	solutions of k-hypergeometric differential equations		which has three regular singular points: 0, 1, and ∞. The hypergeometric differential equation is a prototype: every ordinary differential equation of second-order with at most three regular singular points can be brought to the hypergeometric differential equation by means of a suitable change of variables. The solutions of hypergeometric differential equation include many of the most interesting special functions of mathematical physics. Solutions to the hypergeometric differential equation are built out of the hypergeometric series. The solution of Euler’s hypergeometric differential equation is called hypergeometric function or Gaussian function 2 F 1 introduced by Gauss [2]. The equation has two linearly independent solutions at each of the three regular singular points 0, 1, and∞. Kummer [3] derived a set of 6 distinct solutions of hypergeometric differential equation.These include the hypergeometric function of Gauss and all of them could be expressed in terms of Gauss’s function. For more details on Kummer’s 24 solutions, see [4]. Recently, Dı́az et al. [5–7] have introduced Pochhammer k-symbol. They have introduced k-gamma and k-beta functions and proved a number of their properties.They have also studied k-zeta functions and k-hypergeometric functions based on Pochhammer k-symbols for factorial functions. In 2010, Kokologiannaki [8] and Krasniqi [9] followed the work of Diaz et al. and obtained some important results for the k-beta, k-gamma, k-hypergeometric, and k-zeta functions. Also, Krasniqi [10] gave a limit for the k-gamma and k-beta functions. In 2012, Mubeen and Habibullah [11, 12] introduced a variant of fractional integrals to be called k-fractional integral which was based on k-gamma function and gave its application. They also introduced an integral representation of some generalized confluent k-hypergeometric functions and k-hypergeometric functions by using the properties of Pochhammer k-symbols, k-gamma, and k-beta functions.

The goal of the paper is to design a sample size adaptation technique to guarantee a quality of a filtering estimate produced by the particle filter which is an approximation of the true filtering estimate. The quality is given by a difference between the approximate filtering estimate and the true filtering estimate. The estimate may be a point estimate or a probability density function estimate. The proposed technique adapts the sample size to keep the difference within pre-specified bounds with a pre-specified probability. The particle filter with the proposed sample size adaptation technique is illustrated in a numerical example.	approximation algorithm;email filtering;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;particle filter	Ondrej Straka;Miroslav Simandl	2011	Kybernetika		probability density function;control theory;mathematical optimization;mathematics;filter (signal processing);particle filter;nonlinear system;point estimation;sample size determination;auxiliary particle filter	ML	56.666239969678244	5.298537008498805	53458

Scope and purpose: We address the problem of packing orthogonal rectangles within an arbitrary convex region. We aim to show that smooth nonlinear programming models are a reliable alternative for packing problems and that well-known general-purpose methods based on continuous optimization can be used to solve the models.

5c17653a716b08f1e522ee37fe799f3935614282	mathematical analysis for csi scheme with the interpolation kernel size increased		The cubic-spline interpolation (CSI) scheme is known to be designed to resample the discrete image data based on the least-square method in conjunction with the cubic convolution interpolation (CCI) function. In this CSI scheme, the improved quality of resampling can be achieved as the interpolation kernel size increases. However, the improvement of the performance gets less and less. This means that the performance of the CSI scheme has not been significantly improved and converges toward a constant value when the interpolation kernel size exceeds a certain value. A proof of this result is given in this study and has never been seen in the literature to the authors' knowledge. Moreover, this study analyses the relationship between the performance and computational complexity of the CSI schemes with different interpolation kernel sizes and compares them from a structural point of view. Simulation results indicate that it is in agreement with the theoretic derivations. Since the arithmetic operations required are increasing linearly with the increment of the interpolation kernel size, selecting an interpolation kernel size gives the best trade-off between the performance and computational complexity in practical applications. However, the optimum choice of the interpolation kernel size depends crucially on effective demand.	computational complexity theory;convolution;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;kernel (operating system);linux;simulation;spline interpolation;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Shaohua Hong;Lin Wang;Tsung-Ching Lin;Trieu-Kien Truong	2017	IET Image Processing	10.1049/iet-ipr.2016.0512	spline interpolation;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;bilinear interpolation;monotone cubic interpolation;interpolation;polynomial interpolation;stairstep interpolation;inverse quadratic interpolation;tricubic interpolation;bicubic interpolation;linear interpolation;nearest-neighbor interpolation;multivariate interpolation;trilinear interpolation	HPC	61.614137409382295	25.08754716013264	53495

For example, large and sparse systems of linear equations ;2; are formed during the use of the number field sieve for integer factorization, and elements of the null space of these systems are sampled.Two rather different kinds of block algorithms have recently been considered. Block Wiedemann algorithms have now been presented and fully analyzed. Block Lanczos algorithms were proposed earlier but are not yet as well understood. In particular, proofs of reliability of block Lanczos algorithms are not yet available. Nevertheless, an examination of the computational number theory literature suggests that block Lanczos algorithms continue to be preferred.This report presents a block Lanczos algorithm that is somewhat simpler than block algorithms that are presently in use and provably reliable for computations over large fields. To my knowledge, this is the first block Lanczos algorithm for which a proof of reliability is available.A different Krylov-based approach is considered for computations over small fields: It is shown that if Wiedemann's sparse matrix preconditioner is applied to an arbitrary matrix then the number of nontrivial invariant factors of the result is, with high probability, quite small. A Krylov-based algorithm to compute a partial Frobenius decomposition can then be used to sample from the null space of the original matrix or to compute its rank. This yields a randomized (Monte Carlo) black box algorithm for matrix rank that is asymptotically faster, in the small field case, than any other that is presently known.	black box;block lanczos algorithm;block wiedemann algorithm;block cipher;computation;computational number theory;general number field sieve;integer factorization;kernel (linear algebra);krylov subspace;lanczos resampling;linear equation;matrix multiplication;monte carlo algorithm;preconditioner;randomized algorithm;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;with high probability	Wayne Eberly	2004		10.1145/1005285.1005305	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;lanczos algorithm;rank;sparse matrix;lanczos approximation;integer factorization;mathematics;linear equation;numerical linear algebra;linear system;randomized algorithm;finite field;general number field sieve;monte carlo method;computational number theory;algebra	Theory	82.26614580977447	24.47031110682132	53509

First, we discuss modeling the linear part of the bispectrum of a signal, called the “linear bispectrum.” We decompose the bispectrum of a signal into two multiplicative factors. The linear bispectrum is defined as the factor of the bispectrum that can exactly be modeled using a third-order white noise driven linear shiftinvariant (LSI) system. We show that the desired Fourier-phase and magnitude information about the unknown LSI system is contained in the linear bispectrum of the system output. Thus, we propose representing the linear bispectrum of the output of the unknown LSI system using an ARMA model, where the MA parameters correspond to the unknown FIR system impulse response coefficients, and the AR parameters model the linear bispectrum of the input signal. We then provide an algorithm to identify the MA and AR parameters of this ARMA model. Finally, we elaborate on how the proposed method is different from fitting an ARMA model directly to the bicumulants or the bispectrum of the system output. Application of the proposed method to blur identification is presented.	algorithm;bispectrum;coefficient;finite impulse response;gaussian blur;linear logic;minimum phase;stationary process;white noise	A.

We focus on stochastic problems in which the objective takes the form of expected values and the feasible set is the intersection of a large number of convex sets. We propose a class of algorithms that perform both stochastic gradient descent and random feasibility updates simultaneously. At every iteration, the algorithms sample a number of projection points onto a randomly selected small subsets of all constraints. Three feasibility update schemes are considered: averaging over random projected points, projecting onto the most distant sample, projecting onto a special polyhedral set constructed based on sample points. We prove the almost sure convergence of these algorithms, and analyze the iterates’ feasibility error and optimality error, respectively. We provide new convergence rate benchmarks for stochastic first-order optimization with many constraints. The rate analysis and numerical experiments reveal that the algorithm using the polyhedral-set projection scheme is the most efficient one within known algorithms.	algorithm;constraint inference;convex function;convex optimization;convex set;experiment;feasible region;first-order reduction;iteration;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;polyhedron;program optimization;random projection;randomness;rate of convergence;sample complexity;stochastic gradient descent	Mengdi Wang;Yichen Chen;Jialin Liu;Yuantao Gu	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;stochastic optimization;dykstra's projection algorithm;mathematics;proximal gradient methods	ML	72.77346881114039	24.743220130402808	53741

The cost of these evaluations depends widely on the technique used to obtain the derivatives and on some characteristics of the objective function: its size, structure and complexity. Functions with banded Hessian are a special case that we study in this paper. Because of their partial separability, the cost of obtaining their high order derivatives, subtly computed by the technique of automatic differentiation, makes High order Chebyshev methods more interesting for banded systems than for dense functions. These methods have an attractive efficiency as we can improve their convergence order without increasing significantly their algorithmic costs. This paper provides an analysis of the per-iteration complexities of High order Chebyshev methods applied to sparse functions with banded Hessians. The main result can be summarized as: the per-iteration complexity of a High order Chebyshev method is of order of the objective function’s.

This particular representation serves as an instrument in the characterization of the exact Bayesian filter. Subsequently, novel finite dimensional filter algorithms are developed through introducing approximations to the exact Bayesian solution. One filter approximation assumes conditionally Gaussian density of the joint target state given the joint target manoeuvre mode and the algorithm is referred to as Joint IMM Coupled PDA (JIMMCPDA). The specialty of this filter algorithm is that both the IMM step and the PDA step are performed jointly over the modes and states of all targets. Subsequently, the CPDA track coalescence avoiding hypothesis pruning approach of (Blom & Bloem, 2000) is extended to bring the joint target modes into account. The resulting filter algorithm is referred to as track-coalescence-avoiding Joint IMM Coupled PDA. The two novel algorithms are compared to IMMJPDA and IMMPDA through Monte Carlo simulations.	approximation;approximation algorithm;bayesian network;blom's scheme;chen–ho encoding;coalescing (computer science);coefficient;continuation;entity–relationship model;koch snowflake;monte carlo method;personal digital assistant;peterson's algorithm;simulation	Henk A.

For every future DG installation, the relay settings need to be modified to guarantee protection coordination that can lead to numerous changes in relay settings. This paper presents a novel approach to plan relay protection coordination considering future DG installations. Thus, this paper aims at proposing a method capable of optimally identifying one set of relay settings valid for all possible future DG planning scenarios. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a linear programming problem and the simplex algorithm is utilized to solve it. The proposed approach is tested on the distribution part of the modified meshed IEEE 14-bus system and the IEEE 13-bus radial test system. Comparative studies have been conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach under various planning scenarios considering application of fault current limiters.	discontinuous galerkin method;fault tolerance;flow chart language (fcl);linear programming;radial (radio);relay;simplex algorithm	Lukasz Huchel;Hatem H.

Likewise, in a multi-StQP we have to maximize a (possibly indefinite) quadratic form over the Cartesian product of several standard simplices (of possibly different dimensions). Among many other applications, multi-StQPs occur in Machine Learning Problems. Several converging monotone interior point methods are established, which differ from the usual ones used in cone programming. Further, we prove an exact cone programming reformulation for establishing rigorous yet affordable bounds and finding improving directions.	cartesian closed category;cone (formal languages);conic optimization;converge;ecosystem model;emoticon;feasible region;interior point method;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;local search (optimization);machine learning;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;optimization problem;pattern recognition;quadratic programming;robustness (computer science);sockets direct protocol;monotone	Immanuel M.

Comput. Appl. Math. 6 (1980) 19] is of the FSAL type and uses seven stages per step. This algorithm has been recommended by Shampine [Math. Comput. 46 (1986) 135] as a candidate for an efficient production RK code. In fact the new MATLAB function ode45 is based on this algorithm. Later on another efficient RK 5(4) 7 embedded algorithm, also having orders 5 and 4, is developed by Sharp and Smart [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 14 (1993) 338]. The last algorithm uses seven stages per step and it is of the non-FSAL type. The current paper shows that by using seven stages per step a general four-parameter, non-FSAL embedded RK algorithm having orders 6 and 4 may be designed. A special algorithm, called RK 6(4) 7 new is obtained by using suitable choices for the free parameters. This new algorithm together with the RK 5(4) 7FM in [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 6 (1980) 19] and the RK 5(4) 7 in [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 14 (1993) 338] are applied to some test problems, which have known exact solutions. It is found that the new algorithm is competitive comparing with the algorithms in [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 6 (1980) 19] and in [SIAM J. Sci.

Based on the proposed algorithm, the eigenvalues that have the largest and smallest modulus, real parts, or absolute values of imaginary parts can be extracted, respectively, aswell as the corresponding eigenvectors. Although the ordinary differential equation on which our proposed algorithm is built is only n-dimensional, it can succeed to extract n-dimensional complex eigenvectors that are indeed 2n-dimensional real vectors. Moreover, we show that extracting eigen-pairs of general real matrices can be reduced to those of real normal matrices by employing the norm-reducing skill. Numerical experiments verified the computational capability of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;artificial neural network;computation;eigen (c++ library);experiment;imaginary time;modulus robot;numerical method	Xiongfei Zou;Ying Tang;Shirong Bu;Zhengxiang Luo;Shouming Zhong	2013	J.

The number of computations needed by the algorithm can be expressed as a polynomial of the variables  n  and  m . The total degree of this polynomial defines the complexity order of the algorithm. In this paper we establish that the matrix associated with Bezout's resultant appearing in the stability test of causal or semicausal recursive filters has 2 as its displacement rank. This permits us to apply the generalized Levinson-Szego algorithm to derive a new algorithm for testing the 2-D digital filters' stability. This algorithm is proposed for quarter-plane or nonsymmetric half-plane recursive filters with real coefficients and without nonessential singularities of the second kind. Its complexity order is equal to 4. Note that the complexity order of the fastest existing algorithms is equal to 5.	algorithm;recursion	Michel Barret;Messaoud Benidir	1994	Signal Processing	10.1016/0165-1684(94)90107-4	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;control theory;mathematics;infinite impulse response;algorithm	ML	59.76348182843973	15.890555012266852	54166

A mixed model with both stochastic inputs and deterministic disturbances and faults is formulated over a sliding window. Algorithms for detecting and isolating faults on-line and analyzing the probability for correct and incorrect decisions off-line are provided. A major part of the paper is devoted to discussing properties of this model-based approach and generalizations to cases of incomplete model knowledge, and non-linear non-Gaussian models. For this purpose, a simulation example is used throughout the paper for numerical illustrations, and real-life applications for motivations. The final section discusses the reverse problem: fault detection approaches to statistical signal processing. It is motivated by three applications that a simple CUSUM detector in feedback loop with an adaptive filter can mitigate the inherent trade-off between estimation accuracy and tracking speed in linear filters.	fault detection and isolation;statistical signal processing	Fredrik Gustafsson	2007	Annual Reviews in Control	10.1016/j.arcontrol.2007.02.004	adaptive filter;kalman filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system;fault detection and isolation;statistics	Arch	58.091628454928944	4.804502725121856	54185

The framework optimizes the pole-zero locations for behavioral properties of magnitude and phase response, and the implementation property of quality factors, subject to constraints on the same properties. We formulate the constrained nonlinear optimization problem as a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) problem. SQP solvers are robust when provided formulas for the gradients of the objective function and constraints. We program Mathematica to compute the gradient formulas and convert the formulas into Matlab programs to perform the optimization. The automated approach eliminates errors in manipulating the algebraic equations and transcribing equations into software. The key contributions are (1) an automated, extensible, multicriteria digital IIR lter optimization framework, and (2) a novel lter design.

Using the iterative correction appearing in the Jarratt method of the fourth order, it is proved that the convergence rate of the modified Ehrlich method is increased from 3 to 6. This acceleration of the convergence is obtained with few additional numerical operations which means that the proposed combined method possesses very high computational efficiency. Moreover, the convergence rate can be further accelerated using the Gauss–Siedel approach (single-step or serial mode). A great part of the paper is devoted to the computational aspects of the discussed methods, including numerical examples. A comparison procedure shows that the new iterative method is more efficient than existing methods in the considered class. 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1. Computational efficiency of root-finding methods During the last decade a ‘‘flood” of root finding methods have appeared in various journals for applied and computational mathematics, often without a proper justification. Namely, most of these nonprogressive methods are either rediscovered ones or they do not improve the computational efficiency of the existing methods. In this paper we propose a combined method whose computational efficiency is the highest within the class of iterative methods for the simultaneous approximation of simple complex roots of algebraic polynomials, based on fixed point relations. We have restricted ourselves to this class of methods since they are frequently used in practice, possess a high computational efficiency and they can be successfully implemented on parallel computers. Many papers devoted to iterative methods for solving nonlinear equations, including algebraic equations, discuss and estimate the efficiency of these methods only on the basis of numerical examples which play, at the same time, the key role in the comparison with other methods. In fact, this approach is deficient since it strongly depends on the tested functions and initial approximations. The estimation of computational efficiency by the amount of computational work, most frequently expressed by the central processor unit (CPU) time, is obviously considerably more realistic. A method is more efficient as its amount of computational work is smaller. In other words, the most efficient method (within the tested iterative methods) is the one which satisfies the required termination criterion (for example, the accuracy of produced approximations to the zeros attains a given tolerance s) for the smallest CPU time. The efficiency of an iterative method ðMÞ can be successfully estimated using the coefficient of efficiency given by EðMÞ 1⁄4 rj=h: ð1Þ .

Petković / Applied Mathematics and Computation 204 (2008) 949–956 Here r is the R-order of convergence of the iterative method ðMÞ, h is the computational cost and j is a normalization constant (see [13, Ch. 6] and [14]). As shown in [13, Ch. 6], the rank of methods obtained by (1) mainly matches well with real CPU time. The same ranking is obtained by applying the following alternative formula: E ðMÞ 1⁄4 log r h ð2Þ (see [11, Ch. 1, Sec. 9]). Considering iterative methods for finding a simple real zero of a given real function, the computation cost h is usually expressed by the number of evaluations of this function (at different points) and its derivatives. However, the situation is quite different when we apply the iterative method for the simultaneous determination of polynomial zeros. In this case it is preferable to calculate the computation cost according to the number of arithmetic operations per iteration, taken with certain weights depending on the processor time. Let us denote these weights by wA; wS; wM and wD for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, respectively. If the employed iterative formula requires the calculation of the square root(s), then this operation must be also included. Let AðnÞ; SðnÞ; MðnÞ and DðnÞ be the number of additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions in the realization of one iteration for all n zeros. Then the computational cost h can be (approximately) expressed as h 1⁄4 hðnÞ 1⁄4 wAAðnÞ þwSSðnÞ þwMMðnÞ þwDDðnÞ and from (1) and (2) we obtain: EðM; nÞ 1⁄4 rj=ðwAAðnÞþwSSðnÞþwM MðnÞþwDDðnÞÞ ð3Þ and E ðM;nÞ 1⁄4 log r wAAðnÞ þwSSðnÞ þwMMðnÞ þwDDðnÞ : ð4Þ The both formulae (3) and (4) can be used in ranking the considering methods dealing with the ratio of coefficients of efficiency. However, we choose the formula (4) since it depends only on the essential quantities and parameters (different from (3) which depends on the normalization constant j) and gives a more realistic estimation of the efficiency of the considered methods. It is reasonable to take the weights appearing in (3) and (4) proportionally to the number of cycles of the four basic operations or the numbers of flops per second. These performances depend mainly on the precision of the employed computer arithmetic and hardware (the power of processor (with/without co-processor)). Since iterative methods of high convergence order (such as methods considered in this paper) use multiprecision arithmetic, in our comparison procedure we used the data given in [10] for multiprecision arithmetic operations. More details on multiprecision arithmetic can be also found in [6]. We note that some programming packages (for example, Mathematica, version 5 or 6) use the GNU multiprecision package GMP developed by Granlund [8]. Remark 1. As noted in [10], multiprecision computation not only produces more precise results, but also leads more surely to the correct results in all situations when large number of cancellations or rounding errors appear. Moreover, it improves the convergence of many iterative algorithms leading to an overall increase of computational speed. 2. Improved methods of Ehrlich’s type The aim of this paper is to accelerate convergence and increase computational efficiency of the iterative methods of Ehrlich’s type for the simultaneous determination of the zeros of algebraic polynomials (see [1,2,5,11,12]). The improvement is attained by applying Jarratt’s correction [9] and n additional polynomial evaluations (horners). The presented analysis of computational efficiency shows that the proposed method is the most efficient among all existing methods based on fixed point relations. Let PðzÞ 1⁄4 Qn j1⁄41ðz fjÞ be a monic polynomial of degree n having simple real or complex zeros f1; . . . ; fn. Denote with hðzÞ 1⁄4 PðzÞ=PðzÞ the correction term that appears in the Newton method ẑ 1⁄4 z hðzÞ of the second order. Using the logarithmic derivative: hðzÞ 1⁄4 PðzÞ PðzÞ 1⁄4 d dz log PðzÞ 1 1⁄4 Xn j1⁄41 1 z fj ! 1 ; ð5Þ we single out the term z fi from (5) and obtain the fixed point relation (shorter FPR in the sequel): fi 1⁄4 z hðzÞ 1 hðzÞ Pn j1⁄41 j–i 1 z fj ði 1⁄4 1; . . . ;nÞ: ð6Þ This FPR is suitable for the construction of iterative methods for the simultaneous determination of polynomial zeros. I. Petković / Applied Mathematics and Computation 204 (2008) 949–956 951 We recall that the two-step Jarratt method for solving a nonlinear equation f ðzÞ 1⁄4 0 is given by the iterative formula: y 1⁄4 z 2 3 f ðzÞ f 0ðzÞ ; ẑ 1⁄4 wðzÞ :1⁄4 z 1 2 f ðzÞ f 0ðzÞ f ðzÞ 3f 0ðyÞ f 0ðzÞ : ð7Þ As shown in [9], the order of convergence of the Jarratt method is four if the zero f of f is simple, that is, wðzÞ f 1⁄4 Omððz fÞÞ; ð8Þ where the denotation z1 1⁄4 Omðz2Þ or z1 mag z2 means that two complex numbers z1 and z2 have the magnitudes of the same order. In what follows we will assume that the function f in (7) is an algebraic polynomial, that is, f ðzÞ PðzÞ. Let z1; . . . ; zn be approximations to the zeros f1; . . . ; fn. We also introduce the following approximations: zN 1⁄4 z hðzÞ ðNewton’s approximationÞ; zJ 1⁄4 z cðzÞ 1⁄4 z 1 2 hðzÞ PðzÞ 3PðyÞ PðzÞ ; y 1⁄4 z 2 3 hðzÞ ðJarratt’s approximationÞ: Jarratt’s correction is denoted by cðzÞ 1⁄4 1 2 hðzÞ þ PðzÞ 3PðyÞ PðzÞ : ð9Þ Substituting approximations z1; . . . ; zn instead of the zeros f1; . . . ; fn on the right side of FPR (6) and taking z 1⁄4 zi, the third order Ehrlich method for the simultaneous determination of simple zeros of the polynomial P follows from (6): ẑi 1⁄4 zi hðziÞ 1 hðziÞ Pn j1⁄41 j–i 1 zi zj ði 1⁄4 1; . . . ;nÞ ð10Þ (see [5]). If the approximations z1; . . . ; zn are sufficiently good, then ẑi is a new improved approximation to the zero fi. The iterative method (10) was also considered by Börsch-Supan [2] and Aberth [1]. Having in mind the described construction of Ehrlich’s method (10) and the structure of the FPR (6), we see that if zj ! fj, then ẑi ! fi. In other words, the better approximations to fj will produce a method faster than Ehrlich’s method (10). Nourein [12] utilized this fact and used the Newton approximation zj hðzjÞ in (6) (instead of zj) to derive the fourth order method: ẑi 1⁄4 zi hðziÞ 1 hðziÞ Pn j1⁄41 j–i 1 zi zjþhðzjÞ ði 1⁄4 1; . . . ;nÞ: ð11Þ As shown in [13], Nourein’s method (11) is the most efficient in the class of iterative methods constructed from fixed point relations. Actually, the acceleration of convergence order from 3 to 4 is attained using a negligible number of additional numerical operations (n subtractions per iteration in complex arithmetic) since the already calculated corrections hðzjÞ are used. The main goal of this paper is to increase the computational efficiency of Ehrlich’s method (10) and Nourein’s method (11). For this purpose, we will apply suitable corrections originated from a method faster than Newton’s method. We found that Jarratt’s two-step method (7) (of the fourth order) is convenient. Taking into account the introduced approximations, we combine Ehrlich’s and Jarratt’s method and derive the following iterative total-step method f	algebraic equation;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;arithmetic logic unit;binary prefix;central processing unit;coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;computational mathematics;computer hardware;coprocessor;flops;film-type patterned retarder;fixed point (mathematics);gnu multiple precision arithmetic library;gauss–seidel method;iteration;iterative method;mag (cryptography);monic polynomial;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;parallel computing;performance;rate of convergence;root-finding algorithm;round-off error;series acceleration;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula;wolfram mathematica;z1 (computer)	Ivan Petkovic	2008	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2008.08.005	local convergence;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;calculus;mathematics;geometry;iterative method;algebra	ML	80.31874030653158	17.461784023815728	54349

This zoom-technique is based on subband decomposition and linear prediction. The subband-decomposition idea applied to both FFT [2], [3] and DCT [4], [5] to find these transforms with less computations, is used in [1] in combination with the linear prediction algorithm to implement a new zoom technique with higher spectral resolution efficiency than other techniques. In this work the new algorithm computational complexity is studied. The zoom capability of this subband decomposition zoom technique is also explained by considering many factors such as the gain of the linear prediction modelling and the power spectral density and autocorrelation between the linear prediction coefficients [6]. The accuracy of the technique in terms of the prediction error and minimum allowable signal to noise ratio is also included in this paper. Finally, the adaptive capability of the subband-FFT is included in the zoom algorithm to select the band of most energy (the band to be zoomed).	autocorrelation;coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;decibel;digital zoom;discrete cosine transform;fast fourier transform;linear predictive coding;qr decomposition;sac;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density estimation;split-radix fft algorithm;stellar classification	Abdulnasir Hossen;Ulrich Heute	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics	HPC	58.16301954775618	19.668450494208802	54588

In particular, we propose an interior point (IP) method for them and establish its global convergence. Further, by exploiting the structure of the Hessian matrix of the optimality criteria, we derive an explicit formula for computing its rank. Using this result, we then demonstrate that the Newton direction arising in the IP method can be computed efficiently via Sherman-MorrisonWoodbury formula when the size of the moment matrix is small relative to the size of design space. Finally, we compare our IP method with the widely used multiplicative algorithm introduced by Silvey et al. [33] and the standard IP solver SDPT3 [36, 40]. The computational results show that our IP method generally outperforms these two methods in both speed and solution quality.	algorithm;computation;design of experiments;gnu portable threads;hessian;interior point method;local convergence;moment matrix;newton;optimal design;solver	Zhaosong Lu;Ting Kei Pong	2013	SIAM J.

The method has been generalised here to allow for the determination of symmetries for FDEs with nn independent variables and for systems of partial FDEs. The algorithm has been implemented in the new MAPLE package FracSym (Jefferson and Carminati 2013) which uses routines from the MAPLE symmetry packages DESOLVII (Vu, Jefferson and Carminati, 2012) and ASP (Jefferson and Carminati, 2013). We introduce FracSym by investigating the symmetries of a number of FDEs; specific forms of any arbitrary functions, which may extend the symmetry algebras, are also determined.

We propose, and provide theoretical justification for, a new procedure for adaptive partition (“h”-refinement) of the parameter domain into smaller parameter subdomains: we pursue a hierarchical splitting of the parameter (sub)domains based on proximity to judiciously chosen parameter anchor points within each subdomain. Subsequently, we construct individual standard RB approximation spaces (“p”-refinement) over each subdomain. Greedy parameter sampling procedures and a posteriori error estimation play important roles in both the “h”-type and “p”-type stages of the new algorithm. We present illustrative numerical results for a convection-diffusion problem: the new “hp”-approach is considerably faster (respectively, more costly) than the standard “p”-type reduced basis method in the online (respectively, offline) stage.	adaptive mesh refinement;approximation;greedy algorithm;numerical analysis;online and offline;sampling (signal processing)	Jens L.

It also presents new formulae that show how the cost of calculating and factorizing the JSIM vary with the topology of the tree. These formulae show that the cost of calculating forward dynamics for a branched tree can be considerably less than the cost for an unbranched tree of the same size. Branches can also reduce complexity; some examples are presented of kinematic trees for which the complexity of calculating and factorizing the JSIM are less thanO(n2) andO(n3), respectively. Finally, a cost comparison is made between an O(n) algorithm and anO(n3) algorithm, the latter incorporating one of the new factorization algorithms. It is shown that theO(n3) algorithm is only 15% slower than the O(n) algorithm when applied to a 30-degrees-of-freedom humanoid, but is 2.6 times slower when applied to an equivalent unbranched chain. This is due mainly to the O(n3) algorithm running about 2.2 times faster on the humanoid than on the chain.

Also, some interactive GUIs were implemented for visual demonstration that help the users in understanding the roles of certain parameters such as poles, multiplicity etc.	coefficient;control theory;data compaction;discretization;graphical user interface;interpolation;local optimum;matlab;magma;nelder–mead method;noise reduction;reflection (computer graphics);signal processing;simple rational approximation;simplex algorithm;terminate (software)	Peter Kovacs;Levente Lócsi	2012	2012 35th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2012.6256382	rational function;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;digital signal processing;signal processing;discretization;graphical user interface;mathematics;multiplicity	Robotics	53.93691223923093	17.80980860069436	54721

A dynamical network is modeled as a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed acyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant total outflow at the origin. Routing policies regulate the way the total outflow at each nondestination node gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle density, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current particle density on that link through a flow function. The dynamical network is called partially transferring if the total inflow at the destination node is asymptotically bounded away from zero, and its weak resilience is measured as the minimum sum of the link-wise magnitude of disturbances that make it not partially transferring. The weak resilience of a dynamical network with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper bounded by the network's min-cut capacity and, hence, is independent of the initial flow conditions. Moreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on local information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to that, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that locality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do not cause loss of weak resilience. Fundamental properties of dynamical networks driven by locally responsive distributed routing policies are analyzed in detail, including global convergence to a unique limit flow. The derivation of these properties exploits the cooperative nature of these dynamical systems, together with an additional stability property implied by the assumption of monotonicity of the flow as a function of the density on each link.	directed acyclic graph;dynamical system;flow network;local convergence;locality of reference;maxima and minima;maximal set;minimum cut;routing	Mou Dasgupta;G.

Recently, an alternative receiver was introduced based on a separate per tone equalization, where the SNR on each tone and hence the bitrate is maximized. In this paper, a new adaptive initialization scheme for this per tone equalizer (PTEQ) is introduced, based on a combination of Least Mean Squares (LMS) and Recursive Least Squares (RLS) with inverse updating. It will be shown that the proposed method exhibits only slightly slower convergence compared to full RLS with inverse updating, while complexity as well as memory cost are reduced considerably.	digital monetary trust;recursive least squares filter;selective calling	Geert Ysebaert;Marc Moonen;Thierry Pollet	2002		10.1109/ICASSP.2002.5745164	adaptive filter;computer vision;broadband;lead;speech recognition;equalization;least mean squares filter;computer science;noise;digital signal processing;control theory;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;least squares	NLP	60.915035939289176	13.463508691900493	54800

The scheduling method is based on potential inequalities and disjunctive constraints, that are formulated in the max-plus algebra, in terms of inequalities. The computation of the eigenvalue of the corresponding matrices provides bounds, and a feasibility test that is used in a branch-and- bound procedure that permits to solve the problem. Effective computations make use of the max-plus Scicoslab toolbox, and its implementation of the Howard algorithm. One can evaluate whether or not a solution exists to the problem, compute one solution, or compute the set of solutions minimizing the completion time. The method is applied to two case studies from the literature, which permit to point out its advantages and drawbacks.	job shop scheduling	José Eduardo Ribeiro Cury;Jean Jacques Loiseau;Claude Martinez;Max Hering de Queiroz	2012		10.3182/20121003-3-MX-4033.00014	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;flow shop scheduling;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	70.32007781058118	23.576237656808583	55123

In comparison with the existing results on event-triggered decentralized control, the proposed implementation does not rely on weak coupling between subsystems, nor does it assume the synchronization of local clocks or the existence of a central broadcasting node, and is applicable to nonlinear systems. In addition, higher energy efficiency at the sensors is expected because of the great reduction of the listening times of the sensors. We prove that with asynchronous measurement updates, the event-triggered control actions can guarantee semiglobal practical stability for the sensor/actuator system of interest. We also show that the time between any two consecutive transmissions of measurements at each sensor is bounded from below by a positive constant. Furthermore, asymptotic stability can be achieved when more complicated triggering conditions are introduced. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulations.	bibo stability;distributed control system;nonlinear system;sensor;simulation	Manuel Mazo;Ming Cao	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160582	control engineering;synchronization;real-time computing;nonlinear system;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Embedded	62.98298987966208	4.947022943240396	55197

In the study of the glycerol continuous bioconversion to 1, 3-propanediol by  Klebsiella pneumoniae , there are some uncertain factors such as the mechanism about the transports of substances across cell membrane. In this paper, a nonlinear hybrid system which describes the intracellular reductive pathway is presented, according to the possible transport mechanisms of 1, 3-propanediol across cell membrane. The existence, uniqueness, and continuity of the solutions for the nonlinear hybrid system are discussed. It is difficult to measure the concentrations of intracellular substances; so, a quantitative robustness analysis method is proposed. Taking the robustness of intracellular substance concentrations as the performance index, an identification model is proposed, which is subjected to the constraint of nonlinear hybrid dynamical system. Finally, an algorithm procedure is constructed to solve the parameter identification model, and the most possible transport mechanism of 1, 3-propanediol and the optimal parameters of the corresponding system are also given.	dynamical system;hybrid system	Yuduo Zhang;Enmin Feng;Zhilong Xiu	2011	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	10.1016/j.mcm.2011.08.010	mathematical optimization;process performance index;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics;hybrid system	Logic	76.67908380042384	4.556947070736053	55229

Estimation of frequency and damping is very important in many fields [1]–[15], e.g., linear system identification, speech processing, image processing, transient analysis, electric power system analysis, radar and sonar systems, communication, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS), mechanical spectroscopy, economics, seismology, and others. The literature on the subject is very rich. Recently an interesting introduction to frequency and damping estimation methods was published in the IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine [15]. In this paper, we focus on the methods with the best performance for a single component, damped, real-valued sinusoidal signal disturbed by additive white Gaussian noise. In our previous works [14] and [16]–[18], we investigated these estimation methods, two-point and three-point interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform (IpDFT) for an undamped sinusoidal signal analyzed with Rife-Vincent class I, Kaiser-Bessel and Dolph-Chebyshev windows, methods of Bertocco, Yoshida and Bertocco-Yoshida family for orders 0-3, the Agrez algorithm, IpDFT for damped sinusoidal signal analyzed with Rife-Vincent class I windows, time domain and frequency domain Least Squares (LS) optimization, Hilbert transform, covariance, Prony, iterative Steiglitz-McBride (STMB), Kumaresan-Tufts, total least squares, Matrix Pencil (MatPen), and Pisarenko. For this presentation, we choose only the best methods from the above set, i.e. the Bertocco-Yoshida order 1 (BY1) STMB and MatPen. We also describe the iterative leakage correction algorithm [19] with application to BY1, and compare all results with the well-known Aboutanios and Mulgrew algorithm (AbM) [13]. Our intention is to describe and compare the best existing algorithms. We consider a real-valued signal because it is a typical measurement case. The DFT spectrum of this signal is disturbed by a spectral leakage [5].	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;bessel filter;discrete fourier transform;embedded system;hilbert transform;image processing;interpolation;iterative method;kenneth steiglitz;linear system;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;pisarenko harmonic decomposition;prony's method;rife;radar;resonance;sonar (symantec);spectral leakage;speech processing;system analysis;system identification;the matrix;total least squares;transient state;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Krzysztof Duda;Tomasz P.

9b5539f757676e1b0d12c50eb48bf1faa617923d	accelerated optimization in the pde framework: formulations for the active contour case		Following the seminal work of Nesterov, accelerated optimization methods have been used to powerfully boost the performance of first-order, gradient-based parameter estimation in scenarios where second-order optimization strategies are either inapplicable or impractical. Not only does accelerated gradient descent converge considerably faster than traditional gradient descent, but it also performs a more robust local search of the parameter space by initially overshooting and then oscillating back as it settles into a final configuration, thereby selecting only local minimizers with a basis of attraction large enough to contain the initial overshoot. This behavior has made accelerated and stochastic gradient search methods particularly popular within the machine learning community. In their recent PNAS 2016 paper, Wibisono, Wilson, and Jordan demonstrate how a broad class of accelerated schemes can be cast in a variational framework formulated around the Bregman divergence, leading to continuum limit ODE’s. We show how their formulation may be further extended to infinite dimension manifolds (starting here with the geometric space of curves and surfaces) by substituting the Bregman divergence with inner products on the tangent space and explicitly introducing a distributed mass model which evolves in conjunction with the object of interest during the optimization process. The co-evolving mass model, which is introduced purely for the sake of endowing the optimization with helpful dynamics, also links the resulting class of accelerated PDE based optimization schemes to fluid dynamical formulations of optimal mass transport.	active contour model;bregman divergence;contour line;converge;estimation theory;first-order predicate;gradient descent;local search (optimization);machine learning;mathematical optimization;overshoot (signal);triune continuum paradigm;variational principle	Anthony J.

The signal is a sinusoid whose frequency is drifting at a constant rate ‘Y. It is recovered using an M-tap adaptive predictor W ( k ) . There are five principal results in this paper: 1) the methodology of the analysis, 2) proof of tbe quasi-deterministic nature of the datacovariance estimate R( k ) which satisfies 3) new analysis of RLS for an inverse system modeling problem, 4) new analysis of RLS for a deterministic time-varying model for the optimum filter, and 5) evaluation of the residual output MSE resulting from the nonoptimality of the adaptive predictor (the so-called “misadjustment”) in terms of the forgetting rate p & 1 1 of the RLS algorithm. Specifically, it is shown that the misadjustment is dominated by a lag term of order p-’ and a noise term of order p. Thus, a value popt exists which yields a minimum misadjustment 3nmin. We prove that where p is the input SNR.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;dtime;kerrison predictor;recursive least squares filter;signal-to-noise ratio;systems modeling;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Odile Macchi;Neil J.

This paper provides a review of these problems as well as the undecimated wavelet transform which solves the problem of shift-variance. However, undecimated transforms have very high computational costs and still have oscillating coefficients. The work of Kingsbury is summarized afterwards. They have presented a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) which is nearly shift-invariant and has smooth coefficients. Subsequently, a filter swapping scheme is developed in order to create complex wavelet packets with analytic basis functions.

022202cafa7ad37fc98bf6b169a5f2b0904f774f	iqn: an incremental quasi-newton method with local superlinear convergence rate		The problem of minimizing an objective that can be written as the sum of a set of n smooth and strongly convex functions is challenging because the cost of evaluating the function and its derivatives is proportional to the number of elements in the sum. The incremental quasi-Newton (IQN) method proposed here belongs to the family of stochastic and incremental methods that have a cost per iteration independent of n. IQN iterations are a stochastic version of BFGS iterations that use memory to reduce the variance of stochastic approximations. The method is shown to exhibit local superlinear convergence. The convergence properties of IQN bridge a gap between deterministic and stochastic quasi-Newton methods. Deterministic quasi-Newton methods exploit the possibility of approximating the Newton step using objective gradient differences. They are appealing because they have a smaller computational cost per iteration relative to Newton’s method and achieve a superlinear convergence rate under customary regularity assumptions. Stochastic quasi-Newton methods utilize stochastic gradient differences in lieu of actual gradient differences. This makes their computational cost per iteration independent of the number of objective functions n. However, existing stochastic quasi-Newton methods have sublinear or linear convergence at best. IQN is the first stochastic quasiNewton method proven to converge superlinearly in a local neighborhood of the optimal solution. IQN differs from state-of-the-art incremental quasi-Newton methods in three aspects: (i) The use of aggregated information of variables, gradients, and quasi-Newton Hessian approximation matrices to reduce the noise of gradient and Hessian approximations. (ii) The approximation of each individual function by its Taylor’s expansion, in which the linear and quadratic terms are evaluated with respect to the same iterate. (iii) The use of a cyclic scheme to update the functions in lieu of a random selection routine. We use these fundamental properties of IQN to establish its local superlinear convergence rate. The presented numerical experiments match our theoretical results and justify the advantage of IQN relative to other incremental methods.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;converge;convex function;experiment;gradient;hessian;iteration;newton;newton's method;numerical analysis;quasi-newton method;rate of convergence	Aryan Mokhtari;Mark Eisen;Alejandro R.

Each agent is assignedwith an individual cost functionwhich is coercive and convex. A distributed control protocol is to be designed to guarantee a consensus, and in the meanwhile reach theminimizer of the aggregate cost functions within the constraint set. Three terms are included in the protocol: local averaging, local projection, and local subgradient with a diminishing but persistent gain. It is shown that the constrained optimal consensus can be achieved under a uniformly jointly connected communication network with bounded time-varying edge weights. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, we derive many new cubically convergent families of Schröder-type methods. Proposed families are derived from the modified Newton’s method for multiple roots and one-parameter family of Schröder’s method. Furthermore, we introduce new families of third-order multipoint iterative methods for multiple roots free from second-order derivative by semi discrete modifications of the above proposed methods. One of the families requires two evaluations of the function and one evaluation of its first-order derivative and the other family requires one evaluation of the function and two evaluations of its first-order derivative per iteration. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the performance of proposed iterative methods. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

These methods exploit the max-plus linearity of the associated semigroups. In particular, although the problems are nonlinear, the semigroups are linear in the max-plus sense. These methods have been used successfully to compute solutions. Although they provide certain advantages, they still generally suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. The natural analog to the Laplace transform in ordinary spaces is the Fenchel transform over max-plus spaces, the range space being referred to as the dual space. One can transform the semigroup operators into operators on the dual space. There are natural operations on the transformed operators which may be used to construct solutions of nonlinear control problems. Natural building blocks correspond to transforms of operators for linear/quadratic problems. In this paper, a method for exploiting operations in the Fenchel transform space is used to develop a method for certain problems such that the computational growth in the most time-consuming portion of the computations can be hugely reduced. Although the curse-of-dimensionality is not entirely avoided, the computational cost reductions are very high for some classes of problems.	bellman equation;computation;computational complexity theory;curse of dimensionality;first-order reduction;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;nonlinear system;quadratic programming	William M.

The first method, SSBE, is a split-step extension of the backward Euler method. The second method, CSSBE, arises from the introduction of a compensated, martingale, form of the Poisson process. We show that both methods are amenable to rigorous analysis when a one-sided Lipschitz condition, rather than a more restrictive global Lipschitz condition, holds for the drift. Our analysis covers strong convergence and nonlinear stability. We prove that both methods give strong convergence when the drift coefficient is one-sided Lipschitz and the diffusion and jump coefficients are globally Lipschitz. On the way to proving these results, we show that a compensated form of the Euler–Maruyama method converges strongly when the SDE coefficients satisfy a local Lipschitz condition and the pth moment of the exact and numerical solution are bounded for some p > 2. Under our assumptions, both SSBE and CSSBE give well-defined, unique solutions for sufficiently small stepsizes, and SSBE has the advantage that the restriction is independent of the jump intensity. We also study the ability of the methods to reproduce exponential mean-square stability in the case where the drift has a negative one-sided Lipschitz constant. This work extends the deterministic nonlinear stability theory in numerical analysis. We find that SSBE preserves stability under a stepsize constraint that is independent of the initial data. CSSBE satisfies an even stronger condition, and gives a generalization of B-stability. Finally, we specialize to a linear test problem and show that CSSBE has a natural extension of deterministic A-stability. The difference in stability properties of the SSBE and CSSBE methods emphasizes that the addition of a jump term has a significant effect that cannot be deduced directly from the non-jump literature.

Activity analysisdraws from the power of two seemingly divergentperspectives— the global conflict-basedapproachesof combinatorial satisficing search, and the local gradientbasedapproachesof continuous optimization — combined with the underlying insights of engineering moriotonicity analysis. The result is an approachthat strategicallycuts away subspaces that it can quickly rule out as suboptimal,and then guidesthenumericalmethodsto theremaining subspaces. Introduction and Example Our goal is to capturea modeler’stacit skill at decomposing physicalmodelsandits application to focusing reasoning. This work is ultimately directed towards the contruction of “self modeling” systems,operating in embedded,real time situations. This article explores the modeler’sdecompositionalskills (Williams &~Raiman1994)in the contextof optimal reasoning— the use of qualitativemodeling to strategicallyguide gradient-basedandother numericalexplorationsof objective spaces.Optimal reasoningis crucial for embeddedsystems,wherenumericalmethodsarekey to such areasasestimation,control, inductive learningand vision. The techniquewe present, called activity analy.sis, applies to the pervasivefamily of linear and nonlinear, constrainedoptimization problems,and easily integrateswith any existing numericalapproaches. Activity analysis is striking in the way it merges together two styles of search that are traditionally viewed as quite disparate: first is the more strategic, conflict-basedapproachesused in combinatorial,satisficing searchto eliminatefinite, inconsistentsubspaces (e.g., (de Kleer & Williams 1987)). The secondis the Jonathan Cagan Departmentof MechanicalEngineering CarnegieMellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA cagan+&cmu.edu rich suite of more tactical, numeric methocls(Vancler— plaats1984) used in continuous optimizing searchto climb locally but monotonically towardstheoptimum. Activity analysisdraws from the power of both perspectives,strategicallycutting awaysubspacesthat it can quickly rule out as suboptimal, and then guiding the numericalmethodsto the remainingsuhspaces. Thepower of activity analysisto eliminatelargesuboptimal subspacesis derived from Qualitative KT, an abstraction in qualitative vector algebra of the foundational Kuhn-Tucker (KT) condition of optimization theory. The underlying algorithm achievessimplicity andcompleteness, by introducingtheconceptof generating pruneimplzcatzngassignmentsof linear, qualitatice vector equations. This processof ruling out feasible, but suboptimalsubspacesin acontinuousdomain, nicely parallelsthe useof conflicts and primeimplicant generationfor combinatorial, satisficing search. The end result is a methodthat achievesparsimoniousdescriptions, guaranteescorrectness,and maximizesthe filtering achievedfrom QKT. Finally, activity analysiscan be thought of as automating the underlyingprinciple aboutmonotonicity used by thesimplex method to examineonly the vertices of the linear feasible space. It then generalizes and automatically applies this principle to nonlinear programmingproblems.	algorithm;continuous optimization;embedded system;gradient;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;power of two;stationary process;theory;tucker decomposition	Brian C.

We discuss the structured total least squares (STLS) problem, which is the problem of approximating affinely structured matrices (i.e., matrices affine in the parameters) by similarly structured rank-deficient ones, while minimizing an Lz-error criterion. It is shown that the optimality conditions lead to a nonlinear generalized singular value decomposition, which can be solved via an algorithm that is inspired by inverse iteration. Next we concentrate on the so-called L2 -optimal noisy realization problem, which is equivalent with approximating a given data sequence by the impulse response of a finite dimensional, time invariant linear system of a given order. This can be solved as a structured total least squares problem. It is shown with some simple counter examples that “classical” algorithms such as Steiglitz-McBride, iterative quadratic maximum likelihood and Cadzow’s iteration do not converge to the optimal La solution, despite misleading claims in the literature.	algorithm;control theory;converge;inverse iteration;linear algebra;linear system;nonlinear system;signal processing;singular value decomposition;system identification;time-invariant system;total least squares	Bart De Moor	1994	IEEE Trans.

The system is modeled by a cascade of a single input multiple output (SIMO) linear dynamic system, followed by a multiple input single output (MISO) static nonlinear system. The dynamic system is described using orthonormal basis functions. The original ideas date back to the Wiener G-functionals of Lee and Schetzen. Whereas the Wiener G-Functionals use Laguerre orthonormal basis functions, in this work Takenaka-Malmquist orthonormal basis functions are used. The poles that these basis functions contain, are estimated using the best linear approximation of the system. The approach is illustrated on the identification of a Wiener system.	basis function;dynamical system;linear approximation;nonlinear system;system analysis	Koen Tiels;Johan Schoukens	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160235	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;classical wiener space;nonlinear system;orthonormal basis;control theory;mathematics;wiener filter;integral representation theorem for classical wiener space;statistics;wiener deconvolution;approximation theory	Robotics	58.40205147413404	7.3847215623186235	56063

The continuous nonlinear programming problem is formulated as an unconstrained minimax problem using the Bandler-Charalambous approach, and Dakin's branch-and-bound technique is used in conjunction with Fletcher's unconstrained minimization program to discretize the continuous solution. The objective function to be minimized is directly concerned with the word lengths of the coefficients, which are also introduced as variables.  †	coefficient;digital filter;recursion	J. W.

In this paper, we propose the use of the alternating direction method - a classic approach for optimization problems with separable variables (D. Gabay and B.

Signals are reconstructed as minimizers of the sum of three terms corresponding to total variation, ¿1-norm of a certain transform, and least squares data fitting. Our algorithm, called RecPF and published online, runs very fast (typically in a few seconds on a laptop) because it requires a small number of iterations, each involving simple shrinkages and two fast Fourier transforms (or alternatively discrete cosine transforms when measurements are in the corresponding domain). RecPF was compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms on recovering magnetic resonance images, and the results show that it is highly efficient, stable, and robust.	approximation;augmented lagrangian method;calculus of variations;coefficient;compressed sensing;computation;convex optimization;curve fitting;diffusing update algorithm;discrete cosine transform;dynamic range;iteration;iterative reconstruction;laptop;least squares;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;operating system;resonance;signal reconstruction;sparse matrix	Junfeng Yang;Yin Zhang;Wotao Yin	2010	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2042333	fast fourier transform;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;convex optimization;computer science;finite element method;mathematics;geometry;compressed sensing;least squares	ML	76.1381386632927	26.00382681425355	56137

The proposed approaches to solving this problem are based on representing the original system in an orthonormal basis. In particular, representing controllability in a block form lets us divide a high dimensional optimization problem into optimization subproblems of lower dimension. We pay special attention to finding the initial value of the feedback matrix with suboptimal search procedures. We give recommendations on constructing numerical search procedures for suboptimal solutions with gradient-based methods. The efficiency of the developed algorithms is demonstrated with numerical examples.	modal logic	Sergey A. Kochetkov;Victor A.

This optimization problem has two equivalent symmetric linear maxmin reformulations, leading to two sets of concavity cuts. We first examine the depth of these cuts by considering the assumptions on the boundedness of the feasible regions of both maxmin and bilinear formulations. We next propose a branch and bound algorithm which make use of concavity cuts. We also present a procedure that eliminates degenerate solutions. Extensive computational experiences are reported. Sparse problems with up to 500 variables in each disjoint sets and 100 constraints, and dense problems with up to 60 variables again in each sets and 60 constraints are solved in reasonable computing times.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;branch and bound;computation;concave function;mathematical optimization;minimax;optimization problem;petri net;sparse	Stéphane Alarie;Charles Audet;Brigitte Jaumard;Gilles Savard	2001	Math.

As the delta-operator formulation of digital filters offers better numerical accuracy and lower coefficient sensitivity in narrowband filter designs when compared to the traditional shift-operator formulation, it is desirable to have efficient design and implementation techniques in gamma-domain which utilize the various symmetries in filter specifications. With this motivation, we comprehensively establish the theory of constraints for delta-operator formulated discrete-time real-coefficient polynomials and functions, arising out of the many types of symmetries in their magnitude responses. We also show that as sampling time tends to zero, the gamma-domain symmetry constraints merge with those of s-domain symmetry constraints. We then present a least square error criterion based procedure to design 2-D digital filters in gamma-domain that utilizes the symmetry properties of the magnitude specification. A design example is provided to illustrate the savings in computational complexity resulting from the use of the gamma-domain symmetry constraints	coefficient;computational complexity theory;delta operator;digital filter;frequency response;numerical analysis;polynomial;sampling (signal processing)	I-Hung Khoo;Harnatha C.

To do so it may have to solve a classic problem in computation – global optimization. Reducing an easy problem to a hard one is usually not an advantage, but in fact there is a route to solving both problems if the function can be evaluated using interval arithmetic. Since some computer algebra systems supply a version of interval arithmetic, it seems we have the ingredients for a solution. In this paper we address a particular problem how to compute and display “honest” graphs of 2-D mathematical curves. By “honest” we mean that no significant features (such as the location of poles, the values at maxima or minima, or the behavior of a curve at asymptotes) are misrepresented, By “mathematical” we mean curves like those generally needed in scientific disciplines where functions are represented by composition of common mathematical operations: rational operations (+, –, *, /), exponential and log, trigonometric functions as well as continuous and differentiable functions from applied mathematics.	computation;computer algebra system;computer program;emoticon;global optimization;interval arithmetic;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;time complexity	Richard J.

Conventionally, reference-assisted IC is based on the zero crosstalk assumption; i.e., when the desired source signal is absent in the reference microphones. In applications where crosstalk is inevitable, the conventional IC approach usually exhibits degraded performance due to cancellation of the desired signal. In this paper, we develop a crosstalk resilient IC method based on the Capon beamforming technique. The proposed beamformer deals with the uncertainty of crosstalk by applying a constraint on the worst-case crosstalk magnitude. The proposed beamformer not only performs IC, it also provides blind beamforming of the desired signal. We show that a blind beamformer based on the traditional minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) IC method is a special case of the proposed beamformer. One key step of implementing the proposed Capon beamformer lies in solving a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, and we illustrate how the Capon optimal solution can be effectively approximated using the so-called semidefinite relaxation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamformer is more robust against crosstalk-induced signal cancellation than beamformers based on the MMSE-IC methods.	adaptive beamformer;approximation algorithm;beamforming;best, worst and average case;catastrophic interference;crosstalk;interference (communication);linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;microphone;optimization problem;relaxation (approximation);relaxation (iterative method);simulation	Wing-Kin Ma;Pak-Chung Ching;Ba-Ngu Vo	2004	IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing	10.1109/TSA.2004.833011	minimum mean square error;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;single antenna interference cancellation;crosstalk;speech recognition;teleconference;telecommunications;computer science;adaptive beamformer;speech processing;beamforming;relaxation;statistics	EDA	63.618559174436875	14.8663824942802	56661

Each method needs to solve an inner linear system to expand the subspace successively. When the linear systems are solved only approximately, we are led to the inexact methods. We prove that the inexact HSIRA, RHSIRA, HJD and RHJD methods mimic their exact counterparts well when the inner linear systems are solved with only low or modest accuracy. We show that (i) the exact HSIRA and HJD expand subspaces better than the exact SIRA and JD and (ii) the exact RHSIRA and RHJD expand subspaces better than the exact HSIRA and HJD. Based on the theory, we design stopping criteria for inner solves. To be practical, we present restarted HSIRA, HJD, RHSIRA and RHJD algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that these algorithms are much more efficient than the restarted standard SIRA and JD algorithms and furthermore the refined harmonic algorithms outperform the harmonic ones very substantially.	arnoldi iteration;jacobi method	Zhongxiao Jia;Cen Li	2015	J.

6d2061a25e811c65f60d4aa622cb76cc531ff59d	decay chain differential equations: solutions through matrix analysis		Abstract This paper demonstrates how the solutions to conventional radioactive decay equations can be derived using results from matrix analysis. In particular, we draw on results for the matrix exponential function when the matrix is triangular. By applying key theorems, the paper explains how the solutions to these equations can be presented in algorithmic form and in terms of divided differences of the exponential function. Furthermore, with little additional effort, the approach yields solutions to more general variations of these equations.	matrix analysis	Edmond Levy	2019	Computer Physics Communications	10.1016/j.cpc.2018.07.011	mathematical optimization;radioactive decay;mathematical analysis;decay chain;mathematics;differential equation;matrix exponential;matrix (mathematics);matrix analysis;exponential function;divided differences	ML	79.05892704025328	12.879812191932862	56688
6cbea3a66398913c93ae3b0297dd8aad80c76e93	a generalized 2-d doa estimation method based on low-rank matrix reconstruction		While the sparse methods for 1-D direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation are extensively studied in literature, the research for 2-D DOA estimation is rare. The main reason is that, for utilizing the on-grid or off-grid sparse methods, the 2-D continuous angle space should have to be discretized, which, however, may bring unacceptable computations due to the high dimensionality of the angle space. Hence, incorporating the gridless sparse methods which require no discretization into the 2-D DOA estimation is essential. In this paper, we propose a gridless 2-D DOA estimation method based on the low-rank matrix reconstruction and the Vandermonde decomposition theorem. We first reconstruct the covariance matrix with certain structure (i.e., low-rank, Toeplitz, and positive semidefinite), and then, retrieve the DOAs by using the Vandermonde decomposition theorem. We also present a theorem to guarantee that the true DOAs can be exactly recovered in certain condition. A faster algorithmic implementation is then given by deriving the dual problem of the original one. Our proposed method is applicable for both the uniform rectangular arrays and the sparse rectangular arrays. Extensive simulations are provided to evaluate its estimation performance and the adaptability to various array geometries.	computation;direction of arrival;discretization;duality (optimization);simulation;sparse matrix;toeplitz hash algorithm	Xiyan Tian;Jinhui Lei;Liufeng Du	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2820165	distributed computing;mathematical optimization;vandermonde matrix;toeplitz matrix;computer science;discretization;adaptability;covariance matrix;matrix (mathematics);low-rank approximation;curse of dimensionality	Robotics	82.37843147339242	23.759877074693033	56755

5ab65f609b9a6a0a70081f02867cfba27b018d2e	adaptive estimation of zeros of time-varying z-transforms		In the present paper, a method is proposed for adaptive estimation and tracking of roots of time-varying, complex, and univariate polynomials, e.g. z-transform polynomials that arise from finite signal sequences. The objective with the method is to alleviate the computational burden induced by factorization. The estimation is done by solving a set of linear equations; the number of equations equals the order of the polynomial. To avoid potential drifting of the estimations, it is proposed to verify with Aberth-Ehrlich’s factorization method at given intervals. A numerical experiment supplements theory by estimating roots of time-varying polynomials of different order. As a function of order, the proposed method has a lower run time than Lindsey-Fox and computing eigenvalues of companion matrices. The estimations are quite accurate, but tend to drift slightly in response to increasing coefficient pertubation lengths.	linear equation;matthews correlation coefficient;numerical analysis;polynomial;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Christian Fischer Pedersen;Ove Andersen;Paul Dalsgaard	2011			mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;matrix (mathematics);eigenvalues and eigenvectors;pattern recognition;factorization;linear equation;univariate;polynomial;computer science	Vision	82.03513599837969	20.208742724638928	56841

Euler was able to give explicit values for certain of these sums in terms of the Riemann zeta function. In a recent companion paper, Euler’s results were extended to a significantly larger class of sums of this type, including sums with alternating signs. This research was facilitated by numerical computations using an algorithm that can determine, with high confidence, whether or not a particular numerical value can be expressed as a rational linear combination of several given constants. The present paper presents the numerical techniques used in these computations and lists many of the experimental results that have been obtained. D. H.

89571463dd892746ce4312d1d5429e3b717eea7e	preconditioning pde-constrained optimization with l1-sparsity and control constraints		PDE-constrained optimization aims at finding optimal setups for partial differential equations so that relevant quantities are minimized. Including sparsity promoting terms in the formulation of such problems results in more practically relevant computed controls but adds more challenges to the numerical solution of these problems. The needed L1-terms as well as additional inclusion of box control constraints require the use of semismooth Newton methods. We propose robust preconditioners for different formulations of the Newton’s equation. With the inclusion of a line-search strategy and an inexact approach for the solution of the linear systems, the resulting semismooth Newton’s method is feasible for practical problems. Our results are underpinned by a theoretical analysis of the preconditioned matrix. Numerical experiments illustrate the robustness of the proposed scheme.

The inverse analysis of heat transfer has some practical applications, for example, the estimation of radioactive and thermal properties, such as the conductivity of material with and without the temperatures dependence of diffusive processes. The inverse problems are usually formulated as optimization problems and the main objective becomes the minimization of a cost function. MDE adapts a concept originally proposed in particle swarm optimization design for the dynamic adaptation of mutation factor. Using a piecewise function for apparent thermal conductivity as a function of the temperature data, the heat transfer equation is able to estimate the unknown variables of the inverse problem. The variables that provide the beast least squares fit between the experimental and predicted time-temperatures curves were obtained. Numerical results for inverse heat transfer problem demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of the MDE algorithm. In this application, MDE approach outperforms the GAF and DE best solutions.	differential evolution;genetic algorithm;least squares;loss function;mathematical optimization;model-driven engineering;numerical method;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization	Viviana Cocco Mariani;Vagner Jorge Neckel;Leonardo Dallegrave Afonso;Leandro dos Santos Coelho	2010	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2010.5586000	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;genetic algorithm;computer science;inverse problem;floating point;calculus;mathematics;least squares;heat transfer	Vision	78.34958053187354	27.279597547567164	57049

It has been observed that an exception to this popular perception occurs when the algorithm is used to adapt a transversal equalizer in the presence of additive narrowband interference. In the latter case, the steady-state LMS behavior does not correspond to the Wiener filter: its mean weights are different from the Wiener weights, and its mean squared error performance may be significantly better than the Wiener performance. Starting from the Butterweck expansion of the weight update equation, we derive a recursive approximation for the mean of the LMS weight vector in steady-state. The analytical approximation is good for all step-sizes where the expansion converges, as supported by the simulation results.	algorithm;approximation;equalization (communications);interference (communication);least mean squares filter;mean squared error;recursion;simulation;steady state;utility functions on indivisible goods;wiener filter	Takeshi Ikuma;A.

The low computational cost and the wavelets' scale invariance make the wavelet transform suitable for analysis of LRD processes. In this paper, we apply wavelet-based estimation of the Hurst parameter to MPEG-1 and MPEG-4 encoded video sequences. Frequency-domain estimators (periodogram and wavelet-based) produce different Hurst parameters compared to time-domain estimators (R/S and variance-time plot). Wavelet-based estimators often produce Hurst parameters that are close to or greater than one. Our analysis indicates that possible causes for the unreliable performance of the wavelet-based estimators are the non-stationarity of the scaling exponent and the existence of both short-range and long-range dependent components in the video traces.	coefficient;computational complexity theory;hurst exponent;image scaling;mpeg-1;moving picture experts group;multifractal system;spatial variability;spectral density estimation;stationary process;tracing (software);traffic analysis;wavelet transform	Nikola Cackov;Zelimir Lucic;Momcilo Bogdanov;Ljiljana Trajkovic	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465025	speech recognition;telecommunications;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics;wavelet transform	Arch	55.14929232517857	15.299281938619805	57219

This formulation has attractive features in the sense that no constraint qualifications are needed at the limit point, and that it overcomes ill-conditioning of the subproblems when the penalty parameter is large. Well-definition of the algorithm is shown, and also it is proved that any limit point of the sequence generated by the algorithm is a KKT point or a stationary point of the problem that minimizes the infeasibility. Under suitable hypotheses the sequence generated by the algorithm converges Q-linearly.

Baras Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering In this dissertation, several aspects of design for networked systems are addressed. The main focus is on combining approaches from system theory and graph theory to characterize graph topologies that result in efficient decision making and control. In this framework, modelling and design of sparse graphs that are robust to failures and provide high connectivity are considered. A decentralized approach to path generation in a collaborative system is modelled using potential functions. Taking inspiration from natural swarms, various behaviors of the system such as target following, moving in cohesion and obstacle avoidance are addressed by appropriate encoding of the corresponding costs in the potential function and using gradient descent for minimizing the energy function. Different emergent behaviors emerge as a result of varying the weights attributed with different components of the potential function. Consensus problems are addressed as a unifying theme in many collaborative control problems and their robustness and convergence properties are studied. Implications of the continuous convergence property of consensus problems on their reachability and robustness are studied. The effects of link and agent faults on consensus problems are also investigated. In particular the concept of invariant nodes has been introduced to model the effect of nodes with different behaviors from regular nodes. A fundamental association is established between the structural properties of a graph and the performance of consensus algorithms running on them. This leads to development of a rigorous evaluation of the topology effects and determination of efficient graph topologies. It is well known that graphs with large diameter are not efficient as far as the speed of convergence of distributed algorithms is concerned. A challenging problem is to determine a minimum number of long range links (shortcuts), which guarantees a level of enhanced performance. This problem is investigated here in a stochastic framework. Specifically, the small world model of Watts and Strogatz is studied and it is shown that adding a few long range edges to certain graph topologies can significantly increase both the rate of convergence for consensus algorithms and the number of spanning trees in the graph. The simulations are supported by analytical stochastic methods inspired from perturbations of Markov chains. This approach is further extended to a probabilistic framework for understanding and quantifying the small world effect on consensus convergence rates: Time varying topologies, in which each agent nominally communicates according to a predefined topology, and switching with non-neighboring agents occur with small probability is studied. A probabilistic framework is provided along with fundamental bounds on the convergence speed of consensus problems with probabilistic switching. The results are also extended to the design of robust topologies for distributed algorithms. The design of a semi-distributed two-level hierarchical network is also studied, leading to improvement in the performance of distributed algorithms. The scheme is based on the concept of social degree and local leader selection and the use of consensustype algorithms for locally determining topology information. Future suggestions include adjusting our algorithm towards a fully distributed implementation. Another important aspect of performance in collaborative systems is for the agents to send and receive information in a manner that minimizes process costs, such as estimation error and the cost of control. An instance of this problem is addressed by considering a collaborative sensor scheduling problem. It is shown that in finding the optimal joint estimates, the general tree-search solution can be efficiently solved by devising a method that utilizes the limited processing capabilities of agents to significantly decrease the number of search hypotheses.

To obtain the solution, we derive a global multidimensional nonlinear Schur algorithm, then formulate and prove generalized staircase extension and interpolation theorems.

In the new methods, instead of dropping entries and accepting fill-ins according to the magnitudes of values and the sparsity patterns, we adopt a diagonal compensation strategy, in which the dropped entries are re-used by adding to the main diagonal entries of the same rows of the incomplete upper-triangular factors, possibly after suitable relaxation treatments, so that certain constraints on the preconditioning matrices are further satisfied. This strategy can make the computed preconditioning matrices possess certain desired properties, e.g., having the same weighted row sums as the target matrices. Theoretical analysis shows that these modified incomplete Givens orthogonalization (MIGO) methods can preserve certain useful properties of the original matrix, and numerical results are used to verify the stability, the accuracy, and the efficiency of the MIGO methods employed to precondition the Krylov subspace iteration methods such as GMRES. Both theoretical and numerical studies show that the MIGO methods may have the potential to present high-quality preconditioners for large sparse nonsymmetric matrices.	generalized minimal residual method;givens rotation;iteration;iterative method;krylov subspace;linear equation;linear programming relaxation;numerical analysis;precondition;preconditioner;sparse matrix;system of linear equations;triangular matrix	Zhong-Zhi Bai;Jun-Feng Yin	2009	Computing	10.1007/s00607-009-0065-4	mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics;preconditioner;linear equation;algorithm;algebra	AI	82.50116504687962	21.13432778287357	58011

The provided estimations can be used as design formulas for the parameters, such as degree of smoothness and redundancy, involved in the definition of the frequency warping operators.	aliasing;approximation;bilinear transform;map	Salvatore Caporale;Luca De Marchi;Nicolò Speciale	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960368	fourier transform;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	56.58818952575029	17.61736077446251	58038

A simultaneous sample of a bandpass signal and its Hilbert transform is equivalent to a complex sample of the analytic signal. Therefore, this type of sampling is called analytic sampling. The set of sample points  t   k   at which the samples of the analytic signal and its first  n   k   derivatives uniquely represent the bandpass signal are considered. These sets of samples are defined as analytic sampling sets. It is proved that a set of analytic samples form an analytic sampling set if and only if the only bandpass signal which at each sample point,  t   k  , has a free zero of order  n   k   + 1 is the null signal. This result is used to derive sufficient conditions for analytic sampling sets. These conditions include past, random and non-uniform sampling of the analytic signal. Various analytic sampling expansions are then derived. These expansions include periodic, semi-uniform and first derivative sampling of the analytic signal.	sampling (signal processing)	S. C.

Firstly, a novel scheme is proposed for equivalently decomposing the complete data log-likelihood function into a summation form parameterized by RLP. Secondly, the rapid computation of the expectation in E-step is achieved by skillfully introducing Jessen's inequality to avoid the state augmentation of the traditional method. Thirdly, the analytical identification result of RLP is obtained in M-step by constructing Lagrange operator to maximize the expectation with the parameter constraint. Naturally, such analytical result is so simple that it can be quickly carried out, which is demonstrated by quantitative computation complexity analysis. Finally, an example motivated by the maneuvering target tracking application is presented to show the superiority of the new method.	analysis of algorithms;computation;data logger;expectation–maximization algorithm;rl (complexity);social inequality	Xiaoxu Wang;Yan Liang;Quan Pan;Yonggang Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2514259	econometrics;mathematical optimization;yttrium;control theory;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	Robotics	57.157307096749236	5.281198199559582	58072

Firstly, the dynamical behaviors of the model without vaccination are studied. Using the Jacobian matrix, the stability of the equilibrium points of the system without vaccination is analyzed. The basic reproduction number R is got. In order to study the important role of vaccination to prevent diseases, the model with distributed delay under impulsive vaccination is formulated. And the sufficient conditions of globally asymptotic stability of “infectionfree” periodic solution and the permanence of the model are obtained by using Floquet’s theorem, small-amplitude perturbation skills, and comparison theorem. Lastly, numerical simulation is presented to illustrate our main conclusions that vaccination has significant effects on the dynamical behaviors of the model. The results can provide effective tactic basis for the practical infectious disease prevention.		Wencai Zhao;Tongqian Zhang;Zhengbo Chang;Xinzhu Meng;Yulin Liu	2013	J.

b65ec3114a36c99ffe400c4ae8cc2f06df23216c	on the generalized wavelet-galerkin method		Abstract In the frame of the traditional wavelet-Galerkin method based on the compactly supported wavelets, it is important to calculate the so-called connection coefficients that are some integrals whose integrands involve products of wavelets, their derivatives as well as some known coefficients in considered differential equations. However, even for linear differential equations with non-constant coefficient, the computation of connect coefficients becomes rather time-consuming and often even impossible. In this paper, we propose a generalized wavelet-Galerkin method based on the compactly supported wavelets, which is computationally very efficient even for differential equations with non-constant coefficients, no matter linear or nonlinear problems. Some related mathematical theorems are proved, based on which the basic ideas of the generalized wavelet-Galerkin method are described in details. In addition, some examples are used to illustrate its validity and high efficiency. A nonlinear example shows that the generalized wavelet-Galerkin method is not only valid to solve nonlinear problems, but also possesses the ability to find new solutions of multi-solution problems. This method can be widely applied to various types of both linear and nonlinear differential equations in science and engineering.	galerkin method;wavelet	Zhaochen Yang;Shijun Liao	2018	J.

1354ee37398c8d55acd4f47dae158decbb2a650a	necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiating under the integral sign		a f(x, y) dy, it is often important to know when F is differentiable and when F (x) = ∫ b a f1(x, y) dy. A sufficient condition for differentiating under the integral sign is that ∫ b a f1(x, y) dy converges uniformly; see [6, p. 260]. When we have absolute convergence, the condition |f1(x, y)| ≤ g(y) with ∫ b a g(y) dy < ∞ suffices (Weierstrass M-test and Lebesgue Dominated Convergence). If we use the Henstock integral, then it is not difficult to give necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiating under the integral sign. The conditions depend on being able to integrate every derivative. If g : [a, b] → R is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) it is not always the case that g is Riemann or Lebesgue integrable over [a, b]. However, the Henstock integral integrates all derivatives and thus leads to the most complete version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The Henstock integral’s definition in terms of Riemann sums is only slightly more complicated than for the Riemann integral (simpler than the improper Riemann integral), yet it includes the Riemann, improper Riemann, and Lebesgue integrals as special cases. Using the very strong version of the Fundamental Theorem we can formulate necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiating under the integral sign.	emoticon;nörlund–rice integral;ordered pair	Erik Talvila	2001	The American Mathematical Monthly		mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Theory	73.39757542110132	13.60290495918062	58501

Although the noise variance is not required for the offline Wiener solution, there are potential benefits (and limitations) for the learning behavior of an adaptive solution. In our approach, a Robbins–Monro algorithm is used to minimize the conventional mean square error criterion subject to a noise variance constraint and a penalty term necessary to guarantee uniqueness of the combined weight/multiplier solution. The resulting noise constrainedLMS (NCLMS) algorithm is a type of variable step-size LMS algorithm where the step-size rule arises naturally from the constraints. A convergence and performance analysis is carried out, and extensive simulations are conducted that compare NCLMS with several adaptive algorithms. This work also provides an appropriate framework for the derivation and analysis of other adaptive algorithms that incorporate partial knowledge of the channel.	adaptive algorithm;additive white gaussian noise;channel state information;finite impulse response;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;online and offline;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yongbin Wei;Saul B.

E. Fisher and R. E. Hartwig (1968), Adv. Chem. Phys., 32, pp. 190--225]. The complexity of the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm is known [R. H. Chan and M. Ng (1996), SIAM Rev., 38, pp. 427--482] to be $O(n\log n)$ for Toeplitz systems when $d = 0$. However, the effect on the PCG algorithm of the Fisher--Hartwig singularity in $T_n$ has not been explored in the literature. We show that the complexity of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm for solving $T_n x=b$ without any preconditioning grows asymptotically as $n^{1+|d|}\log (n)$. With T. Chan's optimal circulant preconditioner $C_n$ [T. Chan (1988), SIAM J. Sci. Statist.

Through linearizing the local cost functions agents can obtain their local solutions with simple algebraic operations and gradient descent steps. We prove that the algorithm linearly converges to the optimal solution given that the local cost functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz gradients. The decentralized LADMM has similar computations as the distributed (sub)gradient method but outperforms the latter, which is unable to achieve linear rate of convergence and convergence to the exact optimal solution simultaneously. Compared to its non-linearized counterpart that suffers from high computation burden, the decentralized LADMM has a comparable rate of convergence according to both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;computation;experiment;flat rate;gradient descent;linear algebra;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;rate of convergence	Qing Ling;Alejandro R.

817e86cacfaf84f5f6566a4ec82daeb4bab4b999	an improved recovery algorithm based on isd for multiband signals		Multiband signal is an important signal in radar and communication systems, which is generally sparse and with a wide spectrum. Due to the wide spectral range of multiband signals, traditional ADC sampling at Nyquist rate may be too difficult to achieve. Modulated wideband converter (MWC), which is based on compressed sensing (CS), is a subtle scheme to solve wide spectrum sampling problem. In addition, reconstruction algorithm is the key of MWC which can decide the performance of the architecture. In this paper, we propose an improved reconstruction method, which expands iterative support detection (ISD), an iterative recovery algorithm for one- dimensional signal, to continue to finite (CTF) system. Our algorithm uses ISD to compute the solutions which satisfy that every column's reconstructions is l1 minimization. Then, utilizing the resulting matrix and support detection rule, we can find the support set and obtain the recovered signal. Our algorithm does not require the number of support set as prior knowledge. And the property of our method is close to orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors (OMPMMV), and better than Sparsity adaptive matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors (SAMPMMV). Simulation results confirm the conclusion.	algorithm;charge trap flash;circuit minimization for boolean functions;compressed sensing;iterative method;matching pursuit;modulation;multiply-with-carry;nyquist rate;radar;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Huiyang Peng;Mengyue Liu;Lei Chen;Yu Liu	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925798	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning	Mobile	62.576806884640995	10.704459202738905	59173

1973036038d7c5f4b432f34e39482308fa17654a	design perfect reconstruction cosine-modulated filter banks via quadratically constrained quadratic programming and least squares optimization		Abstract In this paper, the design of perfect reconstruction (PR) cosine-modulated filter banks (CMFBs) is implemented via quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) and least squares (LS) optimization. To this end, a PR CMFB design problem is formulated as a nonconvex QCQP after re-arranging the coefficients of the prototype filter. Then a deep insight is offered into the algebraic relationship between the PR conditions and near-perfect reconstruction (NPR) ones for CMFB designs. Here we theoretically show that the NPR conditions are just the summations of the PR conditions. Firmly in the light of this relationship, a two-stage method is proposed for PR CMFB design. We firstly solve an NPR CMFB problem to obtain its optimal solution as a reference point, then model the PR CMFB design problem as a series of small-sized LS problems near the reference point. And we solve the LS problems in parallel with cheap iteration. Our analysis and numerical results show that the proposed method bears superior performance on effectiveness and efficiency, especially in the case of designing PR CMFBs with large number of channels.	filter bank;least squares;mathematical optimization;modulation;quadratic programming;quadratically constrained quadratic program	Hongying Liu;Caixia Yi;Zhiming Yang	2017	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.06.009	algebraic number;mathematics;control theory;mathematical optimization;quadratic programming;least squares;prototype filter;trigonometric functions;quadratic growth;communication channel	ML	75.09296344215255	28.661707482173664	59467

eded061f104b5fea158cbde54beaf61a8cec789b	simulations of partial update lms algorithms in application to active noise control		Abstract   Partial Update LMS (PU LMS) algorithms started to play an important role in adaptive processing of sound. Due to reduction of computational power demands, these algorithms allow to use longer adaptive filters, and therefore achieve better results in adaptive filtering applications, e.g., system identification, acoustic echo cancellation, and active noise control (ANC). There are two main groups of PU algorithms: data-independent and data-dependent algorithms. While application of a data-independent algorithm almost always results in a degradation of performance, application of data-dependent PU algorithms may even result in an increase of the performance, compared with full parameters update. However, the latter group of algorithms requires sorting.  A number of updated parameters is the factor that allows to decide how much of performance should be sacrificed to obtain computational power savings. In the extreme case only one filter tap out of possibly hundreds is updated during each sampling period. The goal of this paper is to show extensive simulations proving that careful selection of this one tap results in a useful and well performing algorithm, even in the demanding application of active noise control.	algorithm;computer simulation	Dariusz Bismor	2016		10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.451	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;simulation;computer science	Robotics	60.89619768529258	12.69810466818712	59655

A rarefied sequence of points of phase trajectory just forms the centers of segmentation cells, the upper boundary of such rarefying is estimated from statistical analysis of quasi-periodicity along phase trajectories of multidimensional attractor. This method allows to reduce a required computer time in comparison with traditional correlation integral approach and provides a good convergence. So far as the attractor reconstruction was implemented in Takens phase space, analytical approaches for product scheme of functional matrixes derived from delay differential iterations is developed for such phase space. Numerical results for eigenvalues evolution of obtained functional matrixes and for multifractal investigation are represented.© (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

In order to compute a regularisation term in the filter update formulas, data buffers are required in this implementation, resulting in a large memory usage. This paper shows that by approximating this regularisation term in the frequency-domain the memory usage (and the computational complexity) can be reduced drastically. Experimental results demonstrate that this approximation only gives rise to a limited performance difference and that hence the proposed algorithm preserves the robustness benefit of the SP-SDW-MWF over the GSC (with Quadratic Inequality Constraint).	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;gsc bus;gradient;least mean squares filter;microphone;noise reduction;sp-devs;wiener filter	Simon Doclo;Ann Spriet;Marc Moonen	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;speech recognition;mathematics	Vision	61.46188989067676	13.42050559782855	60126

Many practical tracking problems involve some unknown deterministic nuisance parameters such as the system parameters or noise statistical parameters. This paper addresses the problem of state estimation in linear discrete-time dynamic systems in the presence of unknown deterministic system parameters. A Cramér-Rao-type bound on the mean-sqaure-error (MSE) of the state estimation is introduced. The bound is based on the concept of risk-unbiasedness and can be computed recursively. It allows evaluating the optimality of the estimation procedure. Some sequential estimators for this problem are proposed such that the estimation procedure can be considered an on-line technique. Simulation results show that the proposed bound is asymptotically achieved by the considered estimators.	discrete-time signal;dynamical system;mean squared error;online and offline;recursion;simulation	Shahar Bar;Joseph Tabrikian	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178617	kalman filter;stochastic process;econometrics;mathematical optimization;noise;mathematics;moving horizon estimation;statistics	Robotics	56.7960009069666	6.795458142103716	60146

An analytic formula has been derived for the sample unfalsified probability. It is shown that with increasing the data length, the sample unfalsified probability converges in probability to a number which is independent of experimental data. Numerical simulations show that the proposed sample unfalsified probability is appropriate in the evaluation of the quality of a model set.	numerical linear algebra;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Tong Zhou	2001	IEEE Trans.

fabd134b1eea93dc3a1fbf4db5ecbd3f0ed7293c	compositions of convex functions and fully linear models		Derivative-free optimization (DFO) is the mathematical study of the optimization algorithms that do not use derivatives. One branch of DFO focuses on model-based DFO methods, where an approximation of the objective function is used to guide the optimization algorithm. Proving convergence of such methods often applies an assumption that the approximations form fully linear models—an assumption that requires the true objective function to be smooth. However, some recent methods have loosened this assumption and instead worked with functions that are compositions of smooth functions with simple convex functions (the max-function or the \(\ell _1\) norm). In this paper, we examine the error bounds resulting from the composition of a convex lower semi-continuous function with a smooth vector-valued function when it is possible to provide fully linear models for each component of the vector-valued function. We derive error bounds for the resulting function values and subgradient vectors.	convex function;linear model	W.

Although they can improve convergence for sparse impulse responses, the steady-state misalignment is limited by the constant step-size parameter. In this article, based on the principle of least perturbation, we first present a derivation of normalized version of proportionate algorithms. Then by taking the disturbance signal into account, we propose a variable step-size proportionate NLMS algorithm to combine the benefits of both variable step-size algorithms and proportionate algorithms. The proposed approach can achieve fast convergence with a large step size when the identification error is large, and then considerably decrease the steady-state misalignment with a small step size after the adaptive filter reaches a certain degree of convergence. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;least mean squares filter;sparse	Ligang Liu;Masahiro Fukumoto;Sachio Saiki;Shiyong Zhang	2010	IEICE Transactions		adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;impulse response;computer science;control theory;mathematics;steady state;statistics	Visualization	60.09704324457937	12.45022694402823	60573

The principle of each method is to approximate the kernel with respect to one variable, the other remaining free. This leads to an approximation of K by a degenerate kernel. We give error estimates for smooth functions, and we show that the method based on the left (resp. right) approximation of the kernel has an approximation order O(h 5) (resp. O(h 6)).

9eff4461eb0352d46530995c7e4d283e628b69c8	a data-based augmented model identification method for linear errors-in-variables systems based on em algorithm		With a large amount of industrial data available, it is of considerable interest to develop data-based models. The challenge lies in the significant noises that appear in all data collected from industry. The errors-in-variables (EIV) model is a model that accounts for measurement noises in all observations (both input and output). In most of the traditional EIV identification methods, the input generation dynamics is not considered. In this paper, a dynamic model is applied to describe the input generation process, and then, the Kalman smoother is used to estimate its state using all available measurements. In order to utilize all of the observed variables in the EIV process, an augmented EIV model is derived to describe both input generation process and the EIV process dynamics itself. The parameters in the EIV model are then estimated by applying an expectation maximization algorithm. Simulated numerical example and an experiment performed on a hybrid tank system are used to demonstrate the improved identification performance of the proposed method.	errors-in-variables models;expectation–maximization algorithm;input/output;kalman filter;mathematical model;numerical analysis;system identification	Fan Guo;Ouyang Wu;Yongsheng Ding;Biao Huang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2703680	input/output;kalman filter;maximum likelihood;statistics;expectation–maximization algorithm;errors-in-variables models;estimation theory;system identification;statistical classification;computer science	Visualization	57.507357667287685	6.1030757693678686	60647

The artificial problem involves a constant Jd (or constants) which we need to choose large enough to ensure the equivalence between the artificial problem and the original problem. Theoretically, we can always assign a positive number of the order O(2 L) to ~ in linear cases, where L denotes the input size of the problem. Practically, however, such a large number is impossible to implement on computers.

To solve this difficulty, this paper presents """"a little theorem of the big ~ """" , which will enable us to find whether ~ is not large enough, and to update ~ during the iterations of the algorithm even if we start with a smaller ~ .

9e68a971bd7e2480028a4ab0cabaa548990e2778	model order reduction for neutral systems by moment matching	article	Circuits with delay elements are very popular and important in the simulation of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) systems. Neutral systems (NSs) with multiple constant delays (MCDs), for example, can be used to model the partial element equivalent circuits (PEECs), which are widely used in high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) analysis. In this paper, the model order reduction (MOR) problem for the NS with MCDs is addressed by moment matching method. The nonlinear exponential terms coming from the delayed states and the derivative of the delayed states in the transfer function of the original NS are first approximated by a Padé approximation or a Taylor series expansion. This has the consequence that the transfer function of the original NS is exponential-free and the standard moment matching method for reduction is readily applied. The Padé approximation of exponential terms gives an expanded delay-free system, which is further reduced to a delay-free reduced-order model (ROM). A Taylor series expansion of exponential terms lets the inverse in the original transfer function have only powers-of-s terms, whose coefficient matrices are of the same size as the original NS, which results in a ROM modeled by a lower-order NS. Numerical examples are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed alQ. Wang ( ) · Y. Wang · E.Y. Lam · N.

275133fdc705026279121f60ca5721d53db3d2d4	compressive spectral embedding: sidestepping the svd		Spectral embedding based on the Singular Value Decompositi on (SVD) is a widely used “preprocessing” step in many learning tasks, ty pically leading to dimensionality reduction by projecting onto a number of domin ant singular vectors and rescaling the coordinate axes (by a predefined function o f the singular value). However, the number of such vectors required to capture prob lem structure grows with problem size, and even partial SVD computation becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity compressivespectral embedding algorithm, which employs random projections and finite order pol yn mial expansions to compute approximations to SVD-based embedding. For an m× matrix withT non-zeros, its time complexity is O ((T +m+ n) log(m+ n)), and the embedding dimension isO(log(m + n)), both of which are independent of the number of singular vectors whose effect we wish to capture. To the be st of our knowledge, this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the num ber of singular vectors for general SVD-based embeddings. The key to sidestepp ing the SVD is the observation that, for downstream inference tasks such as cl ustering and classification, we are only interested in using the resulting embeddin g to evaluate pairwise similarity metrics derived from the l2-norm, rather than capturing the effect of the underlying matrix on arbitrary vectors as a partial SVD trie s to do. Our numerical results on network datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the p roposed method, and motivate further exploration of its application to large-s cale inference tasks.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;dimensionality reduction;downstream (software development);numerical analysis;numerical method;polynomial;preprocessor;random projection;singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;stellar classification;time complexity;trie	Dinesh Ramasamy;Upamanyu Madhow	2015			mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	ML	66.29014150719392	25.33756046845208	60834

A new algorithm is proposed in this paper for the magnitude design of evidence filters with prescribed transition rolloff. It uses a bisection method to convert the design problem into a series of constrained minimax magnitude error subproblems, which are then solved by using an iterative constrained minimax elliptic error (ICMEE) method. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method for evidence filters.	algorithm;bisection method;convex optimization;finite impulse response;iterative method;linear phase;mathematical optimization;minimax;ripple effect;roll-off;simulation	Dinghan Hu;Xiaoping Lai	2018	2018 21st International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)	10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455741	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;bisection;magnitude (mathematics);impulse response;mathematical optimization;minimax;bisection method	EDA	62.85530997108511	12.229902919642106	60843

In this paper, we present an objective penalty function with two penalty parameters for inequality constrained bilevel programming under the convexity assumption to the lower level problem. Under some conditions, an optimal solution to a bilevel programming defined by the objective penalty function is proved to be an optimal solution to the original bilevel programming.

It is proved herein that any neuron state of the proposed neural network is convergent to the feasible region in finite time and stays there thereafter, provided that the penalty parameter is sufficiently large. The lower bounds of the penalty parameter and convergence time are also estimated. In addition, any neural state of the proposed neural network is convergent to its equilibrium point set which satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the optimization problem. Moreover, the equilibrium point set is equivalent to the optimal solution to the nonconvex optimization problem if the objective function and constraints satisfy given conditions. Four numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performances of the proposed neural network.

This paper describes a new method for speedy computation of the autocorrelation coefficients using Fermat number transform (FNT). It is found that there exists a fast computational algorithm for FNT which has a computational structure similar to the fast Fourier transform’s (FFT). Since the fast Fermat number transformation (FFNT) and FFT have similar computational structures, we may adopt readily available FFT VLSI hardware structure for real-time implementation of the FFNT.

cd39037666733605fb21377333194730221fa480	enabling distributed optimization in large-scale power systems		Distributed optimization for solving non-convex Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems in power systems has attracted tremendous attention in the last decade. Most studies are based on the geographical decomposition of IEEE test systems for verifying the feasibility of the proposed approaches. However, it is not clear if one can extrapolate from these studies that those approaches can be applied to very large-scale real-world systems. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that distributed optimization can be effectively applied to a large-scale real transmission network, namely, the Polish 2383-bus system for which no pre-defined partitions exist, by using a recently developed partitioning technique. More specifically, the problem solved is the AC OPF problem with geographical decomposition of the network using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method in conjunction with the partitioning technique. Through extensive experimental results and analytical studies, we show that with the presented partitioning technique the convergence performance of ADMM can be improved substantially, which enables the application of distributed approaches on very large-scale systems.	augmented lagrangian method;centralized computing;extrapolation;ibm power systems;iteration;lagrange multiplier;local optimum;mathematical optimization;program optimization;social inequality;spectral method;world-system	Junyao Guo;Gabriela Hug;Ozan K.

13b05814440b027f36aca3f17b995d91b2b6c389	convex splitting method for the calculation of transition states of energy functional		Among numerical methods for partial differential equations arising from steepest descent dynamics of energy functionals (e.g., Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations), the convex splitting method is well-known to maintain unconditional energy stability for a large time step size. In this work, we show how to use the convex splitting idea to solve the problem of finding transition states, i.e., index-1 saddle points of the same energy functionals. Based on the previous work of iterative minimization formulation (IMF) for saddle points (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., vol. 53, p1786, 2015), we introduce the convex splitting idea to minimize the auxiliary functional at each cycle of the IMF. We present a general principle of constructing convex splitting forms for these auxiliary functionals and show how to avoid solving nonlinear equations. The new numerical scheme based on the convex splitting method allows for a much larger time step size than a traditional semi-implicit scheme we tested and it turns out that a large time step has a huge advantage in computational efficiency. The new methods are tested numerically for the one dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy functional in the search of the Allen-Cahn or Cahn-Hilliard types of transition states.	symplectic integrator	Shuting Gu;Xiang Zhou	2018	J.

Assuming that the sensor observations are bounded, nonparametric distributed estimators are proposed based on the knowledge of the first N moments of sensor noises. These estimators are shown to be either unbiased or asymptotically unbiased with bounded and known estimation variance. Further, the uniformly optimal quantizer based only on the first moment information and the optimal minimax quantizer with the knowledge of the first two moments are determined. The proposed estimators are shown to be consistent even when local sensor noises are not independent but m-dependent. The relationship between the proposed approaches and dithering in quantization is also investigated. The superiority of the proposed quantization/estimation schemes is illustrated via illustrative examples.	dither;estimation theory;minimax;peripheral;quantization (signal processing);sensor;unbiased rendering	Hao Chen;Pramod K.

d6de0ee607769efa7e766c7109c50fbf280ea0c9	extinction and permanence of a general predator-prey system with impulsive perturbations		A general predator-prey system is studied in a scheme where there is periodic impulsive perturbations. This scheme has the potential to protect the predator from extinction but under some conditions may also serve to lead to extinction of the prey. Conditions for extinction and permanence are obtained via the comparison methods involving monotone theory of impulsive systems and multiple Liapunov functions, which establish explicit bounds on solutions. The existence of a positive periodic solution is also studied by the bifurcation theory. Application is given to a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system with periodic impulsive immigration of the predator. It is shown that the results are quite different from the corresponding system without impulsive immigration, where extinction of the prey can never be achieved. The prey will be extinct or permanent independent of whether the systemwithout impulsive effect immigration is permanent or not. The model and its results suggest an approach of pest control which proves more effective than the classical one.		Xianning Liu;Lansun Chen	2012	J.

Maximum principles for finite element approximations are crucial for the preservation of qualitative properties of the physical model. In this work we develop a convex hull property for P1 conforming finite elements on simplicial non-obtuse meshes. The proof does not resort to linear structures of partial differential equations but directly addresses properties of the minimizer of a convex energy functional. Therefore, the result holds for very general nonlinear partial differential equations including e.g. the p-Laplacian and the mean curvature problem. In the case of scalar equations the presented arguments can be used to prove standard discrete maximum principles for nonlinear problems.

Using a delayed truncation method in the subbands, it is shown that the missing samples can be recovered exactly by inverting small linear systems. Our approach also applies to time-varying filter banks or wavelet transforms where filters are switched between consecutive input blocks. 1. I N T R O D U C T I O N When implementing a perfect reconstruction FIR filter bank for subband coding of signals of finite extent, such as images, the processing of boundary regions give rise to the following problem. Assume, for example, that an input signal X of length N, extended by zeroes outside the interval (0, N-1), is processed using the filter bank depicted in Fig. 1. Subband analysis of X results in a total amount of samples greater than that of the input: The subband signals Y and 2 have N/2 + L/2 samples each, where 15 is the length of the filters. This is due to the transients of the filtering process needed for splitting X into different channels. Thus, L extra coefficients near the boundaries have to be coded and transmitted to reconstruct X exactly. This is generally undesirable for compression problems because of the increase of the encoded data, which is becomes higher as the number of iterations of the filter bank increases. Also, the size of the subimages become nonstandard On the other hand, if the number of samples to be encoded is made equal to N by truncation at the borders of Y and 2, some information is apparently lost, which makes boundary distortion in the reconstructed signal unavoidable [4]. The first issue addressed in this paper is to achieve ezact reconstruction in the presence of trunction to N samples in the channels, i.e. without any increase of the data throughput after processing. A related problem concerns timevarying filter banks, where filters are switched at some transition location between consecutive input blocks. Such techniques have received increased attention recently [ I , 5, 71 because they can be used to exploit the time-varying nature of the signal if they are dynamically adapted to match its short-term properties over time. A variation of this technique applies to time-varying “wavelet” tree structures [3, 71. The second issue considered in this paper is to achieve exact reconstruction in this context, in such a way that the sampling rate is preserved in the subbands at the transitions. Our approach readily applies to this problem when each block is processed independently of its neighbors. Similar ideas are also developped in the case X R	coefficient;distortion;exploit (computer security);filter bank;finite impulse response;iteration;linear system;sampling (signal processing);sub-band coding;throughput;transient (computer programming);truncation;wavelet transform;xfig	François Déprez;Olivier Rioul;Pierre Duhamel	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.390072	filter;adaptive filter;network synthesis filters;nonlinear filter;x-ray filter;speech recognition;digital filter;low-pass filter;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;reconstruction filter;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;filter design;prototype filter;matched filter;capacitor-input filter;composite image filter;half-band filter;m-derived filter;wavelet transform	Theory	58.344193939976606	17.444043885980136	61933
78af17bd52c1477c2c8a9ec586a6e6beb00e463a	leader-follower formation of vehicles with velocity constraints and local coordinate frames		This paper studies leader-follower formation control of networked nonholonomic vehicles of unicycle type. Each vehicle is subject to the velocity constraints consisting of saturated angular velocity and bounded linear velocity with positive-minimum value. Each vehicle is allowed to use its local coordinate frame, and the network topology is described by a directed graph containing a spanning tree. Two dynamic control laws satisfying the velocity constraints are developed respectively, such that the leader-follower formation defined in local coordinate frames can be achieved in two cases. The proposed control laws only require each vehicle to use the information of its neighbors in the network via local measurements and communication. Finally, effectiveness is illustrated by simulation results of an example.	angularjs;c date and time functions;consensus dynamics;converge;directed graph;emoticon;existential quantification;expanded memory;file spanning;network topology;optimal control;simulation;spanning tree;velocity (software development)	Xiao Yu;Lu Liu	2016	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-016-9094-1	angular velocity;mathematical optimization;control theory;directed graph;network topology;mathematics;constant linear velocity;mobile robot;bounded function;nonholonomic system;spanning tree	Robotics	63.57989074966323	5.071580096372819	61945

The basis of this algorithm are the properties of the projection operator and the invertibility of the Gramian in the case of a Riesz basis. We use a parallel approach in both time and frequency for the computation of the dual system obtained by translation and sampling of a finitely number of atoms. Since there are many applications in signal and image processing where the spline-type spaces (also known as shift-invariant spaces) play a central role, fast computing methods are needed, especially in the multi-windows case, where the computations are expensive from the execution time and from memory storage point of view. We test the implementation on car crash data.	algorithm;computation;data recovery;gramian matrix;image processing;microsoft windows;run time (program lifecycle phase);sampling (signal processing);scalability;signal reconstruction;spaces;spline (mathematics);type system	Darian M.

By the Hirota bilinear form for both flows, we find new bilinear system for these equations, and oneand two-soliton solutions. For special values of parameters our solutions show resonance behaviour with creation of four virtual solitons. We first time created four virtual soliton resonance solution for KP-II and established relations of it with degenerate four-soliton solution in the Hirota-Satsuma bilinear form for KP-II. Our approach allows one to interpret the resonance soliton as a composite object of two dissipative solitons in 1 + 1 dimensions. © 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The simulation error minimisation (SEM) approach has been shown to provide significant advantages in the model selection phase by ruling out candidate models with good short-term prediction capabilities but unsuitable long-term dynamics. However, SEM-based parameter estimation has been generally avoided due to excessive computational effort. This article extends to the nonlinear case a computationally efficient approach for this task, that was previously developed for linear models, based on the iterative estimation of predictors with increasing prediction horizon. Conditions for the applicability of the approach to various model classes are also discussed.

We develop a secure distributed estimation strategy subject to an f-locally bounded Byzantine adversary model, where a compromised node can arbitrarily deviate from the rules of any prescribed algorithm. Under such a threat model, we provide sufficient conditions guaranteeing the success of our estimation strategy. Our method relies on the construction of a subgraph, which we call a Mode Estimation Directed Acyclic Graph (MEDAG), for each unstable and marginally stable eigenvalue of the plant. We provide a distributed algorithm for constructing a MEDAG and characterize graph topologies for which the construction algorithm is guaranteed to succeed. Our approach provides fundamental insights into the relationship between the dynamics of the system, the measurement structure of the nodes, and the underlying graph topology.	adversary model;best, worst and average case;control theory;directed acyclic graph;directed graph;distributed algorithm;linear time-invariant theory;pdf/a;threat model;time complexity;time-invariant system;topological graph theory	Aritra Mitra;Shreyas Sundaram	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798671	discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;network topology	DB	63.61087496507139	6.289376491341838	62325

In a general dynamical system, a generic steady-state local bifurcation from a trivial state is transcritical. In the presence of symmetry, a pitchfork is also possible generically. Network structure introduces constraints that may change the generic behavior. We consider regular networks, in which all cells have the same type and all arrows have the same type, and every cell receives inputs from the same number of arrows. A characterization of all smooth admissible maps permits a singularity-theoretic analysis based on Liapunov–Schmidt reduction. Assuming that the cells have 1-dimensional internal dynamics, we give conditions on the critical eigenvectors of the linearization and its transpose that determine when a generic bifurcation is transcritical, pitchfork, or more degenerate. We prove that for all regular n-cell networks, such bifurcations are generically n-determined. In the path-connected case, this is improved to (n− 1)-determined. In bidirectional networks, generic bifurcation is transcritical or pitchfork, but the role of symmetry is minor. In the general case, degenerate cases can occur: the network must have at least 4 cells (5 in the path-connected case). We give examples of networks for which generic bifurcations are degenerate, including a 6-cell network with a normal form that is determined only at degree 6 and a pathconnected 5-cell network with a normal form that is determined only at degree 4.	a-normal form;apollonian network;bidirectional associative memory;bifurcation theory;dynamical system;generic-case complexity;map;schmidt decomposition;steady state	Ian Stewart;Martin Golubitsky	2011	SIAM J.

By using an analytical point of view due to Lanczos [9] to this causal case, we revisit n order derivative estimators originally introduced within an algebraic framework by Mboup, Fliess and Join in [14, 15]. Thanks to a given noise level δ and a well-suitable integration length window, we show that the derivative estimator error can be O(δ q+1 n+1+q ) where q is the order of truncation of the Jacobi polynomial series expansion used. This so obtained bound helps us to choose the values of our parameter estimators.

This function is related to the volume of an ellipsoid containing all feasible solutions, which is parametrized by certain weights which we choose to minimize the function. The center of the resulting ellipsoid turns out to be a feasible solution to the inequalities. Using more sophisticated nonlinear minimization algorithms, we develop and investigate more efficient methods, which lead to two kinds of weighted centers for the feasible set. Using these centers, we develop new algorithms for solving linear programming problems.	algorithm;ellipsoid method;feasible region;lp-type problem;linear inequality;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;volume	Aiping Liao;Michael J.

4610f449aea6d214a1fc3addb24b0bb1f1b9c1ad	a tikhonov regularized penalty function approach for solving polylinear programming problems		Abstract This paper suggests a new regularized penalty method for poly-linear functions. Until our knowledge it is the first time that a regularization approach solution for poly-linear programming is reported in the literature. We propose a penalty function depending on two parameters μ and δ for ensuring the strong convexity and the existence of a unique solution involving equality and inequality constraints. We prove that if the penalty parameter μ tends to zero then the solution of the original problem converges to a unique solution with the minimal weighted norm. We introduce a recurrent procedure based on the projection-gradient method for finding the extremal points and we also prove the convergence of the method. We develop an example for game theory and additional example for portfolio optimization employing the proposed regularization method for Markov chains involving the definition of a poly-linear function.	penalty method	Julio B.

2fa1b648b9dd4d7fa2f208931b3c1daa4707399c	quantum statistical manifolds		Quantum information geometry studies families of quantum states by means of differential geometry. A new approach is followed with the intention to facilitate the introduction of a more general theory in subsequent work. To this purpose, the emphasis is shifted from a manifold of strictly positive density matrices to a manifold of faithful quantum states on the C*-algebra of bounded linear operators. In addition, ideas from the parameter-free approach to information geometry are adopted. The underlying Hilbert space is assumed to be finite-dimensional. In this way, technicalities are avoided so that strong results are obtained, which one can hope to prove later on in a more general context. Two different atlases are introduced, one in which it is straightforward to show that the quantum states form a Banach manifold, the other which is compatible with the inner product of Bogoliubov and which yields affine coordinates for the exponential connection.	density matrix;hilbert space;information geometry;quantum information;quantum state;time complexity	Jan Naudts	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20060472	hilbert space;mathematical optimization;quantum information;manifold;mathematics;mathematical analysis;banach manifold;information geometry;differential geometry;quantum state;matrix (mathematics)	Theory	71.31388167011504	14.416668473157399	62897

Although they have been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations for about a century, they still have a reputation for being numerically challenging. In particular, their extensive pole fields in the complex plane have often been perceived as ‘numerical mine fields’. In the present work, we note that the Painlevé property in fact provides the opportunity for very fast and accurate numerical solutions throughout such fields. When combining a Taylor/Padé-based ODE initial value solver for the pole fields with a boundary value solver for smooth regions, numerical solutions become available across the full complex plane. We focus here on the numerical methodology, and illustrate it for the PI equation. In later studies, we will concentrate on mathematical aspects of both the PI and the higher Painlevé transcendents.	algebraic riccati equation;bryce;computation;condition number;continuation;continuation-passing style;ibm notes;initial condition;navier–stokes equations;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;personally identifiable information;solver;occam	Bengt Fornberg;J.

In contrast to the previously obtained results, the paper deals with the general case of nonlinear polynomial states and observations. As a result, the Ito differentials for the optimal estimate and error variance corresponding to the stated filtering problem are first derived. The procedure for obtaining a closed system of the filtering equations for any polynomial state over observations with any polynomial drift is then established. In the example, the obtained optimal filter is applied to solve the optimal third order sensor filtering problem for a quadratic state, assuming a Gaussian initial condition for the extended third order state vector. The simulation results show that the designed filter yields a reliable and rapidly converging estimate.	closed system;computer simulation;cubic function;differential of a function;initial condition;kalman filter;nonlinear system;quantum state;simulation;system of polynomial equations	Michael V.

cbb42bc4dd2f142f3475d08ec9687c2784155730	a normal-gamma filter for linear systems with heavy-tailed measurement noise		This paper considers state estimation of stochastic systems with outliers in measurements. Traditional filters, which assume Gaussian-distributed measurement noise, may have degraded performance in this case. Recently, filters using heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Student's t-distribution) to describe measurement noise are gaining momentum. This paper proposes a new model for the state and an auxiliary variable (related to measurement noise) as having a normal-gamma distribution. This modeling has three advantages: first, it can describe heavy-tailed measurement noise since the measurement noise is t-distributed; second, using a joint distribution naturally considers the interdependence between the state and the measurement noise; third, it helps to develop a simple recursive filter. We derive the normal-gamma filter for linear systems. Analysis shows its superiority in robustness to traditional filters. Performance of the proposed filters is evaluated for estimation and tracking problems in two scenarios. Simulation results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed normal-gamma filter compared with traditional filters and other robust filters.	algorithmic efficiency;bayesian network;gamma correction;gaussian blur;interdependence;linear system;recursion;recursive filter;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;stochastic process	Le Zhang;Jian Lan;X.

Our approach is based on a decomposition scheme by representing bounded variation signals as a difference of two increasing functions. Jordan filters are computed as the difference between the local extrema values of the increasing functions. They are faster than max/min filters. The number of operations per sample is constant, regardless the size of the window filter. The computational coniplexity of the proposed filters decreases with the number of filtering steps needed in an application. Examples are provided and the application in contrast enhancement is investigated.	bounded variation;maxima and minima;whole earth 'lectronic link;window function	Dinu Coltuc;Ioannis Pitas	1995		10.1109/ISCAS.1995.523788	network synthesis filters;bounded variation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;prototype filter;computational complexity theory	Vision	61.05611973686573	19.85706933015386	63353

In particular, for time-varying systems, we study the properties of the well-known forgetting factor least-squares (FFLS) algorithm in detail in the stochastic framework, and derive upperbounds and lowerbounds of the parameter estimation errors (PEE), using directly the finite input-output data. The analysis indicates that the mean square PEE upperbounds and lowerbounds of the FFLS algorithm approach two finite positive constants, respectively, as the data length increases, and that these PEE upperbounds can be minimized by choosing appropriate forgetting factors. We further show that for time-invariant systems, the PEE upperbounds and lowerbounds of the ordinary least-squares algorithm both tend to zero as the data length increases. Finally, we illustrate and verify the theoretical findings with several example systems, including an experimental water-level system.	algorithm;estimation theory;mean squared error;ordinary least squares;profiling (computer programming);time-invariant system;whole earth 'lectronic link	Feng Ding;Tongwen Chen	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2004.842874	input/output;econometrics;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;convergence;water level;system identification;ordinary least squares;length measurement;computer science;mathematics;predictive modelling;estimation theory;least squares;statistics	Metrics	58.374527726430436	7.296974768895314	63440

One reason for studying such an relation is that solutions of our recurrence relation are steady state distributions in some basic neural network models. Since analytic tools cannot be used to handle discontinuous models such as ours, existence of periodic solutions is investigated by combining combinatorial elimination technique as well as existence arguments for linear systems. By such means, we are able to obtain all periodic solutions with least periods 1 through 9. Some periodic solutions with periods 15, 18, 42 and 72 can also be found, but exhaustive results are not yet available.	bang file;recurrence relation	Gen-qiang Wang;Bo Han	2011	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2010.10.045	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;recurrence relation;calculus;mathematics;linear system;steady state;artificial neural network	Theory	79.09168239409225	8.599651743992746	63482

For all values of the range of the delay function, the characteristic function of the associated autonomous delay equation is exponentially stable. Still, the fundamental solution of the time-varying system is unbounded. We also present a modified example having absolutely continuous delay function, easily calculating the average variation of the delay function, and then relating this average to earlier work of the author on preservation of the stability exponent in delay differential equations with time-varying delay. In this way we suggest one possible viewpoint on the conditions for Markus-Yamabe instability. Finally, we give a very brief sketch of an example of quenching of instability. To suggest a view on conditions for quenching phenomena, we relate this to earlier work of Cooke on preservation of spectral dynamics in delay systems having time-varying delay.	autonomous robot;characteristic function (convex analysis);coefficient;instability;markus–yamabe conjecture	James Louisell	2001	Kybernetika		mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;elmore delay;delay differential equation;control theory;mathematics;instability	EDA	80.2683073505286	5.351778458928655	63567

The solution can be expanded into a series with predetermined orthogonal basis functions, which depend on the random variables. We define a norm of Hankel-type associated to a truncated series. A quadrature rule or a sampling method yields approximations of the unknown time-dependent coefficient functions in the truncated series. We arrange a Hankel norm for the quadrature technique in this context. Assuming a convergent sequence of quadrature rules, we show that the Hankel norms of the quadrature methods converge to the Hankel norm of the truncated series. Hence a numerical method is obtained to calculate the Hankel norm of the truncated series approximately. Results of numerical computations confirm the convergence property in a test example.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;converge;dynamical system;newton–cotes formulas;numerical integration;numerical method;sampling (signal processing)	Roland Pulch	2017	J.

This fact indicates that each point in the solution set may differ too largely in some aspects to be ignored. However, almost all existing algorithms designed specially for such a convex optimization problem converge to only an unspecified point in the solution set and cannot pick up a best one, in some additional strategic criterion, among the set. In this paper, we present a flexible utilization of the hybrid steepest descent method for the strategic point selection among the solution set of nonsmooth convex optimization problems. The proposed method can minimize sum of the Moreau envelope of nonsmooth convex functions over the fixed point set of a variety of nonexpansive mappings (e.g., Proximal Forward-Backward splitting operator, Douglas-Rachford splitting operator and Primal-Dual splitting operator) that characterize precisely the solution sets of the nonsmooth convex optimization problems.	algorithm;converge;convex function;convex optimization;convex set;duality (optimization);fixed point (mathematics);gradient descent;hilbert space;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;signal processing	Isao Yamada;Shunsuke Ono	2013	21st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2013)		convex analysis;subderivative;support function;mathematical optimization;conic optimization;proximal gradient methods for learning;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;convex optimization;convex polytope;closed convex function;convex combination;linear matrix inequality;quasiconvex function;convex hull;absolutely convex set;convexity in economics;random coordinate descent;mathematics;proximal gradient methods;convex set;proper convex function;choquet theory	ML	71.85356445845699	22.601421755699764	63817
8fcd66f9ca4dccd156dc7c51cde1ed8dfe20aafd	joint measurement of signal parameters and adc transition levels		The estimation of the amplitudes and phases of the components of a periodic signal based on the sequence of its quantized samples is a typical problem in instrumentation and measurement. If the signal and noise properties are taken into account, it is possible to provide more accurate estimates than those provided by typical procedures applied to quantized data, such as the least-squares estimator. In this paper, the noisy quantization of a periodic signal is considered. An estimator is described that processes the quantizer output data to provide measurements of the amplitudes and phases of the components of the input signal by applying preprocessing of the quantized sequence and by using weighted least-square estimation. The proposed estimator will also simultaneously measure the quantizer transition levels. Simulation and experimental results show that it outperforms the ordinary least-square estimator, especially when low-resolution quantization is performed and that it does not require numerical maximization of functions of several variables, as when the maximum-likelihood estimator is used.	approximation algorithm;emoticon;expectation–maximization algorithm;first-order predicate;numerical analysis;ordinary least squares;perturbation theory;preprocessor;quadratic function;quantization (signal processing);query by example;series expansion;simulation;term (logic)	Paolo Carbone;Johan Schoukens;Antonio Moschitta	2018	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2018.2831518	electronic engineering;control engineering;maximum likelihood;quantization (signal processing);harmonic analysis;noise measurement;mathematics;instrumentation	Metrics	55.86026841697584	12.623104780349607	63870

Extrapolations in LAR settings relies on the prior knowledge of the (iterative) process that created the existing data points (iterates) to compute the new (improved) data point, which periodically leads to the desired solution faster than the original method. In this study, the author presents novel approaches using extrapolation techniques to speed-up the convergence of query-dependent iterative methods, link analysis based ranking methods, where hyperlink structures are used to determine relative importance of a document in the network of inter-connections. The author uses the framework defined in HITS and SALSA and proposes the use of different Extrapolation techniques for faster ranking. The paper improves algorithms like HITS and SALSA using Extrapolation techniques. With the proposed approaches it is possible to accelerate the iterative ranking algorithms in terms of reducing the number of iterations and increasing the rate of convergence.	algorithm;data point;extrapolation;hyperlink;iteration;iterative method;linear algebra;link analysis;rate of convergence;salsa	Muhammad Ali Norozi	2011	IJCVIP	10.4018/ijcvip.2011070103	mathematical optimization;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;ranking svm	Web+IR	82.45224429917162	24.759206971096994	63925

The first problem is to find control actions transferring a system to a given state with the minimum control norm under a fixed control time. The second problem is to find control actions transferring the system to a given state within the minimum time under a given constraint on the control norm. The authors demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to the problem of moments, as well as derive the feasible statement and solvability conditions for the latter. Solution of the problem is obtained analytically in the form of quadratures.

In this paper we analyse the efficiency of numerical methods as the bisection method and Newton’s method in the case of calculating non-equidistant discretizations generated by Blaschke products. By taking advantage of the strictly increasing property of argument functions we may calculate the discrete points in an enhanced order—to be introduced here. The efficiency of the discrete points’ sequential calculation in this order is significantly increased compared to the naive implementation. In our research we are primarily motivated by ECG curves which usually have alternating regions of high or low variability, and therefore different degree of discretization is needed at different regions of the signals.	algorithm;bisection method;circuit complexity;computer science;discretization;experiment;informatics;newton;newton's method;numerical method;spatial variability	Levente Lócsi	2011	Acta Cybern.	10.14232/actacyb.20.1.2011.9	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics	AI	82.47932605794476	16.60605713915076	63962

Each of these subproblems are solved using Algorithm 3 in [19] wherein each update reduces to “shrinkage” [12] or constrained “shrinkage”. We show that FAL converges to an optimal solution x∗ of the basis pursuit problem, i.e. x∗ ∈ argmin{‖x‖1 : Ax = b} and that there exist a priori fixed sequence {λ}k∈Z+ such that for all > 0, iterates x (k) computed by FAL are -feasible, i.e. ‖Ax(k)− b‖2 ≤ , and -optimal, ∣∣ ‖x‖1 − ‖x∗‖1∣∣ ≤ , after O( −1) iterations, where the complexity of each iteration is O(n log(n)). We also report the results of numerical experiments comparing the performance of FAL with SPA [1], NESTA [18], FPC [10, 11], FPC-AS [21] and a Bregman-regularized solver [20].

In particular, the new procedure has been applied to weakly singular equations of the second kind and to solve the generalized airfoil equation for an airfoil with a flap. In these cases we have obtained arbitrarily high orders of convergence through the solution of very-well conditioned linear systems. In this paper, to enlarge the domain of applicability of our technique, we show how the above procedure can be successfully used also to solve the classical Symm's equation on a piecewise smooth curve. The collocation method we propose, applied to the transformed equation and based on Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, has shown to be stable and convergent. A comparison with some recent numerical methods using splines or trigonometric polynomials shows that our method is highly competitive.	approximation;polynomial	Giovanni Monegato;Letizia Scuderi	2000	Numerische Mathematik	10.1007/PL00005414	chebyshev polynomials;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;numerical analysis;comparative research;collocation method;calculus;galerkin method;mathematics;linear equation;linear system;rate of convergence;integral equation;algorithm;algebra;hilbert space	Theory	81.65111867567458	16.441651509733017	64505

We propose the concepts of stiffness matrix and fixability for the anchored formation graphs modeling the networks, and show that they provide a complete characterization of the AOA localizability as well as an explicit formula for the localization result. Moreover, a distributed continuous-time algorithm is proposed that converges globally to the correct localization result on fixable formation graphs. Performances of the proposed algorithm, e.g.,?convergence rate and robustness to communication delay, are characterized and optimized. Sensitivities of the localization results with respect to errors in AOA measurements and anchor node positions are also analyzed.	algorithm;angle of arrival	Guangwei Zhu;Jianghai Hu	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.09.033	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Robotics	62.50069576205081	6.169767635486312	64574

An upper bound for delay tolerance is obtained which explicitly depends on agent dynamics and network topology. The dependence on network topology disappears in the case of undirected networks. For any delay satisfying this upper bound, a controller design methodology without exact knowledge of the network topology is proposed so that multi-agent consensus in a set of unknown networks can be achieved. Moreover, when the network topology is known, a larger delay tolerance is possible via a topology-dependent consensus controller.		Xu Wang;Ali Saberi;Anton A.

However, while stability is well understood for 1-D systems, open problems remain in the higher dimensional case, e.g. for 3D system realizations, especially with respect to computational complexity and thus hardware effort. We propose a basic and thus fast stability test for systems that can be given in a standard 3-D Roesser-like state space model. Most practical systems can be represented in that manner or at least be transformed into an equivalent system so that the test is applicable to most real world problems. The test itself is inspired by passivity assumptions which for example guarantee stability of electrical reactance networks. It represents a sufficient condition for stability and comprises eigenvalue computations of a sum of Gramian matrices of the same size as the system matrix, which leads in this step to the same complexity as a 1-D stability test. The latter can thus also be applied to adaptive systems, where the system matrix is periodically changing.	adaptive system;computation;computational complexity theory;control system;gnu nano;gramian matrix;infinite impulse response;real-time computing;signal processing;state space;state-space representation	Jörg Velten;Anton Kummert;Daniel Wagner;Krzysztof Galkowski	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7539096	thermal stability;control engineering;electronic engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;solid modeling	Embedded	68.41753499484561	7.149983463937287	64779

In this study, the two methods were combined to create a novel identification algorithm called the empirical frequency-domain optimal parameter (EFOP) estimate and the recursive EFOP algorithm for common linear stochastic systems disturbed with noise. A general prediction error criterion was introduced in the time-domain estimate. By minimizing the frequency-domain estimate, some general prediction error criteria were constructed for Black-box models. Then, the parameter estimation was obtained by minimizing the general prediction error criterion. This method theoretically provides the globally optimum frequency-domain estimate of the model. It has advantages in anti-disturbance performance, and can precisely identify a model with fewer sample numbers. Lastly, some simulations were carried out to demonstrate the validity of the new method.	algorithm;apple a5;black box;discrete fourier transform;error detection and correction;estimation theory;maxima and minima;recursion;reliability engineering;signal processing;simulation;stochastic process;transfer function;white noise	Kueiming Lo;Hidenori Kimura;Wook Hyun Kwon;Xiaojing Yang	2006	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2005.855737	econometrics;mathematical optimization;final value theorem;time domain;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics;cross-spectrum	ML	57.46675423321152	9.117818235152201	64899

7ed117d63b956c05fa160ce1f77c576fc05bf43b	an efficient, second order accurate, universal generalized riemann problem solver based on the hlli riemann solver		Abstract The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation. The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms. Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form; with non-conservative products; and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them.	riemann problem;riemann solver	Dinshaw S. Balsara;Jiequan Li;Gino I. Montecinos	2018	J. Comput.

This technique can be efficiently used for fractional time delay estimation. A useful application of the technique is demonstrated using examples of digital beamforming with wideband signals. Conventional wideband signal beamforming is computationally intensive due to the calculation of fractional time delays. It is shown that the proposed Hilbert transform based fractional time delay estimation provides simple and computationally efficient, yet very accurate results, and therefore, suitable for digital beamforming of wideband signals.	algorithm;beamforming;nonlinear system;sonar (symantec)	Saman S.

b1cc87398d2433032e93f5e95a850ebfe1d3a9a9	accuracy analysis for distributed weighted least-squares estimation in finite steps and loopy networks		Distributed parameter estimation for large-scale systems is an active research problem. The goal is to derive a distributed algorithm in which each agent obtains a local estimate of its own subset of the global parameter vector, based on local measurements as well as information received from its neighbours. A recent algorithm has been proposed, which yields the optimal solution (i.e., the one that would be obtained using a centralized method) in finite time, provided the communication network forms an acyclic graph. If instead, the graph is cyclic, the only available alternative algorithm, which is based on iterative matrix inversion, achieving the optimal solution, does so asymptotically. However, it is also known that, in the cyclic case, the algorithm designed for acyclic graphs produces a solution which, although non optimal, is highly accurate. In this paper we do a theoretical study of the accuracy of this algorithm, in communication networks forming cyclic graphs. To this end, we provide bounds for the sub-optimality of the estimation error and the estimation error covariance, for a class of systems whose topological sparsity and signal-to-noise ratio satisfy certain condition. Our results show that, at each node, the accuracy improves exponentially with the so-called loop-free depth. Also, although the algorithm no longer converges in finite time in the case of cyclic graphs, simulation results show that the convergence is significantly faster than that of methods based on iterative matrix inversion. Our results suggest that, depending on the loop-free depth, the studied algorithm may be the preferred option even in applications with cyclic communication graphs.	casio loopy;centralized computing;directed acyclic graph;distributed algorithm;error detection and correction;estimation theory;iterative method;least squares;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;telecommunications network	Tianju Sui;Damián Marelli;Minyue Fu;Renquan Lu	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.07.016	mathematical optimization;distributed algorithm;mathematics;estimation theory;convergence (routing);exponential growth;directed acyclic graph;covariance;least squares;matrix (mathematics)	ML	63.13966104399951	8.101256644643618	65224

The design problem is formulated as the minimization of the least square error subject to peak error constraints and regularity constraints. By using the linear matrix inequality characterization of the trigonometric semi-infinite constraints, it can then be exactly cast as a SDP problem with a small number of variables and, hence, can be solved efficiently. Several design examples of the triplet halfband filter bank are provided for illustration and comparison with previous works. Finally, the image coding performance of the filter bank is presented.	approximation;bank (environment);cobham's thesis;filter bank;finite impulse response;frequency response;least-squares analysis;linear matrix inequality;linear phase;optimal design;remez algorithm;selectivity (electronic);semiconductor industry;semidefinite programming;social inequality;triplet state	Ha Hoang Kha;Hoang Duong Tuan;Truong Q.

1eca25079050693470cfb426d5e471485873e1c9	on the solution of a nonlinear semidefinite program arising in discrete-time feedback control design		A sequential quadratic programming method with line search is analyzed and studied for finding the local solution of a nonlinear semidefinite programming problem resulting from the discrete-time output feedback problem. The method requires an initial feasible point with respect to two positive definite constraints. By parameterizing the optimization problem we ease that requirement. The method is tested numerically on several test problems chosen from the benchmark collection (Leibfritz, 2004).		El-Sayed M. E. Mostafa	2014	J.

ca90844b69a331013774157abbf956813f159238	state fusion of decentralized optimal unbiased fir filters		The paper presents a decentralized fusion strategy based on the optimal unbiased finite impulse response (OUFIR) filter for discrete systems with correlated process and measurement noise. We extend OUFIR filter to apply in the model with control inputs. Taking it as local filters, cross covariance between any two is calculated; then it is expressed to the fast iterative form. Finally based on cross covariance, optimal weights are utilized to fuse local estimates and the overall outcome is obtained. The numerical examples show that the proposed filter exhibits better robustness against temporary modeling uncertainties than the fusion Kalman filter used commonly.	cross-covariance;finite impulse response;iterative method;kalman filter;numerical analysis	Xuefeng Fan;Fei Liu	2018	J.
