Its 0-D model is derived from the energy and mass conservation in each room, and also presents discrete components to describe the disturbances from heat sources and doors opening. Using the monotonicity of this model, we can characterize two concepts of robust control, the Robust Controllability and the Robust Controlled Invariance introduced in this paper, and determine their limits for control design objectives. The validity of these results is then illustrated in a simulation of a two-room example.	bang file;bang–bang control;control theory;electronic component;feedback;robust control;simulation;monotone	Pierre-Jean Meyer;Antoine Girard;Emmanuel Witrant	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760060	robust control;ventilation;control engineering;building management system;simulation;controllability;engineering;temperature control;control theory	Robotics	61.68304733005359	0.7330418342072058	18673

Moscariello, On the mathematical modelling of complex dynamical systems an electrically operated vehicle, Math. Comput. Modelling (2007), doi:10.1016/j.mcm.2006.12.037] which relates to a motor vehicle activated through independent electric engines set in the rear wheels in the cases of motion with null steering angle (also in case of lateral forces for a limited period of time) and of motion with steered wheels. It is then explained how the model can determine both the vehicle's motion parameters under different conditions and the external and internal constrained reactions. Finally, the analysis is devoted to the stabilizing effect of the lateral adherence forces, referred to as micro-slipping forces in [G.

The experiments on a modular reconfigurable robotic setup confirmed this conclusion: the lateral deviations may range up to several centimeters from the closest point on the desired trajectory. The main reason is that the control output often reaches the saturation value of an actuator. The lateral error is also found very dangerous in obstacle cluttered environments due to possible damage of the manipulator arm while hitting an obstacle a t high speed. This paper is devoted to solve this problem. Widely used task space control algorithms such as the resolved-rate and the resolved-acceleration algorithms are modified b y introducing monitoring on the control output, and, accordingly, modifying the commanded control signal so that the end-effector is prevented from leaving the programmed path. As a consequence, the manipulator tip may slowdown along the path due to limited actuator power, but it will be accelerated after that to reach the desired position as soon as possible. The algorithms also take into account the presence of singularities t o avoid uncontrollable excursions of the manipulator t ip . Hundreds of experiments have been carried out to confirm the concept. Some of those with a desired trajectory reaching both the regular and the singular region of the workspace are provided to illustrate the method.	algorithm;constraint (mathematics);experiment;lateral thinking;robot control;robot end effector;self-reconfiguring modular robot;workspace	Manja V.

The applications include climbing and perching robots. Surfaces are characterized in terms of asperity distributions, which lead to stochastic models of spine force capabilities over a range of loading directions. Models cover unidirectional spine arrays and pairs of opposed arrays that withstand normal forces pulling away from a surface. Experiments on a variety of surfaces confirm the predicted behavior. For opposed spine arrays, the overall load capability also depends on the preloading strategy for applying internal forces. Insights from the analysis guide the design of spine array mechanisms to allow, for example, a small aerial platform to attach to walls and ceilings.		Hao Jiang;Shiquan Wang;Mark R. Cutkosky	2018	I.

17d8049091e0278f455a504d66deb31fe286b6be	regional pole and zero placement with static output feedback via the modified minimum gain lemma		This paper presents static output feedback controller synthesis methods that place closed-loop poles, blocking zeros, and transmission zeros within regions of the complex plane. In particular, closed-loop poles are placed within linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions of the complex plane, while closed-loop blocking and transmission zeros are placed in the open left-half plane (OLHP), and are thus minimum phase. An LMI formulation of the Modified Minimum Gain Lemma is used to ensure that the closed-loop system is minimum phase by forcing a nonzero minimum gain constraint. Two controller synthesis methods are presented, including Method 1, which places the closed-loop poles in the OLHP, and Method 2, which places closed-loop poles in the OLHP and closed-loop poles within a specified LMI region of the complex plane. Numerical examples are provided for both controller synthesis methods, with comparisons to controllers in the literature.	block cipher mode of operation;blocking (computing);control theory;farkas' lemma;game controller;linear matrix inequality;minimum phase;numerical linear algebra;social inequality	Ryan James Caverly;James Richard Forbes	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7962980	control theory;control engineering;control theory;root locus;complex plane;minimum phase;argument principle;mathematical optimization;linear matrix inequality;mathematics;pole–zero plot;full state feedback	Robotics	64.30962332832853	-2.892819526943906	18738
ba52e63a7414d67e0a769406a6424981d16b2928	legged mechanism design with momentum gains		There are two main goals for any mobile, bipedal system: locomotion and balance. These behaviors both require the biped to effectively move its center of mass (COM). In this work, we define an optimization framework which can be used to design a biped that maximizes its ability to move its COM, without having to define an associated controller or trajectory. We use angular momentum gain in our objective function, a measure of how efficiently a system can move its COM based on its physical properties. As a comparison, we also optimize the model using a cost of transport-based objective function over a set of trajectories and show that it provides similar results. However, the cost of transport calculation requires slow hybrid dynamics equations and hand-designed trajectories, whereas the angular momentum gain calculation requires only the joint space inertia matrix at each configuration of interest.	angularjs;computation;human-readable medium;image scaling;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;velocity (software development)	Brandon J.

d92ceac9e9992c0765ec567384a6fcf88915508a	a new method to analyze complete stability of pwl cellular neural networks	cellular neural network	In recent years, the standard Cellular Neural Networks (CNN’s) introduced by Chua and Yang [1988] have been one of the most investigated paradigms for neural information processing. In a wide range of applications, the CNN’s are required to be completely stable, i.e. each trajectory should converge toward some stationary state. However, a rigorous proof of complete stability, even in the simplest original setting of piecewise-linear (PWL) neuron activations and symmetric interconnections [Chua & Yang, 1988], is still lacking. This paper aims primarily at filling this gap, in order to give a sound analytical foundation to the CNN paradigm. To this end, a novel approach for studying complete stability is proposed. This is based on a fundamental limit theorem for the length of the CNN trajectories. The method differs substantially from the classic approach using LaSalle invariance principle, and permits to overcome difficulties encountered when using LaSalle approach to analyze complete stability of PWL CNN’s. The main result obtained, is that a symmetric PWL CNN is completely stable for any choice of the network parameters, i.e. it possesses the Absolute Stability property of global pattern formation. This result is really general and shows that complete stability holds under hypotheses weaker than those considered in [Chua & Yang, 1988]. The result does not require, for example, that the CNN has binary stable equilibrium points only. It is valid even in degenerate situations where the CNN has infinite nonisolated equilibrium points. These features significantly extend the potential application fields of the standard CNN’s.	binary prefix;centrality;chua's circuit;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);converge;electronic switching system;functional approach;fuzzy logic;gradient;grayscale;image processing;information processing;ising model;lagrange multiplier;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nash equilibrium;neural networks;neuron;optimization problem;organizing (structure);pattern formation;programming paradigm;self-organization;stationary process;stationary state;yang	Mauro Forti;Alberto Tesi	2001	I.

By using the average dwell time approach and the piecewise Lyapunov function technique, a sufficient condition is first proposed, in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), to guarantee the exponential stability and a certain bound for the cost function of the closed-loop system, where the decay estimate is explicitly given to quantify the convergence rate. Then, the corresponding solvability conditions for a desired DOF controller under guaranteed cost are established by using the approach of linearising variable transforms. Since these obtained conditions are not all expressed by strict LMIs, the cone complementary linearisation method is exploited to cast them into sequential minimisation problems subject to LMI constraints, which can be easily solved numerically. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.	block cipher mode of operation	Ligang Wu;Zidong Wang	2009	Int. J.

The controller forces the system to maintain nearly nominal performance through the whole range of operation space by quickly estimating and canceling the uncertainties and external disturbances. Despite the non-triviality and relative complexity of the method, the resulting controller structure is simple, allowing low cost low part count analog implementation. Extended simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	boost converter;buck–boost converter;extended precision;nonlinear system;robust control;simulation;switched-mode power supply	Alon Kuperman	2013	2013 5th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)	10.1109/ICUMT.2013.6798418	robust control;forward converter;control theory	Robotics	67.23600505276485	-7.896781408022807	18864

The formulation involves a discrete-time switched linear plant that has a nested structure, and whose system matrices switch between a finite number of values according to finite-state automation. The goal of this paper is to synthesize a commensurately nested switched controller to achieve a desired level of ℓ2-induced norm performance. The nested structures of both plant and controller are characterized by block lower-triangular system matrices. For this setup, exact conditions are provided for the existence of a finite path-dependent synthesis. These include conditions for the completion of scaling matrices obtained through an extended matrix completion lemma. When individual controller dimensions are chosen at least as large as the plant, these conditions reduce to a set of linear matrix inequalities. The completion lemma also provides an algorithm to complete closed-loop scaling matrices, leading to inequalities for controller synthesis that are solvable either algebraically or numerically through SDP.	algorithm;decision problem;distributed control system;linear matrix inequality;numerical analysis;path dependence;semidefinite programming	Anshuman Mishra;Cédric Langbort;Geir E.

The approach relies on the introduction of a new set of kinematic parameters describing the constrained motion of the end-effector, using the analytical forms of material and program constraints. These parameters define a new basis in the end-effector configuration space. A general inner product characterized by the unity matrix is introduced in this basis and in its dual, which gives rise to the definition of a new set of metrics for the end-effector configuration space. The vectors defined in these bases are considered as pseudo-orthogonal. Returning to the original bases of the configuration space, the symmetric matrices for the vanishing bilinear forms can be defined. In this way, the freedom and constraint subspaces can be defined in a rigorous, analytical way. The physical meaning of the resulting metrics is explained. It is shown that the task space decomposition is invariant, although non-Euclidean metrics are being used. To illustrate the application of the methodology and to explain further the properties of the task space decomposition, two examples are presented. In the first example, the robot end-effector tracks a planar surface. A particular definition of the program constraint gives rise to the introduction of skewed bases, which better explains the inherent features of the approach. In the second example, a task of operating a planar joystick, with constrained orientation of the end-effector, is considered. The relevant bases of the task space are translated in this case and it is possible to explain other features of the method.	analytical engine;bilinear filtering;joystick;linear algebra;robot end effector	Krzysztof P.

It has been shown that the system without control loses stability and a Hopf bifurcation occurs when the bifurcation parameter, which is the communication delay of the model, passes through a critical value. Therefore, a control approach based on delayed feedback is proposed to postpone the onset of undesired Hopf bifurcation. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that the controller is efficient in bifurcation control of the Internet congestion control system.	bifurcation theory;control system;hopf bifurcation;network congestion	Dawei Ding;Jie Zhu;Xiaoshu Luo;Yuliang Liu	2009	I.

In a practical control system, uncertainties include parametric uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, time delay and disturbances, which are too many and complicated to observe or know. By taking this into account, a new tracking controller design method is proposed, called the additive-output-decomposition-based dynamic inversion tracking control. The main idea is to lump all uncertainties together at the output by the proposed additive output decomposition. Then the transformed problem is handled by the dynamic inversion method. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed tracking controller design is applied to two benchmark examples.	additive model;benchmark (computing);broadcast delay;control system;inverse transform sampling;linear time-invariant theory;lumped element model;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;time complexity;time-invariant system;utility functions on indivisible goods	Quan Quan;Kai-Yuan Cai	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6427111	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;real-time computing;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	64.8323438563178	-4.773523929480051	18933

This work explores dynamic jumping with the planar biped prototype KURMET, which employs unidirectional series-elastic actuation at each of its joints. While this actuation scheme enables the performance of high-power dynamic movements like the jump, its presence complicates the jumping control problem and has prevented previous researchers from obtaining precise jump control in systems of reasonable complexity. To manage this problem, this paper develops a layered fuzzy control system for KURMET that realizes repeated dynamic hopping and accurate control of both torso height and velocity at each top of flight. An effective two-stage training approach is used for the fuzzy controller to learn the required, yet highly nonlinear, relationships between its inputs and outputs.

Specifically, we study the possibility to steer the state of a single-input singleoutput linear switched system to the origin in finite time by output feedback with finite memory. We show that if the system is in a controller canonical form, a causal state nullifying controller exists. We also show that, generically, only acausal feedback can achieve state nullification. This is in contrast with the fact that state nullification is generically possible when there is no unpredictable switching (linear time varying systems).	anticausal system;block cipher mode of operation;causal filter;time complexity	Gera Weiss	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-71493-4_82	control engineering;real-time computing;control theory	Logic	68.00732992179844	-3.1562675752599705	19099

So far, many works have been published on kinematic redundancy, however, a systemization is missing. In this article an attempt for such a systemization is presented. It has been limited to methods for redundancy resolution through local optimization. Until now, these methods are most widely used, and it is expected also that they will prevail in the near future. A classification is suggested and the performance capabilities of the methods are discussed and compared. Two reference tables are provided; One of them lists references for different problems on kinematic redundancy as: mechanical design, dexterity measures, multicriteria optimization, global optimization, control design and computational considerations. The other table displays existing publications classified according to the application area of redundant robotic-mechanisms.	local search (optimization);mathematical optimization	Dragomir N.

A major contribution of this paper is the development of a coordinate invariant 2nd order mobility index for a body, B, in frictionless contact with nger bodies A1; : : : ;Ak. The index is an integer that captures the inherent mobility of B in an equilibrium grasp due to 2nd order, or surface curvature, e ects. It di erentiates between grasps which are deemed equivalent by classical 1st order theories, but are physically di erent. We further show that 2nd order e ects can be used to lower the e ective mobility of a grasped object, and discuss implications of this result for proving new lower bounds on the number of contacting bodies needed to immobilize an object. Physical interpretation and stability analysis of 2nd order e ects are taken up in the companion paper.	naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;theory	Elon D. Rimon;Joel W.

Some new FTS conditions are provided and applied to the design problem of finite-time fuzzy regulators. The common Lyapunov function (CLF) approach is first used to analyze the FTS of affine fuzzy system. Then, a piecewise Lyapunov function (PLF), which is less conservative than CLF, is adopted to analyze the FTS of affine fuzzy systems and design corresponding finite-time fuzzy controller. In analysis, the FTS conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In synthesis, the conditions of finite-time stabilization turn out to be in the formulation of nonconvex matrix inequalities for discrete affine fuzzy system (DAFS) and bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs) for continuous affine fuzzy system (CAFS). Thus, iterative LMI (ILMI) approach is applied to obtain the feasible solutions. Two examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed results.	nonlinear system;numerical stability	Hao Liu;Xudong Zhao;Hongmei Zhang	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2014.02.008	mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;computer science;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.2003102444778	-0.41962643814357387	19228

It aims at developing novel fault diagnostics techniques for the motor or rotating machines for diagnostics that is costeffective and easier to deploy from industrial perspective. Normally the encoders data is only used to measure speed, however this paper attempts to use the same data normally considered insufficient for mathematical modeling, in creating a set of model based residuals. The velocity measurements based on the timing between the hall effect sensors placed around the motor in form of a mini-plastic belt is accurately measured with a microprocessor without involving expensive A/D. Conventional schemes usually deploy the spectral analysis that requires expensive sensors and powerful data processing engines. This scheme employs the conventional encoder and with a very limited floating point  implementations. The complete model based residual generator can be implemented that can relate the rotational jitters and mechanical faults and with further analysis it can be linked with a set of transformations from spectral domain to the jitter domain. The paper presents a novel model based residual generator for shaft Encoder of a motor based on its jitter model. The mechanical errors of the system are translated into variations in the angular velocity. The residual generator presented in this paper is sensitive to the resolution of jitters of 4us to cross 3s thresholds.	angularjs;encoder;hall effect sensor;mathematical model;microprocessor;velocity (software development)	Z.

A three degree of freedom parallel robot is proposed in this paper to accommodate range of motion and muscle strengthening exercises for ankle rehabilitation. Singularity analysis of the design revealed that a redundantly actuated robot is required to avoid singularity in the workspace. Kinematic parameters of the robot were selected so that the available workspace could closely match the available ankle range of motion. An impedance control scheme has been utilized to allow control of both force and motion to ensure safety of the patient. The redundant actuation degree of freedom is exploited to regulate the vertical reaction force at the ankle.	parallel manipulator;video game rehabilitation	Y. H. Tsoi;S. Q.

The approach relies on a simplified model of the spacecraft and helicopter dynamics. Initial results in simulation indicate that the approach is feasible, with tracking accuracies on the order of5 m.	algorithm;approximation;artificial neural network;emulator;experiment;hall-effect thruster;simulation;testbed;transfer function;yaws	Srikanth Saripalli;Gaurav S.

It fundamentally mimics the skeleto-muscular system of human articulation, in which at least two muscles handle one rotary axis under their antagonistic (counteractive) action. In the first part of the paper one introduces basic formula for controlling the multi-DOF rotary joint that is assumed to be driven by a couple of novel actuators called ANLES (Actuator with Non-Linear Elastic System). It mimics a skeletal muscle in the sense of having a non-linear elasticity. Next the paper describes the structure of the ANLES that is designed and constructed for controlling the wrist joint of an anthropomorphic robot. The experimental results using three DOF joint controlled by four ANLES reveal that the joint angle and the joint stiffness can be independently controlled by the proposed formula.	apache axis;biconnected component;elasticity (data store);emoticon;experiment;ext js javascript framework;nonlinear system;radial (radio);robot;rotary system;stiffness;torsion (gastropod)	Koichi Koganezawa;Hiroshi Yamashita	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354434	structural engineering;control engineering;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;elasticity;linear elasticity;actuator	Robotics	69.64776252900755	-23.538684165399665	19619

The acceleration of a colliding vehicle is measured in its center of gravity — this crash pulse contains detailed information about vehicle behavior throughout a collision. Three types of signal analysis are elaborated here: time domain analysis (i.e. description of kinematics of a vehicle in time domain), the frequency analysis (identification of the parameters of the crash pulse in frequency domain), and the time-frequency analysis, which comprises those techniques that study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, using Morlet wavelet properties. The frequency components of the recorded crash pulse are identified by determining the ridge of the wavelet coefficients matrix. Having knowledge of the natural frequency of the signal, the damping factor for a given mode shape of the signal is estimated. In this work the major frequencies of the crash pulse are determined and the damping factor for the major mode shape is identified. The comparative analysis between the current method's outcome, the response of a model established previously by using different approach and the behavior of a real car is performed and reliability of the actual methods and tools is evaluated.	full scale;wavelet	Witold Pawlus;Hamid Reza Karimi;Kjell G.

The distinguishing feature of this form of control is the use of information from previous executions of the task to update the control signal to be applied on the next execution and thereby sequentially improve performance. Once an execution is complete, all information generated is available for use in control design and how to best use such information is a dominant issue. In applications, robust control is also a critical feature and the new results in this paper use parameter dependent Lyapunov functions to enlarge the uncertainty range allowed for successful design. These results are developed by treating ILC in a repetitive process setting.	control engineering;iterative method;linear system;lyapunov fractal;robust control;system camera;verification and validation	Blazej Cichy;Krzysztof Galkowski;Eric Rogers	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7172101	robust control;robot;control engineering;mathematical optimization;control-lyapunov function;von neumann stability analysis;uncertainty;adaptive control;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign	Robotics	61.44202808181774	-4.020714481730692	19780

The z-variable’s output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the noise intensity shows non-monotonic behavior, indicating the occurrence of EISSR. It is first found that EISSR happened in the periodic-2 oscillations state. A worthy noting point is that the fundamental frequency of the intrinsic period signal of the system is shifted little with the change of noise intensity. EISSR is a cooperative effect of the intrinsic period signal and external noise or fluctuations. Our studies have shown that EISSR can lead to noise-resistance of the chemical oscillator. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	image noise;rössler attractor;signal-to-noise ratio;stochastic resonance	Aizhong Lei;WeiGuo Xu;DaiPing Hu;HuiZhang Shen	2005	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2005.03.006	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;fundamental frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;oscillation;stochastic resonance;physics	ML	81.16475429635278	0.840084521702448	19785

Unlike existing designs which assume that the inertial frame is available to each agent, we develop a passivity-based design which relies only on relative attitude information with respect to neighboring agents. The desired equilibria, where all the rigid bodies possess the same attitude and rotate at a desired angular velocity, are shown to be locally asymptotically stable and a manifold of undesired equilibria may exist. We then consider the situation where the reference angular velocity is available only to the leader, and propose a distributed adaptive controller with which the other agents reconstruct this reference angular velocity.

The hardware is based on our previously proposed forward-inverse-relaxation neural network. Computationally, the optimization principle is the minimum torque-change criterion. At the representation level, hard constraints satisfied by a trajectory are represented as a set of via-points extracted from handwritten characters. Accordingly, we propose a via-point estimation algorithm that estimates via-points by repeating trajectory formation of a character and via-point extraction from the character. It is shown experimentally that for movements with a single via-point target, the via-point estimation algorithm can assign a point near the actual via-point target. Good quantitative agreement is found between human movement data and the trajectories generated by the proposed model.	algorithm;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;computation;control theory;estimated;experiment;extraction;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;mental representation;movement;personality character;point estimation;explanation	Yasuhiro Wada;Mitsuo Kawato	1995	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/BF00199051	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;point estimation;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network;satisfiability	ML	63.490488761331044	-23.534421698199793	19882

Because of this characteristic, research, development, and also marketing are mainly conducted by the conglomerate, like GM, BMW, Honda, and Hyundai motors, etc. But environmental pollution and fuel exhaustion by the stated vehicle increase the necessity of EV(Electric Vehicle) as a representative of green car. First of all, the structure of EV is relatively simple, and energy transmission ratio of electric motor is more efficient than the engine based power train system. In addition to these, inwheel EV can estimate exact wheel torque, which is the most fundamental information for slip control, such as VDC(Vehicle dynamics control)/TCS(Traction control system)/ABS(Anti-lock brake system). Various kinds of expectable situations during EV’s navigation have been simulated through the coordination between ‘Carsim’ and ‘Simulink’.	extended validation certificate;simulation	Hyunuk Ha;Jongmoo Kim;Jangmyung Lee	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40852-6_7	control engineering;embedded system	Robotics	72.82759984896995	-16.852932660839652	19892

Firstly, a new inequality which is the modified version of free-matrix-based integral inequality is derived, and then by aid of this new inequality, two novel lemmas which are relaxed conditions for some matrices in a Lyapunov function are proposed. Based on the lemmas, improved delay-dependent stability criteria which guarantee the asymptotic stability of the system are presented in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Two numerical examples are given to describe the less conservatism of the proposed methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To fix this problem, we propose a set of nonlinear controllers parameterized by only a few variables, and prove that the proposed set contains an approximately optimal solution that achieves within a constant ratio of the optimal cost. This insight is conveyed using bit-oriented deterministic models that elucidate the nature of the ongoing implicit communication that must occur.	approximation algorithm;nonlinear system	Se Yong Park;Anant Sahai	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6425835	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;optimal projection equations;mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	62.382820690308385	0.6587648144130052	20007

Unfortunately, the case of under-actuated robots has not been deeply studied. The aim of this paper is to extend previous results reported by the authors [2] addressing the particular (but of practical interest) case of networks composed by flexible-joint robots. The main feature of the contribution is to consider a change of coordinates, first introduced in [1], to solve the consensus problem assuming the existence of unknown delays in the communication channels. The extensions consist in: the presentation of a control scheme that, in contrast to the one considered in [2], does not require knowledge of the initial conditions; the proof that the controller can also be implemented in Cartesian coordinates; and the statement of the stability properties adopting a Cascaded systems perspective. The usefulness of the contribution is illustrated through numerical simulations.	computer simulation;consensus (computer science);control theory;initial condition;numerical analysis;robot	Sofia Avila-Becerril;Gerardo Espinosa-Pérez;Elena Panteley;Romeo Ortega	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760222	control engineering;simulation;stability;numerical analysis;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	65.65180740536123	-12.984103127569496	20069

We introduce a dedicated team of charging robots to service a team of primary working robots. Given that the trajectories of the working robots are known within a planning interval, the objective is to plan routes for the charging robots such that they rendezvous with and recharge all working robots to guarantee their continuous operation. To this end, the working robot trajectories are discretized to form a finite set of recharging points at which rendezvous can occur. The problem is formulated as a directed acyclic graph with vertex partitions containing sets of charging points for each working robot. Solutions consist of paths through the graph for each of the charging robots. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and a mixed integer linear program formulation is presented and solved for small problem instances. Finally, it is shown that while the optimal solution is not computationally feasible for large problem sizes, it is possible to graphically transform the single charging robot problem to a Traveling Salesman Problem, for which existing heuristic and approximation algorithms can be applied. Simulation results are presented for both single and multiple charging robot scenarios.	aerial photography;approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;computational resource;continuous operation;depletion region;directed acyclic graph;discretization;heuristic;imperative programming;linear programming;noon state;np-hardness;persistence (computer science);rechargeable battery;scott continuity;simulation;solver;travelling salesman problem	Neil Mathew;Stephen L.

In this paper we describe the implementation of inverse kinematics based head stabilization controller on the humanoid platform. The controller uses the IMU feedback and controls neck joints in order to align the head orientation with the global orientation reference. Thanks to the method, we can decouple the orientational motion of the head from the rest of the body. This way stabilized head becomes better platform for proprioceptive sensory apparatus, such as cameras or IMU. In the paper we present three experiments which prove that the method has good performance in damping both, high and low frequency motion of the head. We also prove that the proposed controller improves the stability of the tracked goal point on the image of in-built camera.	algorithm;align (company);british informatics olympiad;chris sawyer's locomotion;control system;experiment;humanoid robot;inverse kinematics;kinesiology;kobian;level of detail;motion capture;reference frame (video);resultant;system of measurement	Przemyslaw Kryczka;Egidio Falotico;Kenji Hashimoto;Hun-ok Lim;Atsuo Takanishi;Cecilia Laschi;Paolo Dario;Alain Berthoz	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6386177	damping;robot;control engineering;motion control;computer vision;kinematics;simulation;stability;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;video tracking;feedback;head;robot kinematics	Robotics	67.45617758580794	-23.649249965563257	20166

Model predictive control requires solving optimization problems in real time, limiting its application to systems with small numbers of switches and a short horizon. We propose a technique for using off-line computation to approximate the model predictive controller. This is done by dividing the planning horizon into two segments, and using a quadratic function to approximate the optimal cost over the second segment. The approximate model predictive algorithm minimizes the true cost over the first segment, and the approximate cost over the second segment, allowing the user to adjust the computational requirements by changing the length of the first segment. We conclude with two simulated examples.	application-oriented networking;approximation algorithm;bsave (bitmap format);bellman equation;boost converter;computation;curve fitting;dicom;differential algebraic equation;discretization;exptime;epoch (reference date);linear matrix inequality;loss function;mathematical optimization;network switch;online and offline;pl/i;power inverter;quadratic function;requirement;sampling (signal processing);the matrix;time complexity;time-invariant system;uncontrolled format string	Nicholas Moehle	2017	2017 12th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)		control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory	Robotics	61.4983549785185	-0.8090862478659443	20317

Thus, when designing a control law, it is important to consider not just predicted system performance, but also the cost associated with changing the control action. This latter cost is almost always ignored in the optimal control literature. In this paper, we consider a class of optimal control problems in which the variation of the control signal is explicitly penalized in the cost function. We develop an effective computational method, based on the control parameterization approach and a novel transformation procedure, for solving this class of optimal control problems. We then apply our method to three example problems in fisheries, train control, and chemical engineering.	approximation algorithm;constant function;discretization;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimal control	Ryan C.

By introducing the λ-norm and using a generalized Gronwall inequality, the sufficient condition for the robust convergence of the tracking errors with respect to initial positioning errors under P-type ILC is obtained. Based on this convergence condition, the learning gain of the initial learning and input learning updating law can be determined. Unlike the existing methods, the ILC scheme will not fix the initial value on the expected condition at the beginning of each iteration. Finally, the validity of the methods are verified by a numerical example. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ff1b6197ed4248d5eca2f9eaebde4e4e51efdd31	multirate output feedback based discrete-time sliding mode control for a class of nonlinear systems	discrete time;output feedback;nonlinear system;sliding mode control	The concept of sliding mode control was first introduced by Emelyanov [Emelyanov, 1967] and Utkin [Utkin, 1977]. It is a technique that achieves desired characteristics for the system by confining its states to a specified subset of the state space. This is done by application of a control of variable structure. The main advantage of sliding mode control is its insensitivity to system parameter variations [Hung et al., 1993,Young et al., 1999]. In the recent years, considerable efforts have been put in the study of the concepts of Digital Sliding Mode (DSM) controller design [Furuta, 1990, Gao et al., 1995, Sarpturk et al., 1978]. In case of the DSM design, the control input is applicable only at certain sampling instants and the control effort is constant over the entire sampling period. Moreover, when the states reach the switching surface, the subsequent control would be unable to keep the states confined to the surface. As a result, DSM can undergo only quasi-sliding mode, i.e., the system states would approach the sliding surface but would generally be unable to stay on it. Thus, in general, DSM does not possess the invariance property found in continuous-time sliding mode. In [Gao et al., 1995] a “reaching law” approach for the design of control for DSM using state feedback was introduced. This reaching law ensures that the system trajectory will hit the switching manifold and thereafter undergo a zigzag motion about the switching manifold. The magnitude of each successive zigzagging step decreases so that the trajectory stays within a specified band called the quasi-sliding-mode band.	block cipher mode of operation;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);state space	Sivaramakrishnan Janardhanan;Bijnan Bandyopadhyay;Prashant Shingare	2004			control engineering;variable structure control;discrete time and continuous time;nonlinear control;sliding mode control;nonlinear system;control theory;state observer	Robotics	69.37120177539869	-4.08821195359477	20423
aea9d38e95be688a736c6afc70f612e2103cdf08	a branch and prune algorithm for the computation of generalized aspects of parallel robots	numerical constraints;generalized aspects;parallel robots;singularities	Parallel robots enjoy enhanced mechanical characteristics that have to be contrasted with a more complicated design. In particular, they often have parallel singularities at some poses, and the robots may become uncontrollable, and could even be damaged, in such configurations. The computation of the connected components in the set of nonsingular reachable configurations, called generalized aspects, is therefore a key issue in their design.#R##N##R##N#This paper introduces a new method, based on numerical constraint programming, to compute a certified enclosure of the generalized aspects. Though this method does not allow counting their number rigorously, it constructs inner approximations of the nonsingular workspace that allow commanding parallel robots safely. It also provides a lower-bound on the exact number of generalized aspects. It is moreover the first general method able to handle any parallel robot in theory, though its computational complexity currently restricts its usage to robots with three degrees of freedom. Finally, the constraint programming paradigm it relies on makes it possible to consider various additional constraints (e.g., collision avoidance), making it suitable for practical considerations.	algorithm;computation;parallel manipulator;robot	Stéphane Caro;Damien Chablat;Alexandre Goldsztejn;Daisuke Ishii;Christophe Jermann	2014	Artif.

We use feedback linearization to construct a nominal control for the system then use reset control and a neural network to compensate for errors due to the time delay. Finally, we obtain a stochastic model of the Networked Control System (NCS) using a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and use it to design a predictive control. We apply our control methodology to a nonlinear inverted pendulum and evaluate its performance through numerical simulations. We also test our approach with real-time experiments on a dc motor-load NCS with wireless communication implemented using a Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN). Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our control methodology.	artificial neural network;broadcast delay;computer simulation;control flow;control system;control theory;dynamic bayesian network;experiment;inverted pendulum;network computing system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;overshoot (signal);real-time clock;rejection sampling;settling time;simulation	Hyun Cheol Cho;M.

In the proposed filter, the unknown acceleration input for each sub-model is determined by mismatches between the modelled target dynamics and the actual target dynamics. After an acceleration input is detected, the state estimate for each sub-model is modified. To modify the accurate estimation, we propose the fuzzy gain based on the relation between the filter residual and its variation. To optimize each fuzzy system, we utilize the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, the tracking performance of the proposed method is compared with those of the input estimation(IE) method and AIMM method through computer simulations.	agp inline memory module;ballistic missile;computer simulation;fuzzy control system;genetic algorithm;interaction;radar tracker;software release life cycle	Sun Young Noh;Jin Bae Park;Young Hoon Joo	2006		10.1007/11925231_72	computer simulation;fuzzy logic;systems modeling;genetic algorithm;filter;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;tracking;tracking error	Robotics	58.40392346355986	-13.157903862990052	20592

The objective is to control a robot from a non-contact initial condition to a desired (in- contact) position so that the mass-spring system is regulated to a desired compressed state. The feedback elements for the controller in this paper are contained inside of hyperbolic tangent functions as a means to limit the impact forces resulting from large initial conditions as the robot transitions from a non-contact to contact state. New control development, closed- loop error systems, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis arguments are used to conclude the result.	control theory;dynamical system;initial condition;lyapunov fractal;midi controller;nonlinear system;robot;robotic arm;semiconductor industry	C.

In this case study, we introduce a laminated 2-DOF spherical, parallel manipulator. Taking advantage of laminating techniques in the construction of the robot can result in considerable saving in construction costs and time, but, the challenges caused by this technique have to be addressed. By using stiffer materials in rigid links, the rigidity of the robot is increased to an acceptable level. We discuss one method for compensating position uncertainty via an experimental identification technique which uses a neural network to create a forward kinematic model. Final results show that the proposed mechanism is able to track desired rotation with acceptable precision using open-loop model-based control. This indicates that parallel manipulators fabricated using lamination techniques can provide similar performance with prototypes made in conventional methods.	artificial neural network;forward kinematics;parallel manipulator;robot;self-replicating machine	Mohammad Sharifzadeh;Roozbeh Khodambashi;Daniel Aukes	2018	CoRR		control engineering;replicate;engineering;artificial neural network;kinematics;lamination;parallel manipulator	Robotics	72.54873642288175	-21.11573603141617	20673

We show that these vibrations can be related to a deterministic chaotic dynamics induced by sampling and quantization. A detailed analytical proof of chaos is presented for the case of a PD controlled oscillator: it is shown that there exists a finite attracting domain in the phase-space, the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive and the existence of a Smale horseshoe is also pointed out. The corresponding two-dimensional micro-chaos map is a multi-baker map, i.e. it consists of a finite series of baker’s maps.	baker's map	Gábor Csernák;Gergely Gyebrószki;Gábor Stépán	2016	I. J.

Sparse signals with heavily corrupted arbitrary positioned samples could be analyzed in the same way as compressive sensed signals by omitting the corrupted samples and considering them as unavailable during the recovery process. The reconstruction of missing samples is done by using one of the well known reconstruction algorithms. In this paper we will propose a very simple and efficient adaptive variable step algorithm, applied directly to the concentration measures, without reformulating the reconstruction problem within the standard linear programming form. Direct application of the gradient approach to the nondifferentiable forms of measures lead us to introduce a variable step size algorithm. A criterion for changing adaptive algorithm parameters is presented. The results are illustrated on the examples with sparse signals, including approximately sparse signals and noisy sparse signals.

The new filter is performed in three stages: First, the predicted state quantities of the nonlinear system are obtained by the prediction equation of the EKF. Then, the estimation error system is represented via an uncertain polytopic linear model, on the bias of which, the rectification equations with constant coefficients for the predicted errors are designed, without the need to evaluate the Jacobian matrixes on line. Finally, the state estimates are given through updating the predictions by the rectified quantities. The main novelty of the paper is the application of the Polytopic Linear Differential Inclusion in the nonlinear system, leading to the simplified design of the nonlinear filter and the improved real time performance of the new filter than the EKF, though the accuracy is a little decline. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by using the statistics result of the calculation number for the filters and an example of application in the attitude estimation system.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;differential inclusion;extended kalman filter;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear model;nonlinear system;programming language design and implementation;real-time clock;rectifier (neural networks)	Bing Liu;Zhen Chen;Xiangdong Liu;Jie Geng;Fan Yang	2013	2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2013.6605995	control engineering;mathematical optimization;split-step method;invariant extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	60.93138295689765	-4.4651318015705295	20703

The problem is stated as a finding of spatial-temporal paths through which the robots can go from their initial locations to the given goal locations in a certain environment. The robots must subordinate to a variety of physical constraints. The most important constraints from our point of view are that the robots must avoid obstacles and they must avoid each other. Both of these two constraints can be captured by a model where the environment is modeled as an undirected graph. Vertices of this graph represent possible locations for the robots and edges represent possible transitions between locations. The robots are located in the vertices of the graph. Each vertex can be occupied by at most one robot. A robot can move to the neighboring unoccupied vertex. The main result of the paper is the description of a class of the problem for which a polynomial time solving algorithm exists. We also present an experimental evaluation in which we tested the ability of several state-of-the-art planners to solve the problem.	automated planning and scheduling;motion planning;robot	Pavel Surynek	2008		10.3233/978-1-58603-893-9-175	mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;motion planning;graph	Robotics	54.39551553215001	-22.582597702639905	20875

Under this framework, a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system is used with a general structure of a linear combination of Gaussian basis function in conjunction with the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm for the optimization of model parameters. A real-time one-pass learning algorithm is developed for identifying the unknown chaotic system. Based on the fuzzy model above, a predictive controller is achieved for the stabilization of the fuzzy model on unknown unstable fixed points. Several simulation examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed method for both fuzzy modeling and predictive control phases.	basis function;chaos theory;control theory;feedback;fixed point (mathematics);futures studies;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimal control;real-time clock;simulation;sugeno integral	Abdelkrim Boukabou;Noura Mansouri	2007	I.

Based on frequency response data of the plant, the parameters of a predefined controller structure are optimized directly with respect to closed-loop performance specifications. As a result, no parametric plant model is required such that time consuming iterative identification-synthesis procedures can be omitted. A framework is presented to both assure stability and optimize closed-loop performance based on frequency response data. Furthermore, based upon these results, a cost-function is formulated that can be exploited to converge from a destabilizing- to the stabilizing controller parameter region. Both the stability guarantee and performance optimization procedures are combined in one optimization algorithm that is illustrated by means of an example.	algorithm;converge;frequency response;iteration;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;performance tuning;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;simulation	Arjen den Hamer;Siep Weiland;Maarten Steinbuch	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400924	control engineering;mathematical optimization;frequency response;convergence;optimal control;stability;engineering;control theory;mathematics;transfer function	Robotics	62.72711301639802	-1.7303462424375757	21123

Sufficient delay-dependent exponential stabilization results are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities by constructing suitable Lyapunov---Krasovskii functional. The control gain matrices are designed using impulsive state-feedback control approach. Also, the nonlinear function is assumed to satisfy the sector-bounded condition which includes Lipschitz condition as a special case. Further numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the derived results.	nonlinear system	Pagavathigounder Balasubramaniam;Ramasamy Krishnasamy	2014	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-014-9771-z	control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear matrix inequality;control theory;mathematics	Logic	69.7074875170642	0.4563637627959203	21157

Once this affine function has been pre-calculated, the optimal solution can be computed for a particular parameter by determining the region that contains it. This is the so-called point location problem. In this paper, we show that this problem can be written as an additively weighted nearest neighbour search that can be solved in time linear in the dimension of the state space and logarithmic in the number of regions. It is well-known that linear model predictive control (MPC) problems based on linear control objectives (e.g., 1or ∞-norm) can be posed as pLPs, and on-line calculation of the control law involves the solution to the point location problem. Several orders of magnitude sampling speed improvement are demonstrated over traditional MPC and closed-form MPC schemes using the proposed scheme. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of difficulty and high manufacturing costs of the radome, large antennas usually operate under open-air atmospheres. Therefore, large antennas’ pointing performance can be severely influenced by wind disturbances, which can lead to reflector deflection and deformation. Accordingly, this brief has been conducted to determine how to inhibit reflector deflection in order to improve pointing accuracy. Based on a pointing control-oriented model (PCOM) which includes a dynamic model for estimating the servo error and the deformation of the structure caused by wind, this brief proposes a method for overcoming wind disturbance to improve pointing accuracy by evaluating the mode of vibration that influences the most significant beam pointing. First, a dynamic PCOM was established. Second, an antenna pointing controller was designed based on a linear-quadratic-Gaussian approach. Finally, a series of tests and analyses of a 7.3-m Ka-band antenna was conducted; the results show that the maximum pointing error was reduced from 0.0103° to 0.0024° compared with the error experienced with a traditional proportional–integral–derivative controller.	computer simulation;half-band filter;ka band;mathematical model;normal mode;reflector (antenna);reflector (cellular automaton);reflector (cipher machine);servo;structural element	Jie Zhang;Jin Huang;Jun Zhou;Congsi Wang;Yao Zhu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2631134	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Visualization	75.8595016960489	-14.471665482995462	21222

It will show how each other mobile robot, with a hand and manipulator with three degrees of freedom and the two wheels, can cooperate with other. Firstly, via the kinematics interpretation, the position of the end-effector is calculated. Then, by using inverse kinematics, the end-effector is moved to the object’s position. This cooperation of these two robots seems like a closed-chain form. Additionally, the angles of the both robot’s manipulators are the same as each other. Utilizing the distance between robots, the constant force can be added to the object. When lifting the object, there are pushing forces from both sides. It is a study of how to control the angle of the manipulator and the position of the robot when know the exact position of the object with the assuming that the robot keeps perfect balance. The result is also simulated by using MSRDS 3D simulation tool.	consensus dynamics;robot	Chang-Jun Woo;Jae-Hoon Jung;Jang-Myung Lee	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13966-1_42	mobile robot;robot control	Robotics	66.54822311931967	-22.016843553228078	21273

We view the nonlinear systems as composed of a finite number of “pieces,” which are interpolated by functions that depend on a possibly exogenous scheduling variable. We assume that each piece is in strict-feedback form, and show that the method yields stability of all signals in the closed-loop, as well as convergence of the state vector to a residual set around the equilibrium, whose size can be set by the choice of several design parameters. The class of systems considered here is a generalization of the class of strict-feedback systems traditionally considered in the backstepping literature. We also provide design guidelines based on bounds on the transient.	interpolation;nonlinear system;scheduling (computing)	Raúl Ordóñez;Kevin M. Passino	2001	IEEE Trans. Automat.

The process of equivalent cycle reconstruction using phase information of samples obviates the need for extra sampling hardware, usually associated with equivalent time sampling in digital oscilloscope applications. The reconstructed equivalent cycle measurements, obtained from low rate sampled data can be used in a state estimator, which uses high frequency within cycle SI gasoline engine model. Results of estimation based on engine data using an industry standard simulator confirm that it is possible to faithfully track states evolving under the within cycle dynamics, which are repetitive using data initially acquired at sampling rate well below Nyquist rates. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in the literature on estimation of the within cycle dynamics of automobile engines using engine measurements, acquired at a low frequency well below the Nyquist rates.	algorithm;angularjs;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;data point;esp game;enterprise test software;extended kalman filter;feasible region;in-phase and quadrature components;input/output;iteration;lms imagine.lab amesim;linear approximation;linear interpolation;maxima and minima;population;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;sampling (signal processing);steady state;technical standard;turing completeness;xfig	Somnath Sengupta;Siddhartha Mukhopadhyay;Alok Kanti Deb;Kallappa Pattada	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2014.2302241	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Visualization	71.57078261106454	-11.049158790853731	21441

With the help of the high-gain scaling approach and the idea of universal adaptive control, we explicitly construct an adaptive output compensator with a novel positive dynamic gain which compensates simultaneously the unknown delays and the output growth rate with unknown constant. Based on such output compensator, we reduce the conservatism of the restrictive conditions imposed on nonlinearities to generalise the existing results. By the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theorem, a delay-independent controller design scheme is proposed to guarantee that all the closed-loop signals are globally bounded while rendering the states of original system and the estimate states to globally asymptotically converge to zero. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to show the usefulness of the proposed de...	feedforward neural network;nonlinear system	Xianglei Jia;Shengyuan Xu;Qian Ma;Yongmin Li;Yuming Chu	2016	Int.

The socalled piecewise-constant TPs mean that the TPs are varying but invariant within an interval. The variation of the TPs considered here is subject to a typical class of slow switching signal, the average dwell time (ADT) switching, i.e., the number of switches in a finite interval is bounded and the average time between two consecutive switchings of TP matrices is not less than a constant. In this paper, the technique is illustrated and its use is exemplified with application to the popular class of multiplier–accelerator macroeconomic model. & 2012 The Franklin Institute.

Special attention focuses on effectively creasing chaos via simple systems, such as two-dimensional nonautonomous chaotic systems, three-dimensional autonomous chaotic systems, and lower-order switching chaotic systems. In particular, autonomous systems of three-dimensional ordinary differential equations with only one or two quadratic nonlinear terms receive wide attention, and many chaotic attractors have been found from these systems, including the familiar Lorenz, Chen and Rössler chaotic systems. Recently, we found a relatively simple threedimensional continuous autonomous chaotic system [Liu & Chen, 2003], which can display two arbitrarily close double-scroll attractors via both computer simulation and circuit experimentation. In this paper, we further study this chaotic system and investigate its dynamical behaviors.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);bifurcation theory;chaos theory;classical xy model;computer simulation;digraphs and trigraphs;dynamical system;entity–relationship model;fo (complexity);haplogroup cz (mtdna);level of detail;lyapunov fractal;microsoft dynamics ax;nl-complete;nonlinear system;numerical aperture;rössler attractor	Wenbo Liu;Guanrong Chen	2004	I.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are devel oped for all vibration modes to exhibit a node at the manipulator endpoint. A rigorous treatment of the relevant kinematics and dy namics shows that this property can be closely achieved for large tip/link mass ratio and sufficiently small rotor inertia. The major impacts of this result on feedforward/feedback controller design are uncovered. First, the nonlinear joint torque to end-effector motion dynamics become essentially equivalent to those of the rigid case. Second, an output involving the endpoint rates and elastic motions is shown to possess the passivity property for suitably defined inputs. This permits the design of simple controllers that furnish endpoint stabilization with simultaneous vibration suppression.

This paper introduces the characteristic model-based modeling method into ATC system and develops an all-coefficient adaptive control. Two characteristic models, namely speed characteristic model and position characteristic model, are established for analyzing both train traction and cruising dynamical characteristics. Control strategies are proposed using single speed feedback and speed/position bi-feedback. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, showing that control objective and required dynamic performance are well satisfied.

Although COG viscoelasticity is based on the well-known kinematic relationship between joint stiffness and end-effector stiffness, it provides practical advantages for both analysis and control of humanoid motions. There are two main contributions. The first is that the COG viscoelasticity allows us to analyze fall risk. In a previous study, the author proposed a fall detection method based on the maximal output admissible (MOA) set, which is computed from feedback gain of the inverted pendulum model. The COG viscoelasticity associates joint viscoelasticity with the feedback gain and allows us to compute the corresponding MOA set when an arbitrary joint viscoelasticity is given. The second contribution is that the COG viscoelasticity can be also utilized in motion control.

The resulting system provides a practical bridge between current state-of-the-art CAD/CAM and optimised CNC production. First, a novel and generic approach for extracting the in-cut geometry is implemented using ACIS® open architecture solid modeller. Next, an ANN (artificial neural network) model is designed and implemented for force prediction. Finally, a new technique for optimising the cutting parameters is applied and verified. The technique is based on reverse mapping of the ANN model for cutting force estimation. As such, the machining process is optimised directly using the learned neural network model by adjusting the net inputs to optimal values that minimise a specified objective function subject to cutting constraints. The optimisation results are used to update the initial CL (cutter location) data file to produce an optimum NC (numerically controlled) code. The proposed approach is demonstrated and verified through a case study to show its validity, practicality, and applicability.	artificial neural network;mathematical optimization;simulation;solid modeling	Hazim El-Mounayri;Haiyan Deng	2010	Int.

For the purpose of tracking trajectory, the error dynamics of a mobile robot are divided into a first-order subsystem and a second-order subsystem by using a cascaded control design. Firstly a global finite-time control law of the angular velocity is designed for the first-order system in order to stabilize the angle error of mobile robots. Subsequently, a finite-time sliding mode control law of forward velocity is synthesized, which guarantees the global stability of the second-order subsystem. Furthermore, the global uniform stability of the whole closed-loop system is analyzed by employing cascaded control theory, and some sufficient conditions are derived. Finally, the proposed control algorithm is applied to mobile robots, where simulation results demonstrate good convergence and performance.	algorithm;angularjs;control system;control theory;first-order predicate;mobile robot;multiple encryption;optimal control;rate of convergence;simulation;velocity (software development)	Yangming Zhang;Guorong Liu;Biao Luo	2014	Inf.

6fad91c8b4ab4fad9421f9225968464f3ea6ae0e	development of high accuracy of magnetic levitation transport system for oled evaporation process		Recently, in the manufacturing process of flat panel displays, mass production method of the in-line system has been emerged. In particular, the next generation OLED display manufacturing process, horizontal in-line evaporation process has been tried. It is important for the success of OLED inline evaporation process to develop a magnetic levitation transport system capable of transferring a carrier equipped with a mother glass with high accuracy without any physical contact along the rail under vacuum condition. In the case of existing wheel-based transfer system, it is not suitable for OLED evaporation process requiring high cleanliness. On the other hand, the magnetic levitation transport system has an advantage that it does not generate any dust and it is possible to achieve high-precision control because there are not non-linear factors such as friction force. In this paper, we introduce the high accuracy magnetic levitation transport system for OLED evaporation process currently under development and design of levitation controller using cascade control consisting of current control (PI) and airgap control (PID).	airgap (microelectronics);evaporation;flat panel display;linear function;memory controller;nonlinear system;oled;pid;two-phase locking	Chang-Wan Ha;Chang-Hyun Kim;Jaewon Lim	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014203	control theory;control engineering;pi;magnetic levitation;electromagnet;pid controller;levitation;engineering;evaporation;oled;electronic engineering	Robotics	74.93296731111374	-18.53379415908694	22224

We combine a nominal IMC scheme with an adaptive law in the presence of unknown and possibly time-varying system parameters due to changing operating conditions. The resulting adaptive control structure is used to address the Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) regulation problem which is known to be one of the main control challenges for internal combustion engines.	alternate frame rendering;approximation algorithm;broadcast delay;control flow;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;memory controller;system analysis	Nazli E.

The accidents may seriously threaten the driver’s safety. This paper proposes a steady-state margin (SSM) angle as a new instability threat indicator to analyse lateral stability of wheel loaders. Firstly, the structural characteristics and the rollover process of a wheel loader are presented, and the SSM angle is defined. Secondly, on the assumption that the tyres are rigid, the calculation process of the SSM angle is described in detail, then the SSM angle of the XG953 wheel loader is computed. A virtual prototyping simulation was performed under the environment of ADAMS. The maximum relative error between the theoretical calculation and simulated result was 4.55%, within the permissible speed range. When changing the tyre parameters to normal tyre parameters, the relative error became larger. Finally, an indirect method is proposed to deal with the influence of tyres on the SSM angle and reduce the relative error.	approximation error;centrifugal governor;control theory;cylinder seal;environment variable;instability;lateral computing;lateral thinking;matching (graph theory);on-board data handling;real-time clock;sensor;simulation;steady state;velocity (software development)	Qingyuan Zhu;Jian Yi;Haoyu Chen;Chenglu Wen;Huosheng Hu	2014	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2014.065337	simulation;stability;computer science;engineering;control theory;virtual reality;forensic engineering;statistics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.97735559153563	-16.50733451634436	22270

Parallel mechanisms are interesting alternative designs in this context but most of them are designed for threeor six-axis machining applications. In the last case, the position and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the shape of the workspace is complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translational motions and to add one leg to have one-dof rotational motion. The kinematics and singular configurations are studied as well as an optimization method. The three-degree-of-freedom mechanisms analyzed in this paper can be extended to four-axis machines by adding a fourth axis in series with the first two.	apache axis;mathematical optimization;optic axis of a crystal;optimal design;series and parallel circuits;workspace	Damien Chablat;Philippe Wenger;Félix Majou	2007	CoRR		control engineering;computer science;optimal design;control theory;mathematics;degrees of freedom;engineering drawing;statistics	Robotics	70.25044541152346	-21.235331912999666	22281

To solve the puzzle, we need to rearrange $$n^2 - 1$$ n 2 - 1 pebbles in the $$n \times n$$ n × n -sized square grid using one vacant position to achieve the goal configuration. An improvement to the existing polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and experimentally analyzed. The improved algorithm represents an attempt to move pebbles in a more efficient way compared to the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called snakes and moving them together as part of a snake formation. An experimental evaluation has shown that the snakeenhanced algorithm produces solutions which are 8–9 % shorter than the solutions generated by the original algorithm. Snake-like movement has also been integrated into the rule-based algorithms used in solving CPF problems sub-optimally, which is a closely related task. The task in CPF consists in moving a group of abstract robots on an undirected graph to specific vertices. The robots can move to unoccupied neighboring vertices; no more than one robot can be placed in each vertex. The ( $$n^2 - 1$$ n 2 - 1 )-puzzle is a special case of CPF where the underlying graph is a 4-connected grid and only one vertex is vacant. Two major rule-based algorithms for solving CPF problems were included in our study—BIBOX and PUSH-and-SWAP (PUSH-and-ROTATE). The use of snakes in the BIBOX algorithm led to consistent efficiency gains of around 30 % for the ( $$n^2 - 1$$ n 2 - 1 )-puzzle and up to 50 % in for CPF problems on biconnected graphs with various ear decompositions and multiple vacant vertices. For the PUSH-and-SWAP algorithm, the efficiency gain achieved from the use of snakes was around 5–8 %. However, the efficiency gain was unstable and hardly predictable for PUSH-and-SWAP.	algorithm;biconnected graph;coalition for patent fairness;compare-and-swap;connectivity (graph theory);control theory;directed graph;experiment;graph (discrete mathematics);logic programming;robot;square tiling;time complexity;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Pavel Surynek;Petr Michalík	2016	Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems	10.1007/s10458-016-9343-7	mathematical optimization;simulation;artificial intelligence	Robotics	55.0457193221712	-22.14413816748104	22398

In this paper a direct adaptive control strategy for WECS control is proposed. It is based on the combination of two control actions: a radial basis zfunction network-based adaptive controller, which drives the tracking error to zero with user specified dynamics, and a supervisory controller, based on crude bounds of the system's nonlinearities. The supervisory controller fires when the finite neural-network approximation properties cannot be guaranteed. The form of the supervisor control and the adaptation law for the neural controller are derived from a Lyapunov analysis of stability. The results are applied to a typical turbine/generator pair, showing the feasibility of the proposed solution.	acclimatization;approximation;arabic numeral 0;artificial neural network;control theory;controllers;intrinsic drive;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;radial (radio);radial basis function	Miguel Angel Mayosky;Gustavo I.

PMSM is a multivariable nonlinear system with strong interaxis couplings. A computed torque method structure is applied to PMSM. There are such uncertainties as estimated errors of the model and external perturbations, which may influence the precision of the control system. A back-propagation algorithm with additional momentum term and self-adaptive learning rate applied to feed-forward neural network can approach nonlinear functions with a learning rate adjusted online, which helps to improve training speed. In this paper, an NNI is applied to identify the uncertainties online. An adaptive-neuro-fuzzy-inference-system-based FC is applied, which has self-adaptive ability and strong robustness. Simulation results preliminarily validate that the algorithm proposed in this paper can eliminate the influences of interaxis nonlinear couplings effectively to actualize dynamic decoupling control. Furthermore, the static and dynamic performances of the control system have been improved greatly with strong robustness to uncertainties. A hypothetical microprocessor system is proposed, and simple experiments of spinning operation are carried out as a foundation for further study.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;control system;coupling (computer programming);experiment;feedforward neural network;identifier;mathematical model;microprocessor;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;performance;perturbation theory;simulation;software propagation	Changliang Xia;Chen Guo;Tingna Shi	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2036030	control engineering;feedforward neural network;nonlinear system;computer science;backpropagation;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.92913107175571	-9.78677749349887	22503

In mechanical systems, difficulty of the exact determination of friction force parameters adversely affects the accuracy of the models. In this study, Karnopp friction model is chosen in order to model the friction parameters of the bob of a pendulum. The parameters are determined by sectioning the speed regions and then using “Response Surface Methodology” (RSM) by sectioning the speed regions. Proposed method has produced accurate yet simple model of the friction parameters. & 2014 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An adaptive critic neuro-control design has been implemented that learns in real-time how to back up a trailer truck along a fixed straight line trajectory. The truck backer-upper experiment is a standard performance measure in the neural network literature, but previously the training of the controllers was done off-line.

A sled test was conducted at 40 kmph with a lap-shoulder-belted Hybrid III 50th percentile male dummy to simulate a frontal crash. A multi-body model of the sled test was developed based on the actual situation and verified by test data including the seat belt loads, head and chest injury responses of the test dummy and motion postures of the dummy. An impact pulse with a 0.2-second-long constant deceleration of 0.8 g ahead of crash was loaded on the verification model to simulate the real deceleration and the crash process with precrash braking maneuvers. The protection performance of a 3-point seat belt, a seat belt with pyrotechnic pretensioner and a motorized seat belt was compared, and the motorized seat belt had the best protection effect. Different pretensioning control factors, such as pretensioning time and pretensioning force, had remarkable effects on injury responses of the dummy. This method could also be used to develop advanced occupant restraint systems coupled with precrash systems to integrate vehicle active safety and passive safety.	belt machine;crash (computing);dummy variable (statistics);safety engineering;simulation;test data	Xiao Luo;Wenjing Du;Jinhuan Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2015.7225794	simulation;engineering;automotive engineering;forensic engineering	Embedded	73.639533414042	-17.22282259794445	22597

First, using the given distribution of frictional forces between the object and the floor, we find out a particular point, named pseudo center, on which the motion of the pushed object cart be approximates by the motion of wheeled mobile robot on its center. Then, a control rule of the pushing operation is derived by applying a tracking control rule for a nonholonomic mobile robot at the pseudo center. This method makes it possible for the robot to perform the tracking control in the pushing operation. A simulation result shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Considering the vehicle lateral velocity is usually hard to measure with low cost sensors, a robust H∞ static output-feedback controller based on a mixed genetic algorithms (GA)/linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is proposed to realize the path following without the information of the lateral velocity. The proposed controller is robust to the external disturbances and the uncertainties of the vehicle/environment parameters/states, including the tire cornering stiffness, vehicle longitudinal velocity, yaw rate and road curvature.

Firstly, a new mathematical expression of the generic memductance (memristance) is proposed according to the feature of the memristor and the general current-voltage characteristic and a new class of neural networks is designed. Next, a new concept of stability (fixed deviation stability) is proposed in order to describe veritably the stability characteristics of the discontinuous system and the sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the global uniform asymptotic fixed deviation stability and stability of the new system.

c1e0d4adeda1176c80ba3ea1064a7fb729df9ee0	a type-2 fuzzy logic controller design for buck and boost dc-dc converters		Conventional (type-1) fuzzy logic controllers have been commonly used in various power converter applications. Generally, in these controllers, the experience and knowledge of human experts are needed to decide parameters associated with the rule base and membership functions. The rule base and the membership function parameters may often mean different things to different experts. This may cause rule uncertainty problems. Consequently, the performance of the controlled system, which is controlled with type-1 fuzzy logic controller, is undesirably affected. In this study, a type-2 fuzzy logic controller is proposed for the control of buck and boost DC–DC converters. To examine and analysis the effects of the proposed controller on the system performance, both converters are also controlled using the PI controller and conventional fuzzy logic controller. The settling time, the overshoot, the steady state error and the transient response of the converters under the load and input voltage changes are used as the performance criteria for the evaluation of the controller performance. Simulation results show that buck and boost converters controlled by type-2 fuzzy logic controller have better performance than the buck and boost converters controlled by type-1 fuzzy logic controller and PI controller.	boost converter;buck converter;dc-to-dc converter;electric power conversion;fuzzy logic;overshoot (signal);performance;power inverter;rule-based system;settling time;simulation;steady state	Ismail Atacak;Ömer Faruk Bay	2012	J.

In this paper, a nonlinear, control-oriented model is proposed for IPMC actuators. A key component in the proposed model is the nonlinear capacitance of IPMC. A nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), which can capture the fundamental physics in IPMC, is fully considered in the derivation of nonlinear capacitance. A systems perspective is taken to get the nonlinear mapping from the voltage to the induced charge by analytically solving the nonlinear PDE at the steady state when a step voltage is applied. The nonlinear capacitance is incorporated into the circuit model, which includes additionally the pseudocapacitance due to the electrochemical adsorption process, the ion diffusion resistance, and the nonlinear DC resistance of the polymer, to capture electrical dynamics of IPMC. With electromechanical coupling, the curvature output is derived based on the circuit model. The proposed model is formulated in the state space, which will be the starting point for nonlinear controller design. Experimental verification shows that the proposed model can capture the major nonlinearities in the electrical response of IPMC.	biomimetics;coupling (computer programming);electroactive polymers;experiment;gnu nano;ionic;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polymer;robot;state space;steady state;system analysis;thickness (graph theory)	Zheng Chen;Dawn R.

This type of system encompasses many slowly-varying adaptation schemes, such as extremum-seeking, acting on hybrid systems, such as urban traffic control and switching control. Conditions are given for semi-global practical asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system when the dynamics of the reduced system are also semi-globally practically asymptotically stable. This extends previous results which require global asymptotic stability of the reduced system.

In this paper, we aim to solve the model-free optimal tracking control problem of nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems. A critic-only Q-learning (CoQL) method is developed, which learns the optimal tracking control from real system data, and thus avoids solving the tracking Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. First, the Q-learning algorithm is proposed based on the augmented system, and its convergence is established. Using only one neural network for approximating the Q-function, the CoQL method is developed to implement the Q-learning algorithm. Furthermore, the convergence of the CoQL method is proved with the consideration of neural network approximation error. With the convergent Q-function obtained from the CoQL method, the adaptive optimal tracking control is designed based on the gradient descent scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed CoQL method is demonstrated through simulation studies. The developed CoQL method learns with off-policy data and implements with a critic-only structure, thus it is easy to realize and overcome the inadequate exploration problem.	algorithm;apply;approximation error;artificial neural network;bellman equation;biological neural networks;control theory;converge;exploration problem;gradient descent;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;horner's method;jacobi method;mean squared error;nonlinear system;q-learning;simulation	Biao Luo;Derong Liu;Tingwen Huang;Ding Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2585520	linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;optimal control;trajectory;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	61.894660705265636	-3.161613518314247	22881

This generation process of slow firing is completely different from that of the well-known potassium A-current in that the steady-state current-voltage relation of the neuronal model is monotonic rather than the N-shaped one of the A-current. In this paper, we extend the previous results and show that the very slow spiking generically appears in both the three-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley equations and the three dimensional Bonhoeffer-van der Pol (or FitzHugh-Nagumo) equations. The generation of repetitive discharges or the destabilization of the unique equilibrium point (resting potential) is a simple Hopf bifurcation. We also show that the generation of slow spiking does not depend on the stability of the Hopf bifurcation: supercritical or subcritical. The dynamics of slow spiking is investigated in detail and we demonstrate that the phenomenology of slow spiking can be categorized into two types according to the type of the corresponding bifurcation of a fast subsystem: Hopf or saddle-node bifurcation.	anatomic bifurcation;bifurcation theory;body fluid discharge;categorization;digital object identifier;fitzhugh–nagumo model;hodgkin–huxley model;hopf bifurcation;huxley: the dystopia;neuron;node - plant part;potassium;rest;steady state;whole earth 'lectronic link	Shinji Doi;Sadatoshi Kumagai	2005	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-005-2895-1	singular perturbation;homoclinic orbit;equilibrium point;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;neuroscience;potassium;period-doubling bifurcation;biological applications of bifurcation theory;control theory;mathematics;saddle-node bifurcation;steady state;hopf bifurcation;bifurcation diagram	ML	78.65287825678546	3.214597473954696	22940

In creating the best robot design, the statical balancing plays a vital role because it reduces the required motor power. To get a simple and more-effective control system, elimination or significant reduction of the gravity load at a powered joint is an important one. With utilization of these objectives an optimization problem is formulated. The average force on the gripper in the working area is taken as an objective function. The design variables are lengths of the links, angles between them and stiffness of springs. This paper describes the use of conventional and evolutionary optimization techniques such as Newton’s method (NM), conjugate gradient method (CGM), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and differential evolution (DE) to solve the above problem. An industrial robot with 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) (APR 20) is considered as a numerical example. The robot has a spring balancing system that has to be optimized. The existing optimization model is improved by adding two new variables. Also, a comprehensive user-friendly general-purpose software package has been developed using VC++ to obtain the optimal parameters using the proposed DE algorithm. The methods used in this article can be applied to find out solutions for a wide range of similar problems without further simplifications. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

08fa8d418ecb817c6cd6ff2a60598f556f0a2745	a two-step distribution system state estimator with grid constraints and mixed measurements		In this paper we consider the problem of State Estimation (SE) in large-scale, 3-phase coupled, unbalanced distribution systems. More specifically, we address the problem of including mixed real-time measurements, synchronized and unsynchronized, from phasor measurement units and smart meters, into existing SE solutions. We propose a computationally efficient two-step method to update a prior solution using the measurements, while taking into account physical constraints caused by zero-injection buses. We test the method on a benchmark test feeder and show the effectiveness of the approach.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;dimensionality reduction;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;online algorithm;online and offline;phasor;power management unit;real-time clock;real-time computing;smart meter;unbalanced circuit;unicode	Miguel Picallo Cruz;Adolfo Anta;Ara Panosyan;Bart De Schutter	2018	2018 Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC)		mathematical optimization	EDA	54.071987510936616	-0.3988012897666837	22960

However, there are two major defects that need to be tackled when considering any practical utilization. The first issue is off-grid problem caused by the basis mismatch between arbitrary located unknowns and the pre-specified dictionary, which would make conventional CS reconstruction methods degrade considerably. The second important issue is the urgent demand for low-complexity algorithms, especially when faced with the requirement of real-time implementation. In this paper, to deal with these two problems, we have presented three fast and accurate sparse reconstruction algorithms, termed as HR-DCD, Hlog-DCD and Hlp-DCD, which are based on homotopy, dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) iterations and non-convex regularizations, by combining with the grid refinement technique. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and related analysis.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;calcium-sensing receptor;central processing unit;channel (communications);channel state information;communications media;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;continuous signal;coordinate descent;dcd gene;detection theory;dictionary [publication type];experiment;graphics processing unit;iteration;iterative reconstruction;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;multi-core processor;numerous;penalty method;performance;real-time clock;real-time transcription;refinement (computing);regular expression;signal reconstruction;solver;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;heart rate	Tianyun Wang;Xinfei Lu;Xiaofei Yu;Zhendong Xi;Weidong Chen	2014		10.3390/s140405929	telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;data mining;compressed sensing;operations research;statistics	AI	79.27666722603811	-5.48495522000716	23036

Interesting results can be found for nonlinearities that are monotone and bounded by odd nonlinearities. We focus on the special case for asymmetric saturation and include loop transformations in the analysis. There are important consequences for systems with non-zero steady state exogenous signals. We illustrate with an example that demonstrates what is, in effect, a local stability result.	loop invariant;nonlinear system;rendering (computer graphics);steady state;time-invariant system;monotone	William P.

The collision free path planning for three-joint robotic arm consists of three parts: partition of C-space, construction of CN and search for a path in CN. We mainly solved the problems of partitioning the C-space and judging the connectivity between connected blocks, etc. For the motion planning of a robotic arm with a gripper, we developed the concepts of global planning and local planning, and discussed the basic factors for constructing the planning system. In the paper, some evaluation and analysis of the complexity and reliability of the algorithm are given, together with some ideas to improve the efficiency and increase the reliability.

In order to consider the impact of different aging states in SOC estimation, the decay mode of battery power was identified by a NARX neural network with dynamic feedback. Then, the Coulomb counting method was utilized as the state function, and the neural network was used in the measurement function. Moreover, the KF algorithm was employed to reduce the abrupt estimation error of NARX neural network. Finally, the proposed method was verified in steady and dynamic conditions. The experimental results show that the joint algorithm can effectively improve the estimation accuracy compared with a single neural network.	algorithm;artificial neural network;kalman filter;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model;state of charge	Kun Chen;Yuehua Lai;Zhinong Jiang;Jinjie Zhang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	10.1109/ICPHM.2018.8448734	battery (electricity);state of charge;kalman filter;artificial neural network;state function;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model;coulomb;control theory;lithium-ion battery;computer science	Robotics	55.12858482759847	-1.9025968532177153	23354

We show that in each case, these formulations are effectively ill-posed. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the first formulation, the system's stabilizability degrades as the size of the platoon increases, and that the system loses stabilizability in the limit of an infinite number of vehicles. We show that in the LQR formulation of Melzer and Kuo, the performance index is not detectable, leading to nonstabilizing optimal feedbacks. Effectively, these closed-loop systems do not have a uniform bound on the time constants of all vehicles. For the case of infinite platoons, these difficulties are easily exhibited using the theory of spatially invariant systems. We argue that the infinite case is a useful paradigm to understand large platoons. To this end, we illustrate how stabilizability and detectability degrade as functions of a finite platoon size, implying that the infinite case is an idealized limit of the large, but finite case. Finally, we show how to pose H/sub 2/ and H/sub /spl infin// versions of these problems where the detectability and stabilizability issues are easily seen, and suggest a well-posed alternative formulation based on penalizing absolute positions errors in addition to relative ones.	platoon (automobile);programming paradigm;well-posed problem	Mihailo R.

In this study, the model reference tracking control problem of nonlinear interconnected systems is studied via decentralized fuzzy control method. First, the nonlinear interconnected system is represented by an equivalent Takagi–Sugeno type fuzzy model. A state feedback decentralized fuzzy control scheme is developed to override the external disturbances such that the model reference tracking performance is achieved. Furthermore, the stability of the nonlinear interconnected systems is also guaranteed. If states are not all available, a decentralized fuzzy observer is proposed to estimate the states of each subsystem for decentralized control. Consequently, a fuzzy observer-based state feedback decentralized fuzzy controller is proposed to solve the tracking control design problem for nonlinear interconnected systems. The problem of decentralized fuzzy tracking control design for nonlinear interconnected systems is characterized in terms of solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP). The EVP can be solved very efficiently using convex optimization techniques. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the tracking performance of the proposed methods.	control theory;convex optimization;distributed control system;fuzzy control system;interaction;mathematical optimization;nx bit;nonlinear system;simulation	Chung-Shi Tseng;Bor-Sen Chen	2001	IEEE Trans.

78cf2855785220179dc53c35b50edd589c88be39	a linear- and linear-matrix-inequality-constrained extended kalman filter		This study proposes a method for state estimation of nonlinear systems that incorporates linear- and linear-matrix-inequalities as constraints on the state estimate. Rewriting the standard maximum likelihood objective function used to derive the Kalman filter allows the Kalman gain to be found by solving a constrained optimization problem with a linear objective function subject to a linear-matrix-inequality constraint. In this formulation, additional state-estimate constraints are incorporated into the optimization problem as linear- and linear-matrix-inequality constraints. This methodology is applied in the multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) framework for three-dimensional position and attitude estimation, and is validated on a simulation of a mobile robot translating and rotating in a constrained domain space. Results are presented and compared to those for the unconstrained MEKF.	constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);convex optimization;extended kalman filter;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;nonlinear system;optimization problem;rewriting;simulation;social inequality	Robin Aucoin;Stephen Alexander Chee;James Richard Forbes	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431673	computer science;control theory;multiplicative function;linear matrix inequality;kalman filter;constrained optimization;extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;rewriting;optimization problem	Robotics	58.06800594768531	2.6840689952052426	23434

418ad39c1d4b6979c273a1926c3d47fb57454633	helical polynomial curves interpolating g1 data with prescribed axes and pitch angles		Abstract A helical curve, or curve of constant slope, offers a natural flight path for an aerial vehicle with a limited climb rate to achieve an increase in altitude between prescribed initial and final states. Every polynomial helical curve is a spatial Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve, and the distinctive features of the PH curves have attracted growing interest in their use for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning. This study describes an exact algorithm for constructing helical PH paths, corresponding to a constant climb rate at a given speed, between initial and final positions and motion directions. The algorithm bypasses the more sophisticated algebraic representations of spatial PH curves, and instead employs a simple “lifting” scheme to generate helical PH paths from planar PH curves constructed using the complex representation. In this context, a novel scheme to construct planar quintic PH curves that interpolate given end points and tangents, with exactly prescribed arc lengths, plays a key role. It is also shown that these helical paths admit simple closed-form rotation-minimizing adapted frames. The algorithm is simple, efficient, and robust, and can accommodate helical axes of arbitrary orientation through simple rotation transformations. Its implementation is illustrated by several computed examples.	interpolation;polynomial	Rida T.

We propose the necessary conditions for stable dynamic walking on irregular terrain in general, and we design the mechanical system and the neural system by comparing biological concepts with those necessary conditions described in physical terms. A PD controller at the joints can construct the virtual spring–damper system as the visco-elasticity model of a muscle. The neural system model consists of a central pattern generator (CPG) and reflexes. A CPG receives sensory input and changes the period of its own active phase. The desired angle and P-gain of each joint in the virtual spring– damper system is switched based on the phase signal of the CPG. CPGs, the motion of the virtual spring–damper system of each leg and the rolling motion of the body are mutually entrained through the rolling motion feedback to CPGs, and can generate adaptive walking. We report on our experimental results of dynamic walking on terrains of medium degrees of irregularity in order to verify the effectiveness of the designed neuro-mechanical system. We point out the trade-off problem between the stability and the energy consumption in determining the cyclic period of walking on irregular terrain, and we show one example to solve this problem.

d13c801c337848eeea8d7fa99ad0e766f3d4261a	fuzzy observer-based control for maximum power-point tracking of a photovoltaic system		ABSTRACTThis paper presents a novel fuzzy control design method for maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) via a Takagi and Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model-based approach. A knowledge-dynamic model of the PV system is first developed leading to a TS representation by a simple convex polytopic transformation. Then, based on this exact fuzzy representation, a H∞ observer-based fuzzy controller is proposed to achieve MPPT even when we consider varying climatic conditions. A specified TS reference model is designed to generate the optimum trajectory which must be tracked to ensure maximum power operation. The controller and observer gains are obtained in a one-step procedure by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The proposed method has been compared with some classical MPPT techniques taking into account convergence speed and tracking accuracy. Finally, various simulation and experimental tests have been carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy MPPT strategy.	maximum power transfer theorem	Moez Allouche;Karim Dahech;Mohamed Chaabane;Driss Mehdi	2018	Int.

In order to ensure tracking accuracy of astronomical observations, firstly the elasticity model of the cable-driven Stewart manipulator is deduced to analyze the terminal error caused by the gravity torque. Newton-Raphson method is adopted to acquire the terminal error range and propose compensation strategy. Then error model considering structural deformation is formulated and the terminal accuracy is analyzed with an improved set theory based method. Finally the sensitivity analysis is also carried out and accuracy synthesis is implemented. Error modeling and analysis method proposed for the support robot in this paper can also be used to other complex hybrid robots with either large dimension or heavy duty.	elasticity (data store);kicked rotator;newton's method;robot;set theory;top-down and bottom-up design;workspace	Xiaoming Chai;Xiaoqiang Tang;Lewei Tang;Qiujian Lu	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225144	control engineering;electronic engineering;radio telescope;tunable metamaterials;engineering;control theory;accuracy and precision;tracking;newton's method;radio receiver;sensitivity analysis;set theory	Robotics	72.54652160268714	-14.401361404493754	23681

T-S fuzzy model was used to solve multi objective control and nonlinear control problems in elevator motion control system. First, the generalized model of system was built, and then system global state controller was designed by parallel-distributed compensation (PDC) method. Second, state feedback robust controller was gained based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) method. The simpleness and effectiveness of the controller were showed by the simulation, and the robustness was satisfied for the system. Multiobjective control and nonlinear control problems have been solved effectively.	fuzzy control system;global serializability;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;peripheral dma controller;robust control;simulation;social inequality	Dongmei Yu;Qing Hu;Yonghong Mu	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2009.501	mathematical optimization;elevator;control theory;fuzzy control system	Robotics	63.6979930622608	-5.935416687887318	23683

The use of an error feedback is essential for the realization of both properties. In adaptive control, error feedback is used to update adaptive parameters in an effort to accomplish learning and tracking. In network control, error feedback is used to achieve consensus. The two types of error feedback are seldom studied in concert without a pinning trajectory. This paper explores the implications of concomitantly achieving consensus and learning in adaptive and networked systems. Conditions under which synchronous inputs can enhance adaptation and learning are analyzed. The tradeoff between synchronization and learning is explored both in the context of two interacting dynamical systems and a network of dynamical systems interacting over a graph.	consensus (computer science);control theory;dynamical system;http public key pinning;interaction;reference model	Travis E.

Furthermore models of neural networks that can deal with quaternion numbers, which is the extension of complex numbers, have also been proposed. However they are all multilayer quaternion neural networks. This paper proposes models of fully connected recurrent quaternion neural networks, Hopfield-type quaternion neural networks. Since quaternion numbers are non-commutative on multiplication, some different models can be considered. We investigate dynamics of these proposed models from the point of view of the existence of an energy function and derive their conditions for existence.	appendix;artificial neural network;coefficient;enzyme unit;hopfield network;information processing;mathematical optimization;neural network simulation;physical quantity to physical quantity ratio data type;poly da-dt;rose cluster 4;recurrent neural network;unit of measure	Mitsuo Yoshida;Yasuaki Kuroe;Takehiro Mori	2005	International journal of neural systems	10.1142/S012906570500013X	discrete mathematics;types of artificial neural networks;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;artificial neural network;quaternion	ML	75.04114388423812	3.8554184700124345	23757

Robustness is formulated as a minimax game, in which the control seeks to minimize the pay-off over the admissible controls while the measure aims at maximizing the pay-off over the total variational distance uncertainty constraint between the uncertain and nominal measures. This paper is a continuation of the abstract results in [1], where existence of the maximizing measure over the total variational distance constraint is established, while the maximizing payoff is shown to be equivalent to an optimization of a payoff which is a linear combination of L1 and L∞ norms. The maximizing measure is constructed from a convex combination of a sequence of tilted measures and the nominal measure. Here emphasis is geared towards the application of the abstract results to uncertain continuous-time controlled stochastic differential equations, in which the control seeks to minimize the pay-off while the measure seeks to maximize it over the total variational distance constraint. The maximization over the total variational distance constraint is resolved resulting in an equivalent pay-off which is a non-linear functional of the nominal measure of non-standard form. The minimization over the admissible controls of the non-linear functional is addressed by deriving a HJB inequality and viscosity subsolution. Throughout the paper the formulation and conclusions are related to previous work found in the literature.	calculus of variations;continuation;expectation–maximization algorithm;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;mathematical optimization;maximising measure;minimax;nonlinear system;optimal control;social inequality;variational principle	Farzad Rezaei;Charalambos D.

A self-tuning Neuro-PID controller is developed for speed control. The PID gains are tuned automatically by the neural network in an on-line way. In recent years, the researches on the control of electrical machines based on ANN are increased. ANN’s, developed controller in this work, offer inherent advantages over conventional PID controller for PMSM , namely: Reduction of the effects of motor parameter variations, improvement of controller time response and improvement of drive robustness. The PMSM drive system was simulated by using MATLAB 5.0/Simulink software package. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the conventional PID methods. At the result, the control based on self-tuning Neuro-PID control has better performance than the conventional PID controller.	artificial neural network;control theory;matlab;online and offline;pid;process identifier;self-tuning	Mehmet Zeki Bilgin;Bekir Çakir	2006		10.1007/11881070_58	pid controller;open-loop controller;controller;computer science;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	72.50207078572824	-7.155237366528615	23825

It has complex control target with less manipulate variables than controlled variables, and the boundary conditions vary frequently and severely during operation. Most rotary kilns are still under manual control such that the burning status cannot be maintained stable, the product quality is hard to be kept consistent and energy consumption remains at high level. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a pattern-based hybrid intelligent control strategy. Because of the vital importance of the burning zone temperature, several patterns representing kiln operation conditions are distinguished through burning zone temperature pattern recognition. A MIMO supervisory fuzzy controller is designed to address qualitative decoupling among controlled variables in the normal regulation phase, and a human mimic controller is employed to avoid overshoot when process large disturbance happens in the abnormal regulation phase. The two controllers are switched by the pattern recognition model, with their parameters tuned also by the pattern recognition model. This pattern-based hybrid intelligent control approach has been implemented in DCS and successfully applied in an alumina rotary kiln. Satisfactory results have shown that the adaptability and performances of the control system have been improved effectively, and remarkable benefit has been obtained.	control system;control theory;coupling (computer programming);graphics device interface;high-level programming language;intelligent control;mimo;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);pattern recognition;performance;rotary woofer	Xiaojie Zhou;Tianyou Chai	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2007.4389201	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	60.94722436689406	-9.850537120620876	24060

The non-linear aircraft dynamics are formulated as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system with external parameter-dependent disturbance, which arisen from the equilibrating between gravity force and nozzles thrust. The disturbance is dependent on the system varying parameter, roll angle, and a constant parameter denoting the normalized gravity force. The controllers are designed in terms of mixed optimization of H1 performance for disturbance attenuation and relative stability for tracking position command in pitch-yaw plane. The characteristics of the parameter-dependent disturbance are described by an equality condition with a defined annihilation matrix. By exploring the parameter-dependence condition on disturbance into the controller design algorithms based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), it is showed that a better performance can be achieved than simply considering it as an external disturbance. The design results are demonstrated by time response simulations. r 2008 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Building upon the results of our recent work in [1], a provably stable adaptive controller is proposed for variable delay teleoperation. The controller utilizes a model of the system dynamics and the time delay within a predictive control framework to improve the response transparency. It can also adapt to uncertainties in the user and environment dynamics. The performance objectives are delay-free position tracking between the master and slave and the establishment of a virtual mass-damper tool impedance between the user and environment. Delay reduction is accomplished based on a state observer and estimates of the system parameters. Using the delay reduced dynamics, an adaptive output regulation problem is formulated and solved. A Lypunov-based analysis of the performance and stability of the resulting system is presented. Simulation results with a single-axis teleoperation setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	apache axis;bilateral filter;bilateral sound;broadcast delay;characteristic impedance;reduced dynamics;simulation;system dynamics	Ali Shahdi;Shahin Sirouspour	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354426	control engineering;real-time computing;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control theory;model predictive control	Robotics	68.59131369699608	-12.98969849247613	24103

Precisely, uncertainty and disturbance estimation-based control design is developed for the addressed systems under uncertain environment. By exploiting the Lyapunov technique and Wirtinger-based integral inequalities, a sufficient condition is derived for ensuring the robust trajectory tracking performance. Precisely, an explicit form of the gain matrix to enhance the robustness of the controller is determined by solving the developed linear matrix inequalities.

The constraints of tangling can be linearized at every frame of motion synthesis, and can be used together with constraints such as defined by the Zero Moment Point, Center of Mass, inverse kinematics and angular momentum for computing the postures by a linear programming procedure. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using the simulator for the Nao humanoid robot. We show that this approach enables us to synthesize complex motion, such as tangling, very efficiently.	angularjs;humanoid robot;interaction;inverse kinematics;linear programming;nao (robot);simulation;zero moment point	Edmond S.

An observer-based FTC framework is proposed for the hybrid system with uncontrollable state-dependent switching and without full continuous state measurements. Two kinds of faults are considered: continuous faults that affect each mode and discrete faults that affect the mode transition. Sufficient conditions are given such that the hybrid system can be stabilised in the sense of LaSalle invariance principle. Simulation results of example of CPU processing control show the efficiency of the proposed method.	hybrid system	Hao Yang;Vincent Cocquempot;Zehui Mao	2009	Int. J.

In the proposed control scheme, the dynamic changes and disturbances induced by actuator failures are detected and isolated by means of radial basis function neural networks, which also compensate system uncertainties that arise from the mismatch between nominal model and real plant. In the presence of unknown actuation functions, the effectiveness of the control scheme is guaranteed by imposing a structural condition on the actuation matrix. Moreover, the singularity problem that arises from the approximation of unknown actuation functions is circumvented, and thus the use parameter projection is avoided. In this work, the nominal plant is transformed into a suitable form via diffeomorphism. Dynamic surface control design technique is used to develop the control laws. The closed-loop signals are proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded through Lyapunov approach, and the output tracking error is shown to be bounded within a residual set which can be made arbitrarily small by appropriately tuning the controller parameters. Finally, the proposed adaptive control scheme effectiveness is verified by simulation of the longitudinal dynamics of a twin otter aircraft undergoing actuator failures.	mimo;nonlinear system	S.

A deadbeat state observer is used to provide the estimates of the derivatives with a given fixed-time convergence. The estimation bias caused by modelling error is characterised herein as well as the ISS property of the estimation error with respect to the measurement perturbation. A number of numerical examples are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed differentiator also including comparisons with some existing methods.	kernel (operating system);numerical analysis;numerical differentiation	Peng Li;Gilberto Pin;Giuseppe Fedele;Thomas Parisini	2018	Int.

This paper proposes a criterion for the determination of optimal grip points to secure contact stability. The criterion is generally valid, that is, it applies to grasps with any number of contact points on objects having a generic shape (polygonal or curved), and does not require that the external force acting on the object be known. A grasp-quality index, fmin, obtained by minimizing the friction coefficient needed to ensure contact stability in the presence of a generic disturbing external action, has been introduced. The criterion leads to the formulation of an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints that is easy to implement. Finally, some examples are provided which compare the results reported in the literature with the results obtained by applying the criterion proposed in this paper.	amax;algorithm;authorization;coefficient;eisenstein's criterion;mathematical optimization;matthews correlation coefficient;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;robot end effector	Giacomo Mantriota	1999	I.

Biological data suggest that legs regulate energy production and removal via muscle activation, and therefore the conservative SLIP model cannot fully explain the robustness of many legged animals during running and hopping gaits. In this work we consider the active SLIP model, an energetically non-conservative version of the SLIP model with series actuation. In particular, we propose a strategy for actuator displacement to add/remove energy from the system, and to analytically solve part of its dynamics. Additionally, we develop a control strategy for online actuator displacement to drive the system to a desired state, even in the presence of terrain perturbation.	control theory;displacement mapping;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;inverted pendulum;terrain rendering	Giulia Piovan;Katie Byl	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2013.6631390	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.88566761741482	-18.715294156454544	24338

Further, the AQ operator is differentiable. We also show that the new AQ operator stabilizes the variance of the intermediate quantities in the tree.	control theory;difference quotient;genetic programming;instability;interval arithmetic;oracle advanced queuing;round-off error	Ji Ni;Russ H.

Therefore this paper proposes a new driving assistant structure, based on a virtual potential fields approach. By that mean, driver's state and intention are estimated through an analysis of facial features, and collision free trajectory detections become possible. This driving assistant is implemented in an electric vehicle using a Steer by Wire system and the validity of the proposal is verified through simulation.	automobiles;device driver;force field (chemistry);mathematical model;sensor;simulation;vector field histogram	Baptiste Rouzier;Toshiyuki Murakami	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2014.6823307	embedded system;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	62.36767020007882	-15.924044222872011	24568

Using mathematical analysis of the proportional derivative (PD) and fuzzy logic controller, this study proposed a design method of a fuzzy logic controller that has the same characteristics as the PD controller in the beginning. Then a design method of a fuzzy logic controller was proposed that has superior performance to the PD controller. This fuzzy logic controller was designed by changing the envelope of the input of the of the fuzzy logic controller to nonlinear, because the fuzzy logic controller has more degree of freedom to select the control gain than the PD controller. By designing the fuzzy logic controller using the proposed method, it simplified the design of fuzzy logic controller, and it simplified the comparison of these two controllers.

In the multiple Lyapunov functions (MLF) framework with ℋ-/ℋ∞ performance index, a robust fault detection filter (RFDF) is designed in order to generate a residual signal which is sensitive to the faults and robust against the disturbances. The design method is formulated to be solved by linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. The main contribution in this paper is to improve the performance of the FD for switched systems by considering switch detection logics. The design of the RFDF is based on the local performance index of each subsystem. An adaptive threshold is set based on both, the bounds of disturbances and the individual performance index for each subsystem.	benchmark (computing);computation;fault detection and isolation;filter design;global serializability;lateral thinking;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;online and offline;social inequality	Ali Abdo;Steven X.

And then the optimal closed-loop control, the minimum cost function and the optimal estimator are offered by solving a set of difference Riccati equations.

5ed680291fec34b44c96bd9d9121becb6db7faec	static output feedback stabilization of positive polynomial fuzzy systems		This paper deals with the static output feedback stabilization of positive polynomial fuzzy-model-based control systems. The positive polynomial fuzzy model does not need to share the same premise membership functions with the static output feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. Unlike the state feedback control case, the static output feedback control usually leads to nonconvex stability conditions. To circumvent the problem, an approach is employed to transform the nonconvex stability conditions into convex ones by introducing a nonsingular transformation matrix. Initially, the conditions guaranteeing the resultant closed-loop systems to be positive and asymptotically stable are obtained. Moreover, the divisional approximated membership functions that carry the local information of the membership functions are employed to facilitate the stability analysis and controller synthesis. The relaxed stability conditions in terms of sum of squares are obtained based on Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation example is given to testify the validity of the analysis result.

The oscillator tunes itself to the natural dynamics of the pendulum system so as to increase the swing amplitude, and finally the pendulum system enters the phase of giant swing motion. A most remarkable result is that transition from simple swing to giant swing is attained without changing the values of the parameters of the neural oscillator at all.	crystal oscillator;double pendulum;limit cycle;robot	Kiyotoshi Matsuoka;Norifumi Ohyama;Atsushi Watanabe;Masataka Ooshima	2005		10.1007/11539117_41	pendulum;computer science;artificial intelligence;underactuation;dynamical system;control theory;robotics;oscillation;parametric oscillator;artificial neural network	Robotics	66.29471775379614	-16.578101469796668	24744

These measurements are distributed among the observers by an allocation algorithm which guarantees local observability. The communication topology of the observers is represented by a graph and reflected in the optimization problem by additional consensus constraints. A dual decomposition technique is used to derive a decoupled dual optimization problem which is solved by a subgradient method to yield a decentralized algorithm.

The environment used was to guide a simulated robot through a virtual world populated with obstacles. In order to analyze the sensitivity we studied the robustness of the controllers when rules were removed from the system. The idea was to simulate situations when the designer does not have complete knowledge about the problem, or an out of order controller. The results obtained so far suggest a higher sensitivity of the hybrid system in a knowledge extraction process. Our experiments indicate that fuzzy systems can perform reasonably under adverse conditions.	experiment;fuzzy control system;hybrid system;neuro-fuzzy;population;robot;simulation;virtual world	Patrick Barbosa Moratori;Leila Cristina V. de Andrade;Adriano Joaquim de Oliveira Cruz;Cabral Lima	2005	Fifth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS'05)	10.1109/ICHIS.2005.28	control engineering;engineering;machine learning;control theory	Robotics	59.098184725843595	-11.394567770777165	24853

The process is a laboratory scale chemical reactor with three inputs and three outputs. It typically represents industrial processes due to its nonlinearity, coupling effects and lack of a mathematical model. Different techniques have been used in collecting training data from the reactor. A novel method was used to select the model order and time-delay to determine the NN model input. A Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) model was then developed. A Recursive Orthogonal Least Squares (ROLS) algorithm was applied as a numerically robust method to update the RBFN weight matrix. In this way, degradation of the modelling error due to ill-conditioning in the training data is avoided. Real data experiments show that the RBFN model developed has high accuracy.	algorithm;artificial neural network;condition number;display resolution;elegant degradation;experiment;least squares;mimo;mathematical model;network model;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;radial basis function network;reactor (software);recursion (computer science)	Dingli Yu;J.

The feedforward controller is firstly designed based on a linearised wind turbine model at one specific wind speed, then expanded for full above rated operational envelope with gain scheduling. The wind evolution model is established using the pseudo-LIDAR measurement data which is generated from Bladed using a designed sampling strategy. The combined feedforward and baseline control system is simulated on a 5MW industrial wind turbine model developed at Strathclyde University. Simulation results demonstrate that the gain scheduling feedforward control strategy can improve the rotor and tower load reduction performance for large wind turbines.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);control system;control theory;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;futures studies;pitch (music);pitch shift;r.o.t.o.r.;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);simulation	Jie Bao;Hong Yue;William E.

The conventional methodologies based on geometric reasoning suffer not only from the algorithmic difficulty but also from the excessive time complexity in dealing with 3-D path planning. This paper presents a massively parallel, connectionist algorithm for collision-free path planning. The path planning algorithm is based on representing a path as a series ofvia points or beads connected by elastic strings which are subject to displacement due to a potential field or a collision penalty function generated by polyhedral obstacles. Mathematically, this is equivalent to optimizing a cost function, defined in terms of the total path length and the collision penalty function, by moving thevia points simultaneously but individually in the direction that minimizes the cost function. Massive parallelism comes mainly from: (1) the connectionist model representation of obstacles and (2) the parallel computation of individualvia-point motions with only local information. The algorithm has power to deal effectively with path planning of three-dimensional objects with translational and rotational motions. Finally, the algorithm incorporates simulated annealing to solve a local minimum problem. Simulation results are shown.	computation;motion planning	Sukhan Lee;Jun Park	1991	J.

95e22f9444272aeb00b1c60e6d93abe618bc6e14	dynamics of four-neuron recurrent inhibitory loop with state-dependent time delays		Abstract In previous works, recurrent inhibitory loops with state-dependent propagation delays, firing process and absolute refractory period have been successfully employed to solve capacity-simplicity dilemma in associative memory attractors networks. But in realistic networks, usually there are more than two or three neurons. In order to disclose their natures, in this paper, we consider the dynamics of periodic patterns mainly in a four-neuron recurrent inhibitory loop. We explicitly address how to give rise to its enormous periodic patterns and obtain their existence conditions. At last, we further execute numerical simulations to address the difference from the five-neuron loop and demonstrate similar periodic patterns. Even for smaller τ , the coexistence of three periodic patterns is found in four-neuron loop and that of four periodic patterns is discovered in five-neuron loop. New periodic patterns are also generated and the maximum values of τ for the existence of possible periodic patterns also decrease with the increment of the number of neurons in loops. They will improve loops performance greatly. Our research shows that delays are significant and remarkable for the dynamics of recurrent inhibitory loops, since loops with more neurons have more complicated dynamical behavior and loops performance are also enhanced due to the the increase of synaptic delay and propagation delay.	neuron	Lijun Pei;Yanju Zheng;Shaofen Zou;Zhanguo Li	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.02.062	periodic graph (geometry);content-addressable memory;refractory period;machine learning;propagation delay;artificial intelligence;inhibitory postsynaptic potential;mathematics;attractor;control theory;neuron	ML	77.74428387963495	2.7656682909812003	24980
20bf5d58a3935511653fdaf4056735cca23df08c	application of neural network in trajectory planning of the entry vehicle for variable targets	variable targets;trajectory planning;real time;entry;onboard;neural network	A method for onboard generation of entry trajectory for variable targets is discussed. Conventional trajectory planning algorithms can only be used for the fixed terminal conditions without considering the variable targets. In case the vehicle needs to alert the entry trajectory due to damage or effectors failure, the entry guidance system must real-time design a feasible entry trajectory according to another feasible landing site from current flight conditions. The conventional approaches must be augmented to provide the real-time redesign capability for variable targets, and the redesign trajectory would also satisfy all path constraints and altered terminal conditions. This paper makes use of the neural network as a major controller to overcome this problem. The redesign trajectory problems and control parameter generations online problems can be transformed into the neural network offline training problem, given the initial conditions and the selected terminal conditions. Numerical simulations with a reusable launch vehicle model for various terminal conditions are presented to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the approach.	algorithm;artificial neural network;autonomous robot;guidance system;initial condition;numerical linear algebra;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Bin Zhang;Shilu Chen;Min Xu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23896-3_38	simulation;computer science;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.68604304231642	-13.572008658432857	25033

It is made by a rigid structure articulated by compliant hinges. Its kinematics consists of both parallel and angular finger motion. The movements were designed to be independent from each other and auto-adaptive as well. The motions were driven by Ni–Ti shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The recovery position is achieved by the elastic force exerted by the flexure hinges in the case of parallel motion and by an axial spring in the case of angular motion. Both the actuators and the hinges were experimentally characterized by suitable test rigs. The gripper prototype was tested and it showed to be able to reach the design performances. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •	angularjs;experiment;instrumentation (computer programming);john d. wiley;performance;prototype;robot end effector;robotics;static program analysis;tactile transducer	Andrea Manuello Bertetto;Maurizio Ruggiu	2003	J.

When, for example, several robots share the same workspace and the environment in the workspace is changing due to the operation, the robot trajectories can no longer be planned in advance without the risk of collision. The objective of this paper is the collision-free motion planning of handling system manipulators from the start to the end position within a changing environment. For this purpose, the trajectories on the control system have to be planned during the operating time most efficiently depending on the current state of a varying environment. This paper describes a new approach for trajectory planning based on curve shortening flows combined with potential fields. The functional capability of the method will be demonstrated initially on a simple robot kinematics with two degrees of freedom.	algorithm;control system;maximal set;motion planning;real-time transcription;robot control;variational principle;weight function;workspace	Konrad Groh;Sascha Röck	2010	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-009-0202-0	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control system;machine tool;control theory;motion planning;scientific control;mechanical engineering	Robotics	64.82980552855744	-21.241382347732817	25196
f9cf30b165aaac275f7b052409626bd982ae9068	h∞ and i2-i∞ finite-horizon filtering with randomly occurring gain variations and quantization effects		This paper investigates the H ∞ and l 2 − l ∞ filtering problem for discrete stochastic nonlinear system with randomly occurring gain variations and quantization effects over a finite horizon. The system under consideration is subject to time-varying parameters and exogenous signals. A Bernoulli distributed white sequence with a known conditional probability is introduced to describe the binary switching phenomenon between two types of nonlinear disturbances. The randomly occurring filter gain variations are utilized to express the random change of filter parameters that is governed by a binary sequences taking values on 0 or 1. Moreover, the quantization effects of measurements are also taken into account where a form of logarithmic quantizer is applied. By using the recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs) approach, sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the desired finite-horizon filter to guarantee the H ∞ and l 2 − l ∞ performance specifications at the same time. A numerical example is proposed to show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed design method. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Two different scenarios are addressed in trajectory control. The first scenario consist of position control with fuel constraint, secondly the position control is performed in the presence of obstacles.

Even in the absence of dynamic controller elements, saturating nonlinearities can trigger undesired oscillations. This effect is obviously due to inappropriate plant states, and is therefore called plant windup. Based on the frequency response of the linear part, a design aid for plant windup prevention is presented. It facilitates the search for suitable closed-loop dynamics, or for an appropriate additional dynamic network. State and disturbance observers add dynamic elements to the compensator, and in the presence of very slow or unstable controller modes, the well-known reset windup or integral windup occurs. This effect, the controller windup, is related to mismatched controller states. By feeding the limited plant input signal into the observer it is completely removed, so that the remaining effects of input saturation are solely attributable to plant windup. Various known windup prevention techniques can be explained within the presented framework. ( 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This modeling approach turns a multi-arm robot into an underactuated system. We observe that controlling floating-base multi-leg robots is fundamentally similar. The Projected Inverse Dynamics Control approach is employed for decoupling contact consistent motion generation and controlling contact wrenches. The proposed framework for underactuated robots has been evaluated on an enormous robot hand composed of four KUKA LWR IV+ representing fingers cooperatively manipulating a 9kg box with total 28 actuated DOF and six virtual DOF representing the object as additional free-floating robot link. Finally, we validate the same approach on ANYmal, a floating-base quadruped with 12 actuated DOF. Experiments are performed both in simulation and real world.

We demonstrate, by taking into account the full nonlinear and multivariable nature of the robot dynamics, that the overall closed loop system is locally asymptotically stable. Besides the theoretical result, the proposed control scheme has two practical features. First. it compensates for static friction in the robot joints, and second, it considers the real torque actuators capabilities to avoid torque saturation.

3e2c7da48023b6ba9cb9fac1b2fd824a39924538	application of lexicographic optimization method to integrated vehicle control systems		In this paper, a general control allocation (CA) algorithm is proposed based on a lexicographic optimization (LO) strategy for a vehicle's longitudinal and lateral control. The primary objective of this CA is to distribute the torque adjustments of the lateral controller such that the error between the desired and actual forces and moments at the vehicle's center of gravity is minimized, while maintaining the longitudinal tire slip ratios close to a desired range. Presence of various constraints in practical systems can significantly increase the complexity and effort of properly adjusting the tuning parameters in the objective function. Hence, an LO method is used to prioritize the objectives. Lateral stability of the vehicle has the highest priority and is subject to the constraint of maintaining small tire slip ratios. The second priority of CA is assigned to minimize the adjustment torques. The proposed LO-based approach reduces exhaustive vehicle testing commonly required for tuning of the separately designed controllers and the cost and time of the implementation.

The dual linear motors servo system comprises two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs). First, the dynamics of the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive with a lumped uncertainty, which contains parameter variations, external disturbance and friction force, is introduced. Then, to achieve accurate trajectory tracking performance with robustness, an intelligent control approach using FLRBFN is proposed for the field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive system. The proposed FLRBFN is a radial basis function network (RBFN) embedded with a functional link neural network (FLNN). The network structure and its on-line learning algorithms for connective weights, means and standard derivations are described in detail. Moreover, since a cross-coupled technology is incorporated into the proposed intelligent control scheme for the gantry position stage, both of the position tracking errors and synchronous errors of dual linear motors will converge to zero, simultaneously. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to depict the validity of the proposed control approach.	32-bit;algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;converge;digital signal processor;embedded system;intelligent control;logical connective;online and offline;online machine learning;radial (radio);radial basis function network;robust control;servo;signal processing	Chin-Sheng Chen;Po-Huan Chou;Faa-Jeng Lin	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)	10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007396	synchronous motor;uncertainty;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;friction;servomechanism;control theory;linear motor;radial basis function network;force;servomotor;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.85240411187727	-10.25507510920285	25497

The system under consideration contains parameter uncertainties, Itô-type stochastic disturbances, timevarying delays, as well as sector-bounded nonlinearities. We aim at designing a full-order filter such that, for all admissible uncertainties, nonlinearities and time-delays, the dynamics of the filtering error is guaranteed to be robustly asymptotically stable in the mean square, while achieving the prescribed H∞ disturbance rejection attenuation level. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and Itô’s differential rule, sufficient conditions are first established to ensure the existence of the desired filters, which are expressed in the form of a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Then, the explicit expression of the desired filter gains is also characterized. Finally, a numerical example is exploited to show the usefulness of the results derived.	admissible heuristic;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mean squared error;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;rejection sampling;social inequality;stochastic process	Zidong Wang;Yurong Liu;Xiaohui Liu	2008	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2007.09.016	control engineering;linear form;haplogroup h;nonlinear control;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov function;calculus;control theory;mathematics	ML	72.4985275486897	-2.8877662883253374	25527

Fuzzy control is the application of the compositional rule of inference and it is shown how the inference of the rule base with complex rules can be reduced to the inference of a number of rule bases with simple rules. A fuzzy logic based controller is applied to a simple magnetic suspension system. The controller has proportional, integral and derivative separate parts which are tuned independently. This means that all parts have their own rule bases. By testing it was formed out that the fuzzy PID controller gives better performance over a typical operational range then a traditional linear PID controller. The magnetic suspension system and the contact-less optical position measurement system have been developed and applied for the comparative analysis of the real-time conventional PID control and the fuzzy control.	algorithm;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;level of detail;mathematical optimization;pid;qualitative comparative analysis;real-time clock;rule 90;rule-based system;scheduling (computing);system of measurement;theory;vagueness	Marjan Golob	1999	Intell.

The main idea is to transform the SA system into an equivalent Switched Linear (SL) system with state reset, and then apply balanced truncation to each mode and redefine the reset maps so as to best reproduce the free evolution of the system output. A randomized method is proposed for order selection in the case when the input is stochastic and one is interested in reproducing the output of the original SA system over a finite time-horizon. The performance of the approach is shown on a benchmark example.	benchmark (computing);map;mathematical optimization;random optimization;randomized algorithm;sl (complexity);stochastic process;truncation	Alessandro Vittorio Papadopoulos;Maria Prandini	2014		10.1145/2562059.2562131	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	AI	61.44250147536219	-0.4066312499938867	25660

The controller enforces a relationship between the velocity of each manipulator and the internal force on the manipulated objects. Each manipulator is directly given the properties of an impedance by the controller; thus, eliminating the gain limitation inherent in the structure of previously proposed schemes. The controller uses the forces sensed at the robot end effectors to compensate for the effects of the objects' dynamics and to compute the internal force using only kinematic relationships. Thus, knowledge of the objects' dynamics is not required. Stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory and simulation results are presented validating the proposed concepts. The effect of computational delays in digital control implementations is analyzed vis-a-vis stability and a lower bound derived on the size of the desired manipulator inertia relative to the actual manipulator endpoint inertia.

FAST-Hex can adapt to the task at hand by finely tuning its configuration from the efficient (but underactuated) flight (typical of coplanar multi-rotor platforms) to the full-pose-tracking (but less efficient) flight, which is attainable by non-coplanar multi-rotors. We also introduce a novel full-pose geometric controller for generic multi-rotors (not only the FAST-Hex) that outperforms classical inverse dynamics approaches. The controller receives as input any reference pose in ℝ3×SO(3) (3D position + 3D orientation). Exact tracking is achieved if the reference pose is feasible with respect to the propeller spinning rate saturations. In case of unfeasibility a new feasible desired trajectory is generated online giving priority to the positional part. The new controller is tested with the FAST-Hex but can be used for many other multi-rotor platforms: underactuated, slightly fully-actuated and completely fully-actuated.	aerial photography;hex;inverse dynamics;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;smoothing;underactuation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Markus Ryll;Davide Bicego;Antonio Franchi	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759271	control engineering;synchronization;simulation;propeller;spinning;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;solid modeling;force	Robotics	65.91952962000833	-20.533945865622655	25824

Based on a realistic memristor model, an MCNN is modeled using a differential inclusion. The essential boundedness of its global solutions is proven. The state of MCNNs is further proven to be convergent to a critical-point set located in saturated region of the activation function, when the initial state locates in a saturated region. It is shown that the state convergence time period is finite and can be quantitatively estimated using given parameters. Furthermore, the positive invariance and attractivity of state in non-saturated regions are also proven.

First, the coupled higher-order dynamic model of an n-link robot manipulator is introduced briefly. Then, a conventional SMC scheme is developed for the joint position tracking of the robot manipulator. Moreover, a fuzzy-neural-network inherited SMC (FNNISMC) scheme is proposed to relax the requirement of detailed system information and deal with chattering control efforts in the SMC system. In the FNNISMC strategy, the FNN framework is designed to mimic the SMC law, and adaptive tuning algorithms for network parameters are derived in the sense of projection algorithm and Lyapunov stability theorem to ensure the network convergence as well as stable control performance. Numerical simulations of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by DC servo motors are provided to justify the claims of the proposed FNNISMC system, and the superiority of the proposed FNNISMC scheme is also evaluated by quantitative comparison with previous intelligent control schemes.	adaptive grammar;algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;high- and low-level;intelligent control;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;network convergence;numerical method;robot;robust control;servo;simulation;system information (windows)	Rong-Jong Wai;Rajkumar Muthusamy	2013	2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606235	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.18280037058851	-10.701464518157923	25894

The former part plays a role in determining the fundamental characteristics of the system against model uncertainties. The latter part eliminates the effect of input quantization and matched disturbances. In other words, each component of the latter part is designed as an integer multiple of the quantization level, which provides a clue to maintaining the decreasing property of a Lyapunov function, associated with theH2 cost, despite input quantization and matched disturbances. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, time-delays are usually unavoidable in control systems due to the sensoring and communication delays. This paper presents an alternative repetitive control design for systems with constant time-delays in both forward and feedback control channels, which are dedicated to track/reject periodic signals. An additional delay is introduced together with the plant delays to construct an internal model for periodic signals, and a simple compensator based on the plant model inverse is utilized to stabilize the closed-loop system. Sufficient stability conditions of the closed-loop system and the robustness analysis against modeling uncertainties are studied. The proposed idea is further extended for general time-delay systems with only a delay term in the forward control channel. The ''plug-in'' structure used in conventional repetitive control designs is avoided, so that it leads to a simpler control configuration, i.e. only a proportional parameter and the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter are required to be selected. Simulations based on a hard disk drive system and practical experiments on a rotary robotic servo system are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	servo	Jing Na;Xuemei Ren;Ramon Costa-Castelló;Yu Guo	2014	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2013.09.010	real-time computing	Robotics	66.55512668598978	-8.396308313158306	26008

If the map is invertible, the only possible dynamics is either quasiperiodic motion, or phase-locked behavior with a unique attracting periodic orbit. Under the influence of quasiperiodic forcing the dynamics of the map changes dramatically. Inside the Arnol ′ d tongues open regions of multistability exist, and the parameter dependency of the dynamics becomes rather complex. This paper discusses the bifurcation structure inside the Arnol ′ d tongue with zero rotation number and includes a study of nons-mooth bifurcations that happen for large nonlinearity in the region with strange nonchaotic attractors.	arnold tongue;bifurcation theory;nonlinear system;quasiperiodicity;rotation number	Hinke M.

A new method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is developed in a controller design based on a two-port network to achieve accurate haptic display.

The stiffness matrices of the robot limb at different configurations are investigated. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that this model is able to predict the general trend of change of stiffness matrix as a function of end effector position. Experiments also show that the maximum eigenvalue of stiffness matrix is a convex function with respect to the effector position, which matches the prediction of theory. Other testing includes measuring the effect of motor backlash on stiffness coefficients, and gauge the amount of contribution to total compliance from joint compliance and structure compliance.	coefficient;convex function;experiment;robot end effector;stiffness matrix	Xuan Lin;Dennis W.

The plant dynamics are discrete-time, linear, and time-invariant, with stochastic process noise and measurement noise. The controller is designed as a norm-bounded causal history-dependent function of the past outputs perturbed by bounded noise. The resulting control signals are assumed to be transmitted through a lossy channel with packet dropouts. We show that under mild assumptions on the system matrices, the statistics of the process and measurement noise sequences, and the probability of dropouts, it is possible to ensure bounded variance of the system in closed-loop.	causal filter;control system;lossy compression;network packet;stochastic process;time-invariant system	Peter Hokayem;Debasish Chatterjee;Federico A.

It is an appealing alternative to hysteresis compensation because it does not require a detailed model of hysteresis, by treating the nonlinear hysteresis as a common disturbance and actively rejecting it. The stability characteristic of the ADRC is analyzed. It is shown that, in the face of the inherent dynamic uncertainties, the estimation and closed-loop tracking errors of ADRC are bounded, with their bounds monotonously decreasing with the observer and controller bandwidths, respectively. Simulation results on two typical hysteretic systems further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	hysteresis;nonlinear system;rejection sampling;simulation	Qing Zheng;Frank J.

A new SINR estimation method is proposed by using moving horizon estimation (MHE), where the SINR estimation system is described as a stochastic parameter system model. By choosing a stochastic cost function, the SINR estimator is obtained by solving a regularized least-squares problem. Considering the coupling of state variable and process noise, a one-step MHE algorithm is presented to solve the constrained SINR optimization problem by using LOQO algorithm. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	bernoulli polynomials;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);dynamical system;interference (communication);least squares;loss function;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simplex algorithm;simulation;state space;stochastic process	Andong Liu;Li Yu;Wen-an Zhang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2013.2269030	mathematical optimization;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	59.61216596073741	2.9688118469860676	26237

For control, low-dimensional models can be used only if the control force is very small, otherwise hidden degrees of freedom may become excited. We study the control of chaotic map dynamics with extremely small forcing functions. We find that the smallest forcing function, which is called a resonant forcing function, echoes the natural dynamics of the system. This means, when the natural dynamics is irregular, the optimal forcing function is irregular too. If the natural dynamics contains a certain periodicity, the optimal forcing function contains that periodicity too. We show that such controls are effective even if the system has hidden degrees of freedom and if the probes of the control system have a low resolution. Further we show that resonant forcing functions of chaotic systems decrease exponentially, where the rate equals the Liapunov exponent of the unperturbed system. We apply resonant forcing functions for efficient control of chaotic systems and for system identification.	complex systems;robustness (computer science)	Glenn C. Foster;Alfred W.

FFA is a novel technique in which traditional fixtures used, for example, in automotive body assembly industries, are eliminated by the use of several robots, with multifinger grippers that are used to grasp and assemble parts. The objective of this work is to design, build, and test a reconfigurable gripper for the purpose of FFA. The gripper developed in this work is capable of precisely grasping parts of different geometries, rigidly holding the parts in space, and choosing different grasping points while allowing sufficient clearance for welding gun access. The overall design procedure, which is subdivided into the conceptual, configuration and parametric design, includes wrench system determination, kinematic and mechanism design. A novel three-finger gripper is developed. Each finger has two movable joints and two point-contacts with which to grasp the part. Finite element analysis is used to simulate deflections of the gripper components under load to determine critical design parameters. Finally, the workspace and the kinematic model of the reconfigurable gripper have been developed. The gripper was fabricated and tested in grasping experiments using several automotive body panels. The reconfigurable gripper is shown to achieve the objectives set out in this work.	coat of arms;critical graph;experiment;finite element method;graphical modeling framework;i-deas;movable type;parametric design;requirement;robot end effector;simulation;six degrees of separation;testbed;workspace	Benny H.

Both methods are based on controller reconfiguration rather than on requiring an exogenous excitation signal, as it is otherwise common in active fault diagnosis. For the first method, it is assumed that the system considered is controlled by an observer-based controller. The method is then based on a number of alternate observers, each designed to be sensitive to one or more additive faults. Periodically, the observer part of the controller is changed into the sequence of fault sensitive observers. This is done in a way that guarantees the continuity of transition and global stability using a recent result on observer parameterization. An illustrative example inspired by a field study of a drag racing vehicle is given. For the second method, an active fault diagnosis method for parametric faults is proposed. The method periodically adds a term to the controller that for a short period of time renders the system unstable if a fault has occurred, which facilitates rapid fault detection. An illustrative example is given.	control theory;fault detection and isolation;field research;observer (quantum physics);rendering (computer graphics);scott continuity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jakob Stoustrup;Henrik Niemann	2010	Int.

As prototype-based clustering algorithms, which are well suited for partitioning, frequently converge to unwanted local solutions, density-based noise clustering is used to initialize them. The clustering acts in a mixed parameter-position feature space and divides the data into separate sets for identifying local models and partition boundaries, which are assumed to be piecewise planar. The obtained partitions are tested on linearity and otherwise replaced each by a TS model that is identified from the respective data. The method is demonstrated for a test problem that includes switching, local polynomial nonlinearity as well as non-convex partition boundaries.	algorithm;cluster analysis;converge;disk partitioning;feature vector;hybrid system;nonlinear system;polynomial;prototype	Moritz Wagner;Andreas Kroll	2014	2014 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2014.6862216	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics;affine combination	ML	76.05478951636788	-7.352791101593994	26317

To achieve the objective of always keeping vehicle states within vehicle lateral stability regions, the corresponding stability margins are designed and analytically formulated. In addition, to promote the fidelity of the stability analysis due to the limited estimation accuracy of vehicle lateral velocity and yaw rate, the estimation errors are considered in the stability analysis and their impacts on the stability control are discussed.

Previous work on constrained manipulation transfers rigid constraints imposed by the target object motion directly into the robot configuration space. This often unnecessarily restricts the allowable robot motion, which can prevent the robot from performing even simple tasks, particularly if the robot has limited reachability or low number of joints. Our method computes ldquocaging graspsrdquo specific to the object and uses efficient search algorithms to produce motion plans that satisfy the task constraints. The major advantages of our technique significantly increase the range of possible motions of the robot by not having to enforce rigid constraints between the end-effector and the target object. We illustrate our approach with experimental results and examples running on two robot platforms.	automated planning and scheduling;autonomous robot;humanoid robot;motion planning;reachability;robot end effector;robotics;search algorithm;the quality of life;warren abstract machine	Rosen Diankov;Siddhartha S.

The concept of the ePaddle mechanism is discussed firstly and followed by its forward and inverse kinematic models. The ePaddle mechanism brings remarkable locomotion ability to a robot working in complex amphibious environments that are hazardous to most of existing robots. Three terrestrial gaits and two aquatic gaits are introduced in this paper. The prototype design of the ePaddle mechanism is introduced and the terrestrial trafficability analysis shows that the ePaddle-based robot is highly capable of overcoming steps and ditches. Finally, the prototype of an ePaddle module is simulated with a legged walking gait, and the proposed locomotion ability as well as its kinematic models are verified by the simulation results.	aquatic ecosystem;experiment;inverse kinematics;prototype;robot;semiconductor industry;simulation;terrestrial television;workspace	Yi Sun;Shugen Ma;Xin Luo	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2010.5723481	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;inverse kinematics;bismuth;control theory;robot kinematics;actuator	Robotics	70.88662505800053	-23.012378324807095	26422

GP is used to evolve control strategies that, given the current and desired state of the propulsion and heading dynamics of a supply ship as inputs, generate the commanded forces required to maneuver the ship. The controllers created using GP are evaluated through computer simulations and real maneuverability tests in a laboratory water basin facility. The robustness of each controller is analyzed through the simulation of environmental disturbances. In addition, GP runs in the presence of disturbances are carried out so that the different controllers obtained can be compared.

The algorithmemploys a global- local strategy, and solves the problem in the 2D workspace of the robot, without generating the complexconfiguration space. Firstly, a visibility graph is constructed for finding a collision-free shortest path for a point. Secondly,the path for a point is evaluated to find whether it can be used as a reference to build up a feasible path for the mobile robot.If not, this path is discarded and the next shortest path is selected and evaluated until a right reference path is found. Thirdly,robot configurations are placed along the selected path in the way that the robot can move from one configuration to the nextavoiding obstacles. Lemmas are introduced to ensure that the robot travels using direct, indirect or reversal manoeuvres. Thealgorithm is computationally efficient and runs in time O(nk + n log n) for k obstacles andn vertices. The path found is near optimal in terms of distance travelled. The algorithm is tested in computersimulations and test results are presented to demonstrate its versatility in complex environments.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;pathfinding;shortest path problem	Kaichun Jiang;Lakmal D.

They may be affected by unknown time-varying disturbances or parameter variations entering linearly in the state equations. The proposed dynamic controller is of order 1 ( is the relative degree of the given system) and ensures that the closed-loop system enjoys for any initial condition and for any smooth bounded output reference signal (with bounded time derivatives up to order ) the following properties: input-to-state stability with respect to disturbance inputs and almost disturbance decoupling, i.e., the influence of disturbances both on theL2 and on the L1 norm of the output tracking error is arbitrarily attenuated by increasing a positive scalar control parameter. When disturbances are zero the reference signal is exponentially tracked by the output and the equilibrium point corresponding to the reference signal is globally asymptotically stable.	block cipher mode of operation;control theory;coupling (computer programming);initial condition;minimum phase;nonlinear system;observable;t-norm;taxicab geometry	Riccardo Marino;Patrizio Tomei	1999	IEEE Trans.

These filters are often unnecessarily conservative with respect to input and output bounds if multiple references with different amplitudes are applied. This conservatism is due to its offline design and linear mapping. This paper presents an online input prefilter design approach to overcome this conservatism. The resulting prefilters are called predictive prefilters because the online design is based on the model predictive control (MPC) framework. By theoretical considerations, simulation results and experimental results, it is shown that this new prefilter is at least as good as traditional prefilters, and can result in substantial gains in settling time. Tests show that a 30% decrease in settling time is possible in a common input shaping application.	active set method;benchmark (computing);decision problem;embedded system;input shaping;input/output;mathematical optimization;noise shaping;nonlinear system;online and offline;online optimization;optimization problem;precomputation;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);setpoint (control system);settling time;simulation;worst-case scenario	Lieboud Van den Broeck;Moritz Diehl;Jan Swevers	2010	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2009.2032165	control engineering;electronic engineering;mechatronics;engineering;control theory;mechanical system;model predictive control	EDA	71.94703906820978	-7.627841229492496	26570

This piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function effectively incorporates the structure of the saturation/deadzone nonlinearity. Several sector-like conditions are derived to describe the complex nonlinear algebraic loop. These conditions transform several performance analysis problems into optimization problems with linear (or bilinear) matrix inequalities.

99b2404cbb47e352356d3ca25ab9f86f825fab91	distributed circumnavigation control with dynamic spacings for a heterogeneous multi-robot system		Circumnavigation control is useful in real-world applications such as entrapping a hostile target. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous multi-robot system where robots have different physical properties, such as maximum movement speeds. Instead of equal-spacings, dynamic spacings according to robots’ properties, which are termed utilities in this paper, will be more desirable in a scenario such as target entrapment. A distributed circumnavigation control algorithm based on utilities is proposed for any number of mobile robots from random 3D positions to circumnavigate a target. The dynamic spacings are subject to the variation of robots’ utilities. The robots can only obtain the angular positions and utilities of their two neighbouring robots, so the control law is distributed. Theoretical analysis and experimental results are provided to prove the stability and effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.	algorithm;angularjs;control theory;mobile robot;optimal control	Weijia Yao;Sha Luo;Huimin Lu;Junhao Xiao	2018	CoRR		control engineering;engineering;robot;mobile robot;circumnavigation	Robotics	58.11915869028615	-22.06523237512015	26661

Both imperfect communication channels and parameter uncertainties are taken into consideration. Bernoulli random distribution is used to describe such unreliable communication environment. Nonlinear NCSs are modeled via the IT2 T-S fuzzy model, in which membership functions with lower and upper bounds can capture and express parameter uncertainties. The observer is designed to observe unmeasurable state variables. Moreover, based on these techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system to be stochastically stable and possess the property of external disturbance attenuation. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed in this paper.	bernoulli polynomials;fuzzy control system;interval arithmetic;nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Qi Zhou;Di Liu;Kai Sun;Chengwei Wu;Xing Xing	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.09.084	mathematical optimization;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	67.00303292956474	1.166413911845663	26719

The main difficulties come from the flexibility of the mechanical chain, but also from the lack of joints sensors. In a first stage, a state-feedback linear quadratic (LQG) technique and a model predictive control (MPC) are designed using optimal observers. Considering additional sensors that provide measurements of accelerations increases the robustness of the controlled system. The second stage consists into adding a supplementary robustness layer (i.e. explicitly considering the robust stability under unstructured uncertainties) on the stabilizing MPC developed at the previous stage. Comparative results are proposed highlighting the trade-off between robust stability and nominal performance for disturbances rejection.	advanced process control;angularjs;brain–computer interface;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;peter stoica;rejection sampling;robot;robustification;sensor;simulation;unstructured grid	Emanuel Dogaru;Cristina Stoica;Emmanuel Godoy	2011			multivariable calculus;robot;control engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.09626921535119	-14.389968637980017	26780

a1c12bd837ea171739ded06379671a82cf86acb1	a proposal of manipulability based model predictive control for the parallelogram linkage		This paper proposes a control method for a parallelogram linkage robot manipulator. Parallelogram linkage can generate motion control with high precision. However, this technique is geometrically constrained in the task space as a result of its mechanical properties. The proposed method uses a model predictive controller to account for the geometric constraints of the system. The key concept behind the controller developed here is to use manipulability for the cost function and geometric constraints in the model predictive controller. Thus, we can design a trajectory-tracking controller using a manipulator and accounting for the geometric constraints. In the simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified using the singularity avoidance problem as an example of geometric constraints.	effective method;linkage (software);loss function;nonlinear system;simulation;technological singularity	Ryota Ishibashi;ShiSheng Zou;Kazuya Kawaguchi;Naoyuki Takesue;Akira Kojima	2012		10.3182/20120905-3-HR-2030.00113	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.03034744026095	-18.07489756665998	26832

The selection of the most effective control parameter to make good use of the engine power is studied theoretically. Based on these analyses, a simulation model of the cold milling machine is designed with the software AMEsim4.2. Whether the engine power utilization of the cold milling machine is reasonable or not is verified through simulations in which the adaptive power control system is used. The results show that using the work speed of the cold milling machine as the control parameter is reasonable and effective; the engine of the milling machine can be set to work at its rated power by the self-adjustment of the adaptive power control system. In this case, the rated power utilization ratio of the engine is improved more than 10.2% and the machine productivity is raised at least 6.32% in various working conditions. The theoretical basis and novel practical methodology can be employed in utilizing the engine power and increasing the machine productivity.	simulation	Peng-yu Ma;Yong-biao Hu;Xin-rong Zhang	2007	Simulation	10.1177/0037549708089111	control engineering;productivity;adaptability;simulation;systems modeling;work output;adaptive control;power control;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;software development;adaptive system;machine tool;engineering drawing	Arch	57.91746146824365	-10.134269994533764	26885
a7044c5a6fdf3aa47ca7d448968c941a1eac4bf8	compensation of cross-saturation effects on ipmsm sensorless control - application to electric vehicle		Most of automotive applications rely on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) thanks to the afforded high efficiency and reduced cost and size. However, this trend is subject to severe safety requirements, particulary related to the reliability of the mechanical position sensor. In this context, the present paper deals with PMSM sensorless control, aimed at providing the position information redundancy. Yet, some side effects, as saturation and cross-coupling, may compromise the estimation quality. To achieve a deeper insight into the impact of these phenomena, authors highlight the way that sensorless estimation accuracy is predicted from the rotor geometry anisotropy. The objective is two-fold: (1) Provide a detailed approach for the characterization of the PMSM magnetic model under different load conditions, (2) Deduce the machine saliency behaviour and the induced estimation error due to saturation effects. To do so, an accurate flux linkage model is required. This model should allow to evaluate the arising cross-saturation terms. Experimental results are presented, referring to two test traction motors dedicated to the electric vehicle application.	control theory;extended validation certificate;linkage (software);lisp machine;r.o.t.o.r.;reduced cost;redundancy (information theory);requirement;ripple effect;side effect (computer science);traction teampage	Wided Zine;Lahoucine Idkhajine;L.

The yaw dynamic system is linearized into a linear system, which is modelled by an affine uncertainty model. We proposed a novel robust Hinfin feedback controller with adaptive mechanisms for the linear system with guaranteed control performances. The feedback gains are obtained by the solutions of a series of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The design approach reduces conservatism inherent in robust control with a fixed gain controller and improves performances in time-response.

In this paper, due to uncertainties in tumour growth model as a nonlinear system, a sliding mode control based on the Lyapunov stability theory is designed to achieve the effective dose in immunotherapy treatment. Also, so as to provide a virtual patient to design a sliding mode controller, the description on the identification process for a particular cancer mathematical model under the immunotherapy treatment by recurrent neural networks is done. An appropriate sliding surface is acquired through a sliding mode control design such that the state trajectories of system will reach to desirable values. As a consequence, the system is simulated to demonstrate the efficacy of the presented method.

We aimed for a function that could rotate the tilt angle continuously and without limit and a function for flying maintaining any desired tilt angle with a structure that could efficiently use the thrust generated by the propellers. We devised a mechanism that connected two bicopter modules, each of which combines two of the four propellers into one set and named this mechanism the “Bi2 Copter”. This mechanism provided movements including landing, take-off, and flying with any desired tilt angle. This ability of this mechanism to fly walls with continuously changing surface angles and full 360° spherical coverage makes possible applications in investigation, measurement, etc. This report covers the design concepts of this flying robot, the structure design, basic control and operations verification.	robot;robotics;sensor;thrust	Koji Kawasaki;Yotaro Motegi;Moju Zhao;Kei Okada;Masayuki Inaba	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353422	robot;control engineering;atmospheric model;simulation;propeller;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;attitude control;torque;force	Robotics	71.49504711730003	-23.114320485580002	27251

The considered system cannot be feedback linearized, and the nonlinear system functions are all unknown. Besides, some unknown actuator faults and external disturbances enter into the system during operation. A novel fault-tolerant controller is proposed by incorporating adaptive fuzzy approximation, backstepping design and robust control into FTC technique. The fuzzy systems which are used to be approximators are nonlinearly parameterized because the fuzzy membership functions are uncertain to designer. Both approximation errors and external disturbances are attenuated by additional control. The designed controller guarantees the closed-loop system stable and the output tracking to the reference signal. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.	approximation;fault tolerance;feedback;fuzzy control system;nonlinear system;robust control;simulation	Ping Li;Guang-Hong yang	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281140	control engineering;real-time computing;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.22113800097772	-5.356357698834913	27269

Statics model of the robotic arm is developed using the Newton-Euler method. Combined with the kinematics model, the robotic arm deformation as well as the wire motion needed to control the robotic arm can be obtained. The model is validated by experiments. Results show that, the proposed model can well predict the robotic arm bending curve. Also, the bending curve is not affected by the wire pre-tension.

Specifically, several anti-windup structures introduced in representative work are considered with PI controlled systems, and NITE for all systems are quantified in terms of system parameters and noise characteristics.

fea16249ade9cedc83119394e51d4f2528c7520c	l2-gain analysis and output feedback control for switched delay systems with actuator saturation		This paper is concerned with the  l  2 -gain analysis and control problems for switched delay systems subject to actuator saturation. The proposed technical framework consists of a switching law and the output feedback controllers. The switching law obeys the mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT), which allows each subsystem of the switched system has its own average dwell time (ADT). More important, the switching law is dependent on the state delay. In special case, it can include the existing switching laws satisfying MDADT or ADT. Further, it allows more switching numbers in slow switching framework, which leads to more freedom for constructing switching signals. Hence, the proposed delay-dependent switching law is more general and applicable. The saturated output feedback controllers with the form of quasi-linear parameter-varying (QLPV) are then designed such that the closed-loop system under the switching law is with the disturbance tolerance capacity and a weighted  l  2 -gain. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the switching law and the controllers are developed based on the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through a numerical example.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback	Xiao-Qi Zhao;Jun Zhao	2015	J.

In this paper we propose a simple algorithm for detection of points in the time–frequency (TF) plane of the instantaneous mixtures where only single source contributions occur. Samples at these points in the TF plane can be used for the mixing matrix estimation. The proposed algorithm identifies the single-source-points (SSPs) by comparing the absolute directions of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform coefficient vectors of the mixed signals. Finally, the SSPs so obtained are clustered using the hierarchical clustering algorithm for the estimation of the mixing matrix. The proposed idea for the SSP identification is simpler than the previously reported algorithms. & 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.	algorithm;blind signal separation;cluster analysis;coefficient;computation;hierarchical clustering;imaginary time;source separation;sparse matrix;time complexity	Vaninirappuputhenpurayil Gopalan Reju;Soo Ngee Koh;Ing Yann Soon	2009	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2009.03.017	fourier transform;speech recognition;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;blind signal separation;algorithm;statistics	ML	79.9915690565722	-8.935737568849285	27435

This paper addresses the air path regulation in turbocharged diesel engines using an explicit model predictive control (EMPC) approach, which allows tracking of the time-varying setpoint values generated by the supervisory level controller while satisfying the actuator constraints. The proposed EMPC framework consists of calibration, engine model identification, controller formulation, and state observer design. The proposed EMPC approach has a low computation requirement and is suitable for implementation in the engine control unit (ECU) on board. The experimental results on a turbocharged Cat® C6.6 diesel engine illustrate that the EMPC controller significantly improves the tracking performance of the exhaust emission variables against the decentralized single-input single-output (SISO) control method.

0bc3d27c7f3d1414641c7f1308d1f44503322c2e	sliding mode techniques for robust trajectory tracking as well as state and parameter estimation		Practical applications are often affected by uncertainties—more precisely bounded and stochastic disturbances. These have to be considered in robust control procedures to prevent a system from being unstable. Common sliding mode control strategies are often not able to cope with the mentioned impacts simultaneously, because they assume that the considered system is only affected by matched uncertainty. Another problem is the offline computation of the switching amplitude. Under these assumptions, important nonlinear system properties cannot be taken into account within the mathematical model of the system. Therefore, this paper presents sliding mode techniques, that on the one hand are able to consider bounded as well as stochastic uncertainties simultaneously, and on the other hand are not limited to the matched case. Firstly, a sliding mode control procedure taking into account both classes of uncertainty is shown. Additionally, a sliding mode observer for the simultaneous estimation of non-measurable system states and uncertain but bounded parameters is described despite stochastic disturbances. This is possible by using intervals for states and parameters in the resulting stochastic differential equations. Therefore, the Itô differential operator is involved and the system’s stability can be verified despite uncertainties and disturbances for both control and observer procedures. This operator is used for the online computation of the variable structure part gain (matrix of switching amplitudes) which is advantageous in contrast to common sliding mode procedures.	computation;control theory;estimation theory;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;mechatronics;microsoft outlook for mac;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;robust control;stochastic process	Luise Senkel;Andreas Rauh;Harald Aschemann	2014	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-014-0208-7	variable structure control;mathematical optimization;sliding mode control;control theory;mathematics;state observer	Robotics	66.27215927356725	-10.479754257488828	27463

In particular, it is shown that when inter-agent formation objectives cannot occur simultaneously in the state-space then, under certain assumptions, the agents velocity vectors and orientations converge to a common value at steady state, under the same control strategy that would lead to a feasible formation. Convergence guarantees are provided in both cases using tools form algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov analysis. The results are verified through computer simulations.

In order to estimate the time-varying unknowns, two iterative learning algorithms, fully-saturated iterative learning projection algorithm and fully-saturated iterative learning least square algorithm, are given, respectively. A one-step ahead controller is developed on the basis of the certainty equivalence principle. The stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are established with the aid of the iteration-domain key technical lemma, which is a variant of the existing one, tailored for the analysis purpose in the iterative domain. The complete tracking is achieved over the pre-specified time interval excluding initial instants, as iteration goes to infinity, while all the signals in the closed-loop remain bounded.	algorithm;iteration;machine learning;simulation interoperability standards organization;stochastic control;turing completeness	Mingxuan Sun;Xiangbin Liu;Haigang He	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485134	control engineering;mathematical optimization;stability;adaptive control;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;statistics;iterative learning control	Robotics	66.04067455754586	-3.3821544837719664	27554

In this paper, we present a novel approach to parameter estimation of robot dynamics which removes the necessity of parameterization (i.e. finding the minimum number of parameters from which the dynamics can be calculated through a linear model with respect to these parameters). This offline approach is based on a simple and powerful swarm intelligence tool: the particle swarm optimization (PSO). In this paper, we discuss and validate the method through simulated experiments. In “Part Two” we analyze our method in terms of robustness and compare it to robust analytical methods of estimation.	estimation theory;executable;experiment;industrial robot;linear model;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;online and offline;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;simulation software;swarm intelligence;total least squares	Hossein Jahandideh;Mehrzad Namvar	2012	2012 16th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)		robot;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;estimation;simulation;computer science;trajectory;machine learning;mathematics;silicon;estimation theory;statistics	Robotics	60.5922359394644	-13.821068259082748	27557

For a polynomial system of order n the paper proposes a formula for the dependence of the cost-to-go function on one of the variables, which then leads to a state-dependent Riccati equation that is linear in in the remaining unknowns. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal cost-to-go function is also a Lyapunov function that can be used to prove stability of the closed-loop system. The relevance of the proposed methodology is illustrated in several examples for which analytical solutions are found, including the Van der Pol oscillator, a mass-spring system, and a nonlinear system in strict form.	algebraic riccati equation;bellman equation;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;relevance;system of polynomial equations;van der pol oscillator	Luis Rodrigues;Alexandre Trofino	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7172174	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;control-lyapunov function;optimal control;nonlinear system;algebraic riccati equation;riccati equation;lyapunov equation;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign;polynomial	Robotics	66.41275529587914	-1.0518972878071187	27678

For redundant arms, we investigate the relationship between kinematic and algorithmic singularities when the method of extended Jacobian is used for task optimization. Under the same model, it is found that, for serial manipulators to move in a point-to-point fashion and for general motion of in-parallel manipulators, their instantaneous kinematics take a similar format as the method of extended Jacobian for redundant arms. Thus, our method of solution can be applied to these manipulators. Several features for the manipulators are demonstrated based on the concept of task separation in the row space of the Jacobian of these manipulators. >	inverse kinematics	Yu-Che Chen;Ian D.

The UAV is actuated by three thrust motors, each guided by suitable actuators, thus forming a platform able to independently track any desired attitude and trajectory. The derivation of the equations of motion is followed by the development of a vectoring controller that is supplemented by an allocation strategy. Both are based on geometric feedback linearization techniques, resulting in a singularity-free control law, taking into account the inertia effects of the main body, of the motors, and of the vectoring dynamics (actuators). A stability proof is developed validating the effectiveness of the control strategy under bounded disturbances.

In particular, a human balancing experiment was carried out to investigate the torque-to-angular displacement profiles about the ankle joint. Experimental results obtained from this study, indicated that both the dorsiflexion and plantarflexion torques present an approximately exponential behavior. These findings served as an inspiration for the development of an optimal, nonlinear stiffness stabilizer, based on an ankle strategy. The balance stabilizer was experimentally validated on the compliant humanoid, CoMAN, demonstrating its balance inducing ability.	angularjs;displacement mapping;experiment;linear model;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;stiffness matrix;time complexity;velocity (software development)	Mohamad Mosadeghzad;Nikos Karavas;Arash Ajoudani;Nikolaos G.

This paper describes the method to identify the model parameters of a small linear drive with ball-screw. Two kinds of friction models will be applied for the servomechanism looking to rise its micro-positioning abilities. The first one includes the static, viscous and Stribeck friction with hysteresis, and the second one uses the Lugre model. The results will be compared taking into account the criterion error, the accuracy and the normalized mean-square-error of the identified mechanical parameters. The coefficients of the models are identified by a recursive identification method using data acquisition and special filtering technics. The least square identification method is used in this paper in order to establish the motor parameters used as initial condition of the recursive estimation method.

Rotation of the arm is controlled by a DC motor, while the pendulum is moving freely in the plane, orthogonal to the arm. Motivated, in particular, by possible applications for walking/running/balancing robots, we consider the Furuta pendulum as a system for which synchronized periodic motions of all the generalized coordinates are to be created and stabilized. The goal is to achieve, via appropriate feedback control action, orbitally exponentially stable oscillations of the pendulum of various shapes around its upright and downward positions, accompanied with oscillations of the arm. Our approach is based on the idea of stabilization of a particular virtual holonomic constraint imposed on the configuration coordinates, which has been theoretically developed recently. Here, we elaborate on the complete design procedure. The results are illustrated not only through numerical simulations but also through successful experimental tests.	computer simulation;double pendulum;experiment;feedback;noise shaping;numerical analysis;planning;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot	Anton S.

The idea of our method is to take advantage of the robustness of feedback laws to delay estimate error that is sufficiently small. We first prove that, when the delay estimate is sufficiently close to the true delay, there is a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional that is strictly decreasing, and asymptotic regulation is achievable. Then, with the help of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional as a supervisor, the switching logic plays the role of adjusting the estimated delay online to make it sufficiently close to the true delay. The result of this note shows that, global adaptive stabilization of linear systems with unknown input delay is achievable, with a logic-based switching control law.	control theory;display lag;input lag;kerrison predictor;linear system;lyapunov fractal;optimal control	Chao Huang;Changbin Yu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2017.2714858	control theory;control theory;delay calculation;robustness (computer science);mathematics;elmore delay;adaptive control;control engineering;linear system	Embedded	68.05477308335307	-3.588784614422384	27863

I found this paper particularly hard to read because its English is poor, its style convoluted and unhelpful, the language ambiguous, and its contents technically unsound. The criticisms about the English, style and language are quite apparent and need no further elaboration, hence this letter will concentrate on the question of technical correctness with particular reference to the claim of closed-loop stability. The starting point of the work is the steepest descent control (SDC) proposed in the Bulletin of Bauman, Moscow State Technical University (in Russian) in which a positive definite function is infimized over a range of input horizons, and the first element of the input sequence that achieves the minimum of the infima in the shortest time is implemented. It is claimed that under some undisclosed conditions (discussed in an unspecified publication), the minimum of the infima behaves like a Lyapunov function and therefore guarantees closed-loop stability. SDC is further claimed to have a convergence property (as yet unproved but verified by simulation) according to which the state±space trajectories converge to the origin faster than other approaches. The paper claims to extend SDC to systems which are subject to polytopic uncertainty in a manner that guarantees closed-loop stability. It is unfortunately the case that SDC does not guarantee closed-stability for the case with no uncertainty and thus cannot guarantee the stability of uncertain systems. Furthermore, the lack of stability also invalidates the claim about fast convergence which in any case concentrates on the behaviour of a ``terminal'' state and ignores transient behaviour. To prove that SDC cannot guarantee stability consider the simplest possible case of a two-state linear unconstrained system with no uncertainty and choose Fx  kxk 2 2 with an overall control horizon T  1, for which SDC would simply choose the current input u to minimize the norm of the next predicted state: x k1  Ax k  Bu k thereby prescribing the state feedback law u  À B T A B T B x yielding the closed-loop dynamics x k1  A cl x k , A cl  A À BB T A B T B …	converge;correctness (computer science);gradient descent;lyapunov fractal;programming language;secure digital container;simulation;smart data compression;vergence	Basil Kouvaritakis	2002	Eur.

In cases where problems could be solved by either or both methodologies, an important research problem is to find what are the advantages for fusing SC methods together with HC methods, rather than using the HC method alone. Hence, in this paper, a performance comparison is detailed for a fused soft control/hard observer type controller (where a classical or HC type observer is fused with an adaptive fuzzy or SC type controller) and a hard control/hard observer type controller (where both the observer and feedback linearization controller are classical HC types). The domain in which this comparison is made is for the sensorless speed control of switched reluctance motors (SRMs). This is because this type of motor has highly nonlinear characteristics, and the HC type controller can often be detrimentally affected by modeling inaccuracies, as well as noise. Simulation and experimental results are illustrated to show the performance comparison of the soft control/hard observer type controller and the hard control/hard observer type controller under a wide range of identical operation conditions including transient speed and torque, SRM model parameter variations, and measurement noise. It can be seen from the results that the soft control/hard observer type exhibits a better performance than the hard control/hard observer type controller.		C. Shi;Adrian David Cheok	2002	IEEE Trans.

Among them, the cross-correlation function has been used to analyze the time relationship between signals such as the electromyogram and the horizontal projection of the center of gravity. The common finding is that the electromyogram precedes the biomechanical signal, a result that has been interpreted in different ways, for example, the existence of feedforward control or the preponderance of a velocity feedback. It is shown here, analytically and by simulation, that the cross-correlation function is depedent in a complicated way on system parameters and on noise spectra. Results similar to those found experimentally, e.g., electromyiogram preceding the biomechanical signal may be obtained in a postural control model without any feedforward control and without any velocity feedback. Therefore, correct interpretations of experimentally obtained cross-correlation functions may require additional information about the system. The results extend to other biomedical applications where two signals from a closed loop system are cross-correlated.	ccr receptors;closed-loop transfer function;control system;cross-correlation;electromyographs;electromyography;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;galactosemia, duarte variant;interpretation process;poor posture;signal processing;simulation;velocity (software development)	André Fabio Kohn	2005	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-005-0016-x	control engineering;simulation;engineering;cross-correlation;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;feed forward;statistics	ML	74.97550357642747	-11.730924176081446	28079

They compute forces oblivious of underactuation, and then they simply project the resulting forces to the actuated subspace. We propose instead a proxy-based haptic rendering method that computes displacements in the actuated subspace only, and then translates these displacements into force commands using regular controllers. Our method is well behaved in two important ways: it is locally passive w.r.t. the motion of the haptic device, and the displayed impedance can be easily controlled regardless of the mapping between device and virtual configuration spaces.	algorithm;approximation;characteristic impedance;computation;haptic technology;jacobian matrix and determinant;nonlinear system;proxy server;underactuation;virtual world;workspace	Daniel Lobo;Mine Sarac;Mickeal Verschoor;Massimiliano Solazzi;Antonio Frisoli;Miguel A.

The path is a paved road in the world or a marked curve on the floor of work area, for which each vehicle can measure the distance to the path and the heading error as well as the curvature of the path segment in its sensing range. Moreover, the vehicles can measure the arc distances of their neighbors that lie in their sensing range. A hybrid control approach is proposed to solve the problem. Depending on the posture with respect to the partly observed path, each vehicle either interacts with one of the others or works at the single-agent level. It is shown that the path following error of each vehicle is eventually reduced to zero and vehicles of every weakly connected component asymptotically converge to formations with equal arc distances.	algorithm;connected component (graph theory);connectivity (graph theory);converge;course (navigation);distributed control system;optimal control;poor posture;sensor;uniform resource identifier	Ying Lan;Gangfeng Yan;Zhiyun Lin	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2107070	control engineering;mobile robot;vehicle dynamics;simulation;fast path;engineering;trajectory;control theory;motion planning;robotics	Robotics	59.69112131013306	-18.457976539836334	28158

971da3dbfe6c05e2a47bc84bdaecb88da625e3de	interactive control paradigm-based robust lateral stability controller design for autonomous automobile path tracking with uncertain disturbance: a dynamic game approach		Stability as well as robustness is the major concerns in the design of a trajectory tracking controller for an autonomous vehicle. In this paper, a novel lateral stability controller design for vehicle path tracking is developed. First, using dynamic game theory as a general framework, vehicle lateral stability can be viewed as a dynamic difference game so that its two players, namely, the active front steering (AFS) system and active rear steering (ARS) system can work together to provide more stability for vehicle path tracking control. The interactive steering control strategies between AFS and ARS are obtained by noncooperative closed-loop feedback Stackelberg game theory to ensure optimal performance for vehicle path tracking. Then, based on the proposed path-following shared control paradigm, by applying the method of zero-sum game theory, a finite-time robust regulator is developed to make the interaction model more robust to uncertain lateral disturbances. Finally, double-lane change and serpentine driving condition with and without uncertain time-varying lateral disturbance are used to evaluate the proposed control algorithm. Simulation and hardware-in-loop implementation results show that the proposed shared control paradigm based robust path-tracking controller can robustly provide better lateral stability when time-varying lateral disturbances are bounded.	algorithm;autonomous car;autonomous robot;game theory;lateral computing;lateral thinking;programming paradigm;simulation	Xuewu Ji;Yulong Liu;Xiangkun He;Kaiming Yang;Xiaoxiang Na;Chen Lv;Yahui Liu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2834381	robustness (computer science);game theory;electronic engineering;control theory;interaction model;vehicle dynamics;sequential game;stackelberg competition;regulator;control theory;computer science	Robotics	63.9442737612431	-16.74658918659937	28262

Large rotations are easy to occur in these structures during assembling process due to their geometric features. So it is necessary to establish a precise model of the thin-walled structure to predict its deformation. In this study, the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) method is used to describe initial curved thin-walled structure and to study the compatibility of deformation of thin-walled structures during assembling process. A four-node shell element of ANCF with 48DOFs is employed to discrete the thin-walled structure. The vector of the element elastic forces and the stiffness matrix are derived based on continuum mechanics. Static deformation tests of a cantilever plate and the modal analysis of free square plate are used to validate the formulations for the plate element of ANCF. The statics equilibrium equations are deduced and the compatibility of deformation of two thin-walled structures is investigated.

In order to realize some visual performances by complicated eye movements, like tracking target, image stabilization and vestibulo-ocular reflex, we present the mechanism and simulation of a robot bionic eye based on spherical ultrasonic motor (SUSM) with three rotational degrees of freedom (3-DOF). SUSM is a compact mechanism occupying little space but good responsiveness, high positioning accuracy, high torque at low speed and strong magnetic field compatibility. So based on SUSM, the bionic eye is fit to solve the problem of vision instability during robots' working. The bionic eye is constructed of three annular stators adhered with several piezoelectric elements and a spherical rotor as a camera actuator. The rotor is driven by frictional forces from the three stators accompanying with same preload generated by the deformations of specialized coil springs. Through simulation by a virtual prototype to analyze the rotational speed, torque and responsiveness, our mechanical design is verified to be reasonable and effective preliminary.	visual prosthesis	Jun Luo;Chaojiong Huang;Hengyu Li;Shaorong Xie;Youmin Zhang	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33509-9_34	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering	EDA	73.41257118530777	-23.5950048501427	28312

For the vibration reduction issue alone, it is shown that almost all the proposed designs can be formulated as optimal controls of either the fixed final time or the minimum time type. Furthermore, it is shown that under reasonable assumptions the two types have the same solution and are thus equivalent. Continuous time, tapped-delay-line input shaping filters, and discrete controls are considered. It is shown that the discrete equivalent of the general vibration reduction problem is a convex problem for the fixed final time case and quasi-convex for the free final time problem.

Then, a new pinning control scheme is given such that the global synchronization can be ensured. Moreover, via the Lyapunov theory and graph theory, the synchronization errors are proved to be asymptotically convergent. Especially, in an uncertainty-free environment, the proposed control scheme includes two easy-to-implement pinning control strategies as special cases, which improve the existing results from the view point of reducing the number of feedback controllers.

Due to the nonlinear model of the ball's flight, only all state including the position and velocity at each event are catched, could its whole trajectory be obtained. However, since only the position could be measurable by cameras, the velocity should be predicted by the measured position. To solve this problem, this paper employs a novel output feedback observer to the ball's flight trajectory prediction for the velocity estimated. The stability and performance of the observer with exponential convergence is proven by Lyaponov method, and conditions for the stability of the observer are given. Compared with the traditional method, the approach proposed in the paper has some advantages of fast convergence and high precision.

These platforms are flexible, easy to use and low-cost, and they are the best candidates for improving the farm efficiency and productivity. In this research, a guidance algorithm and a robust control system are combined to guarantee the robustness of the system to additive noise (i.e. wind disturbance) and uncertainties (i.e. model parameter variations). A small fixed-wing UAV with an autonomy of about 1 hour is proposed as case study, to reduce the cost of monitoring and increasing the stability performance of the system. A waypoint-grid on a paddy field is verified by hardwarein-the loop tests. The control scheme provides good results with a low computational effort, guaranteeing the repeatability of the monitoring and reduction of the costs.	additive white gaussian noise;aerial photography;algorithm;autonomy;control system;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;real-time clock;repeatability;robust control;unmanned aerial vehicle;utility functions on indivisible goods;waypoint	Martina Mammarella;Elisa Capello	2018	CoRR		robust control;robustness (computer science);control theory;mathematics;repeatability;precision agriculture;wing	Robotics	61.42244206522561	-16.188716621911823	28488

Additionally, adaptive control techniques are used for the on-line training of the assembly. The industrial partner is Nippondenso of Nagoya, Japan. Notably, the industrial partner put their constraints on the project as follows: (i) only point-to-point position control was allowed; (ii) cheap (and noisy) force sensors were to be used for process monitoring only; and (iii) the cost of the infrastructure (grippers and pallets) must be kept to a minimum. Simple grippers were used which had an uncertainty of up to 4-2.5 mm. The smallest tolerance for the assembly was 0.075 mm. Yet, despite this difference, successful and reliable assembly was achieved. Moreover, the on-line adaptation scheme successfully allowed the robot to learn the assembly without human teaching.	assembly language;online and offline;point-to-point protocol;robot;sensor	Brenan J.

Our stepping algorithm is characterized by two simple models which idealize the movement of the stepping foot and the projected center of mass based on observations from a database of step motions. We draw a parallel between stepping and point-to-point reaching to motivate our foot model and employ an inverted pendulum model common in robotics for the center of mass. Our system computes path and speed profiles from each model and then adapts an interpolation to follow the synthesized trajectories in the final motion. We show that our animations can be enriched through the use of step examples, but also that we can synthesize stepping to create transitions between existing segments without the need for a motion example. We demonstrate that our system can generate precise, realistic stepping for a number of scenarios.	algorithm;interpolation;inverted pendulum;motion capture;point-to-point protocol;robotics;stepping level	Chun-Chih Wu;Jose Medina;Victor B.

The work is a first effort towards restoring natural like swing phase in paraplegic gait through a new hybrid orthosis, referred to as spring brake orthosis (SBO). This mechanism simplifies the control task and results in smooth motion and more-natural like trajectory produced by the flexion reflex for gait in spinal cord injured subjects. The study is carried out with a model of humanoid with wheel walker using the Visual Nastran (Vn4D) dynamic simulation software. Stimulated muscle model of quadriceps is developed for knee extension. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is developed in Matlab/Simulink to regulate the muscle stimulation pulse-width required to drive FES-assisted walking gait and the computed motion is visualised in graphic animation from Vn4D and finite state control is used to control the transaction between all walking states. Finite state control (FSC) is used to control the switching of brakes, FES and spring during walking cycle.	amiga walker;digital single-lens reflex camera;functional electrical stimulation;fuzzy logic;logic control;matlab;nastran;sap business one;shin megami tensei: persona 3;simulation software;simulink;spring framework	Rozita Jailani;M.

By employing suitable Lyapunov functionals and using the upper bound norm for the interconnection matrices of the neural network system, some novel sufficient conditions ensuring the existence, uniqueness and global robust stability of the equilibrium point are derived. The obtained results impose constraint conditions on the system parameters of neural network independent of the delay parameters. Some numerical examples and simulation results are given to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our results, and to compare the results with previous robust stability results derived in the literature. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To achieve that objective, we studied a control method that combines the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian, and a bang-bang controller. Referred to as energy evaluation control (EEC), this method evaluates the control state using the Lagrangian, and evolves the control output using the Hamiltonian. Here, the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian are defined for the deceleration field. The control result from the EEC is fast and robust. Moreover, EEC has the same control strategy as the sliding-mode control, and hence can be incorporated within it.	bang file;bang–bang control;control system;control theory;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);lagrangian (field theory);lagrangian system;robustness (computer science)	Yasushi Yamamoto;Shinya Hasegawa;Satoru Iwamori;Shigeru Yamaguchi	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)		control engineering;mathematical optimization;energy;hamiltonian;control theory;lagrangian;bang–bang control	Robotics	66.92085991896889	-14.151266505367781	28708

The traditional backstepping control method is modified so that it can be directly applied to systems in block semi-strict-feedback form. The terms in the dynamic equations which do not satisfy the block strict-feedback form are accumulated in the last design step and are suppressed effectively by the adaptive gains, so that the property of asymptotic stability is achieved. Adaptive mechanisms are employed in each of the virtual input controllers as well as the robust controller, hence the least upper bounds of perturbations are not required to be known in advance. A numerical example and a practical application are also given for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.	semiconductor industry	Yan-Si Lin;Chih-Chiang Cheng	2016	Int. J.

The proposed design methodology is based on the equivalence between decentralized static velocity-feedback controllers and passive damping systems. By using recent developments in static output-feedback control, the design of passive-damping systems can be formulated as a single optimization problem with Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. Moreover, this optimization problem can be efficiently solved with standard numerical tools, even for large dimension systems. Due to its computational effectiveness, the proposed methodology can be applied to the design of passive damping systems for large structures. To illustrate the main ideas and methods, a passive damping system is designed for the seismic protection of a five-story building with excellent results.	computation;feedback;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;turing completeness;velocity (software development)	Francisco Palacios-Quiñonero;Hamid Reza Karimi;Josep Rubió-Massegú;Josep M.

The controller requires limited model information, specifically, knowledge of the relative degree and the first nonzero Markov parameter. Furthermore, the controller is effective for stabilisation, command following and rejection of unknown-and-unmeasured disturbances. This article analyses the stability and closed-loop performance (i.e. command following error) of filtered dynamic inversion, which is a single-parameter high-parameter-stabilising controller. We show that for sufficiently large parameter the closed-loop is asymptotically stable, and the average power of the performance signal is arbitrarily small.	minimum phase	Jesse B. Hoagg;T. M.

Unlike the common assumptions on continuous-time information exchanges, a more realistic sampled-data communication strategy is proposed with probabilistic occurrence of time-varying delays. Both of the sampling period and the delays are assumed to be time-varying, which is more general in some practical situations. In addition, the relative coordinate derivative information is not required in the distributed controllers such that the communication network burden can be further reduced. In particular, a distinct feature of the proposed scheme lies in the fact that it can effectively reduce the energy consumption. By employing the stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the consensus can be achieved. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the applicability and benefits of the theoretical results.	anatomy, regional;assumed;consensus (computer science);controllers;display lag;euler;euler–lagrange equation;mean squared error;numerical analysis;population parameter;probability;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;telecommunications network;time complexity;benefit	Chao Ma;Peng Shi;Xudong Zhao;Qingshuang Zeng	2015	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2014.2345735	stochastic process;mathematical optimization;consensus;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	65.77262988272976	4.166450395981258	28837

The PDFs can be approximated by the radial basis functions (RBFs) of neural networks. Differently from the conventional FTC problems, the measured information is in the form of probability distributions of the system output rather than the actual output values. The control objective is to use the output PDFs to design control algorithm that can compensate the faults and attenuate the disturbances. As a result, the concerned FTC problem subject to dynamic relation between the input and output PDFs can be transformed into a nonlinear FTC problem subject to dynamic relation between the control input and the weights of the RBFs neural networks. Feasible criteria to compensate the faults and attenuate the disturbances are provided in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. In order to improve FTC performances, H∞ optimization techniques are applied to the FTC design problem to assure that the faults can be compensated and the disturbances can be attenuated. At last, an illustrated example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and the satisfactory results have been obtained.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;fault tolerance;input/output;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;pid;performance;portable document format;radial (radio);radial basis function;secure digital container;simulation;social inequality	Yi Qu;Zhan-ming Li;Er-Chao Li	2013	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-012-9440-z	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.59674205148694	-5.4114956788825985	28846

5130219597c3a216f28eb9a687a2edb2f6a81040	iterative learning in repetitive optimal control of linear dynamic processes		Learning of stochastically independent decisions is a well developed theory, the main of its part being pattern recognition algorithms. Learning of dependent decisions for discrete time sequences, e.g., for patterns forming a Markov chain and decision support systems, is also developed, but many classes of problems still remain open. Learning sequences of decisions for systems with continuously running time is still under development. In this paper we provide an approach that is based on the idea of iterative learning for repetitive control systems. A new ingredient is that our system learns to find the optimal control that minimizes a quality criterion and attempts to find it even if there are uncertainties in the system parameters. Such approach requires to record and store full sequences of the system state, which can be done using a camera for monitoring of the system states. The theory is illustrated by an example of a laser cladding process.	iterative method;optimal control	Ewaryst Rafajlowicz;Wojciech Rafajlowicz	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39378-0_60	mathematical optimization;control theory;iterative learning control	ML	61.429676501379866	-2.8768608404256155	28901

6666a3d0916a9d33d904dd2974df4f03dd4a0489	nonlinear h∞ feedback control with integrator for polynomial discrete-time systems		This paper investigates the problem of designing a nonlinear   H ∞        H    ∞          feedback controller for polynomial discrete-time systems with and without polytopic uncertainties. The objective is to design a controller such that the ratio between the energy of the regulated outputs and the energy of the exogenous disturbance/inputs is minimized or guaranteed to be less or equal to a prescribed value. It is well known that the state dependant or parameter dependant Lyapunov function is always chosen for synthesizing polynomial discrete-time systems. This leads the solution to be nonconvex because the Lyapunov function and the controller matrix are coupled and therefore cannot be solved by semidefinite programming (SDP). Hence, in this paper, an integrator is proposed to be incorporated into the controller structure. In doing so, the coupling of Lyapunov function and controller matrix can be eliminated effectively. This somehow simplifies the numerical solution of the problem. Then, by using SOS decomposition approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed controller are provided in terms of solvability of the state-dependent linear matrix inequalities (SDLMIs) which can be solved by SDP. A tunnel diode circuit is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrator approach.	feedback;polynomial	Shakir Saat;Sing Kiong Nguang;Abdul Majid Darsono;Noorazma Azman	2014	J.

This auxiliary problem is then solved by some developed robust control techniques, such as multiple high-gain feedback and mixed distributed observer, leading to an effective distributed output feedback regulator synthesis for the original cooperative output regulation problem.	block cipher mode of operation;mimo;multi-agent system;numerous;robust control	Ying Zhang;Youfeng Su	2017	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-017-9255-2	mimo;robust control;internal model;observer (quantum physics);control theory;multi-agent system;mathematics;regulator	ML	64.6184410229331	3.373309661580251	28950

An adaptive fault tolerant control method is proposed for robot manipulators to maintain the required performance in the presence of actuation degradation, and the same adaptive algorithm is utilized to detect actuation failures. The proposed method can compensate for the effects of not only the parametric model uncertainty such as payload variations, but also the uncertainty in the actuation torque coefficients. The proposed approach integrates functions of parameter estimation, control law, actuator fault tolerance and fault detection. Theoretical analysis and simulation results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Index Terms – Robot fault detection, fault tolerant control, adaptive control, and actuator failures. I. INTRDUCTION Most robot fault tolerant control works are focused on the control of underactuated robots, i.e. one or more robot joints have failed, and actuation at those joints has been lost completely [1,10]. The present paper addresses the problems of actuator performance degradation and its on-line monitoring, as well as failure detection. Typical actuator faults are caused by overheating and mechanical component wear, which may not happen as abrupt failures. In this work, we consider an actuator fails if its torque coefficient deviates beyond an acceptable limit. The proposed approach is to design an adaptive control scheme that can maintain the required performance in the presence of actuation degradation, and to detect actuator failures when the actuation performance degrades beyond an acceptable limit. Robust and adaptive control approaches for robot manipulators typically deal with model uncertainties such as payload variations and joint friction [5,6,7,11,12]. In such control approaches, the joint actuators are considered as precise torque sources, and robustness against actuator performance degradation is not accommodated. In case of actuator performance degradation, such controllers cannot take appropriate correction actions and may continue to drive the actuator until it is damaged. The actuator dynamics is incorporated in the overall robot dynamic model in some robust and adaptive control methods [8, 13], and parametric model uncertainty in the actuator dynamics are treated together with other uncertain parameters. Since the actuator dynamics is incorporated in the dynamic model, such control * This work is supported in part by NSERC, Canada, through the grants 227633-00 and 229465-00, and in part by Ryerson Polytechnic University. schemes may be straightforwardly extended to detect actuator faults. However, since the overall dynamic model has higher order, the synthesis of control algorithm is complicated, and the measurement for joint acceleration [8] or the derivative of actuator current [13] is required. As reliability and safety are becoming more and more important in the operation of autonomous and intelligent robotic systems, it is desirable that a robot controller can monitor the actuator performance on-line and detect actuator faults. Depending on the task and environment of the robot manipulator, the robot joint with actuator performance degradation may be kept operating, or be put into a safe mode to avoid unnecessary damages. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) has been extensively studied for industrial process control [4]. Robot fault detection recently attracted significant research interests. In [10], the position and velocity tracking errors are used to detect joint failures. A robot joint is detected failed if a selected combination of the position error and velocity error is larger than a predefined threshold. While it is possible to define such a threshold for a specific trajectory after some online tuning, it is generally difficult to define a globally efficient error threshold because the robot tracking error depends on the control law types and parameters, the payload variation, the position and orientation of the robot manipulator, etc. The cause for larger tracking errors might not be a joint failure. In [2] observers are developed for fault detection. Residuals are generated by comparing measured system outputs and those predicted by the observers. However, in the observer-based methods, the estimation or measurement of joint acceleration is required. Recently, in [3], an actuator fault detection method is formulated using full manipulator dynamics. The torque estimate is filtered in order to eliminate the need for joint acceleration measurement. Adaptive and robust techniques are then applied to deal with model uncertainties. In this paper, an adaptive control approach is proposed to maintain the desired performance in the presence of actuation degradation, to monitor the degradation on-line, and to detect actuator failures. In the proposed approach, the actuator dynamics is still considered fast enough and can be neglected for the positional trajectory tracking control, but the torque coefficients are incorporated in a new parametric dynamic model formulation with the commanded joint torques as inputs instead of the actual joint torques. Based on the proposed model formulation, an adaptive control scheme is synthesized to compensate for parametric model uncertainties including that in the actuator torque coefficients. The embedded adaptation law is used to update the actuator torque coefficients together with the inertial parameters of the robot Control of Robot Manipulators with Consideration of Actuator Performance Degradation and Failures G.

e360c0a43bc5e9c01bc0fd2ae3d74bbe538b9557	adaptive smith predictive control of non-linear systems using neurofuzzy hammerstein models	predictive control	This paper proposes an Adaptive Smith Predictor Controller (ASPC) based on Neuro-Fuzzy Hammerstein Models (NFHM) with on-line non-linear model parameters identification. The NFHM approach uses a zeroorder Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model to approximate the non-linear static function that is tuned off-line using gradient decent algorithm and to identify the linear dynamic function it is used the Recursive Least Square estimation with Covariance Matrix Reset (RLSCMR). This algorithm has the capability of follow fast and slow dynamic parameter changes. The proposed ASPC has special capabilities to control non-linear systems that have gain, time delay and dynamic changes through time. The implementation of the ASPC is made in two steps: first, off-line estimation of the non-linear static parameters that will be used to “get linear” the non-linearity of the system and second, on-line identification of the linear dynamic parameters updating direct and inverse models used in the ASPC. As an illustrative example, a gas water heater system is controlled with the ASPC. Finally, the control results are compared with the results obtained with the Smith Predictive Controller based in a Semi-Physical Model (SPMSPC). 1 This work was supported in part by the Portuguese Government through the PREDEP program.	approximation algorithm;broadcast delay;gradient;linear model;linear system;method (computer programming);neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;online and offline;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;smith predictor	José M.

Linear platoon technology is considered as a potential base for the definition of new urban transportation services. The main problems related to platoon systems is the geometry control: control of inter-vehicle distance and common trajectory matching. The geometry control problem is generally treated according to one of two approaches: global or local. This paper focuses on a local approach which does not require sophisticated sensors and/or costly road equipment. The objective of this local control approach allows satisfactory distance regulation and matching to any common trajectory, by using local perception capabilities of platoon’s vehicles. The basic perception capability consists in measuring the vectorial distance between a given vehicle and its predecessor. The behavior of each platoon vehicle is determined by a physics inspired interaction model based on a virtual spring-damper. Stability and other platoon safety properties are analyzed on the base of the physics inspired interaction model. Both simulation and experimentation have been used to measure trajectory error and to evaluate inter-vehicle distance during platoon evolution.	agent architecture;computer simulation;displacement mapping;emoticon;formal specification;lateral thinking;maximal set;model checking;multi-agent system;platoon (automobile);sensor;simulation;transfer function	Jean-Michel Contet;Franck Gechter;Pablo Gruer;Abder Koukam	2011	IJISTA	10.1504/IJISTA.2011.040348	control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;systems modeling;reactive system;process capability index;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;transport engineering;intelligent agent	Robotics	59.70670870830868	-18.01111431682441	28987

In particular, the practical parametric uncertainties involving sliding friction, uncertain payload, and disturbance in tracking tasks are considered in this paper. Combining Grünwald–Letnikov fractional order definition and terminal sliding mode technique, the proposed method synthesizes a novel DFOTSM control law to drive the sliding mode dynamics into the stable region in finite steps theoretically, even though the system is suffering from uncertainties and disturbances, and the motion on the surface can guarantee higher tracking precision than the conventional discrete-time terminal sliding surface by selecting suitable controller parameters. The theoretical analyses give out the guideline of parameter selection, and experiments are carried out on the linear-motor-based test platform to demonstrate that the proposed controller is easily implemented and can achieve high-precision tracking, fast response, and considerable robustness to uncertainties.	control theory;experiment;optimal control	Guanghui Sun;Zhiqiang Ma;Jinyong Yu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2748045	robustness (computer science);sliding mode control;control theory;control engineering;control theory;linear motor;parametric statistics;discrete time and continuous time;engineering;motion control;terminal sliding mode	Robotics	65.79680712803604	-10.691215721886243	28996

Necessary and sumcient conditions for the existence of a static state feedback that achieves noninteraction and internal stability are obtained. This is accomplished by first characterizing the set of all controllability subspaces (distributions) that can arise as solutions to the noninteracting control problem. This characterization is then used to identify a fixed internal dynamics that is common to every noninteractive closed loop. The stability properties of this dynamics is shown to be the key factor in the problem of achieving noninteracting control with internal stability.	closed-loop transfer function;emoticon;interactivity;land;robertson–seymour theorem	Jessy W.

Under this setting, the paper proposes a direct HDP learning control algorithm for a static var compensator (SVC) supplementary damping control in a standard benchmark power system. The results are used to evaluate the online learning ability of the proposed direct HDP controller, and also to demonstrate that the learning controller does converge to the theoretical limit as derived.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);converge;dynamic programming;heuristic;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;simulation	Chao Lu;Jennie Si;Xiaorong Xie;Jie Song	2007	2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371079	mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;computer science;machine learning;dynamic programming;control theory;static var compensator;electric power system;artificial neural network	Robotics	61.49565611604724	-2.3268221693869937	29051

For this system class, the problem of designing dynamic controllers for input-to-state stabilization in H1-norm with respect to measurement errors is considered. The analysis is based on constructing a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, which leads to controller synthesis and the conditions on system dynamics required for stability. As an application of this stability notion, the problem of quantized control for hyperbolic PDEs is considered where the measurements sent to the controller are communicated using a quantizer of finite length. The presence of quantizer yields practical stability only, and the ultimate bounds on the norm of the state trajectory are also derived.

In this paper, we propose a method for privacy verification of cyber-physical systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) based on barrier certificates. To this end, we consider an opacity-based notion of privacy, which is characterized by the beliefs in system states. We show that the belief update equations can be represented as discrete-time switched systems, for which we propose a set of conditions for privacy verification in terms of barrier certificates. We further demonstrate that, for MDPs and for POMDPs, privacy verification can be computationally implemented by solving a set of semi-definite programs and sum-of-squares programs, respectively. The method is illustrated by an application to privacy verification of an inventory management system.

To remedy those results, two new doubly coprime factorizations have been developed that will parameterize all properly stabilizing controllers for single-input or single-output cases. In addition, the new results can characterize the parameterization of all corresponding causal properly stabilizing controllers.

In this paper some of those methods are selected and applied to a nonlinear mechanical system in order to identify a local linear state space description of the underlying system. The considered plant is an actuated multibody system with two inputs and two outputs. The nonlinear nature of such a system leads to unstable behavior in some operating conditions so the system has to be operated in closed loop control during the identification procedure too. Considering these demands for the process of system identification the capability of subspace-based methods to identify stable and unstable MIMO systems using input-output data obtained from closed loop control experiments is investigated.	control theory;experiment;mimo;nonlinear system;performance tuning;service robot;simulation;state space;state-space representation;system identification	Mathias Marquardt;Peter Dünow;Sandra Basler;Frank Wobbe	2015	2015 20th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2015.7283958	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.20695458366885	-4.608563015762788	29255

The electric resistance (ER) of a SMA wire varies depending on its martensite and austenite fraction, so the determination of the biunivocal relationship between the wire shortening and its electric resistance allows """"previewing"""" the position of the SMA wire. In this way the resistance of the SMA wire can be used as feedback variable in a control system. A test bench was first used to determine the above mentioned relationship, and then this relation is used in a fuzzy control system to impose a desired position to a SMA wire and to check the response of the device. This type of control doesn't need a position sensor, which is a certain advantage in terms of cost, overall dimensions and weight for possible applications. The performances of this position control with resistance feedback are good and adequate for many applications; in particular it will be suitable for all applications which do not dispose of space to place a position sensor—like in aerospace applications or micro manufacturing."""	alloy analyzer	Daniela Maffiodo;Terenziano Raparelli	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21290-6_10	control engineering;engineering;forensic engineering;engineering drawing	EDA	73.8532842576084	-17.779697948090682	29278

It was drawn through the simulation result that the fuzzy control strategy for the engine start/stop can really prevent from frequent start/stop in low speed, and that the equivalent fuel consumption with fuzzy logic control strategy decreases by 4.6% than that with rule strategy.	avl tree;co-simulation;control theory;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;logic control;matlab;rule-based system;simulation;simulink	Lianghui Yang;Hongwen He;Fengchun Sun;Shaoyou Shi;Yujun Li;Li Liu	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569120	fuzzy logic;system on a chip;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuel efficiency;torque;fuzzy control system	Robotics	57.081404001662285	-10.95323232978729	29338

9db2ce58f15e10a016aab91991ff89fe617e4c2f	integrated diesel engine and selective catalytic reduction system active nox control for fuel economy improvement		Diesel engine technologies have gone through significant progresses in the past decade. Though the tailpipe NOx and particulate matter emissions have been reduced to a large extent by the applications of after-treatment systems such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems and Diesel particulate filters, engine fuel economy usually needs to be compromised considerably to achieve appropriate engine-out emissions. Most of the current Diesel engine control studies focus only on the Diesel engines themselves, while most of the current aftertreatment controls are limited in the scope of aftertreatment systems alone. The opportunities of further improving the overall powertrain system performance by considering the engine and aftertreatment system in an integrative way have been rarely exploited. In this paper, a new framework for integrated control of both engine and aftertreatment system is devised. A backstepping-based active NOx control method is proposed by treating the engine-out NOx concentration as a control input for the ammonia coverage ratio control of a two-cell SCR system. Simulation results based on the UDDS driving cycle show that up to 5.86% of engine fuel consumption can be reduced without a significant penalty on the tailpipe emissions.	control theory;diesel;optimal control;rewriting;simulation	Pingen Chen;Junmin Wang	2013	2013 American Control Conference			EDA	55.5575494147134	-5.973202436847606	29379

The Cartesian stiffness matrix of the robots is modeled with the virtual spring approach. By means of a nondimensionalization of the stiffness matrix, the 6 × 6 inhomogeneous stiffness matrix is decomposed into two homogeneous sub-matrices, of which two performance indices, corresponding to the translational and rotational stiffnesses, are defined to evaluate the stiffness behaviors of the manipulators. A comparative study among the robot counterparts is carried out with respect to the elasto-static performance.	cartesian closed category;jacobian matrix and determinant;quattro pro;robot;smt placement equipment;stiffness matrix;workspace	Guanglei Wu;Shaoping Bai;Preben Hjornet	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487217	structural engineering;control engineering;tangent stiffness matrix;engineering;direct stiffness method;control theory	Robotics	69.81746461744697	-21.217999323811352	29404

We address a final objective of fixed-time pose-regulation, which means that the robot position and orientation must reach desired final values simultaneously in a user-defined time. To achieve that, we propose the robust tracking of adequate trajectories for position, which drives the robot to get a desired final orientation due to the nonholonomic motion constraint. Hence, the main contribution of the paper is a complete strategy to define adequate reference trajectories as well as robust controllers to track them in order to enforce the pose-regulation of a wheeled mobile robot in a desired time. Realistic simulations show the good performance of the proposed scheme even in the presence of strong disturbances.	b-spline;control theory;mobile robot;parabolic antenna;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Héctor M.

The corresponding problem has been solved with the help of advanced real coded Genetic Algorithm (GA). The nonlinearity of suspension spring and damper, which are the most important characteristics of the suspension, has been taken into account in order to validate the model to real applications. The nonlinear cubic polynomial has been used to describe the spring characteristic and a quadratic polynomial has been used to describe the damper characteristic. The coefficients of each polynomial represent the design parameters of the suspension system and are to be determined. To find these parameters we have formulated a nonlinear optimization problem in which the bouncing transmissibility of the sprung mass at the center of mass has been minimized with respect to technological constraints and the constraints which satisfy the performance as per ISO 2631 standards. The advanced real coded GA has been used to solve this problem in time domain and the results obtained have been compared to those obtained using the existing design parameters. The objective function and the constraints have been evaluated by simulating the vehicle model over two roads with multiple bumps at uniform velocity.	genetic algorithm	Syeda Darakhshan Jabeen	2013	IJMSSC	10.1142/S1793962312500225	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;control theory	EDA	62.91533699584372	-18.828617002548377	29465

To conveniently define an asymmetric walking pattern, a gait is characterized here in terms of the left and the right legs instead of the support and the swing legs. Another benefit of this characterization is that the joint positions become well-defined and continuous throughout a walking process even under impulse effects caused by impacts. A more general walking encoding method is then introduced, which not only includes walking pattern encoding but also enables upper-level task planning and control. Walking dynamics is then rewritten with the roles of the left and the right legs differentiated and with the biped's global position included. The desired walking pattern, as well as the desired global motion, is tracked exponentially fast through a controller designed using the output feedback linearization method. Stability of the hybrid dynamical control system is analyzed based on the construction of multiple Lyapunov functions. Finally, a fully actuated compass-gait biped is simulated to show that the proposed framework can realize exponentially stable walking, both symmetric and asymmetric, while satisfactorily tracking the desired walking pattern and the planned global motion.	block cipher mode of operation;control system;high- and low-level;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;simulation;underactuation	Yan Gu;Bin Yao;C.

Approximate model inversion transforms the plant into an equivalent linear form. A linear error controller enables tracking of a designer chosen reference model. The control framework is augmented by an L1 adaptive controller, in order to cope with uncertainties. Due to the nature of the L1 controller, performance and robustness are decoupled, which allows for a fast and reliable compensation of faults. We present a condition on the control allocation in order to achieve attitude stabilization during hover. The performance of the control architecture is corroborated in numerical simulation using a high fidelity simulation model of a hexacopter system. After that flight test results with motor degradation are presented.	computer simulation;continuation;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;reference model	Maximilian Mühlegg;Philipp Niermeyer;Guillermo P.

2e2af0deaf25fffddeea4f6eeeecf46bc33421e0	frequency domain approach for dynamics identification of the actuator with asymmetric hysteresis		Micro/nano-manipulation systems have been developed and utilized for decades due to their irreplaceable roles in fields such as MEMS/NEMS fabrication and biological studies. Generally, the motion precision of a micro/nano-manipulator highly depends on its actuator, whose performance can be enhanced by proper control strategies. To design satisfactory controllers, an accurate plant model is ideal. For micro/nano-manipulators, the implemented actuators are mostly Smart Materials (SMs), which exhibit strong hysteretic and dynamic coupling characteristics. The construction of linear dynamics preceded by hysteresis is a prevalent representation for describing SM actuators' behaviors. To effectively and accurately model SM actuators, this paper employs the Extended Unparallel Prandtl-Ishlinskii (EUPI) model to describe complicated hysteretic behaviors. For modeling dynamics of SM actuators, firstly, the EUPI inverse is implemented to compensate the hysteretic effect of the plant; subsequently, the Weighted Complex Least-Squares (WCLS) identification method is proposed to estimate parameters of the dynamic part in the form of complex number function. To guarantee stability of the identified model, the Particle Swarm Optimization based WCLS (PSO-WCLS) optimization approach is proposed. The advantage of the proposed modeling scheme is that, it is capable of accurately describing complicated hysteresis of SM actuators and does not require the drive signal to be small while modeling its dynamics; besides this scheme contains frequency domain identification merits, such as easy noise reduction and easy combination of data from different experiments. The modeling and identification scheme is verified through comparison tests conducted on a piezoelectric actuator platform.

Then, the existence of optimal solution of fuzzy feedback control using SIRMs method is derived from these facts.	fuzzy logic;logic control	Takashi Mitsuishi;Hidefumi Kawakatsu;Yasunari Shidama	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15393-8_32	control engineering;discrete mathematics;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics	AI	62.248500071848376	-5.699343035799535	29614

By using Genetic Algorithms (GAs), changes are introduced to the fan shape looking for a better aerodynamic performance.

By fully making use of sensor measurements, the model dependence of this control method is reduced, which is conducive to handling disturbance from the unknown aerodynamic effects. This controller is tested on a quadrotor vehicle with one rotor completely removed in the high-speed condition. Free flights are performed in the Open Jet Facility, a large-scale wind tunnel. Over 9 m/s flight speed is reached for the damaged quadrotor in these tests.

A new path primitive, called eta3-spline, is proposed. It is a seventh order polynomial spline which permits the interpolation of an arbitrary sequence of points with associated arbitrary tangent directions, curvatures, and curvature derivatives, so that an overall G3-path is planned. A G3-path or path with third order geometric continuity has continuous tangent vector, curvature, and curvature derivative along the arc length. Adopting this planning scheme and a dynamic path inversion technique, the robot's command velocities are continuous with continuous accelerations. The new primitive depends on a vector (eta) of six parameters that can be used to finely shape the path. The eta3-spline can generate or approximate, in a unified framework, a variety of curve primitives such as circular arcs, clothoids, spirals, etc. The paper includes theoretical results, path planning examples, and a note on general etak-splines.	approximation algorithm;etak;interpolation;mobile robot;motion planning;polynomial;scott continuity;spline (mathematics);unified framework;vector graphics	Aurelio Piazzi;Corrado Guarino Lo Bianco;Massimo Romano	2007	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2007.903816	inversion;motion control;mobile robot;mathematical optimization;interpolation;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;geometry;motion planning;arc length;curvature;robotics	Robotics	62.15014489735637	-21.158096929831657	29787

334cef377636b1a651154a24057e971d00069a19	a novel highly hyperchaotic system and its adaptive control		In this work, we describe a twelve-term novel highly hyperchaotic system with four quadratic nonlinearities and an exponential nonlinearity. The phase portraits of the twelve-term novel hyperchaotic system are depicted and the qualitative properties of the novel hyperchaotic system are discussed. The novel hyperchaotic system has two unstable equilibrium points. The Lyapunov exponents of the novel hyperchaotic system are obtained as (L_1 = 14.5577, L_2 = 0.1225, L_3 = 0) and (L_4 = -36.3884). The maximal Lyapunov exponent of the novel hyperchaotic system has a high value, viz. (L_1 = 14.5577). Thus, the novel 4-D system shows highly hyperchaotic behavior. Also, the Kaplan–Yorke dimension of the novel hyperchaotic system is obtained as (D_{KY} = 3.4045), which is a high value for a 4-D hyperchaotic system. Since the sum of the Lyapunov exponents is negative, the novel hyperchaotic system is dissipative. Next, an adaptive controller is designed to globally stabilize the highly hyperchaotic system with unknown parameters. Finally, an adaptive controller is also designed to achieve global chaos synchronization of the identical highly hyperchaotic systems with unknown parameters. MATLAB simulations are presented to depict the phase portraits of the novel highly hyperchaotic system and illustrate all the main adaptive control results derived in this work.

It is used to interactively optimize mechanical characteristics while “self-assembling” or satisfying large systems of mechanical constraints. The high speed method is central to providing inverse dynamics force feedback in haptics and control applications. Performance advantages with the use of augmented coordinates for inverse dynamics of closed loop topologies are also noted. The interaction framework allows manipulation of complex assemblies while maintaining kinematically admissible configurations though linkage and joint limit constraints. Furthermore, design variables such as link length can be treated as free variables and optimized to meet design criteria such as assembly dexterity. Assemblies with flexible bodies fit naturally within this framework. Thus, the contribution of this paper is the advancement of techniques in augmented coordinates for the kinematic and force feedback interaction with virtual mechanical assembly design optimization at force control rates.	computer-aided design;free variables and bound variables;haptic technology;interactivity;inverse dynamics;linkage (software);mathematical optimization	Donald D.

The overall control system can be viewed as a feedback interconnection of a SISO plant, a set of candidate controllers and a switched selection scheme that supervises the switching process among the candidate controllers. The switching scheme is designed without explicit assumptions on the plant model, based on the unfalsified control concept introduced by Safonov et al. [1, 2]. A switched multicontroller structure is implemented and experimental results are presented.	algorithm;control system;frequency response;interconnection;performance evaluation;process modeling;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder	Fernando Costa;Fernando Vieira Coito;Luís Brito Palma	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19170-1_43	control engineering;electronic engineering;adaptive control;engineering;control system;control theory	Robotics	66.71895010662159	-6.264584711673825	29871

Based on an approximate finite-dimensional model of the infinite-dimensional system, a set of stabilizing distributed model-based controllers are initially designed. Communication between the control configurations is realized through an event-triggered strategy which suspends and restores the sensors' transmission over the network when certain stability thresholds are met or violated. The communication strategy is dual-mode in that it switches between two complementary modes of transmission: a decentralized mode in which local communication triggers control the broadcast events of a given configuration, and a centralized mode in which the broadcast events of all configurations are coordinated by a high-level supervisor in response to a global communication trigger. It is shown that the decentralized mode reduces the network load during the transient phase, whereas the centralized mode ensures ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories under non-vanishing perturbations. The results are illustrated using a simulation example.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;high- and low-level;network switch;nonlinear system;parabolic antenna;sensor;simulation	Da Xue;Nael H.

The uncertain Markovian jump system under consideration involves parameter uncertainties both in the system matrices and in the mode transition rate matrix. First, a new criterion for testing the robust stability of such systems is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Then, a sufficient condition is proposed for the design of robust state-feedback controllers. A globally convergent algorithm involving convex optimization is also presented to help construct such controllers effectively. Finally, a numerical simulation is used to illustrate the developed theory. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The matrix defining the linear system (system matrix) is assumed to depend affinely on a set of time-invariant unknown parameters lying on a known polytope. Robust stability is investigated by checking whether a certain integer power κ of the uncertain system matrix has spectral norm less than one. This peculiar stability test is shown to be equivalent to the positivity analysis of a homogeneous symmetric matrix polynomial with precisely known coefficients and degree indexed by κ. A unique feature is that no extra variables need to be added to the problems being solved. Numerical experiments reveal that the value of κ needed to test robust stability is mostly independent of the system dimension but grows sharply as the eigenvalues of the uncertain system approach the unit circle.

3b7763ddbfe94725f3b2740b3b4d8f1a4f971aed	bio-inspired robust control of a robot arm-and-hand system based on human viscoelastic properties		A bio-inspired scheme based on the human multi-joint arm (HMJA) viscoelastic properties is proposed to design a robust controller for the complex robot arm-and-hand system (RAHS) using the operator-based robust right coprime factorization (RRCF) approach. The RAHS mainly consists of two components, a robot arm and a micro-hand with three fingers. The fingers are made up of miniature pneumatic curling soft (MPCS) actuators, and are located in the endpoint of the robot arm. The aim is for a human to intuitively control the robot arm to perform a task under unknown environments from a remote location. We identify the main limitations of standard interaction control schemes in obtaining the learned information pairs, then propose a new control approach that is inspired by the biological model of HMJA viscoelasticity in voluntary movements. To achieve the precise position of the robot arm and obtain the desired force using the micro-hand for coping with the external environment or task involved, we propose a two-loop feedback control architecture using the operator-based RRCF approach. The bio-inspired inner-loop controller is designed based on HMJA viscoelastic properties to control the angular position of the robot arm. The outer-loop controller is designed to control the fingers force by considering the stable inner-loop as a right factorization. The robust tracking conditions and the realization of the proposed control system are also discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control system is also verified by simulation results based on experimental data.	robotic arm;robust control	Aihui Wang;Hongnian Yu;Shuang Cang	2017	J.

In the model, two control variables representing the quarantine and isolation strategies are considered. The necessary conditions for the corresponding optimal control in the sense of minimum cost are obtained via the maximum principle. The numerical control laws are presented in an iterative method. The simulation results demonstrate that the maximum applications of quarantining and isolation strategies in the early phase of the epidemic are typical characteristics of the optimal control. Otherwise, the control effect will be much worse. This gives a theoretical interpretation to the fact that the early quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of epidemics	catastrophic interference;control theory;iterative method;numerical analysis;optimal control;simulation	Xiefei Yan;Yun Zou	2006	2006 9th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2006.345261	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;mathematics;iterative method	Robotics	61.35470838165757	2.0726904098428567	30089

We assume that a continuous-time controller has been designed so that the continuous-time closed-loop satisfies all performance requirements. Then, we use this control law indirectly to compute numerically a sampled-data controller. Our approach exploits a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that minimizes the mismatch between the solutions of the sampled-data model and the continuous-time closed-loop model. We propose a control law and present conditions under which stability and sub-optimality of the closed loop can be proved. We only consider the case of unconstrained MPC. We show that the recent results in [6] can be directly used for analysis of stability of our closed-loop system.	closed-loop transfer function;data model;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;requirement;zero-order hold	Dragan Nesic;Lars Grüne	2006	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2005.09.013	control engineering;simulation;systems modeling;nonlinear system;data model;lyapunov function;engineering;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control;zero-order hold	Robotics	72.22098687061163	-3.792811517470616	30205

Our main contribution is to prove that if the expectation of the time between two consecutive switching (dwell time) is “sufficiently large” then the system is stable under switching with guaranteed probability. We illustrate this methodology by constructing measurement feedback controllers for a wide class of stochastic nonlinear systems.	design tool;electronic switching system;markov chain;nonlinear system;stochastic process	Stefano Battilotti;Alberto De Santis	2005	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2004.11.024	control engineering;markov chain;simulation;nonlinear system;control theory;dwell time;mathematics;markov model;statistics	Robotics	73.23971717888824	-2.7850667739703368	30235

0e6cff692ea8d22eb33278040969dd3323919541	vertical movement control of quad-thrust aerial robot - design, analysis and experimental validation		In this paper we focus on the problem of the vertical movement control and approach to control algorithm implementation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), known as a quadrotor. The most important control subsystems for the VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) are the attitude stabilization and the altitude regulation. Both systems are presented in this paper. However, the vertical movement of the platform has been confined to precise operations such as taking-off and landing. These actions demand high reliability and they are very crucial for autonomous flights. The design, analysis and the validation tests have been undertaken on the experimental aerial platform.	aerial photography;algorithm;autonomous robot;thrust;unmanned aerial vehicle	Roman Czyba;Grzegorz Szafranski	2011			engineering;control engineering;robot;thrust	Robotics	62.434414657472665	-17.096260632156294	30353

Effect of various mechanisms’ parameters including crank length, flexibility of the connecting rod and the slider׳s mass on the dynamic behaviour is studied. Two control schemes are proposed for elastodynamic vibration suppression of the flexible connecting rod and also obtaining a constant angular velocity for the crank. The first scheme is based on feedback linearization approach and the second one is based on a sliding mode controller. The input signals are applied by an electric motor located at the crank ground joint, and two layers of piezoelectric film bonded to the top and bottom surfaces of the connecting rod. Both of the controllers successfully suppress the vibrations of the elastic linkage.	crank (person);piezoelectricity	Samin Akbari;Fatemeh Fallahi;Tohid Pirbodaghi	2016	J.

It is shown that under standard stabilizability and detectability conditions, along with assumptions on inhomogeneous term growth, there exists an optimal control law. This control law of well-known feedback form appears to be optimal with respect to proposed extended criteria. The applied criteria expand the notions of long-run average and pathwise long-run average, commonly used for ergodic control. We also investigate the discounted tracking problems, where the cost incorporates a discount function penalizing deviations from reference trajectories.	autonomous system (internet);coefficient;control system;control theory;ergodicity;letter-quality printer;optimal control;stochastic control	Ekaterina S.

Each of the nonlinear parameters in the manipulator dynamic equation was modeled by a set of fuzzy rules where the unknown parameters were predicted by use of a least-square identification algorithm and an optimum search algorithm. The computed torque method was then applied to design the controller, which comprises a model-based portion to compensate the effect of nonlinear dynamics and a servo portion to control overall dynamics. Computer simulation results have shown that the proposed controller indeed can improve the system performance as the position accuracy is much better than that of conventional PD control, Simulation results have also shown that the proposed controller is xry robust.

Compared to the previously proposed analog input shaper, the DIS makes the implementation of damping much more flexible and significantly reduces the electrical noise. Moreover, the DIS can incorporate position control at the initial contact with virtual objects to improve the perceived contact hardness. Through benchmark virtual wall experiments, we show that the DIS can significantly increase the impedance range that a haptic interface can stably display, and that the initial contact hardness that a user perceives can be noticeably improved by using the proposed position control method.	benchmark (computing);characteristic impedance;digital data;elegant degradation;experiment;haptic technology;noise (electronics)	Yo-An Lim;Jeha Ryu	2011	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/016918611X579439	control engineering;atomic force microscopy;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;haptic technology	Robotics	69.87065676763046	-13.433370690501821	30458

The admissible area for the vehicles is confined within boundary constraints. Extremum-seeking control with sliding mode is utilized for direction finding, and variable structure control is designed to address the constraints on vehicle kinematics and the accessible area. The controller enforces the vehicle to track an optimal trajectory determined by both the motion of the source and the boundary constraints. We present stability and performance analysis for the approach and establish an ultimate bound on the tracking error. A representative simulation example in the context of mobile wireless communication network illustrates the design of the extremum-seeking controller and demonstrates its performance in tracking the optimal trajectory.	direction finding;maxima and minima;mobile agent;mobile phone;profiling (computer programming);simulation;telecommunications network	Lina Fu;Ümit Özgüner	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2023637	control engineering;motion control;variable structure control;transport;kinematics;von neumann stability analysis;vehicle dynamics;simulation;optimal control;stability;sliding mode control;engineering;trajectory;control theory;tracking;tracking error;distributed parameter system;physics;wireless	Robotics	62.680892750920236	-18.430680674336433	30505

Its functions include adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning/avoidance. The research data came from driver car-following tests in real traffic environments. Based on the data analysis, a driver model imitating the driver's operation is established to generate the desired throttle depression and braking pressure. Algorithms for collision warning and automatic braking activation are designed based on the driver's pedal deflection timing during approach (gap closing). A self-learning algorithm for driver characteristics is proposed based on the recursive least-square method with a forgetting factor. Using this algorithm, the parameters of the driver model can be identified from the data in the manual operation phase, and the identification result is applied during the automatic control phase in real time. A test bed with an electronic throttle and an electrohydraulic brake actuator is developed for system validation. The experimental results show that the self-learning algorithm is effective and that the system can, to some extent, adapt to individual characteristics.	algorithm;architecture design and assessment system;automatic control;closing (morphology);facility condition assessment;formal concept analysis;handbrake;prototype;real-time clock;recursion;recursive least squares filter;testbed	Jianqiang Wang;Dezhao Zhang;Keqiang Li	2013	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2012.2205143	adaptive filter;control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control theory;data analysis;least squares;statistics;brake	Robotics	64.3980541936631	-9.184113807486682	30562

We describe a modular, hierarchical control scheme for a mobile manipulator, designed to coordinate motion of the manipulator and base to maintain various performance metrics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our control scheme by developing a controller that maintains the stability and manipulability of a nonholonomic base with a 6 degree-of-freedom manipulator while executing manipulation tasks. We demonstrate the modularity of our control scheme by showing how the controller can be extended to avoid obstacles without requiring redesign of the rest of the controller. Simulation results show the controller completing a task involving multiple end-effector targets, avoiding simple obstacles, and maintaining stability and manipulability within desired limits.	mobile manipulator	Kelvin Gong;Allan I.

In the first method the robot lands its feet. Four legs land abreast on the lower side of the slope. Two legs land abreast on the upper side. The outer pair of the lower legs and one upper leg move together, and the inner pair of the lower legs and the other upper leg also move together. The robot walks on the slope in all directions like tripod gait. Because two of the lower legs are always placed below the robot's center of gravity, this method can support the robot stably. The second method uses the robot's shins to increase ground contact area. Two lower legs and two upper legs land their shins on the slope. These legs push the body upward. The remaining two legs land their feet and make a space under the body for the above-mentioned four legs to step forward. Owing to larger friction force, the second method allows the robot to climb steeper slope than the first method. The slope climbing ability of these methods is tested using three kinds of slope: artificial grass, nonslip mat and desktop wood.	desktop computer;dragon ball z: budokai;gradient;hill climbing;robot;rugged computer;tripod	Kenji Inoue;Masashi Kaminogo	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244563	simulation;engineering;operations management;cartography	Robotics	75.15586967587338	-22.55960681467983	30688

Due to the special structure of the robot, we involve passive attitude stabilization method both in pitch and roll directions. We adjust the distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity to generate restoring moment. The restoring moment is used to realize passive attitude stabilization in pitch and roll directions. But for the yaw direction, because the robot is centrosymmetric and the water resistance is small and there is no restoring moment, active attitude stabilization control is necessary. For the active attitude stabilization, we employ Rotation Vector algorithm to instead Euler angle algorithm. The Euler angle algorithm decomposed the rotation motion into 3 orderly rotational motions in pitch, roll, yaw direction respectively. But the Rotation Vector algorithm can describe the rotation motion of the spherical underwater robot just in one time. It is very convenient to control the rotational motion. Finally, we carry out a stabilization experiment to verify the active attitude stability in yaw direction. The experimental results show that the robot can realize attitude stabilizaiton in a short time.	active sitting;algorithm;euler;online and offline;robot;yaws	Chunfeng Yue;Shuxiang Guo;Maoxun Li;Yaxin Li	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739597	control engineering;motion control;simulation;stability;engineering;control theory;buoyancy;attitude control;fluid dynamics	Robotics	67.53415363424253	-20.51129059052352	30801

As the real subject has obviously different anthropometric parameters than the synthetic robot, directly applying motion capture data leads to a non-respect of physical laws. As a consequence, the humanoid can land in a bad configuration. During aerial phase, the acceleration of the center of mass may be different from gravity and the angular momentum may change incorrectly. This so-called retargetting problem is generally addressed in computer animation by solving kinematic constraints. In this paper, we propose a dynamic filter that is able to rapidly adapt motion in order to preserve its physical correctness. If the original motion is changed by a user or just replayed on a different skeleton, the filter is about to correct the postures at each time step in less than 2 ms in a common computer. It's consequently possible to change an arm motion during the aerial phase and to immediately check its effect on the global rotation of the humanoid.	aerial photography;algorithm;angularjs;anthropometry;computer animation;correctness (computer science);motion capture;simulation;synthetic data	Franck Multon;Ludovic Hoyet;Taku Komura;Richard Kulpa	2007	2007 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2007.4813892	center of mass;computer vision;dynamics;simulation;gravity;angular velocity;computer science;humanoid robot;angular momentum;computer animation;skeleton;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	64.23082721604766	-23.45131615336991	30818

The position of feedback transducers is discussed since it appears as an important problem when it is intended to minimize the influence of these elastic vibrations. The discussion is based on eigenvalues and simulation results.	mathematical model;robot;simulation;transducer	Veljko Potkonjak	1988	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574700003611	control engineering;dynamics;torsional vibration;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;feedback;deformation;scientific control;mechanical engineering	Robotics	71.193509329926	-17.95330705373943	30829

This paper studies optimal linear-consensus algorithms for multivehicle systems with single-integrator dynamics in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. We propose two global cost functions, namely, interaction-free and interaction-related cost functions. With the interaction-free cost function, we derive the optimal (nonsymmetric) Laplacian matrix by using a linear-quadratic-regulator-based method in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. It is shown that the optimal (nonsymmetric) Laplacian matrix corresponds to a complete directed graph. In addition, we show that any symmetric Laplacian matrix is inverse optimal with respect to a properly chosen cost function. With the interaction-related cost function, we derive the optimal scaling factor for a prespecified symmetric Laplacian matrix associated with the interaction graph in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. Illustrative examples are given as a proof of concept.	algorithm;directed graph;graph - visual representation;laplacian matrix;linear time-invariant theory;loss function;test scaling;time complexity;time-invariant system	Yongcan Cao;Wei Ren	2010	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2030495	mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;laplacian matrix;graph theory;control theory;mathematics	ML	65.98597814884003	4.027996348150507	30842

The dynamics of a given cell is characterized by instantaneous self-feedback and neighborhood interaction with distributed delay due to, for example, finite switching speed and finite velocity of signal transmission. Applying the monotone iteration scheme, we can deduce the existence of monotonic traveling wave solutions provided the templates satisfy the so-called quasi-monotonicity condition. We then consider two special cases of the delayed cellular neural network in which each cell interacts only with either the nearestm left neighbors or the nearestm right neighbors. For the former case, we can directly figure out the analytic solution in an explicit form by the method of step with the help of the characteristic function and then prove that, in addition to the existence of monotonic traveling wave solutions, for certain templates there exist nonmonotonic traveling wave solutions such as camel-like waves with many critical points. For the latter case, employing the comparison arguments repeatedly, we can clarify the deformation of traveling wave solutions with respect to the wave speed. More specifically, we can describe the transition of profiles from monotonicity, damped oscillation, periodicity, unboundedness and back to monotonicity as the wave speed is varied. Some numerical results are also given to demonstrate the theoretical analysis.	cellular neural network;characteristic function (convex analysis);existential quantification;iteration;iterative method;neural networks;numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;unbounded nondeterminism;velocity (software development);monotone	Cheng-Hsiung Hsu;Chun-Hsien Li;Suh-Yuh Yang	2008	I.

In this paper, we apply a model-based cancellation controller to mitigate this effect, called biodynamic feedthrough. Using measurements of vehicle acceleration and hand/interface interaction force, we first construct a model of the body transmittance. In operation, the controller processes vehicle acceleration measurements through a regression model of the biodynamic transmittance and a motor imposes the result as a torque on the manual interface. We tested individually fit cancellation controllers by quantifying the tracking performance of 12 human subjects using a joystick to control displacements of a single-axis motion platform. The addition of the cancellation controller reduced the root mean square tracking error by 45%, significantly reduced spectral energy in the 1-7 Hz band, and had a marked effect on the ability of the driver to reject exogenous disturbances.	bidirectional scattering distribution function;device driver;gene regulatory network;joystick;mean squared error;motion simulator;optic axis of a crystal	Szabolcs Sövényi;R.

Usual way of discretization of continuous functions is uniform sampling. Our experiments show that dividing the function definition interval with non-uniform measure makes the redundant dictionary sparser and it is suitable for image denoising via sparse and redundant dictionary. In this case the problem is to find an appropriate measure in order to make each atom of dictionary. It has shown that in sparse approximation context, incoherent dictionary is suitable for sparse approximation method. According to this fact we define some optimization problems to find the best parameter of distribution measure (in our study normal distribution). For better convergence to optimum point we used Genetic Algorithm (GA) with enough diversity on initial population. We show the effect of this type of dictionary design on exact sparse recovery support. Our results also show the advantage of this design method on image denoising task.	compressed sensing;dictionary;discretization;experiment;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;mutual coherence (linear algebra);noise reduction;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing);software release life cycle;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Hani Nozari;Alireza Siamy	2011	J.

A brief literature survey reveals the need for minimal component designs and the benefits of impedance control schemes for interaction tasks such as grasping. The novel robotic finger concept supports these insights by combining three key features: minimal actuation, variable mechanical compliance and full manipulability. This combination of features allows for a minimal component design, while reducing control complexity and still providing required dexterity and grasping capabilities. The conceptual properties (such as variable compliance) are studied in a port-Hamiltonian framework. The framework proved to be suitable in analyzing and understanding the finger properties, which will be used for future controller design.	characteristic impedance;data-flow analysis;gadget (computer science);hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);lock (computer science);noise shaping;product bundling;reachability;robot;robotic arm;verification and validation	Martin Wassink;Raffaella Carloni;Stefano Stramigioli	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509871	robot;control engineering;simulation;stability;engineering;electrical impedance;automatic control;control theory;actuator	Robotics	71.13480197786653	-22.993409888987518	31100

The damped joint motion is quite stable and globally outperforms undamped techniques in the sense of torque minimization capability. In addition, simulation results show that the resulting damped joint motion becomes conservative after an initial transient stage for cyclic end-effector trajectories, while undamped pseudoinverse solutions are reported to never lead to conservative motion. Three undamped and damped joint torque optimization algorithms are considered and discussed with comparison to the previous literature. The effectiveness of the proposed null space damping method is demonstrated by computer simulation.	algorithm;computer simulation;kernel (linear algebra);mathematical optimization;moore–penrose pseudoinverse;robot end effector	Hee-Jun Kang;Robert A.

More precisely, the system and controller outputs are quantized at different quantization levels and experiencing different network-induced delays. This configuration is more natural in NCSs. Network-induced delays and packet dropouts are modeled by a Markov chain. Quantization errors are bounded by a sector bound approach and represented as convex poly-topic uncertainties. Lyapunov-Krasovskii(L-K) functional approach is used to develop stability criteria for NCSs with multiple quantizers. On the basis of stability criteria, a quantized robust H∞ output feedback control law is proposed in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). Furthermore, an iterative cone complementarity algorithm is used to convert these BMIs into a quasi convex optimization problem which can be solved easily.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;block cipher mode of operation;complementarity theory;control system;convex optimization;feedback;functional approach;iterative method;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimal control;optimization problem;quantization (signal processing);quasiconvex function	Faiz Rasool;Dan Huang;Sing Kiong Nguang	2011	2011 6th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications	10.1016/j.jfranklin.2012.01.005	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.77145310353029	0.18846976797053244	31147

The motor speed is often calculated by a derivative operation of the position measure obtained by an electromagnetic resolver. As a consequence, especially at the lowest speeds, the noise overlapped to the measured speed is significant and a suitable filter becomes necessary. The paper presents a solution to such a problem based on the employment of a stationary Kalman filter, suitably inserted in a phase locked loop structure. The implementation in an industrial synchronous motor drive, using a 16-bit fixed point DSP, has confirmed the goodness of the proposed solution. © 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

c65adac3733602f5b340eb243d4c2545f8765f96	study on gasoline engine misfiring detection using the cps signal		As one of the homologation test item, the misfiring detection and alarm function is one of the base function of OBD (On Board Diagnostics). This paper researches on how to use the crank position signal to detect the misfiring happen or not and how to alarm which are enforced by the OBD re- quirements. Because the engine becomes more and more advance and most of the engine control strategies base on the torque control model, most of vehicle need engine brake function. The problem is that with the engine brake func- tion some big deceleration is the driver command not caused by the misfiring, this paper introduces the algorithm design for the misfiring for this kind of engine work. At the last of this paper the authors validate the method on a 2.0L 4 cylinders engine.

Designing neural network observers and modifying the DSC method achieves several control objectives. First, to achieve output feedback control, the finite-time echo state networks (ESN) observer with fast convergence is designed to obtain the online system states. Thus, the immeasurable states in traditional state feedback control are estimated and the unknown functions are approximated by ESN. Then, a modified DSC approach is developed by introducing a high-order sliding mode differentiator to replace the first-order filter in each step. Thus, the effect of filter performance on closed-loop stability is reduced. Furthermore, the input to state stability guarantees that all signals of the whole closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Specifically, the performance functions make the tracking errors converge to a compact set around equilibrium. Two numerical examples illustrated the proposed control scheme with satisfactory results.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;block cipher mode of operation;cns disorder;computation (action);converge;differentiator;echo state network;feedback;first-order predicate;lyapunov fractal;mimo;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;separation principle;steady state;on-line system;observers	Guofa Sun;Dongwu Li;Xuemei Ren	2015	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2312001	mathematical optimization;convergence;nonlinear control;sliding mode control;nonlinear system;computer science;adaptive system;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;state observer;artificial neural network;statistics;mimo	Robotics	65.16854756814222	-5.626533772893148	31288

The presence of time synchronization error in the PMU measurements is explicitly considered. It is shown how incorrect modeling of synchronization errors easily lead to incorrect results, ruining the estimation performance of standard approaches. Resorting to a novel linear approximation for the power flow equations, we propose a Kalman based algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of system state and synchronization error parameters.

By using an asymmetric relay function the excitation of the process is improved. This gives better models, and hence a better tuning, without increasing the time consumption or complexity of the experiment. Some processes demand more accurate modeling and tuning to obtain controllers of sufficient performance. These processes can be singled out by their normalized time delays and be subject to further modeling efforts. The autotuner proposed in this paper provides a simple way of finding the normalized time delay from the experiment, and uses it for model and controller selection.

bdd32f04cee3ed609381acdc76f390f80d96008f	five-phase bi-harmonic pmsm control under voltage and currents limits		For a particular five-phase synchronous machine, this paper investigates the sensitivity of a vectorial control strategy on the required peak phase voltage whose value is fundamental for the choice of the DC bus voltage. The specificity of the machine is that the first and third harmonic components of the back electromotive force (back-emf) have the same amplitude. As a consequence, the torque can be produced by one of them or both with suitable currents. This degree of freedom is interesting for optimizing the efficiency and generating high transient torque. However, using two harmonics having the same amplitude leads to a necessity to analyze the constraints on the required phase machine voltage. Considering a Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) strategy, the paper examines the impact of some parameters such as the phase shift between currents and back-emfs or the ratio between the third and the first harmonic of current on the torque and maximum voltage value. Experimental tests with a limited DC bus voltage have been carried out and compared to the results obtained by a Finite Element Analysis.	ampere;control theory;finite element method in structural mechanics;sensitivity and specificity;torque;voltage	Hussein Zahr;Mohamed Trabelsi;Eric Semail;Ngac Ky Nguyen	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217402	phase (waves);synchronous motor;torque;harmonics;control theory;engineering;voltage;counter-electromotive force;amplitude;harmonic	EDA	79.8692868874922	-15.056852918360653	31342
a3f5eb5232849271f4db9ffe03ea6a982c3a0014	adaptive neural output feedback control for uncertain robot manipulators with input saturation		This paper presents an adaptive neural output feedback control scheme for uncertain robot manipulators with input saturation using the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and disturbance observer. First, the RBFNN is used to approximate the system uncertainty, and the unknown approximation error of the RBFNN and the time-varying unknown external disturbance of robot manipulators are integrated as a compounded disturbance. Then, the state observer and the disturbance observer are proposed to estimate the unmeasured system state and the unknown compounded disturbance based on RBFNN. At the same time, the adaptation technique is employed to tackle the control input saturation problem. Utilizing the estimate outputs of the RBFNN, the state observer, and the disturbance observer, the adaptive neural output feedback control scheme is developed for robot manipulators using the backstepping technique.The convergence of all closed-loop signals is rigorously proved via Lyapunov analysis and the asymptotically convergent tracking error is obtained under the integrated effect of the system uncertainty, the unmeasured system state, the unknown external disturbance, and the input saturation. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive neural output feedback control scheme for uncertain robot manipulators.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;artificial neural network;asymptote;block cipher mode of operation;computer simulation;feedback;lyapunov fractal;radial (radio);radial basis function;robot	Rong Mei;ChengJiang Yu	2017	Complexity	10.1155/2017/7413642	backstepping;observer (quantum physics);control theory;artificial neural network;computer simulation;mathematics;state observer;tracking error;approximation error;lyapunov function	Robotics	65.03240397980849	-5.742363603843279	31361

A nonlinear parametric feedback control is proposed to modify the steady-state resonance responses, thus to reduce the amplitude of the response and to eliminate the saddle-node bifurcations that take place in the resonance responses. The nonlinear gain of the feedback control is determined by analyzing the bifurcation diagrams associated with the corresponding frequency-response equation, from the singularity theory approach. It is shown by illustrative examples that the proposed nonlinear feedback is effective for controlling three kinds of resonance responses.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;feedback;frequency response;hysteresis;nonlinear system;optimal control;resonance;steady state;technological singularity	Andrew Y.

The characteristic of a shaking system is considered to be nonlinear and variable because of the influence of the test piece. In order to compensate for this problem, the influence of the disturbance force needs to be suppressed. The controller is designed using μ-synthesis by considering the uncertainty of the shaker. In order to investigate the control performance for the influence of friction and sloshing, the time waveform replication testing is executed. Finally, because the disturbance-force compensator suppresses the nonlinear characteristic, the good performance is confirmed with the help of experiments conducted using the actual equipment.	cocktail shaker sort;controller (computing);experiment;nonlinear system;robust control;waveform	Yasuhiro Uchiyama;Masayuki Fujita	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281075	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.1129937928747	-12.914017852132632	31437

The ANN model used is a multi-layered perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN). Wherein, gradient descent type of learning rules is applied.

This capability leads to faster implementation, higher performance, quality at a lower cost. This comes about due to improved selection of machining parameters, optimal fixture design and the avoidance of tool failure. The simulation system presented simultaneously considers the effect of cutter geometry, the cutter's initial position errors, workpiece geometry, machine tool dynamics, and workpiece/fixture system dynamics on the machining process.#R##N##R##N#The integration of all of the above in one model provides an off-line tool to simulate and optimize the machining parameters and the fixture configuration cutting both lead and production time.

Stabilization is achieved with a time invariant continuous-time controller. The presented method assumes a parametrized family of continuous-time controllers has been designed so that (1) a periodic orbit is induced, and (2) the orbit itself is invariant under the choice of parameters in the controllers. By investigating the properties of the Poincaré return map, a sensitivity analysis is presented that translates the stabilization problem into a set of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). A BMI optimization problem is set up to select the parameters of the continuous-time controller to achieve exponential stability. We illustrate the power of the approach by finding new stabilizing solutions for periodic orbits of an underactuated 3D bipedal robot.	algorithm;bilinear transform;brain–computer interface;hybrid system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;poincaré plot;robot;self-stabilization;time complexity;time-invariant system;underactuation	Kaveh Akbari Hamed;Brian G.

This provides a peak power output that can exceed several times the maximum motor power. In this way, the actuation and energy systems can be significantly reduced in weight and size. On the other hand, passive dynamics is exploited by compliant forelegs, that let to partially recover the impact energy in their elastic recoil. Equipped with a 0.2W DC motor, the robot is dimensioned to achieve a forward speed of 1.5 m/s, which corresponds to about 30 body length per second."""	feed forward (control);frequency-hopping spread spectrum;grams;robot;unstructured grid	Umberto Scarfogliero;Cesare Stefanini;Paolo Dario	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363830	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;feed forward	Robotics	73.7007482133679	-22.93449788694169	31765

Use of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices like SVC and Stacom can be an economic solution to this problem. Statcom is a second generation FACTS device, which is basically voltage source converter that can be used in voltage control mode or reactive power injection mode.

a558ad65e75265e9f04cb044c2608d5e371eb002	robust model predictive cooperative adaptive cruise control subject to v2v impairments		To improve traffic throughput, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) has been proposed as a solution. The usage of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication enables short following distances, thereby increasing road capacity and fuel reduction (especially for trucks). Control designs for CACC use the wirelessly communicated intended acceleration of a preceding vehicle as a feedforward action in a following vehicle. This feedforward action may determine approximately 80% of the total control action. In case of a communication failure, this feedforward is no longer available, and a larger time gap is needed to ensure high performance and robustness in terms of stability and safety. However, such a larger time gap is not instantly realizable. Therefore, a CACC design is needed which is robust against intermittent communication failures. This paper proposes to share model-based predictions of the intended acceleration via V2V communication, which are stored in a buffer of the following vehicle. This buffer is used in case a packet dropout occurs. Further, since the communication frequency is lower than the frequency of the control-platform, this buffer is also used to virtually upgrade the communication frequency. The design has been tested in experimental vehicles and shows an increased control performance, also in periods of packet dropouts.	algorithm;dropout (neural networks);feedforward neural network;memory controller;network packet;relevance;throughput;vehicle-to-vehicle	Ellen van Nunen;Jan Verhaegh;Emilia Silvas;Elham Semsar-Kazerooni;Nathan van de Wouw	2017	2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317758	throughput;simulation;cooperative adaptive cruise control;robustness (computer science);real-time computing;packet loss;vehicular communication systems;feed forward;network packet;model predictive control;engineering	Robotics	57.16661192205873	-13.629278232547744	31774

In it, spirals are generated by applying single-frequency cosine and sine waves of slowly varying amplitudes in the X and Y-axes, respectively, of the AFM's piezoelectric tube (PZT) scanner. Due to these single-frequency sinusoidal input signals, the scanning process can be faster than that of conventional raster scanning. A linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is designed to track the reference sinusoidal signal. An internal model of the reference sinusoidal signal is included in the plant model and an integrator for the system error is introduced in the proposed control scheme. As a result, the phase error between the input and output sinusoid from the X and Y-PZTs is reduced. The spirals produced have particularly narrow-band frequency measures which change slowly over time, thereby making it possible for the scanner to achieve improved tracking and continuous high-speed scanning rather than being restricted to the back and forth motion of raster scanning. Also, a fifth-order Butterworth filter is used to filter noises in the signals emanating from the position sensors. A comparison of images scanned using the proposed controller (spiral) and the AFM proportional integral (PI) controller (raster) provide evidence of the efficacy of the proposed method.	atomic-force microscopy;butterworth filter;crystal structure;dos;experiment;image scanner;input/output;photomultiplier;piezoelectricity;raster scan;sensor;single-frequency network	Habibullah;Hemanshu Roy Pota;Ian R.

The necessary conditions required for the global stability and convergence of a general STC system are relaxed, i.e. the convergence of parameter estimates is removed for both deterministic and stochastic STC schemes. To reach this goal, ‘virtual equivalent system (VES)’ concept and methodology is adopted. With the help of VES, the original nonlinear dominant (nonlinear in structure) problem is converted to a linear dominant (linear in structure) problem. The results developed in this article show that STC systems are stable and convergent for the abundance of control strategies and parameter estimation algorithms, which will provide great flexibility in the applications of STC.	algorithm;control theory;estimation theory;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;self-tuning;time complexity;time-invariant system;virtual execution system	Weicun Zhang	2010	Int.

Improved control and optimization of WWTP lead to increased pollutant removal, a reduced need for chemicals as well as energy savings. An important step toward the optimal functioning of a WWTP is to minimize the influence of sensor faults on the control quality. To achieve this, a fault-detection system should be implemented. In this paper, the idea of using an evolving method as a base for the fault-detection/monitoring system is tested. The system is based on the evolving fuzzy model method. This method allows us to model the nonlinear relations between the variables with the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. The method uses basic evolving mechanisms to add and remove clusters and the adaptation mechanism to adapt the clusters' and local models' parameters. The proposed fault-detection system is tested on measured data from a real WWTP. The results indicate the potential improvement of the WWTP's control during a sensor malfunction.	fault detection and isolation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;waste	Dejan Dovzan;Vito Logar;Igor Skrjanc	2015	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2379252	temperature measurement;computer science;machine learning;control theory;cluster analysis;inductor	Robotics	57.24323982485893	-8.156606388443775	31833

The adaptive EKF incorporates ridge-type estimation methods to improve the accuracy obtained by the standard EKF. The dynamical model developed for the target vehicle includes the effects of the spherical and non-spherical earth, launch vehicle thrust, and atmospheric drag. Possible observation types considered are azimuth and elevation angles, range, and range-rate data from up to three space-based observers. Comparative studies were made to evaluate the estimation accuracy as a function of observation type, number of observers, and observation rate for an observation time of up to 2 min after target vehicle burnout. In addition, comparisons were made with and without the use of initial orbit determination techniques. Results show that the performance of the adaptive EKF exceeds that of the EKF in a number of scenarios studied.		David A.

The main objective is to design stable filters that minimize a guaranteed cost index and achieve a prescribed Hinfin performance under worst case disturbance. Based on Lyapunov theory, both delay-independent and delay-dependent sufficient conditions guaranteeing stability and achieving prescribed performances are stated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Therefore, stable filters can be obtained easily with existing convex algorithms.

Motivated by practical scenarios where the time-to-estimate is critical, we specifically address the case where the convergence time of the algorithm, i.e., the number of communications required to achieve the final estimate, is minimal. We thus construct estimators of the network size by exploiting statistical inference concepts on top of the distributed computation of order statistics of the IDs, i.e., of the M biggest IDs available in the network. We then characterize the statistical performance of these estimators from theoretical perspectives and show their effectiveness in practical estimation situations by means of numerical examples.	algorithm;computation;distributed computing;numerical analysis;numerical method	Riccardo Lucchese;Damiano Varagnolo	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7171924	econometrics;convergence;engineering;theoretical computer science;mathematics;software testing;maximum likelihood;ac power;statistics	ML	54.48169768047358	3.8881963172133145	32090

Such a strategy is based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method. It offers an appealing alternative to existing control approaches for helicopters by combining decoupling and disturbance rejection without a detailed plant dynamics. The tuning of the control system is formulated as a function optimization problem to capture various design considerations. In comparison with several different iterative search algorithms, an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is selected to obtain the optimal control parameters. For a fair comparison of control performance, a well-designed LQG controller is also optimized by the proposed method. Comparison results from an attitude tracking simulation against wind disturbance show the significant advantages of the proposed optimization control for this control application.

In this note, we show that similar stabilization results may be achieved using unconstrained finite horizon optimal control. The key idea is to approximate the tail of the infinite horizon cost-to-go using, as terminal cost, an appropriate control Lyapunov function. Roughly speaking, the terminal control Lyapunov function (CLF) should provide an (incremental) upper bound on the cost. In this fashion, important stability characteristics may be retained without the use of terminal constraints such as those employed by a number of other researchers. The absence of constraints allows a significant speedup in computation. Furthermore, it is shown that in order to guarantee stability, it suffices to satisfy an improvement property, thereby relaxing the requirement that truly optimal trajectories be found. We provide a complete analysis of the stability and region of attraction/operation properties of receding horizon control strategies that utilize finite horizon approximations in the proposed class. It is shown that the guaranteed region of operation contains that of the CLF controller and may be made as large as desired by increasing the optimization horizon (restricted, of course, to the infinite horizon domain). Moreover, it is easily seen that both CLF and infinite-horizon optimal control approaches are limiting cases of our receding horizon strategy. The key results are illustrated using a familiar example, the inverted pendulum, where significant improvements in guaranteed region of operation and cost are noted.	approximation algorithm;common look and feel;computation;horizon effect;inverted pendulum;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical stability;optimal control;speedup	Ali Jadbabaie;Jie Yu;John Hauser	2001	IEEE Trans.

The corresponding optimal control input that minimizes the HJB equation is calculated in a forward-in-time manner without using value and policy iterations. First, the optimal control problem is solved in a generic multi input and multi output (MIMO) nonlinear system in strict feedback form with a state feedback approach. Then, the approach is extended to single input and single output (SISO) nonlinear system in strict feedback form by using output feedback via a nonlinear observer. Lyapunov techniques are used to show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and that the approximated control signals approach the optimal control inputs with small bounded error. In the absence of NN reconstruction errors, asymptotic convergence to the optimal control input is demonstrated. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the theoretical results for the output feedback controller design.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;bellman equation;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;feedback;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;iteration;jacobi method;loss function;lyapunov fractal;mimo;nonlinear system;optimal control;reconstruction filter;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder	Hassan Zargarzadeh;Travis Dierks;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;mathematical optimization;optimal control;nonlinear control;adaptive control;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;feedback linearization	Robotics	63.19462177784343	-2.907833216733022	32379

While this approach works reasonably well in practice on benign terrain, it fails very quickly when the WMR is deployed in terrain that induces significant wheel slip. We contribute a novel control framework that predictively corrects for the wheel slip to effectively minimize path following errors. Our framework, the Receding Horizon Model Predictive Path Follower (RHMPPF), specifically addresses the problem of path following in challenging environments where the wheel slip substantially affects the vehicle mobility. We formulate the solution to the problem as an optimal controller that utilizes a slip-aware model predictive component to effectively correct the controls generated by a strictly geometric pure-pursuit path follower. We present extensive experimental validation of our approach using a simulated 6-wheel skid-steered robot in a high-fidelity data-driven simulator, and on a real 4-wheel skid-steered robot. Our results show substantial improvement in the path following performance in both simulation and real world experiments.	algorithm;experience;experiment;feedback;mobile robot;motion planning;optimal control;simulation	Venkataramanan Rajagopalan;Çetin Meriçli;Alonzo Kelly	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487659	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	62.84042061122192	-16.800561125492433	32403

In this paper, a general proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type algorithm for controlling transmitted powers in wireless networks is studied and a systematic way to adapt or tune the parameters of the controller in a distributed fashion is suggested. The proposed algorithm utilizes multiple candidate PID gains. Depending on the prevailing channel conditions, it selects an optimal PID gain from the candidate gain set at each instant and places it in the feedback loop. The algorithm is data driven and can distinguish between stabilizing and destabilizing controller gains as well as rank the stabilizing controllers based on their performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme performs better than several candidate controllers, including a well known distributed power control (DPC) algorithm.	algorithm;controllers;deferred procedure call;feedback;pid;power (psychology);quality of service;simulation;throughput;disease transmission;folic acid-containing compound biosynthetic process	Ayanendu Paul;Mehmet Akar;Michael G.

The advantage of the algorithm is that it reduces the dimensionality difficulties. The technique is then employed to evaluate the optimum state and control responses of certain distributed regulator systems. During each iteration, the set of admissible states is restricted only to those two stages 'near' the nominal trajectory. It is shown that our proposed algorithm cuts down the storage requirement significantly.	algorithm;dynamic programming	K. Y. K. Ng;N. G. F.

Based on this model, the control of hopping robots has been widely investigated. A fundamental limitation of the model is that it fails to account for impact with the ground, and this is due to its single degree-of-freedom in the vertical direction. A more accurate representation of the hopping robot is proposed using a two mass model and inelastic impact with the ground. A control scheme is developed to converge the maximum jumping height of the robot to a desired value. The control scheme utilizes feedback linearization in continuous time and updates a control parameter in discrete time to achieve the control objective. Simulation results are presented to show the efficacy of the control scheme.	apex (geometry);control theory;converge;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;inverted pendulum;poincaré plot;robot;simulation;star height	Frank B.

Transient and frequency response experiments indicate that the fusional vergence system is not characterized by sampled data or refractory operation. When provided with a periodic input, this system may utilize prediction to reduce inherent phase lags. The gain of the system, although apparently unaffected by the predictive mechanism, is subject to input amplitude-dependent nonlinearities. Under conditions of artificially high loop gain, the system breaks into smooth sustained oscillations at a frequency predicted by frequency response data. The absence of a refractory period in the fusional vergence system is demonstrated by the system response to brief pulsatile stimulation. These results are discussed, emphasizing comparison with corresponding results from experiments on the versional system.	vergence	Bert L. Zuber;Lawrence W. Stark	1968	IEEE Trans.

The developed analysis is applied to feedback linearizable VSS’, driven by standard sliding mode algorithms of the first order. Constructive parameter tuning of the resulting closed-loop system to posses the L2-gain less than a desired attenuation level is additionally deduced. The proposed tuning is shown to be capable not only of rejecting matched uniformly bounded disturbances but also of attenuating unbounded ones, including mismatched disturbances. Numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum, driven by a first order sliding mode (SM) controller, are involved to support the theory in the presence of the position measurement inaccuracy, being a source of a mismatched disturbance.	performance tuning;soft-in soft-out decoder	Topacio Osuna;Yury Orlov;Luis T.

It uses directly the clinical data; there is no need of a patient model. Such a model is used however, but only as a source of artificial clinical data. Firstly, we use this model in order to create closed-loop control with a classical PID controller and then with polynomial RST control where a robustness analysis is performed. Secondly, as the contribution of this paper, we use the model only as a source of pseudo-clinical data with reinforcement learning, the Q-learning algorithm. In all these cases, the model contains the RAS reflex model of the body.	q-learning	Ciprian Sandu	2017	IJAIP	10.1504/IJAIP.2017.10002027	machine learning;q-learning;blood pressure;artificial intelligence;reflex;computer science;robustness (computer science);automatic control;pid controller;reinforcement learning;polynomial	Robotics	55.61579078571287	-8.250497873456348	32696

Furthermore, achieving the smooth and natural movements of humans has become a hot topic in robotics, especially when robots are supposed to work in close proximity to humans. The anthropomimetic principle aims at mimicking not only the outside but also the inner mechanisms of the human body in humanoid robots. However, for this class of robots there exist as yet no scalable controllers that might make it possible to control a full body, or even several joints. A very similar problem is ongoing research in biomechanics which is the computation of muscle excitation patterns for coordinated movements. For this purpose, biomechanicists have developed computed muscle control which has proven a very scalable technique. In this paper, we demonstrate the adaptation of computed muscle control for a tendon-driven robot, comparing different methods for obtaining the muscle kinematics, as well as different low-level controllers. Results are shown for the implementation on a distributed control architecture and a single revolute elbow joint.	approximation;computation;control theory;distributed control system;existential quantification;feedforward neural network;high- and low-level;humanoid robot;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;scalability;sensor;soft robotics;state space;stereopsis;tendon-driven robot;vii	Michael Jäntsch;Steffen Wittmeier;Konstantinos Dalamagkidis;Alois Knoll	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385851	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;biomechanics;robot control;solid modeling;force;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.37662412226405	-23.670596975752193	32804

Under some conditions, it shows that the DCNNs can exhibit 3(n) equilibrium points. Then, we track the dynamics of u(t)(t>0) in two cases with respect to different types of subset regions in which u(0) is located. It concludes that every solution trajectory u(t) would converge to one of the equilibrium points despite the time-varying delays, that is, the delayed cellular neural networks are completely stable. The method is novel and the results obtained extend the existing ones. In addition, two illustrative examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of our results.	artificial neural network;converge;neural network simulation;subgroup	Lili Wang;Tianping Chen	2012	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2012.09.001	mathematical optimization;cellular neural network;discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	ML	74.16675376186132	2.954370120313004	32825

Compared with the existing primal-dual neural network, the proposed neural network has a low complexity for implementation. Compared with the existing dual neural network, the proposed neural network has no computation of matrix inversion. More importantly, the proposed neural network is theoretically proved to have not only a finite time convergence, but also an exponential convergence rate without any additional assumption. Simulation results show that the proposed neural network has a faster convergence rate than the dual neural network in effectively tracking for the motion control of kinematically redundant manipulators.	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;computation;computation (action);convergence (action);dual;neural network simulation;rate of convergence;real time kinematic;real-time clock;robot;velocity (software development);exponential	Youshen Xia;Gang Feng;Jun Wang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2004.839913	stochastic neural network;motion control;index term;convergence;computer science;recurrent neural network;machine learning;control theory;time delay neural network;rate of convergence;redundancy;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.89893373582105	-12.054785892429724	32827

First, the RSK model, which imitates the representation of environments in the human brain, is presented to describe the search environments. The environments that are divided into regions are represented by a hierarchical nested structure where small regions are grouped together to form superordinate regions. Second, on the basis of the RSK model, an FTC-A* search algorithm is developed to plan the fine-to-coarse route. By making a fine planning to robot surroundings in vicinity, but a coarse planning to that at the distance, the FTC-A* algorithm can effectively reduce computational complexity, so as to enhance the efficiency of route search, and meanwhile makes robots to react quickly to user's commands, especially in large-scale environments. Finally, four exhaustive simulations and a physical experiment have been carried out to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed wayfinding strategy.	a* search algorithm;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;computational complexity theory;experiment;follicular thyroid carcinoma;knowledge representation and reasoning;navigation;robot (device);robotic mapping;simulation;united states federal trade commission	Chaoliang Zhong;Shirong Liu;Qiang Lu;Botao Zhang;Simon X.

Firstly, sliding mode method is adopted to extend the nonlinear kenimatic control law to dynamic system, so that the robot is driven by torques. Then, to solve the speed and torque jump problem, the neural dynamics model is integrated into the presented controller. In addition, we utilize genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the controller parameters for obtaining better stabilization performance. The stability of the proposed control system is analyzed by using Lyapunov theory.

Lyapunov characterizations are developed to verify those properties. The notions investigated here are stricter than boundedness properties ensured by popular input-to-state stability and noise-to-state stability whose probability is taken at each instant. It is demonstrated that Lyapunov functions constructed frequently in the literature not only establish the instantaneous probabilistic properties, but also path-wise probabilistic ones. Differences appear when one wants to estimate the convergence of initial effect. The differences disappear if diffusion fields are remotely orthogonal to the gradient of Lyapunov functions.	control theory;dynamical system;gradient;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;stochastic process	Hiroshi Ito;Yuki Nishimura	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7172279	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;lyapunov function;noise;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign;probabilistic logic;upper and lower bounds;lyapunov exponent;lyapunov optimization;fading	Robotics	68.46838471828639	2.251591986524079	33070

The control approach is based on the application of two internal nonlinear controllers and the derivation of the linear approximant of the resulting nonlinear closed loop system dynamics. For the good performance of the configuration an external remote controller is developed. The external controller is analyzed to two design layers. First, a dynamic I/O decoupling controller is developed towards independent control of the coordinates of the end effector and the attitude angle of the robotic manipulator. Second, minimization of the performance error under boundary constraints of the attitude angle of the aircraft is achieved.	aerial photography;broadcast delay;closed-loop transfer function;computation;coupling (computer programming);experiment;input/output;linear algebra;nonlinear system;remote control;robot end effector;system dynamics	Nikolaos D.

Like other cable or belt actuators, the elastic tendon actuator allows to radically reduce the link inertia by placing the motors near the robot base. But by additionally integrating springs in the tendons, the motor and the joint are elastically decoupled, which increases the lifespan of the tendons and the safety of the actuator. A detailed mathematical model of the actuator is derived taking tendon slackening effects into consideration. The result is a degressive stiffness curve that depends on the pretension force of the integrated tendon springs. The derived model is validated against static and dynamic experimental measurement data of a robot arm equipped with elastic tendon actuators.	elastic net regularization;mathematical model;online and offline;robotic arm;stiffness matrix	Thomas Lens;Jerome Kirchhoff;Oskar von Stryk	2012	2012 12th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids 2012)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2012.6651608	electric motor;robotic arm;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;elasticity;actuator	Robotics	71.98004753964018	-19.918158526871935	33170
239742ec80f97df1b5994c9166b4abf578ae7967	stability of nmpc with cyclic horizons		In this paper we present stability conditions for nonlinear model predictive control with cyclically varying horizons. Starting from a maximum horizon length, the horizon is reduced by one at each sampling time until a minimum horizon length is reached, at which the horizon is increased to the maximum length. The approach allows to utilize shapes and structures in the terminal constraints, which can otherwise not be handled. Examples are terminal boxconstraints, where the terminal set cannot be rendered invariant, or quadratic terminal regions and penalties of diagonal structure. Such constraints are for example of advantage for distributed predictive control problems. To underline the applicability, the approach is used to control a four tank system.	computation;distributed control system;nonlinear system;recursion (computer science);sampling (signal processing);setpoint (control system);simulation;structured programming	Markus J.

The fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a fuzzy adaptive observer is designed for estimating the unmeasured states. By transforming the tracking errors into new virtual error variables and based on backstepping recursive design technique, a new fuzzy adaptive output feedback control method is developed. It is shown that all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded in probability and the tracking error remains an adjustable neighborhood of the origin within the prescribed bounds.The simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A decentralized control inspired from the adaptive immune system TH1/TH2 differentiation mechanism has been proposed. The resulting patrol control exhibits robustness under adversarial conditions. This is primarily because the motion period can be arbitrary, which makes it difficult for intruders to find weak spots for attack. Moreover, this immuno-inspired control can avoid collision and automatically recover from agent failure.	adversary (cryptography);automatic differentiation;dos;distributed control system;perimeter	Ruoting Yang;Sharon Bewick;Mingjun Zhang;William R.

Several experiments are performed to demonstrate these features. Finally, we develop a subsurface explorer robot with propulsion and excavation units. Excavation experiments are successfully conducted using the excavator alone and at lighter weights. We show that the excavator can begin boring from a launcher, and in case of excavator of 1/6 of its own weight, it successfully excavates at the same depth as in its own weight. This demonstrates that this novel excavator is expected to accomplish future missions on other planets and the moon.	cosmic;discharger;excavator (microarchitecture);experiment;futures studies;planetary scanner;prototype;robot;sensor;subsurface scattering	Hayato Omori;Taro Murakami;Hiroaki Nagai;Taro Nakamura;Takashi Kubota	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979824	simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;dc motor;aeronautics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	76.10101339362762	-22.471718768745596	33371

The complications introduced by communications-intermittency, channel noise, quantization, etc.-are evaluated using a Markov stopping time formulation. This is compared to and contrasted with earlier analyses which considered the behavior of Kalman filters with intermittent data based on moments and conditional moments, and the evaluation of the minimal number of bits required for mean square stabilization. The main result shows the escape time is characterized by a Markov chain which is amenable to explicit analysis through the calculation of its cumulative distribution function. This is examined in the linear Gaussian and quantized linear Gaussian cases and then used to develop an approach to bitrate assignment in such communications-based control systems.

It is well known, however, that there exist stable differential inclusions, hence T–S fuzzy models whose stability is unprovable by a globally quadratic Lyapunov function. At present, literature in the broader area of stability analysis suggests piecewise-quadratic stability as a means to avoid such conservatism. This paper generalizes the idea and proposes a framework that supports less conservative sufficient conditions for the stability of the T–S model by using piecewise-quadratic generalized Lyapunov functions. The advocated approach results in the formulation of the controller synthesis, which, herein, aims for robust stabilization, as a problem of bilinear rather than linear matrix inequalities. Simulation studies, which include an algorithm for solution of bilinear matrix inequalities, demonstrate the proposed method.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;control system;differential inclusion;existential quantification;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;simulation;social inequality	Kiriakos Kiriakidis	2001	IEEE Trans.

Kinematic solutions for this manipulator at position, velocity and acceleration levels are obtained. Moreover, the dynamical equations of motion of the manipulator are determined using Newton-Euler's equations and applying the natural orthogonal complement (NOC) method.

The controller is designed from the fuzzy interval ranges of the system parameters using an /spl alpha/-cut methodology. Indeed, for a given /spl alpha/-cut of the fuzzy system parameters representing an uncertainty level, the control objective can be viewed as maintaining the system output within a tolerance envelope, around the exact trajectory, specified by the degree of preference /spl alpha/ on the fuzzy trajectory. The stability is ensured in the way that the controller restricts the system output divergence within the tolerance envelope. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation examples.	control theory;defuzzification;fuzzy control system;linear system;minimum phase;optimal control;simulation	Reda Boukezzoula;Laurent Foulloy;Sylvie Galichet	2006	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.861619	mathematical optimization;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy associative matrix;linear system;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Robotics	62.76585889289734	-6.292959836791287	33528

A force decomposition approach is used to compute the Jacobian. The parallel manipulator consists of a base plate, a top plate, and three connecting legs with all revolute joints. The key to the Jacobian formulation presented here is the derivation of a mapping from the applied end-effector force and torque to two force components at each spherical joint. Each leg of the manipulator can then be treated separately and the actuated joint torques can easily be computed from these spherical joint forces. >	jacobian matrix and determinant;parallel manipulator	Kevin Cleary;Mark Uebel	1994		10.1109/ROBOT.1994.351155	jacobian matrix and determinant;control engineering;kinematics;parallel manipulator;computer science;control theory;mathematics;geometry;degrees of freedom	Robotics	69.50260852443846	-21.109282379459632	33590

Compared with recent existing results, a new mode-dependent eventtriggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed which makes full use of the information of ETM and nonuniform SD. By constructing a newly Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and utilizing a convex optimization approach, some sufficient criteria for H∞ reliable control are deduced in an inequality form.

The point of the act-and-wait concept is that the feedback is switched on and off periodically. Earlier works have shown that if the switch-off (waiting) period is longer than the feedback delay, then the system can be described by an n×n monodromy matrix withn being the dimension of the delay-free system. In this study, it is shown that for certain combinations of the waiting and the acting (or switch on) periods, the system can be still be transformed to a finite, kn-dimensional system with k > 2 even if the waiting period is shorter than the delay. It is shown that the control technique can be a candidate as a solution to the Brockett problem posed for systems with feedback delay.	dimensionality reduction;feedback	Tamás Insperger;Gábor Stépán	2010	IMA J.

By investigating the elastic deformations in each flexure hinge, the stiffness model in the working directions of the CPM is established. In addition, by expressing both potential and kinetic energies of the CPM with the chosen generalized coordinates, the dynamic equation is derived via the Lagrangian approach. Through the finite element analysis performed in ANSYS software package, not only the stiffness model is tested by the nonlinear statics analysis, but also the dynamic model is verified based on the conducted modal analysis. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the obtained analytical models. And the presented results are meaningful for both the design and development of a CPM for micro/nano scale manipulation.	authorization;computation;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;gnu nano;ieee xplore;lagrangian (field theory);mathematical model;mathematical optimization;modal logic;nonlinear system;optimal design;performance evaluation;prototype;requirement;simulation;stiffness;time complexity;time-scale calculus;xyz file format	Qingsong Xu;Yangmin Li	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522136	statics;natural frequency;control engineering;dynamics;simulation;engineering;finite element method;modal analysis;kinetic energy;engineering drawing;static analysis;quantum mechanics	Robotics	71.17715188621082	-20.184857529556183	33713

First, an adaptive fuzzy technique is applied to estimate the bound of the lumped uncertainties. Next, based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a MRAFSMC is developed to solve the control problem. The proposed controller not only possesses the advantages of sliding mode control (SMC) and adaptive fuzzy control law, but also eliminates the disadvantage of traditional SMC. Finally, a computer simulation example is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.	nonlinear system	Chung-Chun Kung;Shuo-Chieh Chang	2007		10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414250	mathematical optimization;uncertainty;sliding mode control;adaptive control;computer science;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system	Robotics	64.63941313062386	-6.398262368615062	33749

Due to its ability to learn, the proposed controller can adapt to different resonant speed ranges without any identification process for system parameters. Conversely, we also introduce the implementation of an ANN-based controller, online backpropagation learning, and a microstep driver on a single field-programmable gate array. An implementation and experimental results are conducted to verify the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed controller.	approximation;artificial neural network;backpropagation;controller (computing);encoder;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;finite-state machine;fixed-point arithmetic;function representation;jacobian matrix and determinant;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;machine learning;modem sharing device;nonlinear system;programming model;resonance;software propagation;the matrix	Quy Ngoc Le;Jae Wook Jeon	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2037650	control engineering;open-loop controller;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network;field-programmable gate array	Robotics	62.547432587056186	-10.034503117855017	33823

Under the Filippov framework, the cone expansion and compression fixed point theorems of set-valued maps are successfully employed to derive the existence of the ω-periodic positive solution. However, before the discussion of the periodicity, there still remains a fundamental issue about viability to be solved due to the presence of general mixed time-delays involving both time-varying delays and distributed delays. This difficulty can be overcome by a transformation and the continuation theorem. Then, for the discontinuous and delayed neural network system with time-periodic coefficients, the uniqueness and global exponential stability of the periodic state solution are proved by using non-smooth analysis theory with generalized Lyapunov approach. Furthermore, the global convergence in measure of the periodic output is also investigated. The obtained results are a very good extension and improvement of previous works on discontinuous dynamical neuron systems with a broad range of neuron activations dropping the assumption of boundedness or monotonicity. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

For such a system, user ride comfort must be at an acceptable level while subjected to various disturbances in its operation. A nonlinear elevator model, including the DC motor and sensor sub-systems, was developed within the Simulink environment. The velocity of a 3200 kg elevator car, required to traverse a distance of 100 m in under 65 s, was the focus of the controller design. A baseline Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller was designed and its performance was compared with the proposed Pseudo-Derivative Feedback controller. Sensitivity to variations in the car mass was investigated to compare controller performance. Analysis of the time-domain parameters revealed that the Pseudo-Derivative Feedback controller achieved superior performance in rise time, settling time, total run time, sensitivity to variations in elevator car mass, disturbance rejection and tracking of the desired velocity signal.	baseline (configuration management);control system;control theory;elliptic curve cryptography;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;nonlinear system;pid;portable document format;rejection sampling;rise time;run time (program lifecycle phase);settling time;simulation;simulink;steady state;systems design;traverse;velocity (software development)	Muhammed Mangera;Dushil S.

We first analyze the the performance index H i =H ∞  measuring the trade-off in all directions of the residual space, and then propose a new design index computed with the maximum and minimum nonzero singular values of the transfer function from disturbances to residual. The necessary and sufficient condition for checking whether an FDF is optimal or not, is given in terms of matrix inequalities (MI). An iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) algorithm is finally developed to design the optimal FDF based on the proposed design index. With the obtained FDF, the H ∞ =H ∞  and H_/H ∞  indexes are optimized as two extreme cases. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	fault detection and isolation;filter design;iterative method;linear matrix inequality	Wei Li;Steven X.

Two pH models of marine craft are considered, one in a body frame and another in an inertial frame. The structure and workless forces of pH models are exploited to design two virtual control systems which are related to the original marine craft’s pH models. These virtual systems are rendered differentially passive with an imposed steady-state trajectory, both by means of a control scheme. Finally, the original marine craft pH models in closed-loop with above controllers solve the trajectory tracking problem. The performance of the closedloop system is evaluated on numerical simulations.	control system;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);numerical analysis;passive optical network;simulation;steady state	Rodolfo Reyes-Báez;Alejandro Donaire;Arjan van der Schaft;Bayu Jayawardhana;Tristan Perez	2018	CoRR		control theory;mathematics;inertial frame of reference;passivity;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);trajectory;rigid body;craft;control system	Robotics	67.05128673357494	-15.74485938127881	34147

In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management strategy is proposed, in which the predicted velocity and SOC trajectory is regarded as reference signal. The velocity predictor is designed based on radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN), and the battery SOC trajectory is planned using the road grade information from Geographic Information System (GIS). The proposed strategy is verified by a Matlab/simulink model. The results indicate that the fuel economy of PSHEV is improved by considering velocity prediction and SOC trajectory planning.

ed7402c2a6b6851daf1ba4dbe76b79a03cada6a9	control of a single degree of freedom noise rejecting - variable impedance actuator		Recently, a number of variable impedance actuator designs have been proposed under different motivations (safe human-robot interaction, mechanical robustness and energy storing to cite a few). In a recent paper (Berret et al. (2011)) we observed that none of the available designs seem to reproduce an important characteristic of human muscles, i.e. the ability to open-loop reject disturbances by means of muscle co-activation. Starting form this observation, we recently designed a novel single-joint actuator (nr-VIA) based on the use of non-linear springs in agonistantagonist configuration. In this paper we discuss some control related characteristics of the proposed design. The theoretical analysis is conducted without specifying the potential energy of the springs. We first design a control law capable of monotonically increasing the joint-stiffness (i.e. disturbance rejection) without changing the joint equilibrium configuration; this result is obtained with minimal requirements on the potential energy of the springs. The same control law is then proven (under more restrictive conditions) to monotonically decrease the sensitivity of the joint equilibrium with respect to the actuation variables, a desirable property when trying to achieve a finer control over joint positioning.	biological system;characteristic impedance;human–robot interaction;nominal impedance;nonlinear system;optimal control;rejection sampling;requirement	Francesco Nori;Bastien Berret;Luca Fiorio;Alberto Parmiggiani;Giulio Sandini	2012		10.3182/20120905-3-HR-2030.00175	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.18703385755799	-18.544526566459705	34278

Various studies have been conducted to improve vehicle and traffic safety through vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication. In the field of CAVs, lane change research is considered a very challenging subject. This paper presents a cooperative lane change protocol, considering the impact of V2V communication delay. When creating a path for a lane change in the local path planning module, V2V communication delay occurs. Each vehicle was represented, in our study, by an oriented bounding box (OBB) to determine the risk of collision. We set up a highway driving simulation environment and verified the improved protocol by implementing a longitudinal and lateral controller.	assumed;benign mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of kidney;cav2 gene;computer aided verification;conflict (psychology);driving simulator;drug vehicle;estimated;hearing loss, high-frequency;lateral thinking;mathematical model;meltwater entrepreneurial school of technology;minimum bounding box;motion planning;network packet;reduction (complexity);retransmission (data networks);simulation;statistical model;vehicle-to-vehicle;collision;research grants;sensor (device)	Nadja Zaric;Jae-Il Jung	2018		10.3390/s18103499	electronic engineering;engineering;control engineering	Embedded	56.83590160070357	-16.24383381854216	34282

The trajectories of the center of mass and the next position of the foot are given by a pattern generator. Then, an inverse dynamics control scheme with a quadratic programming optimization solver is used to let the foot go from its initial to its final position, controlling also the center of mass and the waist. The solver can handle an arbitrary number of contact points. When the swinging foot is going down, collision points are detected and they are added as contact points to the model as soon as they appear. If there are three or more contact points, the foot can safely step, but if there are one or two contact points, the foot rotates properly to generate the largest support polygon. Using this heuristic, the foot can stand on non-planar surfaces. Simulation results of the HRP-2 robot walking on a surface with obstacles are presented.	collision detection;heuristic;humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;inverse dynamics;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;quadratic programming;sensor;simulation;solver	Oscar E.

The feedback system is assumed to consist of a linear time-invariant operator G(s) in the forward path and a nonlinear time-varying gain function f(.)K(t) in the feedback path. The stability condition indicates that the bound on the time derivative [dK(t)(dt)] depends both on the nonlinearity f(.) and the multiplier Z(s) chosen to make G(s)Z(s) positive real. It is also shown that the main result in this paper can be specialized to yield many of the results obtained so far for nonlinear time-invariant systems and linear time-varying systems.	nonlinear system	Yo-Sung Cho;Kumpati S.

The numerical simulation problem is usually treated as two separate problems: (i) the forward dynamics problem for computing system accelerations, and (ii) the numerical integration problem for advancing the state in time. We show that the interaction of these two problems leads to new conclusions about the overall efficiency of multibody simulation algorithms; in particular the fastest forward dynamics methods are not necessarily best when considered in conjunction with the popular adaptive stepsize integration methods. Specifically, we show that the articulated-body method [7, 81 is better suited to deal with certain types of numerical problems than the composite rigid body method [20]. We present examples of simulations and discuss the practical implications of these results. tions of motion of multibody systems: the elimination method which leads (for systems without closed loops) to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and the augmentation method which leads to a larger but sparser set of differential algebraic equations (DAE) [18]. This paper focuses on algorithms for simulating the motion of robot manipulators without closed loops (for example robots whose motion is not constrained by contacts with the environment).

The resulting adaptive algorithm is a switched feedback controller able to cope with uncertain continuous PWA systems. The effectiveness of the new proposed control strategy is shown by using it to achieve master slave synchronization of two PWA systems as a representative example.

In the near future autonomous robots will plan and practice actions according to the code of conduct they generate. It is important to investigate how a robot's personality or individual character will form and how to create a desirable one. When only the task objective is given, the control of a complex robot action has a large number of redundant degrees of freedom. The easiness criterion introduced for the arbitrariness resolution in the early stage of optimization affects the optimal action control. From the result of a simple numerical example it is shown that the easiness-based arbitrariness resolution leads to the action control individuality generation.	autonomous robot;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis	Masakazu Suzuki	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014221	redundancy (engineering);simulation;robot;artificial intelligence;computer science;arbitrariness;code of conduct	Robotics	63.52483101372336	-22.300482748248896	34615

Uncertainty can be due to added motor or sensory noise, unmodeled dynamics, or quantization of sensory feedback. Biological systems are faced with further difficulties, since control must be performed by networks of cooperating neurons and neural subsystems. Here, we propose a new mathematical framework for modeling and simulation of distributed control systems operating in an uncertain environment. Stochastic differential operators can be derived from the stochastic differential equation describing a system, and they map the current state density into the differential of the state density. Unlike discrete-time Markov update operators, stochastic differential operators combine linearly for a large class of linear and nonlinear systems, and therefore the combined effects of multiple controllable and uncontrollable subsystems can be predicted. Design using these operators yields systems whose statistical behavior can be specified throughout state-space. The relationship to Bayesian estimation and discrete-time Markov processes is described.	distributed control system;image noise;markov chain;mathematics;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);sensory feedback;simulation;state space	Terence D.

Such a state estimation always compounds real measurements of some system's variables (depending on the utilized technology) with computation of remaining (not measurable) parameters by means of appropriate filtering algorithms. Here, we consider the continuous-discrete EKF and show that its quality is raised by using the adaptive sixth-order nested implicit Runge–Kutta (NIRK) method of Gauss type with automatic local and global error controls. Through case studies the new filtering technology is compared to another EKF implementation based on an adaptive ODE solver but with the sole local error control. Our numerical results exhibit that the designed state estimation algorithm not only outperforms the earlier published adaptive EKF method, but also resolves the so-called “EKF failure” case reported recently. & 2014 European Control Association.

c664e53ed39bddbde07073bc1add3fa241d21831	hierarchical track association and fusion for a networked surveillance system		In this paper we present a benchmark problem for data association based on a real-world networked surveillance system, and compare the behavior of several multidimensional assignment (MDA) algorithms. The problem consists of a set of Ns observers which transmit track/event reports to a fusion center through a particular (real-world based) communication network among one of Nn networks. The network discards the observer’s track identity (ID), replacing it by a network-generated ID and the observer ID, thus losing the information on the origin of the tracks sent by each observer. The solution approach developed in this paper consists of a hierarchical decomposition of the problem. This hierarchical approach first eliminates the redundancy introduced by the communication network by using an MDA algorithm per each observer present, and then using another MDA algorithm to choose which ‘non-redundant’ reports to fuse. This decomposition drastically reduces the dimensionality of the problem fromNs £Nn toNs problems of dimension Nn and one of dimension Ns. A comparison of two association criteria, normalized distance squared (NDS) and likelihood ratio (LR), is carried out. It is shown that the LR yields significantly superior results. Also the selection of certain parameters in the likelihood ratio is discussed. Finally, to evaluate their performance, three different MDA algorithms are used in this setup, Lagrangean Relaxation based MDA, Sequential m-best 2D and Linear Programming. A thorough comparison of these algorithms in terms of the quality of their solutions as well as their run times is done showing some pitfalls and advantages of each.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);correspondence problem;dimensionality reduction;lr parser;linear programming;redundancy (engineering);relaxation (approximation);telecommunications network	Javier Areta;Yaakov Bar-Shalom;Mark Levedahl;Krishna R.

A new thresholding function (Double-Threshold Sigmoid (DTHS) function) and two associated algorithms (DTHS-1 and DTHS-2) are proposed herein, and their convergence performances are discussed in detail. It is shown that the generalized IRLS algorithm is unbiased if the thresholding penalty can eliminate the undesired perturbation term added on the correlation matrix of the measurement matrix. Compared with the others, the new algorithms are endowed with stability and insensitivity with respect to the regularization parameter by selecting some sound upper thresholds and dividing the iteration procedures into the degraded stage and DTHS stage respectively. Further analyses show that the DTHS-1 algorithm is suitable to deal with the sparse and continuous problems for both of the i.i.d. random matrix and under-resolution PSF matrix. The noise performance of the DTHS-1 algorithm is always superior to that of the IRLS algorithm, especially in the face of the under-resolution PSF matrix.

The aim of this study was to apply a new control strategy, named model-inverse time delay control (MiTDC), to series elastic actuators (SEA) in a lower extremity exoskeleton, even in the presence of uncertainties from pHRI. The law for time delay control (TDC) is derived and implementation issues are discussed, including the design of the state observer and the selection of the nominal value of the control distribution coefficient. Additionally, a new concept, a new reference position using the inverse of model dynamics, is introduced to realize satisfactory tracking performance without delay. Experimental results showed that the suggested controller achieved satisfactory performance without accurate information on system parameters, requiring only a nominal value of the control distribution coefficient.	broadcast delay;coefficient;control theory;human–robot interaction;relay;rotary woofer	Suin Kim;Joonbum Bae	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759564	control engineering;simulation;exoskeleton;engineering;control theory;torque;solid modeling;actuator	Robotics	68.2119295690778	-15.92763021699294	34924

Sami Fadali Department of Electrical Engineering / MS 260 University of Nevada, Reno Reno, NV 89557 kmcnicho@ee.unr.edu / fadali@ee.unr.edu Abstract Gain scheduling is a popular approach for nonlinear control system design. A controller is obtained by designing a set of controllers at operating points and then linearly interpolating controller values between them. However, little guidance has been provided in the literature for the selection of operating points. We use interval mathematics and a classical synthesis design approach to determine a near minimal set of design points and assess the quality of a gain scheduled controller. A sufficient condition for the assignment of the system closed loop poles is developed, and an algorithm for selecting the operating points is provided. An example is given to demonstrate the approach.	algorithm;closed-loop transfer function;coefficient;control system;electrical engineering;interval arithmetic;linear interpolation;nonlinear system;nv network;scheduling (computing);simulation;systems design	Kenneth H.

Although a well-tuned PID controller performs well around normal working points, its tolerance to process parameter variations is severely affected due to the nature of PID controllers. The ANF controller developed overcomes this weakness. The controller design involves 1) the constructing a Takagi and Sugeno-type fuzzy rule-based system, 2) employing the BP learning algorithm combined with the least squares method to optimize the membership function (MF) parameters, and 3) adding a secondary loop to ensure control performance. Compared with PID and original fuzzy logic controllers, simulation results show that the ANF controller performances are comparable to the well-tuned PID controller under normal conditions. It, however, exhibits a much improved robustness when the system encounters large parameter variations. It is also expected that the ANF method developed can be easily extended to other control loops in HVAC systems.	neuro-fuzzy	Jian Wu;Wen-Jian Cai	2000		10.1109/ICSMC.2000.886603	pid controller;hvac;real-time computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;fuzzy control system	Robotics	60.49225262696383	-8.677935745588616	34940

This problem arises in many applications which work with multiple signals maintaining some degree of dependency such as radar and sensor networks. In this paper, we introduce a new method towards joint recovery of several independent sparse signals with the same support. We provide an analytical discussion on the convergence of our method called Simultaneous Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding (SIMAT). Additionally, we compare our method with other group-sparse reconstruction techniques, i.e., Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SOMP), and Block Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding (BIMAT) through numerical experiments. The simulation results demonstrate that SIMAT outperforms these algorithms in terms of the metrics Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Success Rate (SR). Moreover, SIMAT is considerably less complicated than BIMAT, which makes it feasible for practical applications such as implementation in MIMO radar systems.	algorithm;experiment;iteration;iterative method;mimo;matching pursuit;multiuse model view;numerical analysis;radar;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing)	Shahrzad Kiani;Sahar Sadrizadeh;Mahdi Boloursaz;Farrokh Marvasti	2017	CoRR		iterative method;mathematical optimization;mathematics;balanced histogram thresholding;thresholding;sparse approximation	Robotics	78.80032819723172	-6.154386361811287	35002

Nonetheless, the required number of micro-simulation runs for reaching an optimal DSC solution and their computational complexity hinder the use of micro-level models for DSC on large-scale motorways. The present study introduces a set of techniques that reduce the number of required micro-simulations, thus improving the computational cost. The proposed techniques: 1) split the motorway into stretches; 2) introduce an approach based on genetic algorithms to reduce the number of micro-simulations; 3) exclude, when possible, VMS combinations by applying solution approximation methods instead of micro-simulation. The method is evaluated through a number of test scenarios in a stretch of motorway A6 in the Netherlands.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;genetic algorithm;simulation;time complexity	Konstantinos Gkiotsalitis;Francesco Alesiani	2014	17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957952	control engineering;simulation;computer science;computational resource;transport engineering	Robotics	55.35633070164871	-12.782644016716269	35014

To control the undesirable chaos in complex motor networks, a dynamic control that interacted the complex networks with environment is first presented. The average effect of the environment is modeled by an overdamped oscillator, which is kept alive with feedback from the subunits. Second, the stability of the controlled system is proved by analytical method and the threshold values of parameter conditions for the onset of stability are obtained. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed control law is effective. Our method has the advantage that involves a single damped dynamical system coupled to all nodes equally and, hence, the design procedure is simple and easy to implement.	chaos theory;complex network;coupling constant;dynamical system;onset (audio);optimal control;simulation	Xian Hui Mai;Du-Qu Wei;Bo Zhang;Xiao-Shu Luo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2015.2406356	control engineering;ac motor;synchronous motor;electronic engineering;control theory;induction motor	Robotics	77.5588772442931	0.2411241605826533	35035

The PI-FC design is based on the optimization of PI controllers in terms of the Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) approach. Next the parameters of the PI controllers are mapped onto the parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno PI-FCs in terms of the modal equivalence principle. An attractive design method is derived to support the implementation of low-cost PI-FCs. The design is enabled by a stability analysis theorem based on Lyapunov’s theorem for time-varying systems. The theoretical approaches are validated by a case study corresponding to the position control of a servo system.

Both the static-state feedback and dynamic output feedback cases are considered. In particular, we characterize a family of Hinfin controllers solving the problem locally around a neighborhood of the origin. To do this, we first derive two stability criteria for discrete-time nonlinear descriptor systems, and then, a version of a bounded real lemma is also developed based on the concepts of dissipation inequality and differential game. After that, the results are used to derive the Hinfin control theory for nonlinear discrete-time descriptor systems. The approach taken is mainly algebraic, and hence is simple and clear.	block cipher mode of operation;control theory;linear algebra;nonlinear system;social inequality	He-Sheng Wang;Chee-Fai Yung	2008	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2008.919543	functional analysis;control engineering;game theory;discrete time and continuous time;fractional calculus;stability;fractal;control system;calculus;feedback loop;control theory;mathematics;differential equation;integral equation	Robotics	72.12754377281352	-1.028663598843908	35107

The nonlinear Mex system gives rise to a special case of a sliding mode observer with no reduced order dynamics. The equivalent injection signal is filtered to generate a residual signal which is used to identify the faults present by means of threshold selection. Fault isolation is based on directional residual set evaluation using the equivalent injection signal. Finally performance of the designed FDI is verified using Monte Carlo simulations.	benchmark (computing);fault detection and isolation;image noise;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;simulation;simulink	Indira Nagesh;Christopher Edwards	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2011.6044485	control engineering;simulation;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory;state observer	Robotics	62.74714280619586	-4.604119394952831	35128

The uncertainty is represented as a vector constrained in a given set that affects the coefficients of the mathematical model of the GRN. It is shown how regions containing all possible steady states can be estimated via an iterative strategy that progressively splits the concentration space into smaller sets, discarding those that are guaranteed not to contain equilibrium points of the considered model. This strategy is based on worst case evaluations of some appropriate functions of the uncertainty via linear matrix inequality optimization.	best, worst and average case;coefficient;gene regulatory network;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;social inequality;steady state	Graziano Chesi	2012	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans	10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2178829	equilibrium point;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;uncertainty;linear matrix inequality;mathematical model;mathematics;iterative method;mathematical economics;steady state;statistics;robustness;polynomial	Robotics	68.02433304312157	4.1419073805377415	35235

The regulator is designed by embedding the (possible nonlinear) internal model of the fault. This idea is applied to the design of a fault-tolerant controller for induction motors in presence of both rotor and stator mechanical faults. ? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model with external inputs for the acoustic duct is first developed by following the physical acoustic propagation principles. Then this PDE model is converted into an infinite dimensional complex-valued state space model using the variable separation technique under the assumption that the acoustic terminal impedance is constant. The assumed acoustic impedance can be estimated using the experimental system identification method. By combining the acoustic duct model with the model of the canceling loudspeaker module, in which the acoustic coupling between the acoustic duct and the loudspeaker is also explicitly modeled, a mathematical model for the entire one-dimensional active duct noise control system is obtained and validated. The developed model provides a solid and sufficient platform for design of active noise control using advanced filtering technique, advanced control techniques and development of virtual sensors as well.	acoustic coupler;acoustic cryptanalysis;advanced process control;characteristic impedance;control system;experimental system;loudspeaker;mathematical model;sensor;software propagation;state-space representation;system identification	Zhenyu Yang;Steffen Podlech	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913179	control engineering;electronic engineering;acoustics;engineering;partial differential equation	Robotics	58.38878603750878	0.5078034679277235	35280

Sufficient conditions to guarantee the persistence of the stability boundary characterization under parameter variation are presented. When these conditions are violated, the stability region may undergo a bifurcation and may suffer drastic changes. In this paper, the behavior of stability region and stability boundary when the system undergoes a type-zero saddle-node bifurcation on the stability boundary is investigated. A complete characterization of these changes in the neighborhood of a type-zero saddle-node bifurcation point on the stability boundary is developed. These results are applied to the analysis of stability region of a simple Hopfield artificial neural network.	artificial neural network;autonomous robot;bifurcation theory;dynamical system;hopfield network;ibm power systems;network theory;nonlinear system;persistence (computer science)	Fabíolo Moraes Amaral;Luís F.

The design specifications are given in the frequency domain and are expressed as frequency-domain inequalities. On the basis of the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, each frequency-domain inequality is converted into linear matrix inequalities of the controller parameters. The controller parameters can be computed efficiently by solving a convex optimization problem to maximize the loop gain around the rotational frequency while satisfying other frequency-domain specifications on the performance and stability. Experimental results show that a reasonable performance can be obtained by using a second-order controller, and the performance can be further improved by using a third-order controller.	add-ons for firefox;convex optimization;farkas' lemma;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;phase margin;social inequality	Jae Sik Lim;Jung Rae Ryoo;Young Il Lee;Sung-Yong Son	2012	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2011.2106159	control engineering;open-loop controller;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;controller;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;frequency domain	Robotics	65.89178772801145	-2.278886919615182	35354

It is well known that for a switched system with all stable subsystems, if the dwell time of the switching signal are long enough, then the system remains stable. When systems are unknown, the value of dwell time to preserve stability are usually implicit and only can be shown qualitatively. We propose a variable structure (VS) adaptive backstepping control to achieve the control goal for a class of unknown switched linear systems and with this design, the value of average dwell time (ADT) that is sufficient for system stability can be obtained explicitly and systematically for high relative degree cases. For the considered switched system with unknown parameters, unknown switching signals, and unknown switching time instants, we can guarantee output regulation and signal boundedness for the closed loop system with the proposed controller provided the ADT of the switching signal is greater than the derived value. An example is provided to validate the results.	approximation;formal verification;linear system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;switched-mode power supply;switching time;tree rearrangement	Ming-Li Chiang;Li-Chen Fu	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;stability;adaptive control;backstepping;network switch;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	68.36951835840571	-0.30074309029532514	35450

This paper presents a novel technique of dual feedback & feedforward synchronized cross-coupled motion control (DFFSCCC) for two-wheel mobile robot to achieve higher accuracy. previous cross-coupled motion control techniques are based on the consideration of only internal disturbances. The technique presented in this paper is based on the consideration of both internal and external disturbances. Similarly, previous cross-coupled motion control techniques used only feedback signals to correct the errors of the system. DFFSCCC has employed feedback and feedforward signals at the same time to achieve more accurate results. DFFSCCC has been mathematically modeled and simulated by using MATLAB-SIMULINK. The achieved results show that the suggested technique is robust and yield zero transient response and zero steady state errors. Hence, DFFSCCC can yield zero position and orientation errors which can keep the mobile robot on the same trajectory path, either straight or curve, despite of continuous disturbances that may affect either of motors	algorithm;autonomous robot;control flow;feedback;feedforward neural network;lagrange multiplier;matlab;mathematical model;mobile robot;motion system;resultant;simulation;simulink;social robot;steady state	Omar Al-Ayasrah;Talib Alukaidey;R.

This paper presents an alternative representation using random unit quaternions that makes no strict small angle error assumption. The approach uses a novel family of probability density functions derived by placing a unit-length constraint upon some or all of the degrees of freedom of a Gaussian in Euclidean space. An important property of this representation is that it does not directly interrelate angles with spatial components. This paper discusses the properties of Radially Constrained Gaus-sians (RCG's), then presents speciic cases of uncertain rotations, directions, orientations, 2D transformations , and 3D transformations, then indicates their applications to robotics.	range concatenation grammars;robotics	K.

The proposed control system is designed so that the tracking performance is optimized subject to the stability margin constraint.

68c326464390917c00c6a7c48fd9a14d4c1a4021	output-feedback variable gain super-twisting algorithm for arbitrary relative degree systems		ABSTRACTThis paper presents an output-feedback control strategy based on the variable gain super-twisting algorithm. The proposal achieves robust global/semi-global exact tracking results for plants with arbitrary relative degree. This is ensured in spite of parametric uncertainties and disturbances that may be state-dependent and time-varying. The construction of such controller is based on a (non)homogeneous higher order sliding-mode differentiator with dynamic gains. The gain adaptation schemes for the controller and differentiator are based on norm observers to overcome the lack of state measurement. The continuous nature of the obtained control signal alleviates the chattering phenomenon. The stability properties of the proposed controller are demonstrated by means of a Lyapunov function-based analysis. The theoretical results are verified through a simulation example, and experimentally tested on a seesaw module.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;variable-gain amplifier	Tiago Roux Oliveira;Victor Hugo Pereira Rodrigues;Antonio Estrada;Leonid M.

The feedback may also be inherent in many dynamic systems (e.g., economical, biological). In this paper we shall consider the problem of identification of dynamic systems operating under feedback control and propose an indirect approach to closed-loop system identification based on the bias-compensation principle. The main feature of the proposed method is that introductions of auxiliary vector and matrix are helpful to find an approach to estimating the noise-output correlated variance. Therefore via compensating the consistent bias of LS estimate, the consistent estimates for closed-loop system can be given.	control system;dynamical system;feedback;instability;system identification	Li-Juan Jia;Ran Tao;Yue Wang;Shunshoku Kanae;Zi-Jiang Yang;Kiyoshi Wada	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control	10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525174	control engineering;electronic engineering;information science;computer science;control system;signal processing;control theory;feedback;statistics	Robotics	66.49793423663493	-5.783523188235258	35619

The design of a parallel robot is carried out by this approach which integrates in a simultaneous way both the structure design parameters of a parallel robot and the PID controller gains in order to improve the position errors and the robot dexterity for executing a specific task. The TBMSDA considers the dynamic system as an equality constraint into the optimization problem. Through the TBMSDA, an optimal combination of the structure and PID controller gains for a planar five-bar parallel robot is obtained. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this design approach.	differential evolution;dynamic programming;dynamical system;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;nonlinear system;optimization problem;pid;parallel manipulator;process identifier;simulation;systems design	Carlos Alberto Cruz Villar;Jaime Alvarez-Gallegos;Miguel Gabriel Villarreal-Cervantes	2009	Computación y Sistemas			Robotics	60.126924943310215	-14.0348374108424	35624

It relates to studying asymptotic stability of the set of state trajectories corresponding to zero input and zero output, with a fixed switching signal. Due to the nature of solutions of switched DAEs, the problem reduces to analyzing stability of the trajectories emanating from a non-vanishing unobservable subspace, for which we first derive a geometric expression. The stability of state trajectories starting from that subspace can then be checked in two possible ways. In the first case, detectability of switched DAE is shown to be equivalent to the asymptotic stability of a reduced order discrete-time switched system. In the second approach, the solutions from a non-vanishing unobservable subspace are mapped to the solutions of a reduced order continuous system with time-varying switching ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As a special case of the later approach, the reduced order switched system is time-invariant if the unobservable subspace is invariant for all subsystems.	differential algebraic equation;time-invariant system	Aneel Tanwani;Stephan Trenn	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402666	control engineering;mathematical optimization;network switch;trajectory;control theory;mathematics	Vision	69.23595998475261	2.8391967304049746	35683

Black-box identification of hybrid models from input/output observations and no information on the operating mode of the system is a challenging problem, as both the logical and the continuous dynamics must be retrieved. In this work, we consider the identification of discrete hybrid automata (DHA), which represent a mathematical abstraction of hybrid models whose logical dynamics are described by a finite state machine (FSM) and the continuous dynamics are represented through affine discrete-time dynamical models. We propose a two-stage estimation algorithm based on the joint use of clustering, multi-model recursive least-squares and linear multicategory discrimination techniques, which allows us to estimate both the affine models describing the continuous dynamics and the FSM governing the logical dynamics of the system.	algorithm;automata theory;black box;cluster analysis;computation;finite-state machine;hybrid automaton;hybrid system;input/output;markov property;numerical analysis;polyhedron;recursion;recursive least squares filter;simulation	Valentina Breschi;Dario Piga;Alberto Bemporad	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798294	computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematical model;mathematics;automaton;cluster analysis;computational model;algorithm	Robotics	54.87780069490965	-3.4086027751885597	35684

The technique, which is based on the isolation of fault signatures via filtered torque prediction error estimates, does not require measurements or estimates of manipulator acceleration as is the case with some previously suggested methods. The method is formally demonstrated to be robust under uncertainty in the robot parameters. Furthermore, an adaptive version of the algorithm is introduced, and shown to both improve coverage and significantly reduce detection times. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experiments with a two-joint manipulator system.	algorithm;experiment;fault detection and isolation;hp 48 series;rewrite (programming);robot;robustness (computer science);sensor;type signature;velocity (software development)	Warren E.

The experimental set up used is a CNC machine that carries out metals spinning. The controlled forces are the metal forming forces. The designed controller operates in a dynamic environment. The complete control system operates in a manner similar to reaction compensation. The force controller used can be viewed as an integrating on-off controller which has tightly controlled release of control efforts to the controllers. It brings in artificial damping that ensures the stability of the control system. The designed force controller operates within limited tool path disturbances. The controller requires the feed forward of a nominal tool path. The accuracy of the nominal tool path brings the force deviations to within a manageable level.

Multi-mass-spring models are considered for the characterization of the most prominent sloshing modes. The control objective is to control the translational velocity vector and the attitude of the spacecraft, while attenuating the sloshing modes. A full-state feedback that uses a reduced-order observer for the estimation of the slosh states is proposed to achieve the objective. The effectiveness of the proposed observer-based control law is illustrated through a computer simulation.	computer simulation;nonlinear system;optimal control;velocity (software development);vii	Jaime Rubio Hervas;Mahmut Reyhanoglu	2014	2014 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2014.6864607	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.31279087652817	-14.884362102715322	35831

We utilize a new assumption instead of the contraction assumption in discounted optimal control problems. We establish the error bounds for approximate value iteration based on a new error condition. Furthermore, we also establish the error bounds for approximate policy iteration and approximate optimistic policy iteration algorithms. It is shown that the iterative approximate value function can converge to a finite neighborhood of the optimal value function under some conditions. To implement the developed algorithms, critic and action neural networks are used to approximate the value function and control policy, respectively. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithms.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;artificial neural network;assumed;bellman equation;converge;dynamic programming;iteration;markov decision process;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem	Derong Liu;Hongliang Li;Ding Wang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2402203	mathematical optimization;optimal control;function approximation;nonlinear system;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network	ML	61.98716569299422	-2.4986591355620273	35980

The technique is used to enable placing objects in order from the corner of a container, fulfilling the following conditions: (A) the corner is within the reach of a robot manipulator, and (B) the robot manipulator does not collide with surrounding obstacles when it moves an object to the corner. The technique is as follows: a robot manipulator holding an object alternates between motions in a straight line and random reflections from a surface of either a container or already-packed objects in a simulation of robot movement. The motions and reflections are under physical constraints such as the reach of the robot manipulator and collisions between the robot and surrounding obstacles. The technique was evaluated with numerical examples based on the CAD data of an actual industrial-robot-manipulator using five types of objects, and the robot-packable corner for each object was determined. We therefore concluded that the technique is essential for the packing of various objects with a robot manipulator. The technique is expected to be used for packing with a robot manipulator in warehouses and factories.	computer-aided design;executable;mobile robot;numerical analysis;reflection (computer graphics);set packing;simulation	Kanako Esaki;Nobutaka Kimura;Kiyoto Ito	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844249	planning;computer vision;bang-bang robot;parallel manipulator;simulation;snake-arm robot;trajectory;mobile manipulator;robot control;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	61.902050986500825	-21.718859059162327	36047

When appropriately modified, the theory can be used to design a “switching” controller that can be applied to insulin injection for blood glucose (BG) regulation. The “switching” controller is defined by a collection of basic insulin rates and a rule that switches the insulin rates from one value to another. The rule employed an estimation of BG from noisy measurements, and the subsequent optimization of a performance index that involves the solution of a “jump” Riccati differential equation and a discrete-time dynamic programming equation. With an appropriate patient model, simulation studies have shown that the controller could correct BG deviation using clinically acceptable insulin delivery rates.	bellman equation;best, worst and average case;blood substitute;control theory;dynamic programming;job control (unix);mathematical optimization;network switch;norm (social);optimal control;simulation	Frederick Chee;Andrey V.

The vehicle's movement is controlled through a suboptimal sliding mode steering law.

Lower bounds on L performance as a function of sampling rate and quantizer precision. The main feature of the performance data is that performance degrades with decreasing quantizer precision. As the quantizer's precision increases, the sampling rate at which the """" onset """" of worsening performance occurs also increases. In general however, it seems that for any given quantizer precision, there is a sampling rate fast enough to cause performance to degrade. Furthermore, from this and other data (for various precisions), it seems that as the sampling rate increases , performance degrades unboundedly. Since simulation time increases linearly with the sampling rate, it is not very practical to simulate rates faster than 10 04-10 05 using MATLAB on currently available workstations. The performance data indicates that for any given precision level in the controller's arithmetic, the output norm limits to infinity as the sampling period goes to zero. If this conjecture is true, such systems should be regarded as unstable for fast sampling rates, even though for any fixed rate they are BIBO stable as argued earlier. Finally, we should point out that as observed in [8], one can significantly improve the finite precision performance of a system by the choice of controller realization. This issue was not addressed in this note. A more judicious choice of controller realization, would have probably improved the performance curves in Fig. 7 (by delaying the onset of worsening performance to higher sampling rates). However, it appears that the basic pattern of degrading performance for sufficiently fast sampling rates would persist. This last point deserves further investigation , and if true, would indicated some fundamental limitation for the use of unstable dynamic sampled-data controllers.

In sparse coding, signals are represented with a linear combination of a small number of elementary signals called atoms, and the collection of atoms is called a dictionary. Design of the dictionary has strong influence on the signal approximation performance. Recently, to put prior information into dictionary learning, several methods imposing a certain kind of structure on the dictionary are proposed. In this paper, like wavelet analysis, a dictionary for sparse signal representation is assumed to be generated from an ancestral atom, and a method for learning the ancestral atom is proposed. The proposed algorithm updates the ancestral atom by iterating dictionary update in unstructured dictionary space and projection of the updated dictionary onto the structured dictionary space. The algorithm allows a simple differential geometric interpretation. Numerical experiments are performed to show the characteristics and advantages of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;approximation;atom;coefficient;decimation (signal processing);dictionary;experiment;gradient;ground truth;image scaling;k-svd;lexicography;machine learning;mathematical optimization;neural coding;numerical method;openmp;signal-to-noise ratio;singular value decomposition;sparse matrix;wavelet	T.

Synthesizing gaits by hand is a complex and time-consuming task which becomes even more challenging when the vehicle operates underwater. When operating underwater any motion of the limbs applies forces to the vehicle. Underwater gaits must therefore be constructed to mitigate these unwanted forces while meeting the desired gait properties. This paper presents an automatic gait synthesis system for underwater legged vehicles. The system utilizes a simulated annealing engine coupled with a black box hydrodynamic vehicle model to synthesize the desired gait. The resulting system is used to synthesize gaits for a simulated version of the AQUA amphibious hexapod although it is general enough to be applied to other legged vehicles.	aqua;autonomous robot;black box;simulated annealing;speech synthesis	Andrew German;Michael R.

The proposed hierarchy builds on the notion of approximate simulation relations. We use the diffeomorphic transformation between the feedback linearized system and the nonlinear system, along with the associated interface between the abstraction and the linearization of the concrete system obtained via feedback, to recast the problem of trajectory planning and control for the nonlinear system into a reduced dimensional space. The formal abstraction framework then enables the control to be mapped to the space of the concrete nonlinear system using the feedback linearized system as a “bridge”. Two different hierarchical control architectures are proposed for this framework and the method is demonstrated with a quadrotor system.	approximation algorithm;control system;feedback;hierarchical control system;linear system;linearizability;nonlinear system;refinement (computing);simulation	Jie Fu;Shridhar K.

First, a precursor to an ionomeric polymer material (Nafion) is used to 3D print modular leg and body sections to create a caterpillar-like robot. Then, the printed components are activated, plated with electrodes, assembled together to create the robot from smart electroactive polymer material. The 3D-printed robot exploits the unique capabilities of IPMC materials; specifically, the actuation of the hydrated 3D-printed leg and body sections can be controlled by applying a voltage signal. In particular, the IPMC legs can grip and the body sections can expand and contract, allowing the robot to propel itself forward and backward. The newly-developed 3D-printing process and the robot design and modeling process are described. Experimental results are presented that show the prototype robot moving along a tube like a caterpillar or inchworm.	3d printing;electroactive polymers;gait analysis;ibm notes;ionic;plating;polymer;propel;prototype;robot	James D.

Using fuzzy logic systems to approximate unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy state observer is designed for estimating the unmeasured states. By combining adaptive backstepping technique with adaptive fuzzy control control approach is developed.

This effect can reduce the stability and positioning accuracy of these machines. Unfortunately, their dynamic properties also vary with the lifted load magnitude and position. The purpose of the paper is to present a controller design method which can handle the effect of varying lifted load magnitude and position in a dynamic model and at the same time it has good reference signal tracking and mast-vibration reducing properties. A controller design case study is presented step by step from the dynamic modeling to the validation of the resulting controller. In the paper the dynamic modeling possibilities of single-mast stacker cranes are summarized. The handling of varying dynamical behavior is realized via the polytopic LPV modeling approach. Based on this modeling technique a gain-scheduled controller design method is proposed, which is suitable for achieving the goals set. Finally, controller validation is presented by means of time domain simulations.	lempel–ziv–stac;mathematical model;model order reduction;radio masts and towers;scheduling (computing);simulation;state space;time series;titanium nitride	Sándor Hajdu;Péter Gáspár	2016	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science	10.1515/amcs-2016-0056	robust control;control engineering;automotive engineering;control theory;mathematics;gain scheduling	Robotics	72.4081210845771	-15.248818282053744	36405
732637b430c71a5999893148677df1d9f4a0630c	queue length estimation at isolated intersections based on intelligent vehicle infrastructure cooperation systems		With the advance of intelligent vehicle infrastructure cooperation systems (i-VICS), many traffic parameters can be inferred given data from the OBU (On Board Unit of i-VICS)-equipped vehicles to calculate some information used in the modern urban traffic management. As a typical application, the estimation of investigated queue length at isolated intersections is proposed in the paper. Firstly, the queue length estimation at isolated intersections is explored to be transformed into the problem of deriving the number of queued vehicles. Two models, the improved and advanced interpolation methods, are then introduced to the condition of single cycle and multiple cycles, respectively. The microscopic simulation software VISSIM is adopted to evaluate the effect of the derived models. Its analysis shows that, under the condition of single cycle, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the improved interpolation method is less than 2 vehicles when the equipped rate of i-VICS OBU is higher than 50% and the maximum MAE with 30% equipped rate will be no more than 4 vehicles. On the other hand, under the condition of multiple cycles, the MAE of the advanced interpolation method with very low OBU-equipped rates will be less than 6 vehicles. Finally, numerical results of proposed approach have shown the relations of MAE with the volume-to-capacity ratio and the OBU-equipped rate.	approximation error;interpolation;numerical analysis;simulation software;vehicle information and communication system;vissim	Huile Xu;Jishiyu Ding;Yi Zhang;Jianming Hu	2017	2017 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2017.7995792	simulation software;acceleration;vissim;interpolation;real-time computing;mean absolute error;control engineering;trajectory;queue;engineering	Robotics	54.5590797091335	-13.523430701668051	36426

Firstly, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is adopted to estimate the lumped model uncertainties online for compensation. Then, a novel RBFNN-based fully distributed adaptive control scheme consisting of control law to stabilize the system and adaptive law to adjust RBFNN weights is developed to tackle the time-varying formation tracking problem in the presence of varying time delay. The uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of the formation tracking errors is theoretically analyzed through Lyapunov approach.

The overall interconnected system consists of multiple heterogeneous LTI sub-systems with the physical interconnection being modeled by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The sub-systems are controlled by a networked controller through a shared communication channel. In order to cope with the limited channel capacity, we introduce a bi-character deterministic-probabilistic scheduling mechanism which dynamically assigns access priorities to each sub-system at each time-step according to an error-dependent priority measure. The sub-systems which are granted channel access then transmit their state information through the communication network. Given an emulation-based control strategy, we prove stability of such networked systems under the proposed scheduling law in terms of f-ergodicity of overall network-induced error. Simulation results illustrate the proposed approach and show a reduction in the error variance compared to standard TDMA and uniform random-access scheduling policies.	channel (communications);channel capacity;control system;control theory;controller (computing);directed acyclic graph;emulator;ergodicity;interconnection;optimal control;random access;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications network	Mohammad H.

Sparse decomposition can be fast solved by tree based matching pursuit, however, the tree based pursuit is locally best in essence, so it convergences very slowly. We propose the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that maintains full backward orthogonality of the residual (error) at every step and thereby leads to improved convergence. Also, it guarantees the sparsity of results and exactly of reconstructed image. Speech signal and earthquake signal are tested via Tree based orthogonal matching pursuit separately, both of which have better convergence performance than tree based matching pursuit. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.	dictionary;matching pursuit;tree structure	Song Xian Zhao;Qiuyan Zhang;Heng Yang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23324-1_50	speech recognition;k-svd;machine learning;pattern recognition;matching pursuit	Vision	77.97722503994704	-5.101731092148657	36525

We are extending here the basic cell model of [1] for the example case of a peripheral navigation system that needs to demonstrate such plasticity in the sense of tolerance to hardware failures. This biologically-inspired extension consists in equipping each one of the cells with multiple motivations to process/consume different kinds of messages and in cancelling the rigid connections between levels, so that cells of one level will compete for the consumption of the messages coming in from the previous level. Individual cell “motivations” are expressed as continuous variables that are excited by certain identification values of the incoming messages, thus as eigen-frequencies. Simulation results indicate that the cellular network self-organizes in case of failures by “discovering” alternative message flow pathways and that multiple failures slow down the system’s responsiveness to external events, since intermediate level cells are not specialized to one message type but distribute their processing time among different motivations. The presence of an additional developmental/ontogenetical factor allows for self-organization even in the case of major failures in the network, i.e. when a particular eigenfrequency disappears completely from the system.	eigen (c++ library);fault tolerance;peripheral;responsiveness;self-organization;simulation;systems biology	Elpida S.

6fd52f90f6a4e690d1968fe26b9dee8d7f552d7c	learning stabilizable dynamical systems via control contraction metrics		We propose a novel framework for learning stabilizable nonlinear dynamical systems for continuous control tasks in robotics. The key idea is to develop a new control-theoretic regularizer for dynamics fitting rooted in the notion of stabilizability, which guarantees that the learned system can be accompanied by a robust controller capable of stabilizing any open-loop trajectory that the system may generate. By leveraging tools from contraction theory, statistical learning, and convex optimization, we provide a general and tractable semi-supervised algorithm to learn stabilizable dynamics, which can be applied to complex underactuated systems. We validated the proposed algorithm on a simulated planar quadrotor system and observed notably improved trajectory generation and tracking performance with the control-theoretic regularized model over models learned using traditional regression techniques, especially when using a small number of demonstration examples. The results presented illustrate the need to infuse standard model-based reinforcement learning algorithms with concepts drawn from nonlinear control theory for improved reliability.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;control theory;convex optimization;dynamical system;machine learning;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;reinforcement learning;robotics;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry	Sumeet Singh;Vikas Sindhwani;Jean-Jacques E.

For this, an implicit state and input parametrization in terms of a basic output is determined via a Volterra-type integral equation with operator kernel. By recursively computing successive series coefficients, a series solution of the integral equation is obtained, whose absolute and uniform convergence is verified by restricting the system parameters and the basic output to a certain but broad Gevrey class. Hence, prescribing an admissible desired trajectory for the basic output directly yields the feedforward control by evaluating the input parametrization. This results in a systematic procedure for trajectory planning and feedforward control design for boundary controlled parabolic distributed-parameter systems defined on higher-dimensional domains.	coefficient;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;nonlinear system;parabolic antenna;recursion	Thomas Meurer;Andreas Kugi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2024572	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control system;automatic control;process control;control theory;mathematics;distributed parameter system;integral equation;partial differential equation;feed forward	Robotics	75.53699014736013	-1.7864083342115618	36590

The AEM method improves the traditional EM method by relaxation under an annealing process, which is recruited to avoid trappings of tremendous spurious local minima within an objective function that inversely measures quantitative performance of a demixing structure. The derived objective function depends on the demixing structure as well as a set of membership vectors that represent missing data toward encoding statistical dependency of retrieved independent sources. Under the annealing process, the derived E and M steps are iteratively performed to search for expectations of membership vectors and minimizers of the objective function. The state number of membership vectors is related to modulate discretization of observations. Its effects on extraction of fetal electrocardiograms and reliability of the AEM method for blind source separation are extensively explored by numerical simulations. r 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In a navigation system, information from internal and external vehicle sensors is combined to estimate the motion of the vehicle. However, while the issue of sensing and effects of sensor accuracy have been widely studied, there are few results or insights into the complementary role played by the vehicle model. This paper has two main contributions: a theoretical analysis of the role of the vehicle model in navigation system performance, and an empirical study of three models of increasing complexity, used in a navigation system for a conventional road vehicle. The theoretical analysis focuses on understanding the effect of estimation errors caused by approximations to the """"true"""" vehicle model. It shows that while substantial performance improvements can be obtained from better vehicle modeling, there is, in general, no definitive """"best"""" model for such complex nonlinear estimation problems. The empirical study shows that an appropriate choice of a higher order model can lead to significant improvements in the performance of the navigation system. However, the highest order model suffers from problems related to the observability of some of its parameters. We show how this problem can be overcome through the imposition of weak constraints."""	automotive navigation system;autonomous robot	Simon J. Julier;Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte	2003	IEEE Trans.

First, the paper considers the case of switched systems, where the vector field is allowed to arbitrarily switch among the elements of a finite family. Second, the paper considers the case of hybrid systems, where the state space is partitioned into several regions described by polynomial inequalities, and the vector field is defined on each region independently from the other ones. In both cases, the problem consists of computing the largest sublevel set of a Lyapunov function included in the domain of attraction. An approach is proposed for solving this problem based on convex programming, which provides a guaranteed inner estimate of the sought sublevel set. The conservatism of the provided estimate can be decreased by increasing the size of the optimisation problem. Some numerical examples illustrate the proposed approach.	nonlinear system	Chuen Kit Luk;Graziano Chesi	2015	Int. J.

Minimization of the gain from initial plant state mismatch to L2 (respectively, l2) plant output mismatch provides improved transients. A solution to the bumpless transfer problem is given, both for plants without input saturation and for plants with input saturation.

First, an ε-dependent Lur'e Lyapunov function is constructed that facilitates the stability analysis of the singularly perturbed system. Then, a stability criterion expressed in terms of ε-independent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is derived. Based on the stability criterion, an algorithm is proposed to compute the stability bound that is shown to be less conservative than those computed using other existing methods.

4d5277cc5b7fb52797a7ac2a4940cda4819201d7	state-space transformations of uncertain systems with purely real and conjugate-complex eigenvalues into a cooperative form		Cooperativity of uncertain dynamic systems can be exploited to simplify several tasks such as the computation of guaranteed state enclosures, the design of interval observers, forecasting worst-case bounds for selected system outputs in predictive control, and the identification of unknown parameters. Although many system models in biological, chemical, and medical applications are naturally cooperative, there is also a great number of systems (typically from the fields of electric, magnetic, and mechanical applications) which do not show this property if the state equations are derived using first-principle techniques. Hence, it is often desired to transform such system models into an equivalent cooperative form. Unfortunately, these transformations are often not straightforward, especially, if linear systems and nonlinear ones with state-dependent system matrices are subject to bounded parameter uncertainty. This paper presents two approaches for the transformation of state equations into a cooperative form for which the original system models do not fulfill sufficient criteria for cooperativity in their basic formulation. These are a time-invariant transformation for systems with purely real eigenvalues and a time-varying transformation in the case of conjugate-complex eigenvalues. Both procedures are tested on real-life application scenarios with interval parameters.	best, worst and average case;computation;consensus dynamics;dynamical system;line search;linear system;log management;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;real life;requirement;simulation;time-invariant system;wrapping (graphics)	Julia Kersten;Andreas Rauh;Harald Aschemann	2018	2018 23rd International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2018.8486085	computer science;control theory;state space;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;mathematical optimization;dynamical system;matrix (mathematics);model predictive control;bounded function;linear system;nonlinear system	Robotics	74.23837621542633	-9.85232212328627	36961

In this paper, we bring these complementary techniques together by efficiently estimating the mechanical stability of the plane when it makes contact with a vertical surface; the resulting landing funnel can then be used in a feedback motion planning algorithm for the flight controller. We consider a simplified model of the perching dynamics and report an extension of the region of attraction techniques, using sums-of-squares optimization, which combines polynomial approximations of barrier constraints with the traditional Lyapunov methods to achieve tight estimation of the true region of attraction for the model. We demonstrate the new method on a variety of design parameters for the perching system, suggesting a potential use as a mechanical system or controller design tool.	algorithm;approximation;automated planning and scheduling;design tool;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;motion planning;polynomial;resource-oriented architecture;simulation	Elena Leah Glassman;Alexis Lussier Desbiens;Mark M.

169124d78f85ad4ed721a40dd263ba29303cf814	experimental closed-loop control of scr aftertreatment systems using nox sensors cross-sensitive to nh3. (commande expérimentale en boucle fermée des systèmes de post-traitement scr en utilisant des sondes à nox sensibles au nh3)		The problem studied in this thesis is the closed-loop control of a urea-SCR (urea Selective Catalytic Reduction) as used in aftertreatment systems of diesel vehicles. A f rst contribution of the thesis is a detailed model for the SCR, highlighting the distributed (1D) nature of the considered system, and several successive reductions of this simulation model leading to a simpler one, better-suited for control design purposes. A second contribution consists in considering the sensitivity to NH3 of the NOx sensor used in a feedback loop, in the development of the control algorithms (state observer, feedback, gain scheduling, measurement interpretation). The ambiguity of the output measurement could be detrimental to the closed loop response, as it generates multiple equilibrium points (artefacts), besides the point of practical interest. A study of the closed-loop dynamics is performed in the vicinity of each point, which shows that the closed loop system naturally converges to the point of interest not to the artefacts. Both contributions have been tested and validated experimentally. In summary, the method proposed in this thesis might allow an engine equipped with Euro 5 hardware to satisfy Euro 6 standard using a preconditioning procedure of the catalyst.

Thus, there is a need for the development of accurate and reliable thermal compensation models to reduce the impact of such thermal drift of the sensors. Since the conventional thermal calibration methods are typically time-consuming and costly, an efficient thermal calibration method to investigate the thermal drift of a full set of gyroscope and accelerometer errors (i.e., biases, scale factor errors and non-orthogonalities) over the entire temperature range in a few hours is proposed. The proposed method uses the idea of the Ramp method, which removes the time-consuming process of stabilizing the sensor temperature, and addresses its inherent problems with several improvements. We change the temperature linearly for a complete cycle and take a balanced strategy by making comprehensive use of the sensor measurements during both heating and cooling processes. Besides, an efficient 8-step rotate-and-static scheme is designed to further improve the calibration accuracy and efficiency. Real calibration tests showed that the proposed method is suitable for low-grade IMUs and for both lab and factory calibration due to its efficiency and sufficient accuracy.	addresses (publication format);calibration;computer cooling;conflict (psychology);cool - action;heating;lindera sp. zhou 200491;mems cap;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;natural science disciplines;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;root mean square;thermal grease;yang;accelerometers;sensor (device)	Xiaoji Niu;You Li;Hongping Zhang;Qingjiang Wang;Yalong Ban	2013		10.3390/s130912192	acceleration;control engineering;inertial measurement unit;electronic engineering;calibration;transducer;temperature;engineering;control theory;accelerometer;physics;quantum mechanics	AI	80.20330846758377	-15.917026649839226	37168

However, understanding some fundamental issues still remains as further study. One of the issues is the exact dynamic model. Previous studies very often ignore the wheel dynamics of the mobile robot and suffer from algorithmic singularity. Thus, actuator sizing or control algorithms based on the incomplete plant model does not guarantee the control performance of the system. This paper deals with the singularity-free, exact dynamic modeling and analysis of an omnidirectional mobile robot with three caster wheels. Initially, the exact dynamic model of the mobile robot including the wheel dynamics is introduced. A natural orthogonal complement approach is also introduced. The joint-space and operational-space dynamic models are derived as analytical forms. Through simulation, the discrepancy of the incomplete dynamic model is shown by comparison with the exact dynamic model. Furthermore, the useful aspect of operational dynamics in terms of impact geometry is also discussed.	mobile robot;wheels	Jae Heon Chung;Byung-Ju Yi;Whee Kuk Kim;Hogil Lee	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241647	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.12339704530727	-20.928700941357246	37169

This is because the number of the automobiles is increasing rapidly. To solve this problem, there are many solutions. One of them is to increase the flow rate of a particular traffic artery. A converse approach to increase the flow rate is to make the vehicle smaller and narrower. We developed a new conceptual Narrow Tilting Vehicle (NTV) that has one front wheel and two rear wheels. Also, it is very narrow and all three wheels can tilt to improve the stability during turning. In this paper, we derive a new switching dynamical model of NTV. This model considers several NTV states including normal running, temporary running with one rear wheel not on the ground and totally falling down. Based on this model, a simulation platform is established, which is useful to test different control methods and to investigate dangerous driving situations in case hurt drivers in real experiments. The effectiveness of proposed dynamical model is verified through comparison study of simulations and corresponding experiments.	experiment;network congestion;simulation;wheels	Hiroki Furuichi;Jian Huang;Takayuki Matsuno;Toshio Fukuda	2012	2012 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2012.6492432	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	72.71073852558439	-16.535339758493038	37178

We consider a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system that can be written in a form of nonlinear state-space representation. We show that residuals that are sensitive to variations in some cardiovascular parameters and to abnormal opening and closure of the valves, can be generated. Since the whole state is not easily available for measurement, we propose to associate the residual generator to a robust extended kalman filter.

Following the assumption that the time-frequency (TF) distributions of the input sources do not overlap, quadratic TF representation is used to exploit the sparsity of the statistically nonstationary sources. However, separation performance is shown to be limited by the selection of a certain threshold in classifying the eigenvectors of the TF matrices drawn from the observation mixtures. Two methods are, therefore, proposed based on recently introduced advanced clustering techniques, namely Gap statistics and self-splitting competitive learning (SSCL), to mitigate the problem of eigenvector classification. The novel integration of these two approaches successfully overcomes the problem of artificial sources induced by insufficient knowledge of the threshold and enables automatic determination of the number of active sources over the observation. The separation performance is thereby greatly improved. Practical consequences of violating the TF orthogonality assumption in the current approach are also studied, which motivates the proposal of a new solution robust to violation of orthogonality. In this new method, the TF plane is partitioned into appropriate blocks and source separation is thereby carried out in a block-by-block manner. Numerical experiments with linear chirp signals and Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) signals are included which support the improved performance of the proposed approaches.	algorithm;blind signal separation;chirp;cluster analysis;competitive learning;experiment;image plane;imaging phantom;key (cryptography);modulation;quadratic function;simulation;source separation;sparse matrix	Yuhui Luo;Wenwu Wang;Jonathon A.

9f487ff49fe3dc199f42852af35920518013f82c	lévy nmf for robust nonnegative source separation		Source separation, which consists in decomposing data into meaningful structured components, is an active research topic in many fields including music signal processing. In this paper, we introduce the Positive α-stable (PαS) distributions to model the latent sources, which are a subclass of the stable distributions family. They notably permit us to model random variables that are both nonnegative and impulsive. Considering the Levy distribution, the only PαS distribution whose density is tractable, we propose a mixture model called Lévy Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (Lévy NMF). This model accounts for low-rank structures in nonnegative data that possibly has high variability or is corrupted by very adverse noise. The model parameters are estimated in a maximum-likelihood sense. We also derive an estimator of the sources, which extends the validity of the Wiener filtering to the PαS case. Experiments on synthetic data and realistic music signals show that Lévy NMF compares favorably with state-of-the art techniques in terms of robustness to impulsive noise and highlight its potential for decomposing nonnegative data.	cobham's thesis;heart rate variability;low-rank approximation;mixture model;non-negative matrix factorization;signal processing;source separation;synthetic data	Paul Magron;Roland Badeau;Antoine Liutkus	2017	2017 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA)	10.1109/WASPAA.2017.8170035	mixture model;estimator;wiener filter;mathematical optimization;random variable;source separation;lévy distribution;mathematics;artificial intelligence;synthetic data;non-negative matrix factorization;pattern recognition	ML	79.58605263425692	-10.308663266244919	37331

For an unknown regulatory network with time delay and uncertain noise disturbance, several adaptive laws are derived to ensure the stochastic stability of the error states between the unknown network and the estimated model. The novelty lies in the fact that the designed adaptive laws are independent of the unknown system states and parameters, requiring only the output and structure of the underlying network. A representative simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.	adaptive filter;broadcast delay;gene regulatory network;simulation	Wenwu Yu;Jinhu Lu;Guanrong Chen;Zhisheng Duan;Qianhe Zhou	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2008.2010972	adaptive filter;control engineering;stochastic process;simulation;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Vision	70.91195728980264	-2.0026492645583005	37426

After input-output linearization of the longitudinal model of FAHV, the dynamic inversion controller is formulated to track the reference commands based on state feedback. The AIT2-FLS is further developed to deal with the model uncertainties and input errors. Besides, the state estimator is applied to estimate the true values of the corrupted outputs. The stability characteristics of both the controller and the state estimator are analyzed. The whole control scheme is finally obtained through combining the controller and the state estimator based on the separation principle.

7c2f71036b0a814dbcd495494e1679d440e305fc	misep -- linear and nonlinear ica based on mutual information		Linear Independent Components Analysis (ICA) has become an important signal processing and data analysis technique, the typical application being bli nd source separation in a wide range of signals, such as biomedical, acoustical and astrophysical ones. Nonlinear ICA is less developed, but has the potential to become at least as powerful. This paper presents MISEP, an ICA technique for linear and no nli ear mixtures, which is based on the minimization of the mutual information of the es timated components. MISEP is a generalization of the popular INFOMAX technique, which is e xtended in two ways: (1) to deal with nonlinear mixtures, and (2) to be able to adapt to the actual s atistical distributions of the sources, by dynamically estimating the nonlinearities to be used at the outputs. The resulting MISEP method optimizes a network with a specialized architecture, with a single objective function: the output entropy. The paper also briefly discusses the issue of nonlinear sourc e separation.

Repetitive control (RC) is a simple and effective scheme to obtain good tracking of such reference trajectories. However, the highly resonant dynamics of the positioning stage combined with hysteresis and creep behavior in the piezoelectric actuator can degrade performance and even make creating a stable RC system difficult. In this paper, a damping proportional-integral (PI) controller is combined with a repetitive controller for robustness and high performance. Compared to a regular PI controller, the modified PI controller introduces damping, increases the bandwidth, and reduces the overall noise level due to feedback. Also, due to the integral action, the hysteresis and creep nonlinearities inherent in the piezoelectric actuator is minimized. A novel method for tuning the PI controller is proposed. The control approach is applied to a custom-design flexure-guided nanopositioning system with a dominant resonance of approximately 725 Hz. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall control scheme, and the maximum tracking error for scanning at 100 Hz and 400 Hz is measured at 0.27% and 2.7%, respectively, of the total positioning range.	experiment;field-programmability;hysteresis;instruction creep;noise (electronics);piezoelectricity;resonance;vii	Arnfinn Aas Eielsen;Jan Tommy Gravdahl;Kam K.

Then, to solve the chattering problem and the slow rate of convergence problem of the existing sliding mode control methods for the hybrid mechanism, a super-twisting algorithm based second-order nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control method is proposed. The stability of the proposed control method is proved by Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, compared with the reaching law based sliding mode control method and the super-twisting algorithm based second-order sliding mode control method, it is indicated from the simulation and experiment results that the proposed control method not only has high steady-state accuracy, better dynamic performance and strong robustness, but also reduces the chattering and improves the rate of convergence of the system.

The parametric uncertainties are assumed to be time varying but norm bounded. The purpose is to design a switched filter such that, for all admissible uncertainties, the resulting filtering error system is robustly stable and satisfies a prescribed l2–l∞ performance level. By introducing some extra matrices, a desired filter can be constructed by solving certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A couple of eigenvalue sets for some positive operator associated with the stochastic system under study are defined to characterize its stability in the mean square sense. Properties for these eigenvalue sets are established based on which we show that the spectral abscissa of these eigenvalues sets are the same and thus these eigenvalue sets are equivalent in the sense of characterizing the stability of the system. Also, it is shown that the guaranteed convergence rate of the Markovian jump Itô stochastic systems can be determined by some eigenvalue set. Finally, a linear matrix inequality based approach is proposed to design controllers such that the closed-loop system has guaranteed convergence rate. Some numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

For the sake of simplicity, a two-level system consisting of two subsystems interconnected by means of buffer storages is considered. In order to avoid measure theoretic difficulties, only a finite set of typical disturbance realizations are taken to represent the uncertainty in the system. The uncertainty leads to a co-ordination method based on a 'balance in the mean' condition. It turns out that the weakness of the mutual interaction between the subsystems is an important concept. In the case considered the buffer storages contribute to the weakness of the interaction to a noticeable degree.	dynamical system;interaction;online and offline;theory;uncertainty principle	Lauri Hakkala;Hans Blomberg	1976	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(76)90082-0	control engineering;mathematical optimization;dynamical system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	63.97395655450251	2.8001861286703	38033

Lagrangian function of freely swimming robotic fish is built based on a simplified geometric model. In order to build the kinematic model, the fluid force acting on the robotic fish is divided into three parts: the pressure on links, the approach stream pressure and the frictional force. By solving Lagrange's equation of the second kind and the fluid force, the movement of robotic fish is obtained. The robotic fish's motion, such as propelling and turning are simulated, and experiments are taken to verify the model.	british informatics olympiad;computer simulation;euler–lagrange equation;experiment;geometric modeling;mathematical optimization;motion controller;prototype;robot	Chao Zhou;Min Tan;Zhiqiang Cao;Shuo Wang;Douglas C.

This study describes the use of evolutionary robotics techniques to build neurocontrollers that maximize energy recoverable from wind by kite control systems in simulation. From initially randomized starting conditions, neurocontrollers rapidly develop under evolutionary pressure to fly the kite in figure eight trajectories that have previously been shown to be an optimal path for power generation. Advantages of this approach are discussed and data is presented which demonstrates the robustness of trajectory control to environmental perturbation.	artificial neural network;control system;evolutionary robotics;randomized algorithm;schedule (computer science);simulation	Allister Furey;Inman Harvey	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74913-4_75	wind power;electricity generation;simulation;computer science;control system;machine learning;evolutionary robotics	Robotics	58.05309003107785	-19.11195311293754	38148

Normally those can be assumed to remain nearly constant for everyday car trips, but looking at vehicles with very low curb weights, these parameters can change on a wide range due to different passenger or luggage loads. This effect is analyzed with several load scenarios. A Kalman filter based algorithm is presented that is able to determine all vehicle and tire parameters with standard sensors during random everyday trips and within short time. Therefore, an extended nonlinear vehicle model is defined that is able to represent vehicle behavior for everyday driving profiles very well. The estimator is validated using real-world steering and velocity profiles.	algorithm;chassis;control system;estimation theory;kalman filter;nonlinear system;observable;sensor;velocity (software development);yaws	Florian Kohlhuber;Stefan Buechner;Markus Lienkamp	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety	10.1109/ICVES.2014.7063730	control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	60.18194253550235	-14.92052848552273	38185

The key idea involves a new filter construction for the regressor terms within the governing dynamics that enables the establishment of a stabilizing mechanism within the adaptation process for unknown parameters. Viewed in the setting of filtered signals, the technical developments share some features inherent to the immersion and invariance (I&I) adaptive control methodology while maintaining certain crucial distinctions. In particular, the results stated here are not subject to satisfaction of any integrability or manifold attractivity conditions implicit within the powerful framework of I&I adaptive control. The paper presents numerical simulation of the new control scheme to highlight potential closed-loop performance improvements compared to the application of classical certainty-equivalence based adaptive controllers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To measure this ability, the standard ISO double lane change test was a designed by consumer unions. The detailed simulation of such an active safety issue would contribute to shorten the design cycle time of a vehicle by reducing the number of real world tests. In this paper we discuss the use of a trajectory deformation algorithm to determine a possible motion for a realistic dynamic car model going through such a test, and the way to determine the maximum passage speed. The main idea of this method is to iteratively deform the inputs of the system to progressively reduce the number of collisions while respecting the dynamic constraints. This deformation is calculated for each iteration by taking into account a locally linearized dynamic model of the system. Consequently, this algorithm can anticipate correctly the inputs needed to solve the future collisions	algorithm;iteration;mathematical model;motion planning;simulation	F.

Step that follows diagnosis is to quantify this stiction, in order to decide about maintenance or to implement compensators that can improve control loop performance until next plant stop. The describing function method is a well known scheme to predict the period and amplitude of limit cycles in control loops, requiring the knowledge of linear and nonlinear parameters of system model. Here, a method is proposed to estimate these nonlinear parameters using the parameters of linear model and amplitude and period of limit cycle produced by nonlinearity. The result is a simple and efficient algorithm that can be easily extended to other nonlinearities. The conditions for existence and uniqueness of solution for dead band and stiction estimations are obtained. Also, the error from estimations is related to total harmonic distortion of control signal. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application to two examples.	algorithm;control flow;control system;harmonic balance;limit cycle;linear model;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;total harmonic distortion;transfer function;utility	Alancardek P.

The dynamic model describing the motion of MAV's with respect to the Earth tied frame is nonlinear and the design of the new adaptive control system is based on the dynamic inversion technique. The inversion error is calculated with respect to the control law and two matrices (inertia and dynamic damping matrices) which express the deviation of the estimated matrices relative to the calculated ones (the matrices from the nonlinear dynamics of MAV's) in conditions of absolute stability in closed loop system by using the Lyapunov theory. To completely compensate this error, an adaptive component (output of a neural network) is added in the control law. The system also includes a second order reference model which provides the desired attitude vector and its derivative. The two variants of the new adaptive control system are validated by complex numerical simulations. & 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The partially decentralized structure of this approach permits each vehicle to independently compute its trajectory in real-time using only locally generated information and low-bandwidth feedback generated by a system exogenous to the platoon. Our work is motivated by applications for which communications bandwidth is severely limited, such for platoons of autonomous underwater vehicles. The communication requirements for our trajectory generation approach are independent of the number of vehicles in the platoon, enabling platoons composed of a large number of vehicles to be coordinated despite limited communication bandwidth.	autonomous robot;drug vehicle;license;motion planning;platoon (automobile);real-time clock;real-time locating system;requirement	Daniel J.

The system identification is based on recursive Kalman filter (RKF) estimation technique, and the control is according to a new constrained Hinfin optimal control strategy. A continuous-time model of the acoustic duct is found first, in state space form, using RKF technique. The new Hinfin optimal control with closed-loop pole assignment is then applied, which improves the performance of the robust controller and ensures the stability of the closed-loop system under the modeling errors and measurement noise. As a consequence, this methodology results in a noise reduction in a wide bandwidth that is desirable in the area of ANC. Actual hardware experiments using a DSP have been carried out in order to verify the applicability and the performance of the proposed method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;control theory;digital signal processor;experiment;kalman filter;noise reduction;optimal control;recursion;robust control;runge–kutta–fehlberg method;state space;system identification	Tansel Yucelen;Farzad Pourboghrat	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434469	kalman filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.18613401761874	-2.213902800745447	38493
5dfd1791afaec810ee15d1dacf488a706625c659	design of  $h_\infty$  output feedback controller for gas turbine engine distributed control with random packet dropouts		The distributed control architecture is expected to dominate the gas turbine engine (GTE) control systems in future, in which the sensors and actuators are connected to the controllers via a network. Hence, the control problem of network-enabled high-performance distributed engine control (DEC) becomes important in modern gas turbine control systems. Due to the properties of the network, the packet dropouts must be considered. This study introduces a distributed control system architecture based on a networked cascade control system (NCCS). Typical turboshaft engine-distributed controllers are designed based on the NCCS framework with a  $H_\infty $  output feedback under random packet-dropouts. The sufficient robust mean-stable conditions are derived via the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality approach. In addition, the effectiveness of the presented method is illustrated through a series of simulations.

By exploiting the special features of high-speed visual feedback and motion, a direct visual servoing scheme based on a simplified interaction matrix is proposed. The camera's internal parameters are not calibrated. Simplifying the interaction matrix allows decoupling of motions, which improves global convergence, as shown by simulations. By further simplifying the interaction matrix so as to make it depth-independent, estimation of depth information is not needed, making the approach suitable for high-speed setpoint control. Simulations were performed to compare the proposed approach with the conventional approach. As applications of the proposed approach, high-speed ball tracking and peg-and-hole alignment experiments were conducted. The results show that the simplified approach worked well for these kinds of manipulation. This paper mainly focuses on translational control; robot arm pose control is ignored because the rotation component of the interaction matrix is independent of the depth information.	computer simulation;coupling (computer programming);experiment;local convergence;robotic arm;servo;setpoint (control system);visual servoing	Shouren Huang;Yuji Yamakawa;Taku Senoo;Masatoshi Ishikawa	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2012.6491253	control engineering;computer vision;computer science;control theory;visual servoing	Robotics	67.2803572018353	-21.93776474765339	38497

Differing from the conventional Bernoulli random variable model, the random packet loss is modeled by an arbitrary stochastic sequence with bounded length requirement, which is a new model of realistic packet losses. A novel regulating approach based on truncations is introduced to make the proposed algorithm find the correct control direction adaptively, and then guarantee the almost sure convergence property. Therefore, this paper has threemajor innovations comparedwith reported studies, namely, the stochastic sequence model of packet loss, the novel control direction regulation method, and the almost sure convergence property of the proposed algorithm.

It combines the advantages of decentralized control solutions and the robustness of impedance control with force feedback. Distributed impedance was implemented on a dualarm system composed of two industrial manipulators. Experimental results were obtained for free and constrained manipulation tasks. 1. T h e d i s t r i b u t e d i m p e d a n c e a p p r o a c h Coordinated manipulation is a generic term used to designate the manipulation of a single body by multiple limbs. This is illustrated by two manipulators carrying an heavy, volumic and/or flexible object. Dextrous hands constitute an interesting sub-class of cooperative systems. They offer a high degree of flexibility compared to basic on-off grippers. They are particularly useful for manipulating fragile objects. An analysis of the control problem of coordinated manipulation systems shows that besides the control of the trajectory and forces experienced on the manipulated object, it is necessary to provide a control of the internal forces. Control of internal forces indeed is critical with respect to grasp stability in that it permits to avoid slippage or lost of the contact on the surface of the object. Most previous approaches for cooperative system control consist in global and centralized methods [1]. Object coordinates and internal efforts must be evaluated in line to be independently servoed. As a consequence, a specific hardware development is needed for data centralization. Conversely, local approaches consider each cooperative manipulator as an autonomous, independently controlled system. Practically, each manipulator's controller is used without any hardwaremodification in the multi-robot system. This provides flexibility and modularity. Furthermore, undesirable phenomenons (actuators limitation, non-colocated modes,...) that limit the performances from a particular manipulator, can be locally treated, without major influence on the whole system. A first possible approach consists in implementing pure joint control [2]. In this case, computation of the grasp and robot inverse kinematic models are required. This makes joint level approaches very sensitive to uncertainties in	autonomous robot;centralized computing;characteristic impedance;closed-loop transfer function;colocation centre;computation;consensus dynamics;distributed control system;haptic technology;interaction;inverse kinematics;nominal impedance;performance;puma (microarchitecture);scara;switch	Jérôme Szewczyk;Philippe Bidaud	1999		10.1007/BFb0119391	control engineering;simulation;decentralised system;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;haptic technology;robotics;cooperation	Robotics	66.53752561108192	-21.751935884649228	38514

Due to the increasing demands of industries, many issues are rising and remain unsolved such as in-hand manipulation, placing object with appropriate posture. Operations like twisting, altering orientation of object, in a hand, requires significant dexterity of the gripper that must be achieved from a compact mechanical design at the first place. In this paper, a newly designed gripper is proposed whose primary goal is to solve in-hand manipulation. The gripper is derived from four identical finger modules; each module has four DOFs, consists of a five bar linkage to grasp and additional two DOFs mechanism similar to ball spline is conceived to manipulate object. Hence the easily constructible gripper is capable to grasp and manipulate plurality of object. As a preliminary inspection, an optimized platform that represents the central concept of the proposed gripper is developed, to the aim of evaluating kinematic feasibilities of manipulation of different objects.	linkage (software);poor posture;reconfigurability;robot end effector;simulation	Nahian Rahman;Luca Carbonari;Mariapaola D'Imperio;Carlo Canali;Darwin G.

However, most physical-chemical catalyst models are not represented in a state-space. In this paper, we present an approach to transform simplified physical–chemical models into the state-space, and hereby, we introduce the concept of weighting functions. The weighting functions represent the catalyst model in a compact form and are a convenient way for system analysis. The weighting functions will be analyzed from the system theoretical and chemical point of view. The generalization of this approach will be demonstrated. Exemplarily, three reaction mechanisms will be transformed into nonlinear state-space models. Based on the first model, the nonlinear state-space model will be linearized and a linear quadratic controller will be designed. Contrarily to the LQ controllers in the literature, the weighting matrix for the state vector is chosen in the model-based form. The only few design parameters are intuitive to choose.	confidentiality;control engineering;letter-quality printer;model–view–controller;nonlinear system;state space;storage model;system analysis;test bench	Radoy Stanchev;Jan Rink;Ulrich Konigorski;G.

In the study, a new adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is developed for the investigated nonlinear systems, where the unknown nonlinearity is approximated via the adaptive fuzzy mechanism in the presence of signal quantization. The proposed control law can compensate the time-varying faults and the quantization errors completely by injecting the quantizer parameter into the controller gain. Moreover, in this design, the adaptive fuzzy law is constructed via the quantized state information instead of using the exact original information. Under the proposed quantized SMC scheme, the closed-loop control systems are guaranteed to be asymptotically stable, and the reachability of the sliding surface can be ensured strictly. Finally, two examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the method.	approximation algorithm;control system;control theory;nonlinear system;optimal control;quantization (signal processing);reachability;robust control;telecommunications network	Liheng Chen;Xianlin Huang;Shasha Fu;Jianbin Qiu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2718968	control theory;mathematics;fuzzy logic;sliding mode control;robust control;adaptive control;quantization (signal processing);control theory;variable structure control;control system	Robotics	65.64514441500546	-4.998221485467714	38630

The faults only related to the system states are considered, these typical faults are very common in physical systems. The basis idea is that when the desired trajectory is periodic, then the fault function can be expended to parameterized known basis functions by Fourier series, and thus an adaptive learning scheme based on the known basis functions for accommodating failures can be constructed. A fault detection scheme based on the nominal model is designed via the dynamic of the tracking errors. The robustness and sensitivity of the proposed fault detection scheme with respect to modeling uncertainties are analyzed. The stability of the proposed accommodation controller is also proved and the tracking performance is saved.	basis function;fault detection and isolation;nonlinear system	Jianyong Yao;Zongxia Jiao;Bin Yao;Wenbin Dong	2012	IEEE 10th International Conference on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/INDIN.2012.6300644	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;stuck-at fault;control theory;fault model	Robotics	64.91782271932863	-6.026224277110861	38651

The issue of position control for flexible link manipulators has gained a lot of attention. Using the vibration signal originating from the motion of the flexible-link robot is one of the important methods used in controlling the tip position of the single-link arms. Compared with the common methods for controlling the base of the flexible arm, vibration feedback can improve the use of the flexible-link robot systems. In this paper a modified PID control (MPID) is proposed which depends only on vibration feedback to improve the response of the flexible arm without the massive need for measurements. The arm moves horizontally by a DC motor on its base while a tip payload is attached to the other end. A simulation for the system with both PD controller and the proposed MPID controller is performed. An experimental validation for the control of the single-link flexible arm is shown. The robustness of the proposed controller is examined by changing the loading condition at the tip of the flexible arm. The response results for the single-link flexible arm are presented with both the PI and MPID controller used. A study of the stability of the proposed MPID is carried out.  Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2008	coat of arms;feedback;lyapunov fractal;nv network;pid;robot;robotics;simulation;zero suppression	Tamer Mansour;Atsushi Konno;Masaru Uchiyama	2008	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855308X294671	pid controller;control engineering;simulation;engineering;dc motor;control theory	Robotics	71.36385833866849	-17.886414824307295	38656

Currently accessibility for nonlinear time delay systems is defined as the absence of autonomous functions on the extended state space. Such a property is expressed in terms of the Accessibility matrix rank, extending to the nonlinear context the well known Kalman Criterion. A weaker notion is introduced in this paper which is motivated by the fact that even if autonomous functions exist for the given system, it may be still possible to move from a fixed point to an arbitrary one in some open subset of $I\!\!R^{n}$.

For a specific real physical plant (i.e., the brushless DC motor), the main drawback of some existing chaos control methods is first analyzed. Then, a piecewise quadratic state feedback method is proposed for controlling chaos in the brushless DC motor model. In the proposed method, the direct-axis (or quadrature-axis stator voltage) is used as the control variable, and the piecewise quadratic state feedback is used as the control law. The control mechanism is illustrated and then the principle of parameters selection is discussed. Chaos in the brushless DC motor model can be satisfactorily eliminated by the proposed piecewise quadratic state feedback, and the speed of the motor can be stabilized to a constant value. This control method is simple and can be easily implemented.

The proposed control scheme comprises a special fuzzy sliding-mode controller and an adaptive tuner. The former is a main controller, which is designed without reaching phase to retain the merits of a total sliding-mode control approach. Furthermore, a translation width is embedded into the fuzzy inference engine to remedy the chattering phenomena. The adaptive tuner is utilized to adjust the translation width on-line for further assuring robust and optimal performance. To verify the effectiveness, the proposed control scheme is applied to control the tension of a winding process. The computer-controlled winding system includes an electrical servo driven windup reel, a geared speed reducer and a set of pinch rolls.

b02bc42bb83c790023449a04060e9e0c0969e55a	an online controller redesign based fault-tolerant strategy for thermal comfort in a multi-zone building		Variable air volume (VAV) boxes are used in multi-zone buildings, which varies the volume of constant temperature air separately supplied by an air-handling unit to meet challenging thermal load demands of individual zones. A fault appearing in the VAV damper severely affects the control performance and consequently, the energy efficiency of the overall system. To address this issue, we present a novel online redesign based fault-tolerant control strategy in this paper for a VAV thermal system in a multi-zone building. The novelty of the proposed strategy is that no a priori information about the process is used in real-time. In fact, no online identification of the thermal dynamical model of the building process or estimation of its operating status (healthy or faulty) is done. The design of the fault accommodation scheme is solely based on the real-time trajectories generated by the process. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy, we consider a case-study of three-zones in a one-story building.	control theory;fault tolerance;real life;real-time clock;real-time computing;simbad;systems theory	Joseph-Julien Yamé;Tushar Jain;Dominique Sauter	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2015.7320887	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	54.68041689079691	-10.957853939704712	38862

A stable adaptive control scheme for both trajectory tracking and internal force control is presented. Detailed analyses on tracking properties of the object position and velocity and the internal forces exerted on the object are given. It is shown that this control scheme achieves satisfactory tracking performance without using the measurement of contact forces and their derivatives. It can be shown that this scheme can be realized by decentralized implementation to reduce the computational burden. Moreover, some efficient adaptive control strategies can be incorporated to reduce the computational complexity. >		Jong-Hann Jean;Li-Chen Fu	1993	IEEE Trans.

Then the nonlinear equation of system is linearised. A feedforward control law and proper Lyapunov function are defined for design controller. Lastly, the performance and properties of the proposed controller such as desired position tracking, rejection of external disturbance, for example wind, and parameter variations of the system are studied in detail.	feed forward (control);parallel manipulator	Arash Kiani;Kamaleddin Mousavi Mashhadi	2016	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2016.076828	control engineering;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;extended kalman filter;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	67.69688988110035	-14.821862789813654	39031

The design objective is to find a reduced-order observer-based controller such that the peak of the tracking error in time domain must be as small as possible under persistent bounded disturbances. Since the nonlinear L/sub /spl infin//-gain optimal tracking control for robotic systems can not be solved directly, the nonlinear L/sub /spl infin//-gain optimal tracking problem is transformed into a nonlinear L/sub /spl infin//-gain tracking problem by giving a desired (prescribed) disturbance attenuation level for the L/sub /spl infin//-gain tracking performance. The proposed robust L/sub /spl infin//-gain controller is based on a reduced-order observer, which is constructed to estimate the velocity signal only and whose dimension is half of the dimension of robotic systems, and is suitable for practical control design of robotic systems.	block cipher mode of operation;control theory;feedback;nonlinear system;robot;velocity (software development)	Chung-Shi Tseng	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571451	robust control;robot;real-time computing;time domain;computer science;control theory;feedback;tracking	Robotics	67.399562807822	-6.54455971458838	39057

These schemes involve a recursive estimator while the regression models are formulated in continuous time. The fact that the total energy of robot manipulators can be represented as a linear relation in the inertial parameters, has motivated the suggestion in the literature of several regression models which are linear in a common dynamic parameter vector. Among them, in this paper we consider the schemes based on the filtered dynamic regression model, the supplied energy regression model and a new one proposed in this paper: the filtered power regression model. The underling recursive parameter estimator used in the experimental evaluation is the standard least-squares.	robot	Fernando Reyes Cortes;Rafael Kelly	1997	Robotica		proper linear model;simulation;system identification;computer science;artificial intelligence;robotics;least squares;regression analysis	Robotics	64.1453247934596	-12.507968843844722	39086

An illustrative example is included to demonstrate performance improvement over the Kalman filter which does not include sensor failures in its measurement model.	sensor	Franck O.

The choice of type of feet such as a contact points, flat feet and circular arc feet is important, because walking stability is essentially affected by the contact with the ground. Control methods of many traditional humanoids with flat foot are based on zero moment point (ZMP) that remains inside the convex hull of the foot support using the ankle torque. There are lots of successful results, but the gaits seem not to be so natural. On the other hand, for a biped with point contact a geometric tracking method for biped walking using input-output linearization (Aoustin & Formalsky, 1999; Grizzle et al., 2001; Aoustin& Formalsky, 2003; Chevallereau et al., 2003) produces stable gait that seems quite natural. (The idea of the geometric tracking can be seen in the previous studies of Furusho (Furusho et al., 1981) and Kajita (Kajita & Tani, 1991).) Grizzle, et al. (Grizzle et al., 2001) proposed the method for a three-link model, only two outputs are controlled, the reference are expressed as a function of the biped state. Zero dynamics with an impact event of the controlled system were analyzed by Poincaré method. The effectiveness of geometric tracking has been verified on a platform called ’Rabbit’ (Chevallereau et al., 2003) (Fig.1 left) with point feet. Westervelt, et al. (Westervelt et al., 2005) gave some additional results to show capability for robustness, changing average walking rate, and rejecting a perturbation by ’one-step transition control’ and ’event-based control’. In the field of passive dynamic walking mechanisms (McGeer, 1990), it is shown that a biped with large radius circular arc feet can take easily a lot of steps. The prototype Emu (Fig.1 right) can be equipped with various arc feet with different radii (Kinugasa et al., 2003; 2007). In previous walking experiments the biped Emu is excited by gravity or forced oscillation of the length of legs. If the feet radius is 10% of leg length, the biped could only take few steps (Kinugasa et al., 2003) excited by the effect of gravity because of the sensitivity to disturbances produced by the cables, the guide to avoid lateral motion and so on. The biped could not walk by the forced oscillation. In the case of a radius which is 97% of leg length, the biped 4	amiga walker;angularjs;bin he;convex hull;experiment;fractal dimension;lateral thinking;mathematical model;optimal control;planar (computer graphics);prototype;rate of convergence;simulation;smoothing;synthetic intelligence;underactuation;velocity (software development);vii;xfig;zero moment point	T.

On the other hand, inverse dynamics (ID) based approaches have gained increasing acceptance by providing compliant motions and robustness to external perturbations. However, the performance of such methods is heavily dependent on high quality dynamic models, which are often very difficult to produce for a physical robot. IK approaches only require kinematic models, which are much easier to generate in practice. In this paper, we supplement our previous work with ID-based controllers by adding IK, which helps compensate for modeling errors. The proposed full body controller is applied to three tasks in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Trials in Dec. 2013.	darpa robotics challenge;display resolution;high-level programming language;hill climbing;humanoid robot;inverse dynamics;inverse kinematics;obedience (human behavior);perturbation theory;real life;smart-m3;tree traversal	Siyuan Feng;Eric C.

With the help of control Lyapunov function (CLF), a constructive parameterization of controls that globally asymptotically stabilize the system is proposed. Two different cases are considered. Firstly, under certain regularity assumptions, the feasible control set is parameterized, and continuous feedback stabilizing controls are designed. Then for the general case, piecewise continuous stabilizing controls are proposed. The design procedure can also be used to verify whether a candidate CLF is indeed a CLF. Several illustrative examples are presented as well. c © 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd	common look and feel;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Jianghua Zhong;Daizhan Cheng;Xiaoming Hu	2008	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2008.01.005	parametrization;control engineering;nonlinear system;information science;lyapunov function;calculus;control theory;mathematics	SE	71.86392759820849	-3.627395899979396	39263

Amphibious legs equip the robot with a capability to explore diverse locations in the world encompassing both those that are on the ground as well as underwater. In this paper we work with a hexapod robot of the Aqua vehicle family (based on a body plan first developed by Buehler et al. [1]), which is an amphibious robot that employs legs for amphibious locomotion. Many different leg designs have been previously developed for Aqua-class vehicles, including both robust all-terrain legs for walking, and efficient flippers for swimming. But the walking legs have extremely poor thrust for swimming and the flippers are completely unsuitable for terrestrial operations. In this work we propose a single leg design with the advantages of both the walking legs and the swimming flippers. We design a cage-like circular enclosure for the flippers in order to protect the flippers during terrestrial operations. The enclosing structure also plays the role of the walking legs for terrestrial locomotion. The circular shape of the enclosure, as well, has the advantages of an offset wheel. We evaluate the performance of our design for terrestrial mobility by comparing the power efficiency and the physical speed of the robot equipped with the newly designed legs against that with the walking legs which are semi-circular in shape. The swimming performance is examined by measuring the thrust generated by newly designed legs and comparing the same with the thrust generated by the swimming flippers. In the field, we also verified that these legs are suitable for swimming through moderate surf, walking through the breakers on a beach (and thus through slurry), and onto wet and dry sand.	aqua;mathematical optimization;multi-purpose viewer;performance per watt;robot combat;robot locomotion;semiconductor industry;speeded up robust features;terrestrial television;thrust;turbulence;underwater robotics	Bir Bikram Dey;Sandeep Manjanna;Gregory Dudek	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6697171	simulation;engineering;marine engineering	Robotics	74.37272520167605	-22.9666033125216	39288

The cooperative manipulation problem is analyzed from a systems perspective, and the desirable features of a control system for cooperative manipulation are discussed. A control policy is developed that enforces a controlled impedance not of the individual arm endpoints, but of the manipulated object itself. A parallel implementation for a multiprocessor system is presented. The controller fully compensates for the system dynamics and directly controls the object internal forces. Most importantly, it presents a simple, powerful, intuitive interface to higher level strategic control modules. Experimental results from a dual two-link-arm robotic system show the effectiveness of the object impedance controller compared to other strategies, both for free-motion slews and environmental contact. >	characteristic impedance	Stanley A.

Given a nonlinear dynamical system and an MTL specification for that system, our goal is to find a trajectory that violates or satisfies the specification. This trajectory can be used as a concrete feedback to the system designer in the case of violation or as a trajectory to be tracked in the case of satisfaction. The search for such a trajectory is conducted over the space of initial conditions, system parameters and input signals. We convert the trajectory search problem into an optimization problem through MTL robust semantics. Robustness quantifies how close the trajectory is to violating or satisfying a specification. Starting from some arbitrary initial condition and parameter and given an input signal, we compute a descent direction in the search space, which leads to a trajectory that optimizes the MTL robustness. This process can be iterated to reach local optima (min or max). We demonstrate the method on examples from the literature.	computation;descent direction;dynamical system;feedback;gradient descent;hybrid system;initial condition;iteration;local optimum;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;model-based definition;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem;requirement;search problem;simulink;stochastic optimization;systems design;temporal logic	Houssam Abbas;Andrew K.

The control performance is specified in terms of control output responses such as steady state error, maximum overshoot, settling time, and rise time; and the end-to-end timing constraints include loop processing periods and input-to-output latency. Our approach includes a generic real-time controller model on which our analysis is performed, and a heuristic optimization algorithm which derives end-to-end timing constraints. We apply the approach to the design of an embedded real-time controller, and validate it through an experimental study using simulation. Our approach contributes to both the control and realtime areas: (1) it allows control engineers to take into consideration the effect of scheduling latency and sampling periods at the early stage of system design; and (2) it makes it possible to streamline the design of real-time control systems, since temporal requirements are derived in an automatic manner. Our approach can be effectively used with the period calibration method [2, 8, 4] as its front-end.	adobe streamline;algorithm;embedded system;end-to-end principle;experiment;heuristic;mathematical optimization;newton's method;overshoot (signal);real-time control system;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;rise time;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);settling time;simulation;steady state;systems design;theory	Minsoo Ryu;Seongsoo Hong;Manas Saksena	1997		10.1109/RTTAS.1997.601347	real-time computing;real-time control system;computer science;control system;automatic control	Embedded	60.66009281330701	-4.181123889152609	39575
567fbe68f8fa00b87ee8411d3d56cb958e7192f9	performance enhancement of pressure-swing distillation process by the combined use of vapor recompression and thermal integration		Abstract The intensified pressure-swing distillation (PSD) process is explored by applying vapor recompression and thermal integration. The evaluation indicators of second-law efficiency and CO 2 emissions are adopted to rank different pressure swing-top vapor recompressed (PSDVRC) configurations. Compared to the conventional PSD process, the economically optimum flowsheet is the thermal integrated PSDVRC process with overhead vapor splitting since it can reduce 67.05% in energy consumption, 72.66% in CO 2 emissions and 34.14% in total annual cost (TAC) as well as enhance 159.06% in thermodynamic efficiency. Besides, PSDVRC processes with overhead vapor splitting (PSDVRC-VS) are also superior to other PSDVRC configurations where economic-efficient process is PSD process (PSDSVRC) with single vapor recompression. Dynamic controllability for the highly integrated and interacting economic-efficient process is also investigated. An effective control structure is developed that only handles small (5%) disturbances in throughput and feed composition. The modified process is further developed to achieve robust control performance in terms of peak dynamic transients, settling time, oscillation and steady-state offsets. Meanwhile, control performance comparisons for PSDVRC-VS and PSDSVRC processes are also studied and showed that there is conflict between the steady-state economics and dynamic controllability.	metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy	Qingjun Zhang;Meiling Liu;Aiwu Zeng	2019	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.09.014	throughput;control engineering;robust control;controllability;distillation;settling time;energy consumption;oscillation;mathematics;thermal efficiency	SE	56.1233259961613	-6.063802059723091	39594

The arm is controlled to track a desired end-effector trajectory and at the same time to change the attitude of the system in a desired manner and without activating jet thrusters and/or reaction wheels. The formulation is based on the fixed-attitude restricted (FAR) Jacobian matrix which was introduced for path planning and control at the velocity level. A reformulation in terms of accelerations allows the author to address the issue of end-effector velocity step-change response, caused, for example, by a collision between the end-effector and the target. It is shown that when the FAR Jacobian is applied, the joint acceleration is mainly derived from the null space of the manipulator-link inertia matrix, and hence there is very little disturbance of the spacecraft attitude. As a consequence, there is a loose dependence on spacecraft mass and inertia.	robot	Dragomir N.

The strategy involves manipulating the object at high speed. By moving the robot at high speed, we can assume that the dynamic behavior of the linear flexible object can be obtained by performing algebraic calculations of the robot motion. Based on this assumption, we derive a model of the linear flexible object and confirm the validity of the proposed model. Finally, we perform simulation of dynamic knotting based on the proposed model. Results of an experiment demonstrating dynamic knotting with a high-speed robot arm are shown.	mathematical model;motion planning;robot;robotic arm;simulation	Yuji Yamakawa;Akio Namiki;Masatoshi Ishikawa	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5651168	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;arm solution;control theory;motion planning	Robotics	67.86422657550557	-21.48817951667316	39677

Under the framework of multi-instant homogenous matrix polynomials, a novel fuzzy observer and a new Lyapunov function, which are homogenous polynomially parameter-dependent on both the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions and the m-steps past-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions, are proposed for conceiving less conservative observer design conditions. Since the algebraic properties of both the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions and the m-steps past-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions are fully considered, the relaxation quality of the fuzzy observer design of discrete-time T-S fuzzy systems is significantly improved. In particular, some existing fuzzy Lyapunov functions and fuzzy observers are special cases of the Lyapunov function and the fuzzy observer given in this paper, respectively. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	fuzzy control system;linear algebra;linear programming relaxation;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial	Xiangpeng Xie;Dong-Sheng Yang;Hongjun Ma	2014	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2302491	mathematical optimization;membership function;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;fuzzy measure theory;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Robotics	67.32771450995823	-1.0821462320286523	39690

This problem is challenging as the shape of tree is complex and irregular. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper dealing with the path planning problem on natural tree environment. Different from conventional motion planning approach that requires constructing a complex configuration space, this paper divides the planning problem into two parts, i.e., path and motion planning problem so as to reduce the dimension of the problem. An intuitive method to represent a climbing space is proposed that highly simplifies the path planning problem. With the use of a dynamic programming algorithm, an optimal path to reach a target position can be acquired in linear time. In addition, an efficient motion planning algorithm for a tree climbing robot named TreeBot is developed to make TreeBot follow the planned path.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;computation;dynamic programming;hill climbing;motion planning;robot;time complexity;uniform resource identifier	Tin Lun Lam;Guoqing Xu;Huihuan Qian;Yangsheng Xu	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5650347	computer vision;mathematical optimization;simulation;any-angle path planning;computer science;artificial intelligence;dynamic programming;mathematics;motion planning;shortest path problem	Robotics	54.73749052244635	-23.1676372212264	39812

In combination with a new type of terminal sliding-mode control strategy, finite-time convergence of TASC is realized. First, the specific mathematical expression of the system terminal sliding-mode surface is given. On the basis of this, according to the sliding-mode surface expression, the sliding-mode variable structure control laws of  $n$  regular nonlinear systems are derived, avoiding the singularity problem that can easily appear in ordinary terminal sliding-mode controllers. Meanwhile, the initial system is located on the sliding-mode surface. The approach process in sliding-mode control is eliminated, and the existence of the sliding phase is proved according to the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by a numerical example.	algorithm;control theory;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;technological singularity	Changfan Zhang;Zhenzhen Lin;Simon X.

29373c7d6dfdf76c9e8e88e73bf1bbb9baae7513	a reduced-complexity description of arm endpoint stiffness with applications to teleimpedance control	ellipsoids;kinematics;force;robots;jacobian matrices;muscles;real time systems	Effective and stable execution of a remote manipulation task in an uncertain environment requires that the task force and position trajectories of the slave robot be appropriately commanded. To achieve this goal, in teleimpedance control, a reference command which consists of the stiffness and position profiles of the master is computed and realized by the compliant slave robot in real-time. This highlights the need for a suitable and computationally efficient tracking of the human limb stiffness profile in real-time. In this direction, based on the observations in human neuromotor control which give evidence on the predominant use of the arm configuration in directional adjustments of the endpoint stiffness profile, and the role of muscular co-activations which contribute to a coordinated regulation of the task stiffness in all directions, we propose a novel and computationally efficient model of the arm endpoint stiffness behaviour. Real-time tracking of the human arm kinematics is achieved using an arm triangle monitored by three markers placed at the shoulder, elbow and wrist level. In addition, a co-contraction index is defined using muscular activities of a dominant antagonistic muscle pair. Calibration and identification of the model parameters are carried out experimentally, using perturbation-based arm endpoint stiffness measurements in different arm configurations and co-contraction levels of the chosen muscles. Results of this study suggest that the proposed model enables the master to naturally execute a remote task by modulating the direction of the major axes of the endpoint stiffness and its volume using arm configuration and the co-activation of the involved muscles, respectively.	arm architecture;algorithmic efficiency;communication endpoint;experiment;norm (social);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;remote manipulator;robot;stiffness matrix;workspace	Arash Ajoudani;Cheng Fang;Nikolaos G.

The path planner is implemented as architecture of island parallel genetic algorithm (IPGA) running a variable-length genetic algorithm in each island. The techniques of spatial fitness-sharing in search space and a crowded measure of generated paths are integrated in the planner to implement a high-diversity evolutionary optimizer of paths that could self-adjust the spacing and number of intermediate configurations. The experimental result demonstrates the robustness and self-adjusting capability of evolutionary path planner in discovering shorter and smoother composite η3-splines paths in complex environments.	converge;genetic algorithm;gradient descent;iterative method;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mobile robot;motion planning;rendering (computer graphics);spline (mathematics);xfig	Jiun-Hau Wei;Jing-Sin Liu	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354829	mobile robot;parallel processing;mathematical optimization;simulation;genetic algorithm;fast path;any-angle path planning;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	Robotics	58.479113363858794	-20.08810332694452	40097

This paper presents the modeling, control and simulation of a robotic reconfigurable manipulator. The manipulator benefits from passive cylindrical joint design for its links which allows it to change the link parameters. The robot enters the reconfiguration phase in two steps; first, it forms a closed kinematic chain or in other words docks its end-effector to a fixed point in order to increase the constrained DOFs. Second, it releases the built-in locks of its cylindrical joints to enable the reconfiguration of the links. Then, the reconfiguration process is performed by using the proper control method. After achieving the desired configuration, the cylindrical joints are locked again, the end-effector is released and robot enters the operation mode. This paper only focuses on the reconfiguration process of a 6-DOF manipulator with two lockable passive cylindrical joints.	simulation	Pooya Merat;Farhad Aghili;Chun-Yi Su	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40849-6_11	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;mobile manipulator;control theory;system dynamics	Robotics	69.38811787618317	-21.90084438001522	40125

The upside of such an explicit MPC solution stems from the fact that optimal control input can be obtained on-line by a mere function evaluation. This task can be accomplished quickly even on cheap hardware. To account for random disturbances, our formulation assumes probabilistic version of thermal comfort constraints. We illustrate how a finite-sampling approach can be used to convert probabilistic bounds into deterministic constraints. To reduce complexity, and to allow for synthesis of explicit feedbacks in reasonable time, we furthermore propose to prune the set of samples depending on activity of constraints. Performance of the stochastic explicit MPC controller is then compared against best-case and worst-case scenarios.	best, worst and average case;online and offline;optimal control;sampling (signal processing)	Jan Drgona;Michal Kvasnica;Martin Klauco;Miroslav Fikar	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760908	control engineering;sampling;mathematical optimization;optimal control;stochastic optimization;temperature control;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	Robotics	59.676071493656366	0.18792302588606108	40204

The base and moving platform of the parallel robot are connected by three cables and a flexible link. The flexible link serves as cervical spine to support and facilitate the motion of moving platform. The three cables serve as the muscles around human neck to drive the robot. Due to both ends of the flexible link are fixed with the base and moving platform, the kinematics of the parallel robot cannot be solved directly. By assuming the bending shape of the flexible link to be circular, the kinematics can be solved geometrically.

However, this characteristic cannot be accurately modeled without high-order equations or complicated measurement of motor parameters. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to model the behavior of a commercial 1.8deg hybrid stepper motor accurately and efficiently. Also, model-based damping algorithms for both open-loop control and servo control are proposed. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively eliminate low-speed resonance and vibration of the stepper system. The algorithms are efficient enough to be implemented on commercial DSP-based controllers without sacrificing motion control performance.	algorithm;digital signal processor;resonance;servo;simulation	Kenneth Wang-Hay Tsui;Norbert C.

To solve the problem of longitudinal attitude control of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase, a new intelligent controller is proposed in this paper. This new controller is based on the fuzzy dynamic characteristic modeling method. The fuzzy logic is introduced into the characteristic modeling by dividing the whole restriction range into several subspaces. Simulations show that this modification greatly improves the performance of the original method. With the same whole restriction range the fuzzy dynamic characteristic modeling decreases the time of convergence, and at the same time makes the attitude angle tracing more precise and robust. Since the sub-model is a characteristic model that has stronger adaptiveness than a fixed local model, the number of fuzzy rules is greatly reduced. Our model sharply reduces the complexity in constructing a fuzzy dynamic model. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with the attitude control problem of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase.	adaptive algorithm;approximation;autonomous robot;coefficient;computer simulation;control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;game controller;intelligent control;mathematical model	Xiong Luo;Jiang Li	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4193-z	fuzzy logic;simulation;defuzzification;computer science;control theory;attitude control	Robotics	64.6323430345966	-11.29359491319922	40265

Recently, stability analysis of the polynomial fuzzy-control systems, which is a generalized form of the well-known Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) FMB control systems, has been reported in the form of SOS-based stability conditions. Lack of information on the relations between membership functions and premise variables, in the existing stability analysis approaches, causes conservatism of their results. In this paper, to derive relaxed stability conditions for polynomial FMB control systems, membership functions which are approximated with polynomials and carrying relations between membership functions and premise variables are brought into the stability analysis. Considering a polynomial FMB control system and based on the Lyapunov stability theory, stability conditions in the form of fuzzy summations are derived, where each term contains product of membership functions of the polynomial fuzzy model and polynomial fuzzy controller. Each product term is approximated by a polynomial. In order to obtain better approximation, the operating domain of membership functions is partitioned to subregions. Then, SOS-based stability conditions for all subregions are derived. Unlike some published stability-analysis approaches, the proposed one can be employed for stability analysis of polynomial fuzzy-control systems under imperfect premise matching of which the fuzzy model and fuzzy controller do not share the same membership functions. The solution of the SOS-based stability conditions can be found numerically using SOSTOOLS, which is a free third-party MATLAB Toolbox. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability conditions.	approximation algorithm;control system;linear programming relaxation;lyapunov fractal;matlab;membership function (mathematics);numerical analysis;polynomial;race condition;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Mohammad Narimani;Hak Keung Lam	2010	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050890	kharitonov's theorem;von neumann stability analysis;discrete mathematics;stability;membership function;homogeneous polynomial;control system;artificial intelligence;stable polynomial;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;explained sum of squares;square-free polynomial;numerical stability;statistics;polynomial	Embedded	64.58761976920921	-3.906753952744745	40352

If the robots have to respect second-order dynamics, this becomes a challenging problem, even for static environments. This work presents a replanning framework where each robot computes partial plans during each cycle, while executing a previously computed trajectory. Each robot communicates with its neighbors to select a trajectory that is safe over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach does not require synchronization and allows the robots to dynamically change their cycles over time. This paper proves that the proposed motion coordination algorithm guarantees safety under this general setting. This framework is not specific to the underlying robot dynamics, as it can be used with a variety of dynamical systems, nor to the planning or control algorithm used to generate the robot trajectories. The performance of the approach is evaluated using a distributed multi-robot simulator on a computing cluster, where the simulated robots are forced to communicate by exchanging messages. The simulation results confirm the safety of the algorithm in various environments with up to 32 robots governed by second-order dynamics.	algorithm;computer cluster;dynamical system;robot;scalability;simulation	Kostas E.

The local bifurcations of the low-period solutions are numerically detected by means of a continuation method, and the different modes of behavior are classified as well as the transitions among them. As predicted by the theory, the control system is robust in the sense that all trajectories are bounded regardless to the action of the disturbance. However, the periodicity of the input can give rise to chaotic behavior. The result of the analysis will aid the designer in selecting the controller parameters in order to achieve an acceptable behavior.	bifurcation theory;chaos theory;control system;first-order predicate;numerical analysis;numerical continuation;prototype;quasiperiodicity	Yuri A.

b697e5e6b9787d6be1e6d586327bbab4e3781951	a human mimicking control strategy for robotic deburring of hard materials		ABSTRACTThis paper deals with the use of an industrial robot (IR) for the deburring of hard material items (i.e. cast iron items). The control strategies introduced in this paper aim to mimic the human behaviour during the manual deburring. On the basis of force feedback, provided from a 1-axis load cell, the nominal deburring trajectory is optimised and deformed making multiple repetitions. The deburring trajectory is repeated until completing the nominal deburring path. The removal of thin layers of materials allows the robot to operate at high feed rates avoiding spindle stall and without exciting elastics effects on the mechanical structure of the system. Furthermore, a method to automatically detect the force changepoints, related to the presence of a burr, without tuning force thresholds, is discussed. The human mimicking control strategy is compared with a standard industrial approach demonstrating a reduction of the task cycle time and an improvement of the finishing quality.	control theory;robot	Enrico Villagrossi;Nicola Pedrocchi;Manuel Beschi;Lorenzo Molinari Tosatti	2018	Int.

The dynamical network is complex with respect to the uncertainties, non-identical nodes and coupling time-delays. The goal signal can be a measurable vector function or a solution of a dynamical system. By utilizing Lyapunov function and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional methods, robust global exponential stability (RGES) criteria are derived for the error system, under which global exponential consensus is achieved for the complex dynamical networks. These criteria are expressed in terms of LMIs and algebraic inequalities. Thus, the impulsive controller can be easily designed by solving the derived inequalities. Meanwhile, the estimations of the consensus speed rate for global exponential consensus is also obtained. One example with numerical simulations is worked out for illustration.	computer simulation;content delivery network;dynamical system;linear algebra;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;time complexity	Bing Liu;David J.

The proposed method resolves redundancy at the acceleration level. The command acceleration is composed of two terms: the minimum-norm acceleration and the null-space acceleration, which is intermittently added to the minimum-norm acceleration according to a kinematic criterion to globally reduce excessively large torque requirements. In particular, both the generation and the control of null-space acceleration is based on the property of full row-rank minors of a Jacobian matrix, i.e., the aspect, which is a function of a manipulator's configuration. Numerical simulations illustrated good capability from the viewpoint of torque optimization and global stability.	jacobian matrix and determinant	Won Jee Chung;Wan Kyun Chung;Youngil Youm	1993		10.1109/IROS.1993.583298	computer simulation;jacobian matrix and determinant;control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.11816474867796	-20.164138100402525	40515

Firstly, a complete model containing a missile seeker servo system, missile guidance system, and missile control system (SGCS) was creatively proposed. Secondly, a designed high-order tracking differentiator (HTD) was used to estimate states of systems in real time, which guarantees the feasibility of the designed algorithm. To guarantee tracking precision and robustness, backstepping sliding-mode control was adopted. Aiming at the main problem of projectile motion disturbance, an adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was proposed to compensate for disturbance. Adaptive RBFNN especially achieves online adjustment of residual error, which promotes estimation precision and eliminates the """"chattering phenomenon"""". The boundedness of all signals, including estimation error of high-order tracking differentiator, was especially proved via the Lyapunov stability theory, which is more rigorous. Finally, in considered scenarios, line of sight angle (LOSA)-tracking simulations were carried out to verify the tracking performance, and a Monte Carlo miss-distance simulation is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."""	algorithm;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;control system;differentiator;entity name part qualifier - adopted;guidance system;lyapunov fractal;missile guidance;monte carlo method;radar;radial (radio);radial basis function;servo device component;simulation;track and trace	Yu-Hsing Lin;Humin Lei;Jikun Ye;Xiangwei Bu	2018		10.3390/s18092927	electronic engineering;line-of-sight;differentiator;backstepping;engineering;guidance system;sliding mode control;missile guidance;control theory;missile;servomechanism	Robotics	65.6920500462773	-11.902672331548652	40651

Using a hybrid dynamic model of the assembly task, velocity constraints are derived from which satisfactory velocity commands are obtained. Due to modeling errors and parametric uncertainties, the velocity commands may be erroneous and may result in suboptimal performance. Tasklevel adaptive control schemes, based on the occurrence of discrete events, are used to change the model parameters from which the velocity commands are determined. Two adaptive schemes are presented: the first is based on intuitive reasoning about the vector spaces involved whereas the second uses a search region that is reduced with each iteration. For the first adaptation law, asymptotic convergence to the correct model parameters is proven except for one case. This weakness motivated the development of the second adaptation law, for which asymptotic convergence is proven in all cases. Automated control of a peg-in-hole assembly task is given as an example, and simulations and experiments for this task are presented. These results demonstrate the success of the method and also indicate properties for rapid convergence.

179a55b154675b9ddb17762ca21f0b521b4f1328	adaptive backstepping control, synchronization and circuit simulation of a novel jerk chaotic system with a quartic nonlinearity		This work describes a six-term novel 3-D jerk chaotic system with a quartic nonlinearity. The phase portraits of the novel jerk chaotic system are displayed and the qualitative properties of the novel jerk system are discussed. The novel jerk chaotic system has exactly one equilibrium point, which is saddle-focus. The Lyapunov exponents of the novel jerk chaotic system are obtained as (L_1 = 0.1443, L_2 = 0) and (L_3 = -2.8439). The Kaplan–Yorke dimension of the novel jerk chaotic system is obtained as (D_{KY} = 2.0507). Next, an adaptive backstepping controller is designed to globally stabilize the novel jerk chaotic system with unknown parameters. Moreover, an adaptive backstepping controller is also designed to achieve global chaos synchronization of the identical jerk chaotic systems with unknown parameters. The backstepping control method is a recursive procedure that links the choice of a Lyapunov function with the design of a controller and guarantees global asymptotic stability of strict feedback systems. MATLAB simulations have been shown to illustrate the phase portraits of the novel jerk chaotic system and also the adaptive backstepping control results. Finally, an electronic circuit realization of the novel jerk chaotic system using Spice is presented in detail to confirm the feasibility of the theoretical model.	chaos theory;electronic circuit simulation;nonlinear system;quartic function	Sundarapandian Vaidyanathan;Viet-Thanh Pham;Christos K.

6767fb394ac984376e4a0328444fdb63d632afb5	decentralized adaptive optimal stabilization of nonlinear systems with matched interconnections		In this paper, we investigate the decentralized feedback stabilization and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)-based optimization for the class of nonlinear systems with matched interconnections. The decentralized control law of the overall system is designed by integrating all controllers of the isolated subsystems, and it satisfies the optimality on the basis of optimal control laws of all the subsystems. For solving the optimal control problems of these isolated subsystems, the policy iteration algorithm is used to approximately solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations in the framework of ADP with the neural network implementation, where a set of critic neural networks is constructed to estimate the optimal cost functions, and the approximate optimal control laws can be obtained after the learning of critic neural networks. The weight estimation errors of the critic networks and the stability of all isolated subsystems are proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the performance of the proposed decentralized optimal control strategy is verified by simulation results.	nonlinear system	Chaoxu Mu;Changyin Sun;Ding Wang;Aiguo Song;Chengshan Qian	2018	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-017-2526-6	mathematical optimization;decentralised system;nonlinear system;artificial neural network;computer science;dynamic programming;lyapunov function;optimal control;control theory	Robotics	63.04876152826893	-3.221817083473192	40819

A method of generating a bipedal footstep sequence that follows a designated path and maintains stability in a planar environment is proposed in this paper. It adopts a walking style with a fixed step frequency and adjusts consecutive strides by eliminating irrational stride changes. An omnidirectional moving vehicle model and the deduced inequalities are introduced to theoretically describe the inter-pace constraints. A modified backtrack search is then implemented to solve the resulting constraint satisfaction problem. Both dynamics simulations and real robot experiments show that a humanoid robot is capable of tracking various paths with rapid paces. Comparison with several alternatives verifies the superiority of this novel method in terms of rapidity.	robot	Zhang Jiwen;Liu Li;Ken Chen	2016	I. J.

The standard GRNs under consideration are based on the model of the recurrent neural networks, the stochastic perturbation is in the form of a scalar Brownian motion, and the time-varying delays exist in the transcription and translation processes. Specifically, we are interested in (1) establishing a standard model for the time-varying delayed GRNs and (2) establishing conditions under which the standard GRNs are exponentially mean-square stable in the presence of time delays and stochastic disturbances. By using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and S-procedure, sufficient conditions are first derived for ensuring globally asymptotic and exponential stability that can be easily solved by using standard software packages. Two numerical examples are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	gene regulatory network	Yurong Li;Yanzheng Zhu;Nianyin Zeng;Min Du	2011	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2011.05.008	mathematical optimization;computer science;recurrent neural network;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	Logic	71.3062228229189	1.5799825952720803	40873

Up to now, open-tree structure has been generally employed for dynamic modeling of hybrid robotic systems. However, it requires not only expensive computation as the complexity of the system increases, but also must perform dynamic modeling for the whole manipulator again even if the partial portion of the robot structure is changed. Therefore, we propose an efficient dynamic modeling methodology for hybrid robotic systems. In the proposed method, initially the local dynamics of each of modules are obtained with respect to its independent joint coordinates and then the dynamics of the hybrid robot is calculated utilizing the concept of virtual joints that are attached to the base of each module of interest The virtual joints are assigned to have the appropriate number of DOFs in the operational space to represent the motion of all the proximal modules from the module of interest to the ground. For general multiple module-based hybrid robots, a recursive dynamic formulation of the proposed method is derived and the usefulness of the method is verified by comparing the computational efficiency of both the proposed method and the existing method.	computation;recursion;robot;tree structure	Goo Bong Chung;Byung-Ju Yi;Dong Jin Lim;Whee Kuk Kim	2004	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004.

e9bd403c45dbfda775d62356c4649a9f154ed90b	internet of things infrastructure for wireless power transfer systems		This paper derives a state-space model of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems to be used for the purpose of state estimation and controller design considering the internet of things (IoT) communication networks. After expressing the WPT systems into a state-space linear equation, the elements of IoT, such as sensors are deployed to obtain the state information. Then, an innovative IoT based communication infrastructure is proposed for sensing, actuating, and transmitting the information to the control center. In order to know the operating condition of the WPT systems, the Kalman filter based dynamic state estimation algorithm is proposed considering the IoT infrastructure. Afterwards, the optimal controller is designed to regulate the system states. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approaches can accurately estimate and stabilise the WPT states. Therefore, the developed frameworks are valuable in designing the IoT based smart control center for WPT systems.	algorithm;internet of things;kalman filter;linear equation;optimal control;sensor;simulation;state space;telecommunications network;transmitter	Md Masud Rana;Wei Xiang;Eric Wang;Xuehua Li;Bong Jun Choi	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2795803	telecommunications network;computer network;control theory;rlc circuit;capacitor;kalman filter;internet of things;wireless power transfer;computer science	Robotics	56.14764208078333	-1.8012272830057146	40968
d628663ae58fa19f3fc912aa1cf759f63315ff6d	application of fuzzy model predictive control to a drum-boiler		Economic feasibility of a power plant requires smooth and uninterrupted plant operation in the face of varying electrical power demand. The feed-water system in a power plant is a major contributor to plant unavailability. In this paper, a fuzzy model predictive control FMPC approach is introduced to design a level control system in a drum boiler. In this approach, the process is described by a fuzzy convolution model that consists of a number of quasi-linear fuzzy implications FI. The whole process behavior is characterized by a weighted sum of the outputs from all quasi-linear fuzzy implications. In controller design, prediction errors and control energy are minimized through a two-layered iterative optimization process. At the lower layer, optimal local control policies are identified to minimize prediction errors in each subsystem. A globally optimal control policy is then identified through coordinating the subsystems to reach an overall minimum prediction error at the upper layer. Results from validation of the control system are presented. A Client/Server architecture is proposed for implementation.

The excitement in this field stems from the fact that we can sample at a rate way below the Nyquist rate and still reconstruct the signal provided some conditions are met. Some of the popular greedy reconstruction algorithms are the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), the Subspace Pursuit (SP) and the Look Ahead Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (LAOMP). The LAOMP performs better than the OMP. However, when compared to the SP and the OMP, the computational complexity of LAOMP is higher. We introduce a modified version of the LAOMP termed as Reduced Look Ahead Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (Reduced LAOMP). Reduced LAOMP uses prior information from the results of the OMP and the SP in the quest to speedup the look ahead strategy in the LAOMP. Monte Carlo simulations of this algorithm deliver promising results.	basis pursuit denoising;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;greedy algorithm;linear equation;matching pursuit;monte carlo method;nyquist rate;openmp;rademacher complexity;simulation;sparse matrix;speedup	Prateek Basavapur Swamy;Sooraj K.

We show how such sub-movement sequences can emerge naturally as an optimal control policy is approximated by a reinforcement learning system in the face of uncertainty and feedback delay. The system learns to generate sequences of pulse-step commands, producing fast initial sub-movements followed by several slow corrective sub-movements that often begin before the initial sub-movement has completed. These results suggest how the nervous system might efficiently control a stochastic motor plant under uncertainty and feedback delay.	approximation algorithm;emergence;feedback;optimal control;reinforcement learning;velocity (software development)	Michael Kositsky;Andrew G.

Using the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke method, the bifurcation gait could be suppressed into the period-1 gait with higher energy efficiency and walking speed. However, the disturbance rejection ability of the obtained period-1 gait was insufficient, i.e., the basin of attraction was small. In this paper, a new suppression method based on the idea of model predictive control is proposed. Because of the design of the new walking model, which has a time window for computation, and the ability to calculate the walking map quickly, the optimal parameter perturbation can be generated in real time during walking. As a result, the suppression of the bifurcation gait for our bipedal robot can be achieved on-line. This new method not only makes the gait of the controlled model converge to the target period-1 gait with desired high performance, but also guarantees that the obtained gait is better able to reject disturbances.	bifurcation theory;computation;converge;gait analysis;mobile robot;online and offline;over-the-top content;rejection sampling;zero suppression	Ka Deng;Mingguo Zhao;Wenli Xu	2017	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2016.11.023	effect of gait parameters on energetic cost;simulation;poincaré map;model predictive control	Robotics	62.617256694724524	-23.053044073646085	41210

The plant is a quantum system, which generally is in a mixed state, coupled to a continuous measurement channel. The Pontryagin Maximum Principle is derived in both the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture, in particular in statistical moment coordinates.

Their domain of applications is wide and keeps expanding. One of the mostly widely used types of these actuators is the amplified piezoelectric actuator (APA). APAs have been used in many control engineering applications such as vibration suppression and positioning. Their efficient use, however, requires a development of an accurate mathematical model. A number of nonlinear models were proposed in the literature. Among these models, Bounc-Wen (BW) model received a special interest due to its simplicity and its ability to model a wide range of hysterics behavior. This paper addresses some practical considerations that need to be addressed when using BW model to describe the dynamic behavior of APA.

The correction vector is determined by the mean of the multi-polynomial approximation algorithm (MPAalgorithm) using observations of the noise functions of the components of the state vectors.

When the needle is inserted into soft tissue, it bends naturally due to the asymmetric forces. In this paper, mechanics-based modeling of needle insertion is developed, based on which the needle deflection during insertion can be predicted. Utilizing the beam theory and Rayleigh-Ritz method, the shape function of the needle deflection can be formulated mathematically. An online evaluation method for load distribution is further proposed to determine the distributed load when the needle is inserted into non-homogenous tissue. Experiments are finally performed to verify the correctness of the proposed approach.	control theory;correctness (computer science);euler–bernoulli beam theory;insertion sort;load balancing (computing);rayleigh–ritz method;torsion (gastropod)	Jianjun Wang;Xiangpeng Li;Jinjin Zheng;Dong Sun	2013	2013 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2013.6584065	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	75.6797759077281	-19.650773742205953	41687

At the introduction the authors claim that some numerical results for Hénon map, coupled logistic map and Rössler system will be given, only some results for the latter is presented in the paper. Also the affect of noise on the performance of the proposed scheme is not considered, which is an important issue. In Chapter 28, the authors focus on numerical calculations of periodic orbits along with the related bifurcation parameters. They apply their numerical technique to various classical systems and compare them with the existing ones. This chapter presents an alternative way of finding periodic orbits along with the bifurcation parameters which may be useful for researchers in the field. Chapter 29 deals with the chaotic behaviour in one-dimensional discrete time systems. It neatly outlines most of the relevant information and concepts related to chaos, presents various applications of the theoretical results. It can be considered as an excellent tutorial on the subject and a very good reference for researchers working in this area. The main aim of the present book is to present the state of the art of the chaos in electronic circuits and systems and to serve as a reference for scientists working in different areas of chaotic systems who are interested in chaotic behaviour in electronic systems. In that respect, this book serves its purpose in an efficient way and is a welcome edition to the literature on chaotic electronic systems. Finally, we congratulate the editors for their excellent job in compiling diverse material in such a book.

Due to the electrostatic force of the testing signal, the seismic mass of the sensor may be pulled into contact with the static electrode. In this paper, safe operation ranges for capacitive accelerometers with light damping for dynamic inertial signals (step and pulse signals) are investigated for singleand double-sided configurations. The results show that the safe signal level of step inertial signal is smaller than that of quasi-static signal by a factor of 0.5 to 0.7. For pulse inertial signal, the safe operation condition is dependent on the product of the amplitude and the time duration of the pulse.	sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Minhang Bao;Yuancheng Sun;Yiping Huang;Yuelin Wang	2003	International Journal of Computational Engineering Science	10.1142/S1465876303000892	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;operant conditioning;control theory;capacitive sensing	Mobile	78.98328531415083	-16.375121258160753	41998

Although some measurements have been arranged so far to evaluate statical or dynamical flexibility of hand manipulator. This paper displays a new measurement of Dynamic Reconfiguration Manipulability Shape Index (DRMSI) which is the combination of dynamic manipulability and reconfiguration manipulability, and we have applied the DRMSI into humanoid robot experiments to evaluate its dynamical reconfiguration ability during walking. According to the value of DRMSI in our experiments, we have verified our humanoid robot model is reliable and effective since the results have indicated that the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of our model are similar to human-being.	experiment;human height;humanoid robot;mathematical optimization;poor posture;simulation;tissot's indicatrix	Keli Shen;Xiang Li;Hongzhi Tian;Daiji Izawa;Mamoru Minami;Takayuki Matsuno	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2016.7866529	control engineering;database index;dynamics;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;ellipsoid	Robotics	68.59459767966064	-23.162742725748057	42127

The slow response of these systems requires predictive control based on an understanding of the input-output relationship of system dynamics. In practical applications, such as learning to control an excavator, training can be a long and therefore costly process. This paper investigates the use of haptic shared control (HSC) to support learning of a system with slow dynamics. Previous work has failed to reach a consensus on the effectiveness of training with HSC, although a few recent studies have demonstrated improvements in tasks with time-critical components. Here, subjects learned to perform a pursuit task while controlling a linear system with slow dynamics using a 1-DOF haptic manipulator, either with or without HSC during training. To prevent reliance on the guidance forces, HSC was only present on intermittent trials and decreased in strength over time. Both groups quickly learned the task and showed similar performance after training, regardless of whether or not they trained with HSC.	control theory;dynamical system;excavator (microarchitecture);haptic technology;linear system;refinement (computing);system dynamics;teaching method;window of opportunity	Vincent Honing;Tricia L.

When images are binary, this problem corresponds to the control of the evolution of a geometric domain. The present paper proposes mathematical tools derived from shape analysis and optimization to study this problem in a quite general way, i.e., without any regularity assumptions or modelsa priori on the domains that we deal with. Indeed, despite the lackness of a vectorial structure, one can develop a differential calculus in the metric space of all non-empty compact subsets of a given domain ofR n , and adapt ideas and results of classical differential systems to study and control the evolution of geometric domains. For instance, a shape Lyapunov characterization allows to investigate the asymptotic behavior of these geometric domains using the notion of directional shape derivative. We apply this inR 2 to the visual servoing problem using the optical flow equations and some experimental simulations illustrate this approach.	lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;negative feedback;optical flow;robotics;servo;shape analysis (digital geometry);simulation;visual servoing	Luc Doyen	1995	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1007/BF01250522	computer vision;mathematical optimization;topology;metric space;lyapunov function;computer science;differential calculus;shape analysis;optical flow;mathematics;geometry;visual servoing	Robotics	59.205079792180214	-21.427486151483954	42146
c43eb0a2fa79a4c7f6a3d182c127479a96d7c381	flatness based control of a gantry crane		This contribution deals with flatness based control of a laboratory model of a gantry crane. The mechanical model has 3DOFs, where a trolley can be moved on a rail, the load is fixed at the end of a rope and can be lifted or lowered by coiling or uncoiling this rope on a cylinder. Under the assumption that the rope is always stretched, the underactuated system is not input to state linearisable but it is flat with the coordinates of the load as flat output. Since the flat output coincides with the variables to be controlled, a flatness based design for trajectory tracking and stabilisation is indicated. The design of the tracking control is accomplished in two steps. First, the system is exactly linearised by a quasi-static state feedback. Subsequently, for the linear system a feedback with integral parts is designed such that the motion of the load is stabilised about the reference trajectories. Moreover, the control law is extended by terms which approximately compensate for the friction occurring at the gantry crane. Finally, the setting of the controller parameters is discussed and measurement results are presented, which demonstrate an excellent tracking behaviour and disturbance attenuation.	ccir system a;cylinder seal;feedback;linear system;optimal control	Bernd Kolar;Kurt Schlacher	2013		10.3182/20130904-3-FR-2041.00056	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.10835030289817	-13.89566264585904	42197

The conversion losses generate internal heat, which is undesirable, as it leads to thermal loading on the device. Temperature rise should be limited to enhance the reliability, minimize thermal disturbance, and improve the output performance of the device. This paper presents the application of an optimization method to determine the geometric configuration of a flexure-based linear electromagnetic actuator that maximizes output force per unit of heat generated. A two-stage optimization method is used to search for a global solution, followed by a feasible solution locally using a branch and bound method. The finite element magnetic (fine) model is replaced by an analytical (coarse) model during optimization using an output space mapping technique. An 80% reduction in computation time is achieved by the application of such an approximation technique. The measured output from the new prototype based on the optimal design shows a 45% increase in air gap magnetic flux density, a 40% increase in output force, and a 26% reduction in heat generation when compared with the initial design before application of the optimization method.	air gap (networking);approximation;branch and bound;computation;finite element method;mathematical optimization;optimal design;prototype;space mapping;thermal grease;time complexity	Jonathan Hey;Tat Joo Teo;Viet Phuong Bui;Guilin Yang;Ricardo Martinez-Botas	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2301727	control engineering;atmospheric model;mathematical optimization;magnetic circuit;engineering;finite element method;control theory;computational model;force;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	81.52087279395066	-14.237055508874917	42227

The use case revolves around grasping and manipulation of deformable objects. These kinds of tasks are difficult to tune to a satisfactory extent by expert users, and therefore optimization by simulation is a good alternative to achieve satisfactory solutions. In order to apply the optimization, a dynamic simulation framework has been used to model the performance of a given solution for the task. The solutions are parameterized in terms of the robot motion and the gripper configuration, and after each simulation various objective scores are determined and combined. This enables the use of various optimization strategies. Based on visual inspection of the most robust solution found, it is determined that 50 out of 50 simulations, with different meat properties, produce satisfactory manipulations.	mathematical optimization;robot end effector;robust optimization;smt placement equipment;simulation;stochastic process;visual inspection	Troels Bo Jørgensen;Kristian Debrabant;Norbert Krüger	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487574	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	63.53188838886624	-21.931720523317054	42306

One challenging application is nonstationary loads; those that move spatially in time. Such loads change the coupling between the source and load and with it the efficiency and maximum power transfer possible. One emerging application is in the automotive environment, where nonstationary loads such as powered seats and doors exist. Moreover, the automotive environment is particularly challenging due to the presence of metallic objects and the safety requirements of the passengers. In this work, we examine RWPT for nonstationary loads and present a design methodology for optimal efficiency and power transfer and show an RWPT of 70 W across a 24 cm distance in an automotive environment. We also examine the impact of the metallic environment and show how its effects can be mitigated. Finally, we examine the field intensity during RWPT and examine the safety of the passengers.

Therefore a need arises for robust fault diagnosis, where complete disturbance decoupling can be achieved. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a parity relation for robust fault detection using right eigenstructure assignment. Up to date the left eigenstructure assignment technique has been used for the design of first order disturbance decoupled parity relations. In many cases complete disturbance decoupling is not possible when using left eigenstructure assignment. Therefore, the proposed method utilises the right eigenstructure assignment technique for the purpose of robust fault detection. The novelty of the developed scheme is to replace the traditional asymptotically convergent state observer by a state observer, which converges in a predefined time. The proposed method is demonstrated to be equivalent to a parity relation of a user predefined order.	coupling (computer programming);fault detection and isolation;finite impulse response;parity bit	Malgorzata Sumislawska;Tomasz Larkowski;Keith J.

However, it has been the fact that hysteresis is inherent in any piezoelectric actuators, especially when using voltage steering, which in turn, can degrade the performance of the system. Therefore, it should be treated carefully. In this work, a simple Dahl model is constructed to capture the hysteresis effect together with the mechanical model. For simplicity, the nature of the micro manipulator is assumed to be modelled as lumped parameters. From open-loop experimental response, a disturbance observer is constructed based on that model for estimating the hysteresis effect. Finally, some experiments are performed. Experimental result shows that the area of the hysteresis curve could be minimized significantly. However, it is still asymmetric due to the behaviour of the flexure hinge. Therefore, an integral action is added to reduce this effect. It is seen that the hysteresis could be compensated well	experiment;hysteresis;lumped element model;piezoelectricity	Adha Imam Cahyadi;Yoshio Yamamoto	2006	2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2006.282112	control engineering;open-loop controller;electronic engineering;hysteresis;engineering;control theory	Robotics	71.95147184392643	-14.501874644347106	42546

Control of the system is distributed among five different types of agents: link agents, joint agents, end-effector agents, task agents, and object agents. As each agent attempts to achieve a desired individual behavior, the manipulator itself exhibits an emergent behavior that avoids obstacles while approaching an object to be grasped. As the object is approached, object agents that represent the object to be grasped and the gripper performing the grasp are instantiated. The instantiation of each of these two object agents, which are guided by visual feedback, automatically changes the manipulator control structure. Once both object agents become active, closed-loop visual servoing of the end-effector during the final stage of grasping is realized. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the three types of manipulator control realized during a typical grasping task.	multi-agent system;visual servoing	Lars Overgaard;Bradley J.

We derive the weighted averaging procedure by maximizing signal-to-noise ratio in the averaged subject responses and show, thereby, that maximizing signal-to-noise ratio criterion is equivalent to minimizing the originally proposed mean-square error criterion in the sense of the weighted averaging problem solving. Moreover, in order to characterize fully the performance of the selected methods, we compare also noise reduction rates in estimates of event-related potentials provided by methods, while the number of processed trials increases.	bottleneck (software);erp;electroencephalography;mean squared error;noise reduction;problem solving;rate of convergence;signal-to-noise ratio	Andriy Ivannikov;Tommi Kärkkäinen;Tapani Ristaniemi;Heikki Lyytinen	2008			computer science	ML	79.8448753548875	-6.050592315574179	42710

Hierarchical vehicle-control structures have been used before-for example, in electronic stability control systems, where a low-level control loop tracks high-level references. Here, the control structure includes a nonlinear vehicle model already at the high level to generate optimization-based references. A nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) formulation, combined with a linearized MPC acting as a backup controller, tracks these references by allocating torque and steer commands. With this structure the two control layers have a physical coupling, which makes it easier for the low-level loop to track the references. Simulation results show improved performance over an approach based on linearized MPC, as well as feasibility for online implementations.	backup;computation;control flow;control system;coupling (computer programming);high- and low-level;high-level programming language;mathematical optimization;motion planning;nonlinear system;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing);simulation;wheels	Karl Berntorp;Fredrik Magnusson	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7171154	control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;convergence;engineering;trajectory;control theory	Robotics	62.86228905836007	-17.843360942509545	42768

PRIDE is based upon the 4D/RCS (real-time control system) architecture and provides information to planners at the level of granularity that is appropriate for their planning horizon. The primary contribution of this paper is the approach that is used to provide a more synergistic framework, in which the results from one prediction algorithm are used to strengthen/weaken the results of another prediction algorithm. In particular, we describe how the results of an estimation-theoretic short-term (ST) prediction algorithm are used to validate the results of a situation-based long-term (LT) prediction algorithm. We show the results of the long-term prediction both before and after the results of the short-term predictions are integrated, and demonstrate how the latter provide better predictions of vehicle future positions using the AutoSim simulation package	4d-rcs reference model architecture;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;autonomous robot;encode;extended kalman filter;image scaling;real-time control system;real-time clock;relevance;revision control system;simulation;synergy;theory	Craig Schlenoff;Raj Madhavan;Zeid Kootbally	2006	Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2006.

Based on a detailed analysis of the grasping process, the problem of position/force control is converted into the position control along with force monitoring. Then, a strategy of sliding mode-based robust position control is presented and its stability is demonstrated analytically. As compared with the traditional position/force switching control which usually induces an unstable transition, the switching problem is eliminated by the presented scheme. Moreover, only a piecewise position trajectory planning is needed for the robust position controller. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is validated by experimental investigations. The scheme provides a sound base for the execution of practical microassembly tasks.	control theory;piezoelectricity;robust control;sensor	Qingsong Xu	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2013.6653900	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.62623709930524	-17.878213480137152	42834

A quaternion-based distributed attitude coordination control scheme is proposed with consideration of the input saturation and with the aid of the sliding-mode observer, separation principle theorem, Chebyshev neural networks, smooth projection algorithm, and robust control technique. Using graph theory and a Lyapunov-based approach, it is shown that the distributed controller can guarantee the attitude of all spacecraft to converge to a common time-varying reference attitude when the reference attitude is available only to a portion of the group of spacecraft. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed distributed controller.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;computational fluid dynamics;computer simulation;constraint (mathematics);controllers;converge;graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;graph theory;instability;lyapunov fractal;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;robust control;separation principle;spacecraft;subgroup;negative regulation of endoplasmic reticulum tubular network organization	An-Min Zou;Krishna Dev Kumar	2012	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2196710	mathematical optimization;graph theory;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network;quaternion	Robotics	63.819858795821446	3.9977803414177773	42950

Models of these two motor types were used to calculate benchmarks and evaluate motor performance in simulated tasks for different motor geometries. Exterior-rotor motors had higher motor constants and efficiency, but lower rated power compared with interior-rotor motors. They required less energy to perform typical robotic tasks. Four exterior-rotor motors were fabricated and compared with manufacturing data from the best existing brushless DC motors. The exterior-rotor motors had more than a 250% increase in stall torque density compared with the best known brushless DC motor (RoboDrive) and more than a 740% increase in stall torque density compared with more common motors such as those produced by MicroMo and Maxon. These exterior-rotor motors appear promising for robotic applications.	algorithmic efficiency;benchmark (computing);cinema 4d;r.o.t.o.r.;robot	Jonathon W. Sensinger;Stephen D. Clark;Jack F.

The positive impacts of platooning on travel time reliability, congestion, emissions, and energy consumption has been shown for homogeneous roadway segments. However, unveiling the full potential of platooning requires stable platoons throughout the transportation system (end-to-end platooning). Speed limit changes frequently throughout the transportation network, due to either safety related considerations (e.g., change in roadway geometry and workzone operations) or congestion management schemes (e.g., speed harmonization systems). These abrupt changes in speed limit can result in shockwave formation and cause travel time unreliability. Therefore, designing a platooning strategy for tracking a reference velocity profile is critical to enabling end-to-end platooning. Accordingly, this study introduces a generalized control model to track a desired velocity profile, while ensuring safety in the platoon of autonomous vehicles. We define appropriate natural error terms and the target curve in the state space of the control system, which is the set of points where all error terms vanish and corresponds to the case when all vehicles move with the desired velocities and in the miniml safe distance between them. In this way we change the tracking velocity profile problem into a state-feedback stabilization problem with respect to the target curve. Under certain mild assumptions on the Lipschitz constant of the speed drop profile, we show that the stabilizing feedback can be obtained via introducing a natural dynamics for *Sina Arefizadeh is a Ph.D Candidate in the Zachry Department of Civil Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843 USA (e-mail: sinaarefizadeh@tamu.edu).

86660d747957f2f17175885988ba07b0f2342b2e	formation control with obstacle avoidance for a class of stochastic multiagent systems		This paper addresses formation control with obstacle avoidance problem for a class of second-order stochastic nonlinear multiagent systems under directed topology. Different with deterministic multiagent systems, stochastic cases are more practical and challenging because the exogenous disturbances depicted by the Wiener process are considered. In order to achieve control objective, both the leader-follower formation approach and the artificial potential field (APF) method are combined together, where the artificial potential is utilized to solve obstacle avoidance problem. For obtaining good system robustness to the undesired side effects of the artificial potential, $H_\infty$ analysis is implemented. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that control objective can be achieved, of which obstacle avoidance is proven by finding an energy function satisfying that its time derivative is positive. Finally, a numerical simulation is carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation schemes.	agent-based model;computer simulation;consensus dynamics;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance	Guoxing Wen;C.

Stability and resolution analysis with performance guarantee for Single-Snapshot ESPRIT (SS-ESPRIT) is the main focus. In the noise-free case exact reconstruction is guaranteed for any arbitrary set of frequencies as long as the number of measurement data is at least twice the number of distinct frequencies to be recovered. In the presence of noise and under the assumption that the true frequencies are separated by at least two times Rayleigh’s Resolution Length, an explicit error bound for frequency reconstruction is given in terms of the dynamic range and the separation of the frequencies. The separation and sparsity constraint compares favorably with those of the leading approaches to compressed sensing in the continuum.	compressed sensing;dynamic range;estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques;rayleigh–ritz method;snapshot (computer storage);snapshot isolation;sparse matrix;spectral density estimation;triune continuum paradigm	Albert Fannjiang	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	Theory	78.8057999405908	-7.768535235184519	43193

Tuning formulae are derived for PD controller being used for controlling IPDT processes. Simulations have been carried out to determine the effectiveness of the tuning formulae. Also, comparison between proposed and the other existing tuning methods with respect to performance indices, time domain specifications and the control effort expressed in terms of control signal energy has been done. Effects of gain margin and settling time specifications on process output responses have been discussed. A PD controller cannot account for load disturbances. So, a disturbance observer is suggested for use along with the PD controller. Regulatory and tracking responses are then compared with respect to performance indices and control effort.	bode plot;computer simulation;frequency response;game controller;phase margin;servo;settling time;transfer function	Sujay D.

Compressibility of air in the actuator tubes and the elastic nature of the rubber, however, are the two major sources of increased non-linearity and complexity in motion control. Soft computing, exploiting the tolerance of uncertainty and vagueness in cognitive reasoning has been offering easy to handle, robust, and low-priced solutions to several non-linear industrial applications. Nonetheless, the black-box approach in these systems results in application specific architectures with some important design parameters left for fine tuning (i.e. number of nodes in a neural network). In this study we propose a more systematic method in defining the structure of a soft computing technique, namely the backpropagation neural network, when used as a controller for rubbertuator robot systems. The structure of the neural network is based on the physical model of the robot, while the neural network itself is trained to learn the trajectory independent parameters of the model that are essential for defining the robot dynamics. The proposed system performance was compared with a well-tuned PID controller and shown to be more accurate in trajectory control for rubbertuator robots.		Mehmed Özkan;Kenji Inoue;Kanako Negishi;T.

To this end, first a stable transition from initial to desired configuration is made based on the minimum number of steps and maximum use of the leg workspace to prepare the robot for the movement. Next, swing leg and body trajectories are planned for a successful stairclimbing gait. Afterwards, a stable spinning gait is proposed to change the orientation of the body. We simulate our gait planning algorithms on a model of quadruped robot. The results show that the robot is able to climb up stairs, rotate about its yaw axis, and climb down stairs while its stability is guaranteed.	algorithm;apache axis;automated planning and scheduling;feedback;human–robot interaction;motion planning;perturbation theory;robot;simulation;workspace;yaws	Ali Zamani;Mahdi Khorram;S.

In terms of the generalized BCzout identity, a right factorization of a nonlinear plant is coprime according to the input-output definition if and only if it satisfies the generalized Bezout identity. Therefore the stability of an observer-controller configuration is a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonlinear plant to have a right coprime factorization. Finally we present generalized B6zout maps for some nonlinear plants with a state-space representation.	fred (chatterbot);map;nonlinear system;state-space representation	Alfonso Baños	1996	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(95)00164-6	nonlinear system;state-space representation;calculus;control theory;mathematics;geometry;factorization	Robotics	72.4980372494726	-1.9395357080105389	43336

In this approach, a feed-forward network such as radial basis function (RBF) network is used to learn the forward kinematic map of the redundant manipulator. This network is inverted using an inverse-forward adaptive scheme until the network inversion solution guides the manipulator end-effector to reach a given target position with a specified accuracy. The positioning accuracy, attainable by a conventional network inversion scheme, depends on the approximation error present in the forward model. But, an accurate forward map would require a very large size of training data as well as network architecture. The proposed inverse-forward adaptive scheme effectively approximates the forward map around the joint angle vector provided by a hint generator. Thus the inverse kinematic solution obtained using the network inversion approach can take the end-effector to the target position within any arbitrary accuracy. In order to satisfy the joint angle constraints, it is necessary to provide the network inversion algorithm with an initial hint for the joint angle vector. Since a redundant manipulator can reach a given target end-effector position through several joint angle vectors, it is desirable that the hint generator is capable of providing multiple hints. This problem has been addressed by using a Kohonen self organizing map based sub-clustering (KSOM-SC) network architecture. The redundancy resolution process involves selecting a suitable joint angle configuration based on different task related criteria. The simulations and experiments are carried out on a 7 DOF PowerCube manipulator. It is shown that one can obtain a positioning accuracy of 1 mm without violating joint angle constraints even when the forward approximation error is as large as 4 cm. An obstacle avoidance problem has also been solved to demonstrate the redundancy resolution process with the proposed scheme.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;cluster analysis;experiment;feedforward neural network;forward kinematics;initial condition;inverse kinematics;network architecture;obstacle avoidance;organizing (structure);radial (radio);radial basis function network;redundancy (engineering);regular expression;robot end effector;self-organization;self-organizing map;simulation;teuvo kohonen;workspace	Swagat Kumar;Laxmidhar Behera;T.

However, the radiation damage on robot components except for electronic circuits has not been well studied. Our study in this paper is the first on the radiation induced performance degradation of the brushless DC (BLDC) motor in the robot servo systems. Based on the fact that radiation causes NdFeB magnet demagnetisation, we analyse how this demagnetisation would affect the BLDC motor performance by establishing a model introducing the demagnetisation factor into the electromagnetic model of the BLDC motor, and simulated the motor operation under open loop PWM control in MATLAB. The result shows that the radiation demagnetised BLDC motor will decrease in power, lose controllability, and even quit working by a 'magnetic-trap' jerking effect.	elegant degradation;robot;servo	Shimeng Li;Yuan F.

Given the configurations (position and direction) of two points, one searches for the trajectory that minimizes the integral of acceleration (tangential and normal). The resulting trajectory should not only be smooth but also safe in order to be applicable in real-life situations, so the authors investigate two different obstacle-avoidance constraints that satisfy the minimization problem. Unfortunately, in this case the problem becomes more complex and unsuitable for real-time implementations. Therefore, the authors introduce two simple solutions, based on the idea of polynomial fitting to generate safe trajectories, once a collision is detected with the original smooth trajectory.

However, there is still a lack of detailed stability and accuracy analysis for the sensorless SR drive system. In this paper, a sensorless rotor-position-measurement method for an SR motor drive is presented. The method is based on estimating a particular rotor position on a phase-by-phase basis and measuring the flux linkage and current when the estimated position is reached. By comparing the measured flux linkage with the pre-stored flux linkage corresponding to the particular position for the measured current, the angular difference between the estimated and particular positions can be calculated. The method is applied to two practical systems, the first being a 0.3-kW 10000-r/min three-phase 6/4 SR motor with a variable load, and the second being a 1-kW 1500-r/min three-phase 12/8 SR motor with a fan load. This paper examines the theoretical stability of the measurement and shows that measurement errors are not compounded and act as a variable disturbance to the system. The theoretical accuracy of the measurement is examined and shown to be acceptable.	angularjs;computation;flux qubit;linkage (software);multistage interconnection networks;r.o.t.o.r.	Ibrahim H.

Due to the manipulator redundancy, the load distribution computed by means of a generalized inverse of the grasp matrix is not uniquely determined. Controversial results on the nonsqueezing property of specific load distributions exist in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the analysis of internal wrenches based on the kinematic constraints imposed to the manipulator ensemble. We unify previous results by showing that there exists no unique nonsqueezing load distribution and illustrate the consequences of our findings by means of several examples. In particular, the presented results provide a new perspective on the decomposition of interaction forces into internal and external components as required for cooperative multimanipulator control schemes.	conversion between quaternions and euler angles;load balancing (computing);programming paradigm;relevance;robot;robot end effector;the matrix	Sebastian Erhart;Sandra Hirche	2015	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2015.2459412	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.4145528370125	-21.570720274410064	43477

We propose to simplify controllers defined by continuous Piecewise Affine (PWA) functions by employing separating functions. If a state resides in a region where the optimal control action attains a saturated value, the optimal control move is determined from the sign of the separator. Thus, instead of storing all regions, only the unconstrained regions and the separator are needed. We propose several approaches to construct separators with different efficacy and properties.	reduction (complexity)	Michal Kvasnica;Juraj Hledik;Ivana Rauová;Miroslav Fikar	2013	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.02.018	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	AI	64.00339691885439	-0.7712832000659936	43559

In order to find a method that is versatile and has simple calculation process, it is figured out that different kinds of hybrid power system have the same path in the transfer of energy. The distribution of energy is decided by the upper Limit of direct power from the diesel engine. The upper Limit of direct power from the diesel engine, which could characterize the hybrid system, is used as the independent variable. The common expressions of the main components' installed parameter are deduced from the load curve. These expressions are used to design the parameters on a certain 7t hydrauLic excavator. The result shows that this method can be used to carry out parameter matching on different hybrid system and also shows significant reference value on choosing the overall plan of the hybrid system.	diesel;excavator (microarchitecture);hybrid system;load profile;parameter (computer programming)	Zhi Liu;Shaoju Liu;Zhonghua Huang;Qiong Hu	2011	2011 Second International Conference on Digital Manufacturing & Automation	10.1109/ICDMA.2011.150	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;mechanical engineering	EDA	80.44368590708297	-16.7690759370508	43573

Such a robot is small-time locally controllable on an open subset of its zero velocity section, allowing it to follow any path in this subset arbitrarily closely. However, some paths are “preferred” by the dynamics of the manipulator in that they can be followed at higher speeds. In this paper we describe a computationally efficient trajectory planner which finds fast collision-free trajectories among obstacles. We are able to decouple the problem of planning feasible trajectories in the robot’s six-dimensional state space into the computationally simpler problems of planning paths in the three-dimensional configuration space and time scaling the paths according to the manipulator dynamics. This decoupling is made possible by the existence of velocity directions, fixed in the passive link frame, which can be executed at arbitrary speeds. We have demonstrated the motion planner on an experimental underactuated manipulator. To our knowledge, it is the first implementation of a collision-free motion planning algorithm for a manipulator subject to a second-order nonholonomic constraint.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;automated planning and scheduling;coupling (computer programming);image scaling;motion planning;planner;robot;state space;velocity (software development)	Kevin M.

The modeling and control strategy take into account the dynamics of the velocity controlled 6 DOF manipulator as well as a simplified model of the camera and acquisition system in order to significantly increase the bandwidth of the servo loop. Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) is used to optimally control the visual loop with respect to the proposed dynamical model. The predictive feature of the GPC is used for optimal trajectory following in Cartesian space. Experimental results on a 6 DOF industrial robot are presented that validate the proposed model. The visual sensor used in the experiments is a high speed camera that acquires 120 non interlaced images per second. Using this camera, sampling rate of 120 Hz is achieved for the visual loop. Furthermore, a precise synchronization method is used to reduce the delays due to image transfer and processing. The experiments show a drastic improvement of the loop performance with respect to more classical control strategies for 6 DOF visual servo loops.	cartesian closed category;computer;control theory;experiment;feedforward neural network;industrial robot;interlaced video;mimo;negative feedback;pid;perturbation theory;rejection sampling;sampling (signal processing);servo;simulation interoperability standards organization;traffic enforcement camera;velocity (software development);visual servoing	Jacques Gangloff;Michel de Mathelin	2003	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855303322554391	control engineering;computer vision;optimal control;engineering;control theory;visual servoing;model predictive control	Robotics	66.32574833144419	-15.202573456810304	43654
acb37a25d41ad1788e23169945f5470f8c088e63	algorithms for chattering reduction in system control		Sliding mode control (SMC) is among the popular approaches for control of systems, especially for unknown nonlinear systems. However, the chattering in SMC is generally a problem that needs to be resolved for better control. A time-varying method is proposed for determining the sliding gain function in the SMC. Two alternative tuning algorithms are proposed for reducing the sliding gain function for systems. The first algorithm is for systems with no noise and disturbance but with or without unmodeled dynamics. The second algorithm is for systems with noise, disturbance, unmodeled dynamics, or any combination of them. Compared with the state-dependent, equivalent-control-dependent, and hysteresis loop methods, the proposed algorithms are more straightforward and easy to implement. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated for five different cases. A 90% to 95% reduction of chattering is achieved for the first algorithm used for systems with sensor dynamics only. By using the second algorithm, the chattering is reduced by 70% to 90% for systems with noise and/or disturbance, and by 25% to 50% for systems with a combination of disturbance, noise, and unmodeled dynamics.	algorithm	Nengmou Wang;Hojjat Adeli	2012	J.

04555ff57b8b2963416c712c4ddc9b0f255253f0	model-based feedback control of oil production in oil-rim reservoirs under gas coning conditions		In oil-rim reservoirs, oil is typically extracted at constant rate. However, the constant-rate oil production strategy may lead to suboptimal solutions as it does not take into account the process dynamics such as how the gas/oil contact (GOC) near the wellbore dynamically changes with time during oil production. Motivated by this, initially, we present a gas-rate dependent gas/oil ratio model to describe gas coning phenomena. Second, a numerical scheme is developed to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the GOC height during oil production. Third, a reduced-order model is constructed, which is used to design a Luenberger observer for state estimation. Lastly, the model predictive control theory is applied for the design of a feedback control system to compute the optimal oil production profile that maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of oil produced from a well before gas breakthrough. We demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is able to compute the oil production profile before gas breakthrough which has a higher NPV compared to other state-of-the-art oil production strategies including Hasanu0027s control law and the conventional constant-rate oil production strategies.	feedback	Prashanth Siddhamshetty;Joseph Sang-Il Kwon	2018		10.23919/ACC.2018.8431419	control engineering;control theory;computer science;state observer;model predictive control;wellbore;control system	Robotics	56.14481180502149	-5.262520167029918	43687

f6a7fc9a8b6b994b5d10375319795ec5be2e8a31	a theoretical discussion on the foundation of stone's blind source separation		This paper discusses the theoretical foundation of Stone’s BSS (Stone in Neural Comput 13:1559–1574, 2001; Stone in Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction, A Bradford Book, London, 2004), and it proposes a novel BSS approach based on second-order statistics of the responses of two different linear filters to source signals. The proposed approach which includes Stone’s BSS as a special case helps us to understand how generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) concludes separating vectors in Stone’s BSS. It obtains the separating vectors by simultaneous diagonalization of covariance matrices of two different linear filters responses to the mixtures. The two employed linear filters are selected dependent on source signals structures under the assumption that they have different responses to source signals. Here, two FIR filters with coefficients selected in an opposite probabilistic way have been suggested for the proposed BSS. The proposed BSS method has been compared with Stone’s BSS, SOBI and AMUSE over speech and image mixtures in different noise levels.	blind signal separation;source separation	Mahdi Khosravy;Mohammad Reza Alsharif;Katsumi Yamashita	2011	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-010-0161-0	speech recognition;artificial intelligence;algorithm;statistics	ML	80.77707360775642	-7.248380898259533	43754

A single neuron was used to implement the dynamic identification of controlled object. Tapped delay links (TDL) were used to input information to neuron. Former information was used to correct the predicted output values of predictor to improve prediction precision. Another neuron was used to implement intelligent adaptive control. Three inputs were constructed similarly to PID control. Gradient descent algorithm was used in modifying weights in the neuron. WorldFIP distributed intelligent measurement and control network based on the proposed algorithm was designed. Architecture and construction of the designed system were expounded. Hardware and software design for measurement node, control node and supervisory node were presented. Simulation research and site practice were done. The proposed SNPIC algorithm and designed control network were easier to be implemented and showed better control effects.	algorithm;artificial neural network;control theory;factory instrumentation protocol;fieldbus;gradient descent;kerrison predictor;neuron;pid;real-time transcription;simulation;software design	Geng Liang	2009	2009 International Asia Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics	10.1109/CAR.2009.85	pid controller;identification;gradient descent;control engineering;control network;algorithm design;predictive analytics;prediction;computer science;software design;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.712756620546514	-9.188867873163003	43798

An application of the coarse-fine robot bracing approach to precision laminate registration and stacking for electronic packaging is presented. Results show that assembly errors of a few pm can be readily obtained, approximately an order of magnitude improvement over the unbraced coarse-fine case, and nearly two orders of magnitude better than those attainable by coarse manipulation alone.	control system;electronic packaging;industrial robot;stacking	Ralph L.

In particular, we employ Lyapunov theory to constrain fuzzy rule consequents for ensuring stability of the designed controller. Proposed fuzzy RL controller employs Lyapunov theory dictated rules for discovering an optimal yet stable control strategy for robotic manipulators. Furthermore, our proposed linguistic RL controller handles payload variations and external disturbances quite effectively. We validate linguistic Lyapunov RL controller on two benchmark control problems: (i) a standard two-link robotic arm manipulator, and (ii) a two link selective compliance assembly robotic arm (SCARA). Simulation results and comparison against (a) baseline fuzzy Q learning (FQL) controller, and (b) a recently proposed Lyapunov theory based Markov game controller showcases our controlleru0027s superior tracking performance and lower computational complexity.

In this method, parameter estimation can be facilitated without disturbing the model error or operating state. To achieve this goal, three important elements, namely observation, action, and reward, are appropriately designed. To improve the robustness and accelerate the convergence, a new concept, denoted as Q-sensitivity, is proposed and investigated in detail. The experimental results show that a high-Q-sensitivity design can allow the proposed method to obtain a fast and torque-maximized estimation. Results from the comparative studies confirm the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.	algorithm;mathematical induction;q-learning	Xing Qi	2018	Eng.

We derive decentralized controllers that allow the robots to converge to a given curve S and spread along this curve. We consider implicit functions that are weighted sums of radial basis functions created by interpolating from a set of constraint points, which give us a high degree of control over the desired 2D curves. We describe the generation of simple plans for swarms of robots using these functions and illustrate our approach through simulations and real experiments.	converge;experiment;interpolation;radial (radio);radial basis function;robot;sensor;simulation;swarm	Luiz Chaimowicz;Nathan Michael;Vijay Kumar	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570486	robust control;control engineering;motion control;computer vision;radial basis function;shape;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;motion planning;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	59.26897579529815	-21.301907816436156	43998

Instead of using standard Lyapunov functions, we explicitly search for ISS Lyapunov functions of the estimation error with respect to the external disturbances that act on the system and measurement equations. First, the use of ISS is motivated when dealing with the design of observers for quite a general class of nonlinear systems. Second, high-gain observers are investigated by providing conditions that ensure ISS as well as a given attenuation with respect to the noises in terms of L2-gain. Third, an adaptive high-gain observer is proposed with such stability properties, which can be taken into account for the purpose of design by using linear matrix inequalities.	control theory;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Angelo Alessandri	2013	2013 American Control Conference		control engineering;mathematical optimization;stability;lyapunov function;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign;estimation theory;statistics	Robotics	66.96715678282725	-1.8503865778340691	44011

The optimal sensor scheduling problem can be posed as a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) whose solution is given by an Information Space (I-space) Dynamic Programming (DP) problem. We present a simulation based stochastic optimization technique that, combined with a receding horizon approach, obviates the need to solve the computationally intractable I-space DP problem. The technique is tested on a simple sensor scheduling problem where a sensor has to choose among the measurements of N dynamical systems such that the information regarding the aggregate system is maximized over an infinite horizon.	aggregate data;computational complexity theory;distributed control system;dynamic programming;dynamical system;gain;markov chain;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;partially observable markov decision process;recueil des historiens des croisades;scheduling (computing);scheduling - hl7 publishing domain;sensor;simulation;stochastic gradient descent;stochastic optimization	Suman Chakravorty;Richard Scott Erwin	2011	2011 IEEE Symposium on Adaptive Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning (ADPRL)	10.1109/ADPRL.2011.5967362	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory	Embedded	59.520241481697234	1.3286607677437798	44016
ce1fa7468ac15834776cfac67c8b6b259008c86e	using a nonlinear mechanical control coupling metric for biped robot control and design		This paper uses results from geometric mechanics and control to determine the degree of coupling between actuated and unactuated degrees of freedom in a two-link biped robot. By comparing the degree of coupling when ankle actuation is used and when hip actuation is used, it is clear that ankle actuation affords stronger dynamic coupling and hence, may provide a superior means for control design for robust gait and posture control. This is true both in the case where the robot is configured as a bipedal walker and the case where it is configured to model posture control. In the case of posture control, these results are consistent with some literature on the means by which humans maintain posture.	amiga walker;geometric mechanics;nonlinear system;poor posture;robot control	Tan Chen;Xiangyu Ni;James P.

With the new method, the requirement of an optimal path and the need of a slim motion due to the lack of free space can be compromised. The generated slim motion is suitable for applications where human-robot cooperation takes place and the workspace is considered to be constrained. This new method is based on the synchronized links motion with a constant ratio of the link angle positions. The proof that any PTP motion can be carried out under this constraint will be provided. The new method of synchronized motion will be illustrated at hand of some examples and compared with conventional methods.	motion compensation;motion planning;picture transfer protocol;point-to-point protocol;robot;workspace	Amr A.

8fcdd674bdd5486ece8d12fbf4c7d6d1fc3cd1a0	synchronization of nonlinearly and stochastically coupled markovian switching networks via event-triggered sampling		This paper studies the exponential synchronization problem for a new array of nonlinearly and stochastically coupled networks via events-triggered sampling (ETS) by self-adaptive learning. The networks include the following features: 1) a Bernoulli stochastic variable is introduced to describe the random structural coupling; 2) a stochastic variable with positive mean is used to model the coupling strength; and 3) a continuous time homogeneous Markov chain is employed to characterize the dynamical switching of the coupling structure and pinned node sets. The proposed network model is capable to capture various stochastic effect of an external environment during the network operations. In order to reduce networks’ workload, different ETS strategies for network self-adaptive learning are proposed under continuous and discrete monitoring, respectively. Based on these ETS approaches, several sufficient conditions for synchronization are derived by employing stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions, the properties of stochastic processes, and some linear matrix inequalities. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results and the superiority of the proposed ETS approach.	anatomic node;bernoulli polynomials;cd45 negative events:num:pt:xxx:qn;computational fluid dynamics;coupling constant;dynamical system;dynamical systems theory;enterprise test software;execution;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;network model;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;polynomial;sampling (signal processing);simulation;stochastic processes;stochastic process;synchronization (computer science);exponential	Hailing Dong;Jiamu Zhou;Bingchang Wang;Mingqing Xiao	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2812102	artificial intelligence;mathematical optimization;machine learning;complex network;network model;matrix (mathematics);synchronization;stochastic process;random variable;markov process;computer science;markov chain	ML	67.34083548025339	3.1920355050953924	44149

This approach gives control engineers greater flexibility to select a controller that matches their specifications. Furthermore, for a given controller it is simple to analyze the tradeoff achieved between conflicting objectives. By using the multi-objective design technique it is also possible to perform a global comparison between different control strategies in a simple and robust way. This approach thereby enables an analysis to be made of whether a preference for a certain control technique is justified. This proposal is evaluated and validated in a nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output system using two control strategies: a classical proportional-integral-derivative control scheme and a feedback state controller.	algorithm;diagram;download;holism;linear model;mimo;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system;optimizing compiler;pid;pareto efficiency;process modeling;robust control;simulation;simulink;software design pattern;state space	Gilberto Reynoso-Meza;Sergio García-Nieto;Javier Sanchis;Xavier Blasco Ferragud	2013	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2012.2185698	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;multi-objective optimization;evolutionary algorithm;control theory;feedback	SE	60.95724606264933	-6.379751699581944	44206
d7ca2b92879215fbb112dd4ca3a44c1990cd37d9	elastic structure preserving (esp) control for compliantly actuated robots		Physical compliance can be considered one of the key technical properties a robot should exhibit to increase its mechanical robustness. In addition, the accompanying temporal energy-storing capabilities enable explosive and energy efficient cyclic motions. But these advantages come at a price, as compliance introduces unwanted intrinsic oscillatory dynamics, underactuation, and reduces the natural frequency of the plant. These aspects make control of the link configuration variables a challenging task. This paper presents two novel control methods for implementing link-side motion tracking capabilities and injecting a desired damping characteristic to suppress link vibrations along the reference trajectory for compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear elastic characteristics. We prove their uniform global asymptotic stability by invoking a theorem by Matrosov. Both approaches, namely elastic structure preserving (ESP) and ESP+, have in common that they preserve the link-side inertial properties and the elastic structure of the original plant dynamics, hence the name ESP control. Apart from that, ESP control focuses on preserving the inertial properties of motor dynamics. While ESP+ control aims at minimizing the dynamic shaping on the motor side. The performance of the feedback control laws have been evaluated on the Hand Arm System from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), a variable stiffness robot arm, where the stiffness in each of its joints is highly nonlinear. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated tracking controller for compliantly actuated, multijoint robots with nonlinear elastic elements.	dynamic language runtime;experiment;feedback;noise shaping;nonlinear system;robot;robotic arm;underactuation	Manuel Keppler;Dominic Lakatos;Christian Ott;Alin Albu-Sch&#x00E4;ffer	2018	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2017.2776314	robustness (computer science);control theory;inertial frame of reference;natural frequency;control theory;control engineering;underactuation;nonlinear system;mathematics;robotic arm;vibration	Robotics	67.64288899910895	-17.481057595395516	44228

Thus, we propose a simulation technique to predict the success of a compliant gripper grasping irregular objects, which could be used in mechanism design as well as grasp planning. The simulator we propose integrates joint compliance simulation with a Boundary Layer Expanded Mesh (BLEM) technique to enhance the stability of contact estimation. We compare the proposed simulator with existing simulators via a set of stability and fidelity criteria, including contact force variation, contact position variation, and contact normal variation. Scores along these criteria are correlated with the simulator's accuracy of predicting the success/failure of a given grasp pose and preshape. A test set of 13 grasps, with two compliant underactuated hands were manually generated on 4 objects. Experiments suggest that our simulator leads to improvements in the stability criteria, predictability of grasp success, and reduction of simulation artifacts.	algorithm;computer hardware;experiment;hands-on computing;integrated information theory;pose (computer vision);robot end effector;robotics;simulation;test set;underactuation	Alessio Rocchi;Barrett Ames;Zhi Li;Kris Hauser	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487699	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.0447838976224	-19.692304966928546	44236

The vehicles are required to converge to a formation on the circle, expressed by desired separations and ordering of the unicycles. The information exchange between unicycles is modelled by a directed graph which is assumed to have a spanning tree. A hierarchical approach is proposed which simplifies the control design by decoupling the problem of making the unicycles converge to a common circle from the problem of stabilizing the formation.	control engineering;converge;coupling (computer programming);directed graph;distributed control system;file spanning;information exchange;initial condition;optimal control;spanning tree;stationary process;the circle (file system)	Mohamed I.

The dynamics of the Stewart platform driven by voice coil actuators is derived by the Newton-Euler method. The influence factors of vibration isolation are taken into account, such as the nonlinear characteristics of the dynamic model, the parameter perturbation and the unmodeled dynamics, etc. The favorable feature of the proposed controller is that it is not necessary for the upper bound of the unmatched uncertainties to be known in advance. A tuning rule is designed to deal with the estimation problem of the uncertainties. The uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the controller is demonstrated by applying the Lyapunov approach and a UUB lemma. The simulation results illustrate that the controller can effectively attenuate low frequency vibrations in all six degrees of freedom (DOFs) and the satisfactory vibration isolation performance can be achieved.	estimation theory;euler method;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;newton;nonlinear system;requirement;robust control;simulation;six degrees of separation;voice coil	Tao Yang;Jia Ma;Zeng-Guang Hou;Fengshui Jing;Min Tan	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913147	robust control;control engineering;payload;electronic engineering;uncertainty;computer science;engineering;voice coil;vibration;control theory;vibration isolation;newton's method;low frequency;degrees of freedom;upper and lower bounds;stewart platform;robustness	Robotics	67.98662443767579	-11.880258418837128	44379

A posture is robust if the contacts can passively support the mechanism against gravity as well as disturbance forces generated by moving limbs of the mechanism. This paper is concerned with identifying and computing robust postures of planar mechanisms supported by frictional contacts in two-dimensional gravitational environments. The complex kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body B having the same contacts with the environment and a variable center of mass. Inertial forces generated by moving parts of the mechanism are lumped into a neighborhood of wrenches centered at the nominal gravitational wrench. The robust equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts become the center-of-mass locations of B that maintain equilibrium with respect to all wrenches in the given neighborhood. The paper formulates the set of robust center-of-mass locations as a linear programming problem. It provides a graphical characterization of the robust center-ofmass locations, and gives a geometric algorithm for computing these center-of-mass locations. The paper reports experiments validating the equilibrium criterion on a 2-legged prototype. Finally, it describes initial progress associated with computation of robust equilibrium postures in three-dimensions.	algorithm;computation;experiment;graphical user interface;linear programming;poor posture;prototype;robustness (computer science)	Yizhar Or;Elon D.

This is due the fact that ILC does not depend on physical model of the system. In the application of ILC in automotive industry, the restriction is that these methods calculate the input value and the tuning of an available controller with fixed structure is not possible. To solve this problem a method is proposed in this paper which consists of two main steps: the first step is the calculation of an input variable, based on an ILC algorithm, and the second step is the optimization of the given parameters of the feedforward controller. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are shown with experiments on a test vehicle with an one stage turbocharged gasoline motor with wastegate.	algorithm;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;iteration;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;nonlinear system;parameter (computer programming);self-tuning;system camera	René Noack;Torsten Jeinsch;Adel Haghani;Nick Weinhold	2014	2014 19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2014.6957466	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory	Robotics	61.61518183623637	-10.62621925203855	44480

A fuzzy observer is first developed to estimate the vehicle sideslip angle as well as the roll parameters using the yaw rate measurement, while taking into account the road bank angle and the unmeasurable premise variables of the TS model. The objective of this study is the design of an observer-based controller to improve the stability and vehicle safety with perturbations related to the nonlinearities of the contact forces, the variations of the adhesion coefficients, the road bank angle.

As such, a feedback controller is often designed in the continuous-time domain and then discretized for digital implementation. It is important for the discretization step involved to yield an SD approximation which captures the essential features of the original controller from the perspective of closed-loop behavior. In this note, a gap metric framework is developed for studying the controller discretization problem for linear time-invariant (LTI) plants and controllers. Importantly, knowledge of a gap metric distance between an LTI controller and an SD approximation permits explicit characterization of the possible difference in closed-loop performance, with any LTI plant for which the LTI controller is known to work well, accounting for intersample behavior. The central result of the new framework gives rise to an algorithm for computing a gap metric measure of the distance between an LTI controller and a given discretization, and a technique for synthesising a SD approximation which is optimal with respect to this metric.	algorithm;approximation;control theory;discretization;linear time-invariant theory;time complexity;time-invariant system	Michael Cantoni;Glenn Vinnicombe	2004	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2004.837543	control engineering;real-time computing;lti system theory;control theory;mathematics	Theory	70.4334909845139	-2.9048518368917104	44559

Update laws for both the non-linear and the linear dynamical systems have been derived for the domain of dynamic blind source recovery along both ordinary stochastic gradient and the Riemannian contra-variant gradient directions. The choice of the rich state space demixing network structure allows for the development of potent learning rules, capable of handling most filtering paradigms and convenient extension to non-linear models. Some particular filtering cases are subsequently derived from this general structure and are compared with material in the recent literature. Some of this reported work has also been implemented in dedicated hardware/software. An illustrative simulation example has been presented to demonstrate the online adaptation capabilities of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;constrained optimization;dynamical system;feedforward neural network;finite impulse response;gradient;ibm notes;infinite impulse response;information geometry;kullback–leibler divergence;linear model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;simulation;state space;stochastic process;transfer function	Fathi M.

The principle has been established, providing that the state just after heel-strike exists at the next step. However, this condition may not always hold. The passive walker with knees can execute the leg-swing motion with no control, only by gravity effect. Unfortunately, while the walker takes a step forward, the swing leg may strike its toe on the slope at unsuitable point. Therefore, understanding of the mechanism of leg-swing motion is very important for assuring the next step. In this paper, we focus on the leg-swing motion of passive walking, and demonstrate the mechanism of the flexion and extension of knee joint of swing leg.	amiga walker;desert strike: return to the gulf;fixed point (mathematics);swing (java)	Yoshito Ikemata;Kiyoshi Yasuhara;Akihito Sano;Hideo Fujimoto	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543428	robot;control engineering;motion control;simulation;gravity;stability;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;control theory;fixed point	Robotics	65.41645417285964	-20.21155904544637	44695

A regenerative controller must satisfy the constraint that, on average, more energy is extracted from the network than injected. We consider the multi-objective LQG optimization of such a regenerative control law, which exhibits performance robustness over the polytopic uncertainty domain. It is shown that, although the presence of uncertainty makes the optimal control problem nonconvex, an efficient numerical algorithm can be used to arrive at an optimal controller. The algorithm makes use of convex over-bounding Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) techniques. The concepts are demonstrated by an example pertaining to structural vibration suppression.	algorithm;convex hull;convex optimization;initial condition;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;spectral density;stationary process;stochastic process;the matrix;zero suppression	E.

Any small imprecision may lead the fingers to close too abruptly and let the object fly away from the hand before closing. We present a strategy to overcome for sensorimotor imprecision by introducing softness in the catching approach. Soft catching consists of having the robot moves with the object for a short period of time, so as to leave more time for the fingers to close on the object. We use a dynamic system-based control law to generate the appropriate reach and follow motion, which is expressed as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. We propose a method to approximate the parameters of LPV systems using Gaussian mixture models, based on a set of kinematically feasible demonstrations generated by an offline optimal control framework. We show theoretically that the resulting DS will intercept the object at the intercept point, at the right time with the desired velocity direction. Stability and convergence of the approach are assessed through Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed method is validated systematically to catch three objects that generate elastic contacts and demonstrate important improvement over a hard catching approach.	approximation algorithm;closing (morphology);dynamical system;experiment;lyapunov fractal;mixture model;online and offline;optimal control;robot;velocity (software development);visual intercept	Seyed Sina Mirrazavi Salehian;Mahdi Khoramshahi;Aude Billard	2016	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2016.2536749	planning;control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;optimal control;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;tracking	Robotics	62.70755327911356	-22.986305835477953	44741

Research on the basic mechanics and control principles of hand's dexterous manipulation abilities is one of the most important subjects in biomimetics. In this paper, by considering the multicontact manipulation problem as a hybrid one, we propose a modeling framework which encapsulates switching between phases of continuous motion. The presentation is illustrated by a typical example, multicontact whole finger manipulation problem, where in addition to the continuous part the event driven component should be carefully designed. We first formulates the robot hand subject to unilateral constraints into a general dynamic complementarity (DC) system expression, then transform DC system to a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) model. Based on the derived MLD model dexterous finger manipulation can be realized via mixed integer quadric programming (MIQP) algorithm. Further more, MLD model can be expected for subsequent stability and control studies, which is still missing in the field of multicontact robot system design by taking into account the whole hybrid dynamics	algorithm;biomimetics;complementarity theory;hybrid system;interaction;robot;systems design	Yingjie Yin;Takayuki Sugimoto;Shigeyuki Hosoe;Fumihiko Asano;Zhiwei Luo	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2004.1521760	biomimetics;control engineering;simulation;integer programming;computer science;engineering;control theory;hybrid system;systems design	Robotics	67.80535409582636	-22.053081249500394	44744

Degradation leads to a loss of capacity and a higher series resistance. One possibility to determine the state of health is the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ac resistance is therefore measured for a set of different frequencies. Previous approaches match the measured impedances with a nonlinear equivalent circuit, which needs a lot of time to solve a nonlinear least squares problem. This paper combines the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with neural networks to directly model the state of health in order to speed up the estimation. Zinc air batteries are exemplary used as energy storage, as other problems exists, that can be solved by impedance measurements. Optimizing a cost function is used to determine the fastest combination of examined frequencies.	neural networks;state of health	Andre Loechte;Daniel Heming;Klaus T.

FOPI controllers' parameters involve proportionality constant, integral constant and integral order, and hence its design is more intricate than that of usual integral-order proportional-integral controller. Here the synthesis of controller is done according to the objective function considered. In order to digitally realize the fractional order PI controller, an Oustaloup approximation method is used. Simulations and comparisons of proposed HD-ABCA with conventional methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, especially for actuating fractional order plants.	approximation;artificial bee colony algorithm;computer simulation;differential evolution;loss function;optimization problem;surface-mount technology	Anguluri Rajasekhar;Millie Pant;Ajith Abraham	2011	2011 Third World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing	10.1109/NaBIC.2011.6089408	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Logic	60.44444580040455	-6.822306963858881	44794

The proposed control law based on the sliding-mode controller can guarantee both homogeneous and heterogeneous string stability, if the control parameters and system parameters meet certain requirements. The analysis of the negative effect of the parasitic time delays and lags on the string stability indicates that the negative effect of the time delays is larger than that of the time lags. This paper provides a practical means to evaluate the ACC systems applying the sliding-mode controller and provides a reasonable proposal to design the ACC controller from the perspective of the practical string stability.	broadcast delay;optimal control;requirement;sensor;time complexity	Lingyun Xiao;Feng Gao	2011	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2011.2143407	control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;vehicle dynamics;simulation;stability;adaptive control;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Embedded	66.08918750519767	-9.477519210003276	44895

The approach consists in translating state and input constraints into a constraint on the value of the Lyapunov function which is then enforced by suitably manipulating the derivative of the applied reference. This paper extends the Explicit Reference Governor approach by addressing its robustness in the presence of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. Using ISS arguments, it will be shown that the robustness with respect to external disturbances can be ensured by simply restricting the domain of the applied reference. Parametric uncertainties can instead be accounted for using suitable bounds on the Lyapunov function.

The technique builds on the robust-safe-but-knowledgeable (RSBK) algorithm, which is developed in this paper for the multivehicle case. RSBK uses constraint tightening to achieve robustness to external disturbances, an invariant set to ensure safety in the presence of changes to the environment, and a cost-to-go function to generate an intelligent trajectory around known obstacles. The key advantage of this RSBK algorithm is that it enables the use of much shorter planning horizons while still preserving the robust feasibility guarantees of previously proposed approaches. The second contribution of this paper is a distributed version of the RSBK algorithm, which is more suitable for real-time execution. In the distributed RSBK (DRSBK) algorithm, each vehicle only optimizes for its own decisions by solving a subproblem of reduced size, which results in shorter computation times. Furthermore, the algorithm retains the robust feasibility guarantees of the centralized approach while requiring that each agent only have local knowledge of the environment and neighbor vehicles' plans. This new approach also facilitates the use of a significantly more general implementation architecture for the distributed trajectory optimization, which further decreases the delay due to computation time.	algorithm;centralized computing;computation;experiment;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;real-time clock;simulation;time complexity;trajectory optimization	Yoshiaki Kuwata;Arthur Richards;Tom Schouwenaars;Jonathan P.

The neurocontroller design uses the novel optimization neuro-dynamic programming algorithm based on dual heuristic programming (DHP), which has the most robust control capability among the adaptive critic designs family. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used as the function approximator to implement the DHP technique. The DHP based optimal neurocontroller (DHPNC) using the RBFNN shows improved dynamic damping compared to the CONVC even when a power system stabilizer is added. Also, the DHPNC provides a robust feedback loop in real-time operation without the need for continual on-line training, thus reducing any risk of possible instability associated with the neural network based controllers. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The dynamic behavior of such systems can assume very complex forms inducing complex dynamics that are challenging to observe and control. This is mainly due to noisy data received from the environment in which they evolve, data that has to be fed back to their decision support. These closed and endless feedback loops are prone to error if not dealt with in an appropriate manner. The nonlinearity of circular causation and feedback effects of such phenomenon creates an environment where some models, driven by practicality concerns, resort to simplification strategies that ignore important feedback relationships, but make the decision problem more tractable. Even so, the non-smooth dynamics of such systems makes stability analysis difficult. The consequence hereof is the existence of models that are constrained to the brink of loosing their true purpose. In this paper, we present a cross-fertilization approach using tools from physics and biology to show how one can practically approach the stability analysis of such systems.	causality;cobham's thesis;complex dynamics;decision problem;decision support system;distributed computing;dynamical system;feedback;intelligent agent;nonlinear system;numerical stability;randomness;run time (program lifecycle phase);signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;system configuration;temporal logic;text simplification	Alain Gaetan Njimolu Anyouzoa;Filip Perich;Aloys Mbala;Theo D'Hondt	2005	IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology	10.1109/IAT.2005.111	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations management	Robotics	58.11481067660012	0.9751634532545028	45067

In multi-robots systems, the path planning problem is based on cooperation. In such systems, the robots dynamically exchange roles in order to complete complex tasks, such as moving in different formations. In this paper, a Cellular Automaton algorithm for solving the path planning problem in a multi-agent system is presented. Moreover, robots must cooperate to keep their initial formation if an unexpected event in the environment takes place. The proposed method was implemented in a real time system of three autonomous mobile robots. Simulation results and the results obtained from this system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and its robustness.	algorithm;autonomous robot;cellular automaton;mobile robot;motion planning;multi-agent system;robustness (computer science);simulation	Konstantinos Ioannidis;Georgios Ch.

A dynamic model of the manipulator during noncontact and contact motion is developed. This model includes the effect of the inevitable collision that occurs between the manipulator end effector and the work environment during the transition from noncontact to contact motion. The work environment that the manipulator comes into contact with is modeled as a very still surface. The dynamic model of the robot during this transition is transformed through a nonlinear coordinate transformation into a new set of generalized coordinates in which the form of the dynamics is greatly simplified. A discontinuous control is proposed for the robotic manipulator system. It is shown that with this discontinuous control applied to the system, the closed-loop system can be treated as a generalized dynamical system. Using the theory associated with generalized dynamical systems, it is possible to extend Lyapunov stability analysis to systems with discontinuous controls. The system dynamics is written as a contingent equation to which a set valued control function is applied. Within this mathematical framework, the uniform asymptotic stability in the larger of the closed-loop systems is proved. The controller has several desirable properties, including the ability to return to contact motion if the manipulator end effector inadvertently leaves the surface due to some external disturbance acting on the system. >		James K.

3b57d69c1ac5332c44b56ab1fbb5385df71d27a5	cooperative collision avoidance for nonholonomic robots		In this paper, we present a method, namely $\epsilon$ CCA, for collision avoidance in dynamic environments among interacting agents, such as other robots or humans. Given a preferred motion by a global planner or driver, the method computes a collision-free local motion for a short time horizon, which respects the actuator constraints and allows for smooth and safe control. The method builds on the concept of reciprocal velocity obstacles and extends it to respect the kinodynamic constraints of the robot and account for a grid-based map representation of the environment. The method is best suited for large multirobot settings, including heterogeneous teams of robots, in which computational complexity is of paramount importance and the robots interact with one another. In particular, we consider a set of motion primitives for the robot and solve an optimization in the space of control velocities with additional constraints. Additionally, we propose a cooperative approach to compute safe velocity partitions in the distributed case. We describe several instances of the method for distributed and centralized operation and formulated both as convex and nonconvex optimizations. We compare the different variants and describe the benefits and tradeoffs both theoretically and in extensive experiments with various robotic platforms: robotic wheelchairs, robotic boats, humanoid robots, small unicycle robots, and simulated cars.	centralized computing;collision detection;computational complexity theory;convex function;device driver;experiment;humanoid robot;humans;interaction;mathematical optimization;velocity (software development)	Javier Alonso-Mora;Paul A.

A novel LMI-based stability criterion is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of stochastic cellular neural networks with multiple time-varying delays which are represented by T–S fuzzy models. In order to derive delay-dependent stability conditions, free-weighting matrices method has been introduced, which may develop less-conservative results. In fact, these techniques lead to generalized and less-conservative stability condition that guarantee the wide stability region. Our results can be specialized to several cases including those studied extensively in the literature. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and conservativeness of our results. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

d7762731c57884494c5a27679a21157a2b86ad48	an optimal controller design for cps with stochastic time delay		Since Cyber-Physical System(CPS) is defined as integrations of computation, communication and control to physical processes, the communication plays an important role in such system. Compared with the traditional control system, the control in CPS is very difficult because the communication networks inevitably introduce variable time delays and possible lost of samples. In Networked Control System(NCS), there are some related works to discuss the problem of time delay. However it still needs to evaluate and improve those existing schemes in CPS. In this paper, a novel dynamic timeout scheme and actuator compensation by using a hidden Markov model for the time delay to reduce the influence of random time delays has been proposed. Simulation results on TrueTime 2.0 demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this networked real-time control strategy.	broadcast delay;computation;control system;control theory;hidden markov model;markov chain;optimal control;real-time clock;simulation;telecommunications network	Leilei Lou;Xu Zhang;Dongbin Wang	2016	2016 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN)	10.1109/MSN.2016.061	control theory;distributed computing;telecommunications network;networked control system;timeout;hidden markov model;computer science;real-time computing;computation;markov process;control system	Robotics	65.76891622271576	1.8353792771009918	45500

In reality, injectors do vary and age. To contain variations around a nominal value, tight tolerances are imposed on the manufacturing process. Even if the manufacturing process is tightly controlled, the air-to-fuel ratio needed to satisfy emission constraints is difficult to achieve due to aging and even slight mismatch among different injectors. To devise control policies that take into account behavior differences among injectors, we need to estimate injector characteristics from measurements that are taken on the engine during its life time. In this paper, we present an estimation technique for injector characteristics based on a set of measurements that can be carried out using the sensors present in the car, i.e., intake manifold pressure, crank-shaft speed, throttle-valve plate angle, injection timings and exhaust air-to-fuel ratio, which is measured by a single UEGO sensor placed at the exhaust pipe output.	apache spark;crank (person);cylinder seal;sensor	Luca Benvenuti;Maria Domenica Di Benedetto;Stefano Di Gennaro;Alberto L.

An optimum design of variable input speed for the cam mechanism is aimed at improving the kinematic performance of the traditional cam mechanism by reducing the peak angular acceleration and angular jerk. The transfer functions of cam mechanisms with variable input velocity, the normalized displacement, angular velocity and acceleration and jerk of the followers corresponding to the normalized time, are firstly inferred in this paper. The B-spline curve, as the uniform mathematics expression, can be differently shaped depending on its control points. So speed function is described as a non-uniform B-spline curve and therefore, the corresponding control points are considered as the design variables. The method to confirm the knot vector is discussed. The kinematic optimization of variable-speed cam mechanisms and its constraints are then developed. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the proposed method and also to show its feasibility and validity.	angularjs;b-spline;displacement mapping;mathematical optimization;optimal design;spline (mathematics);transfer function;velocity (software development)	Rongyu Ge;Yunfeng Du	2016	2016 International Conference on Cybernetics, Robotics and Control (CRC)	10.1109/CRC.2016.021	control engineering;simulation;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	68.70094490714295	-17.468178188884934	45574

Unfortunately, not all of these values can be determined analytically nor can they be obtained from simple measurements. Established experiments for inertial parameters estimation have been applied to serial and parallel rigid-link manipulators, yet in very few cases to cable-driven parallel robots. Due to their kinematic properties and their unique setup, cable robots are more sensitive to incorrect estimates of the inertial parameters making it important to obtain such quantities through experiments. In this work, we assess the topic of inertial parameter identification of a parallel flexible-link manipulator exemplified by the suspended cable-driven parallel robot CoGIRo. Identification equations are derived from Newton-Euler equations of motion of an arbitrary point fixed to a rigid-body. Laboratory experiments for identification of the inertial parameters are then introduced and results are presented. Within the limitations of the sensors and data acquisition methods, reasonable results have been obtained, thereby validating the procedure for suspended cable-driven parallel robots.	control system;control theory;data acquisition;estimation theory;euler;experiment;newton;parallel manipulator;robot;sensor;serial port	Philipp Tempel;Pierre-Elie Herve;Olivier Tempier;Marc Gouttefarde;Andreas Pott	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989723	robot;control engineering;control theory;equations of motion;inertial frame of reference;manipulator;parallel manipulator;kinematics;data acquisition;computer science;control system	Robotics	70.75916665764089	-19.824180429488163	45629
3944269cb739faeea53a5578f78caf130597ee3a	theoretical guarantees for the design of near globally optimal static distributed controllers		This paper is concerned with the optimal distributed control problem for linear discrete-time deterministic and stochastic systems. The objective is to design a stabilizing static distributed controller whose performance is close to that of the optimal centralized controller (if such controller exists). In our previous work, we have developed a computational framework to transform centralized controllers into distributed ones for deterministic systems. By building on this result, we derive strong theoretical lower bounds on the optimality guarantee of the designed distributed controllers and show that the proposed mathematical framework indirectly maximizes the derived lower bound while striving to achieve a closed-loop stability. Furthermore, we extend the proposed design method to stochastic systems that are subject to input disturbance and measurement noise.

This problem is generally ill-posed since signal identifiability is a key concern, and there have been efforts to use sparse models for regularizing blind deconvolution to promote signal identifiability. The identifiability of the sparse blind deconvolution problem is analyzed herein under assumptions of geometric decay of the channel and canonical sparsity of the source, and the ill-posedness is quantified by lower bounding the Hausdorff dimension of the unidentifiable signal set. The approach involves lifting the deconvolution problem into a rank one matrix recovery problem and analyzing the rank two null space of the resultant linear operator. An important conclusion of the paper is that the structural restriction of geometric decay of the channel vector with canonical sparsity of the source, occurring naturally in multi-hop channel estimation, is insufficient for signal identifiability in blind deconvolution, even if the canonical-sparse support is known.	blind deconvolution;channel state information;complexity of constraint satisfaction;convergence insufficiency;hausdorff dimension;image processing;kernel (linear algebra);lifting scheme;nonlinear system;resultant;sparse matrix;well-posed problem	Sunav Choudhary;Urbashi Mitra	2014	2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032160	mathematical optimization;deconvolution;blind equalization;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind deconvolution;statistics;wiener deconvolution	ML	80.89647933111908	-4.920481742452959	45712

The consequence parameters of the fuzzy control rules are adjusted online by applying the Lyapunov stability condition. Furthermore, parameters tuning is carried out in order to guarantee the sliding condition. Comparison between zero order and first order Sugeno model are presented. Moreover, a time-varying sliding surface is used with the aim of enhancing tracking-performance. Indeed, moving sliding surface improves the robustness during the reaching phase against uncertainties, parameter variations and extraneous disturbances. As an illustration, the trajectory control of a two degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator is considered.

In this paper, recent developments in inferential control are utilized to arrive at control structures suited for inferential ILC. The proposed frameworks extend earlier results and encompass various controller structures.

59a55ab1d9d007ca4b597b160186391063aa2e21	special issue on time-delay systems	time delay system	Time-delay often appears in many control systems (such as aircraft, chemical or process control systems) either in the state, the control input, or the measurements. Unlike ordinary differential equations, delay systems are infinite dimensional in nature and time-delay is, in many cases, a source of instability. The stability issue and the performance of control systems with delay are, therefore, both of theoretical and practical importance. Delay equations were first considered in the literature in the XVIII century (e.g. the works of Bernoulli, Euler or Condorcet). A systematic study of such equations began in the 20’s of the XX century by V. Volterra, and in the end of 40’s of the same century by A. Myshkis and R. Bellman. Lyapunov’s second method for the stability of delay systems was developed at the end of 50’s by N. Krasovskii who introduced Lyapunov functionals and by B. Razumikhin who formulated the appropriate Lyapunov functions. Since 1950s, the subject of delay systems or functional differential equations has received a great deal of attention in Mathematics, Biology and Control Engineering. Over the past decade, much effort has been invested in the analysis and synthesis of uncertain systems with time-delay. Based on the Lyapunov theory of stability, various results have been obtained that provide, for example, finite-dimensional sufficient conditions for stability and stabilization. Departing from the classical linear finite-dimensional techniques which apply Smith predictor type designs, the new methods simultaneously allow for delays in the state equations and for uncertainties in both the system parameters and the time delays. During the early stages, delay-independent results were obtained which guarantee stability and prescribed performance levels of the resulting solutions. Recently, delay-dependent results have been derived that considerably reduce the overdesign entailed in the delay-independent solutions. In the present issue, new results are obtained for various control and identification problems for delay systems. These results are based either on Lyapunov methods or on frequency domain considerations. The nine papers included in this issue have been written by prominent specialists in the field of Systems and Control who have touched upon a variety of control and stability problems for linear and nonlinear systems with delay. Lyapunov-based stability methods for different classes of linear delay equations, either continuous or discrete time (difference equations), are presented in the first three papers:	control engineering;control system;euler;euler–bernoulli beam theory;instability;kerrison predictor;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;recurrence relation;smith predictor	Emilia Fridman;Silviu-Iulian Niculescu;Vladimir Rasvan	2010	IMA J.

We collect static data under different temperature points using a MEMS-based inertial sensor mounted inside a thermal chamber. Rigorous stochastic models, namely Autoregressive-based Gauss-Markov (AR-based GM) models are developed to describe the random error behaviour. The proposed AR-based GM model is initially applied to short stationary inertial data to develop the stochastic model parameters (correlation times). It is shown that the stochastic model parameters of a MEMS-based inertial unit, namely the ADIS16364, are temperature dependent. In addition, field kinematic test data collected at about 17 °C are used to test the performance of the stochastic models at different temperature points in the filtering stage using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). It is shown that the stochastic model developed at 20 °C provides a more accurate inertial navigation solution than the ones obtained from the stochastic models developed at -40 °C, -20 °C, 0 °C, +40 °C, and +60 °C. The temperature dependence of the stochastic model is significant and should be considered at all times to obtain optimal navigation solution for MEMS-based INS/GPS integration.	autoregressive model;gauss;gentamicins;global positioning system;inertial navigation system;kalman filter;markov chain;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;stationary process;stochastic modelling (insurance);stochastic process;test data	Mohammed El-Diasty;Spiros Pagiatakis	2009		10.3390/s91108473	simulation;temperature;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;stochastic modelling;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;autoregressive model;physics;statistics	Robotics	78.57586921395713	-16.544145465135568	45735

The algorithms are derived from the prediction-correction methodology, which corresponds to a strategy where the time-varying problem is sampled at discrete time instances, and then, a sequence is generated via alternatively executing predictions on how the optimizers at the next time sample are changing and corrections on how they actually have changed. Prediction is based on how the optimality conditions evolve in time, while correction is based on a gradient or Newton method, leading to decentralized prediction-correction gradient and decentralized prediction-correction Newton. We extend these methods to cases where the knowledge on how the optimization programs are changing in time is only approximate and propose decentralized approximate prediction-correction gradient and decentralized approximate prediction-correction Newton. Convergence properties of all the proposed methods are studied and empirical performance is shown on an application of a resource allocation problem in a wireless network. We observe that the proposed methods outperform existing running algorithms by orders of magnitude. The numerical results showcase a tradeoff between convergence accuracy, sampling period, and network communications.	approximation algorithm;convex optimization;gradient;mathematical optimization;newton;newton's method;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing)	Andrea Simonetto;Alec Koppel;Aryan Mokhtari;Geert Leus;Alejandro R.

We demonstrate that a set of fuzzy control rules with singleton consequent can be derived systematically, rather than heuristically from perception-based information using the constrained fuzzy arithmetic. The stability of the devised singleton fuzzy controller can be guaranteed by means of fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis that gives a linguistic description on the plant and the control objective. Furthermore, we also show that some deficiencies of the standard fuzzy arithmetic in fuzzy controller design can be overcome by the constrained fuzzy arithmetic which takes all available information into consideration. The performance and applicability of the proposed method are illustrated through the practical implementation of fuzzy control of an autonomous pole-balancing mobile robot.	lyapunov fractal	Changjiu Zhou;Yansheng Yang	2001		10.1109/FUZZ.2001.1008939	mobile robot;fuzzy electronics;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Logic	61.74931337374433	-7.184574649267181	45946

Some impressive initial results have emerged from work focused on generating sufficient lift force for levitation or vertical acceleration [1]; however, effective methods for motion control remain an open problem. In this work, we propose and analyze a simplified approach to the FWMAV maneuvering problem that 1) focuses on motion control and steering in the horizontal plane and 2) employs a wing design that relies on tunable passive dynamics to set the angle of attack. Our simulated experiments with this method demonstrate an exceptional capability in handling pitch tracking and steering maneuvers, even in presence of measurement noise. We compare the performance of our approach with that of another promising technique for steering: the “split cycle” [2]. Simulation results suggest that in our approach, steering maneuvers and planar motion are both faster and smoother. Furthermore, a passive dynamic control approach in FWMAV proves to have considerably lower bandwidth requirements. We will discuss how this is advantageous when designing a real FWMAV.	aerial photography;characteristic impedance;experiment;lift table;pitch detection algorithm;requirement;simulation;steering wheel	Hosein Mahjoubi;Katie Byl	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;motion control;mobile robot;simulation;passive dynamics;aerodynamics;steering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;electrical impedance;drag;control theory;microbotics;force	Robotics	65.4710339867551	-20.06573392174186	46031

Robust Principal Component Analysis, whose formulation relies on low-rank plus sparse matrices decomposition, shows an interestingly suitable framework to separate moving objects from the background. The optimization problem is transformed to a sequence of convex programs that minimize the sum of L1-norm and nuclear norm of the two component matrices, which are efficiently resolved by an Augmented Lagrangian Multiplierss based solver. In this paper, we propose two new robust schemas for low rank approximation of numerical matrices. The proposed algorithms allow batch and incremental robust low-rank approximal of matrices used in static and real-time foreground extraction to detect moving objects. Experiments reveal that the proposed method are both deterministic, converge decently and quickly; besides, they achieve an accurate background and foreground separation outcome.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;closed-circuit television;converge;convex optimization;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;real-time clock;robust principal component analysis;solver;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry	Haïfa Nakouri;Mhamed-Ali El-Aroui;Mohamed Limam	2017	2017 18th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT)	10.1109/PDCAT.2017.00040	real-time computing;mathematical optimization;robustness (computer science);sparse matrix;low-rank approximation;robust principal component analysis;matrix norm;matrix (mathematics);computer science;augmented lagrangian method;optimization problem	Robotics	79.51168335588687	-2.8493383658153153	46194

Based on a design model of the combined master human system with parameter uncertainties and teleoperator optimal transparency conditions, the interaction (communication) channel controllers are derived. One of the interaction channel controllers is then altered to make the teleoperator closed loop meet requirements imposed by the robustness property passivity. Transparency of the teleoperator system is analysed by analysing the gain plots of all the four transfer functions in the H-matrix. The three channel teleoperator is found to have a bandwidth of around 90 rad/sec in the force reflection channel, a small influence on the reflected force from the master velocity for low frequencies, a bandwidth of 150 rad/sec in the forward channel and a slave which is relatively unaffected by external forces. The theoretical results from the stability analysis are verified by experimental results.	telerobotics	H.

It provides an alternative solution to the problem of \(L_2-L_\infty \) filtering for two kinds of network-based linear time-invariant systems. The presented method highlights two features, “plug and play” and “always feasible,” because it is simple and does not need to solve any complex constrained optimization problems. For measurable and unmeasurable system states, two different filter frameworks are presented, respectively. The proposed filtering strategy could guarantee the asymptotic stability of the filtering error system, while ensuring an \(L_2-L_\infty \) performance. At the same time, the relationship between the \(L_2-L_\infty \) disturbance attenuation level bound \(\gamma \) and the maximum time-delay upper limit \(\tau _\mathrm{m}\) is given.

9425af922f97826d57dbb4fa8a501f5547205a65	lexicographic mpc with multiple economic criteria for constrained nonlinear systems		Abstract Many control problems in process systems feature multi-objective optimization problems that involve several and often conflicting objective functions, such as economic profit and environmental concerns. In this paper, we consider a class of multi-objective model predictive control (MO-MPC) problems where nonlinear systems are subject to state and control constraints and multiple economic criteria are conflicting. Using the lexicographic optimization, we propose a prioritized MO-MPC scheme with guaranteed stability for economic optimization. At each sampling time, the MPC action is computed by solving a set of sequentially ordered single objective optimized control problems. Some sufficient conditions are established to ensure recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the MO-MPC in the context of economic criteria optimization. Two examples of multi-objective control of a coupled-tank system and a free-radical polymerization process are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC scheme and to evaluate the performance by some comparison experiments.	lexicographical order;nonlinear system	Defeng He;Shiming Yu;Linlin Ou	2018	J.

7066634209b86de775d7ca557be9c02dbba71422	about one approach to robot control system simulation		Mobile robot onboard equipment functioning is considered. It is shown, that abstract analogue of one equipment unit operation is an ordinary semi-Markov process. This abstraction is insufficient for analytical modeling the mobile robot as a whole, so to simulate synchronized onboard equipment functioning, it is necessary to use more complicated abstraction based on integration of ordinary processes to so-called M-parallel semi-Markov process. For definition of such abstraction notification “functional states” as combinations of structural states is introduced. Method of definition of semi-Markov matrix parameters, such as time of residence in functional states and probabilities of switches from current functional states to neighboring functional states is proposed.

Robust unilateral decoupling requires an actuator to generate an additional front wheel steering angle. However, introducing actuators to closed loop systems may cause limit cycles due to actuator saturation and rate limits. Such limit cycles are intolerable w.r.t. safety and comfort. By introducing a simple nonlinear modification of the control law, this paper proposes a remedy to significantly reduce the susceptibility to limit cycles for robustly decoupled car steering dynamics. The robustness of the resulting system w.r.t. the avoidance of limit cycles is investigated for varying operating conditions by combining the parameter space approach and the theory of describing functions.	closed-loop transfer function;coupling (computer programming);lateral thinking;limit cycle;nonlinear system;optimal control;yaws	Jürgen Ackermann;Tilman Bünte	1999	Kybernetika		rate limiting;control theory;mathematics;limit cycle	Robotics	67.47631733799726	-12.978479034178793	46282

This method applies to general linear systems including strictly unstable ones. A nonlinear output feedback controller is first expressed in the form of a quasi-LPV system. Conditions under which the closed-loop system is locally asymptotically stable are then established in terms of the coefficient matrices of the controller. The design of the controller (coefficient matrices) that maximizes an estimate of the domain of attraction is then formulated and solved as an optimization problem with LMI constraints	block cipher mode of operation;coefficient;control engineering;control theory;feedback;linear matrix inequality;linear system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem	Fen Wu;Zongli Lin;Qian Zheng	2007	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2006.886498	control engineering;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;nonlinear control;plant;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Visualization	71.43618458582837	-3.337096057639775	46302

However, these manipulators sometimes suffer from the lack of enough stiffness while applied in surgical robotic systems. This paper presents an experimental kinestatic comparison between three continuum manipulators, aiming at revealing how structural variations could alter the manipulators' stiffness properties. These variations not only include modifying the arrangements of elastic components, but also include integrating a passive rigid kinematic chain to form a hybrid continuum-rigid manipulator. Results of this paper could contribute to the development of design guidelines for realizing desired stiffness properties of a continuum or hybrid manipulator.	apache continuum;dexterity programming language;elasticity (data store);focus stacking;futures studies;interaction;kinematic chain;robot;stiffness;triune continuum paradigm	Kai Xu;Minxiao Fu;Jiangran Zhao	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907327	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	72.68259627851253	-23.316341647000943	46315

At present, it is customary to assume that dynamical chaos in finite-dimensional smooth systems can exist in three different forms. This is dissipative chaos, the mathematical image of which is a strange attractor; conservative chaos, for which the entire phase space is a large “chaotic sea” with randomly spaced elliptical islands inside it; and mixed dynamics, characterized by the principal inseparability in the phase space of attractors, repellers and conservative elements of dynamics. In the present paper (which opens a series of three of our papers), elements of the theory of pseudohyperbolic attractors of multidimensional maps and flows are presented. Such attractors, as well as hyperbolic ones, are genuine strange attractors, but they allow the existence of homoclinic tangencies.

Conditions for the stability analysis and robust performance estimation are provided in the form of matrix inequalities by utilizing Lyapunov theory, local saturation overflow arithmetic, and Lipschitz condition. The proposed criterion ascertains (local) asymptotic stability in the absence of perturbations. Under the effects of external interferences, a condition for the local stability, ensuring the H ∞ performance objective, is developed. The proposed approach offers a less conservative and more accurate estimate of H ∞ performance index than the global method by utilizing a bound on the interferences energy. Moreover, the proposed criterion, in contrast to the existing global methods, can be employed to choose an adequate word length of a digital hardware for the specified values of tolerable perturbations energy, H ∞ performance index, and fixed-point resolution. It is worth mentioning that analysis approaches have not been completely reported in the literature, in which local stability criteria for nonlinear discrete-time filtering prototypes under both overflow and disturbances have been developed. A detailed stability analysis for a nonlinear recurrent neural network is performed for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	digital filter;nonlinear system;saturation arithmetic	Amina Shams;Muhammad Rehan;Muhammad Tufail;Choon Ki Ahn;Waqas Ahmed	2018	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.06.026	nonlinear system;mathematical optimization;mathematics;control theory;filter (signal processing);recurrent neural network;lyapunov function;lipschitz continuity;exponential stability;digital filter;matrix (mathematics)	EDA	69.1813354556555	-1.514695950849548	46367

PUMA 560 model is strongly coupled highly nonlinear model, which necessitate effective controller capable of dealing with high degree of coupling and nonlinearity. Furthermore, the robot is subjected to many sources of disturbances, which can affect the performance significantly. Mathematical model of MIMO-BELBIC is introduced and tailored to work as a controller of PUMA 560. Moreover, new optimization algorithm, designed especially for this problem, is used to optimize the 51 parameters of the controller. The results show remarkable success of the proposed controller in decreasing the tracking error (with/without) disturbances in comparison to the traditional PID controllers that were optimized by two different algorithms.

Then, a hierarchical neuro-fuzzy controller using backpropagation (BP) training algorithm is proposed for the precision control and active damping of the micropositioning system.

88eb66f2e7001e7fb2dbdc74450eb069d3340ae9	adaptive neural network-based visual servoing control for manipulator with unknown output nonlinearities		Abstract In this paper, the problem of neural network control for visual servoing robotic system is addressed, where the unmodeled dynamics and output nonlinearity are taken into account simultaneously. An adaptive neural network module is constructed to approach the unknown dynamics, upon which, the robot dynamics are not required to be linearly decomposable and structurally known. The major superiority of this module lies in its conciseness and the computational-reduction operation. Moreover, the output nonlinearity is considered, and its undesirable effect is subsequently tackled without a prior knowledge of the model parameters in output mechanism. It is proven by the Lyapunov method that the image-space tracking error is driven to an adjustable neighborhood of origin. Numerical simulations and experiments under various situations are used to validate the performance of the proposed adaptive neural network based scheme.	artificial neural network;visual servoing	Fujie Wang;Zhi Liu;Charley Peter Chen;Yun Zhang	2018	Inf.

An impedance control of the hand with respect to the inertial coordinate is effective in keeping the contact with the target. In this paper, we propose a method for impedance control for a space manipulator. The end tip of the manipulator is controlled like a mass-damper-spring system fixed at a point in space in spite of the reactive motion of the base.

Using this method, the number of inference rules and the shape of membership functions are optimized without an expert in robotics. The fuzzy outputs of the consequent part are updated by the gradient descent method, and it is guaranteed that the selected solution become the global optimal solution by optimizing Akaike's information criterion expressing the quality of the inference rules. Also, trajectory tracking simulation shows that the optimal fuzzy inference rules by the genetic algorithm are automatically selected and the trajectory control result is almost similar to the result which uses the inference rules to be selected through the trial and error method by an expert. Therefore, although a designer is a non-expert of robot systems, the fuzzy-sliding mode controller can be designed by the proposed self tuning fuzzy inference method based on the genetic algorithm.	genetic algorithm	Seok Jo Go;Min-Cheol Lee	2000		10.1109/ROBOT.2000.846343	control engineering;genetic algorithm;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;information theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system;global optimization	AI	60.979882908878075	-7.385310259717023	46556

As the performance of the LQR controller greatly depends on the weighting matrices (Q and R), it is important to select them optimally. However, normally the weighting matrices are selected based on trial and error approach, which not only makes the controller design tedious but also time consuming. Hence, to address the weighting matrices selection problem of LQR, in this paper we propose an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) method to obtain the elements of Q and R matrices. Moreover, to enhance the convergence speed and precision of the conventional PSO, an adaptive inertia weight factor (AIWF) is introduced in the velocity update equation of PSO. One of the key features of the AIWF is that unlike the standard PSO in which the inertia weight is kept constant throughout the optimization process, the weights are varied adaptively according to the success rate of rajectory tracking lgebraic Riccati equation the particles towards the optimum value. The proposed APSO based LQR control strategy is applied for pitch and yaw axes control of 2 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) laboratory helicopter workstation, which is a highly nonlinear and unstable system. Experimental results substantiate that the weights optimized using APSO, compared to PSO, result in not only reduced tracking error but also improved tracking response with reduced oscillations. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 . Introduction Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the control esign of helicopters due to their potential military and civil appliations. The challenges in attitude and position controller design for elicopters originate from their particular characteristics namely onlinearity, inter axis coupling and uncertainties. In the last two ecades, many works have been reported in the area of control esign for autonomous flying vehicles. Combining feed forward ontrol actions and nested saturation feedback law to deal with the ncertainties in aerodynamic parameters, Marconi and Naldi [1] roposed a robust control scheme for lateral and longitudinal direcion control of a small scale helicopter.

All rights reserved. system, they utilized system identification technique to obtain the accurate model of the system and employed CNF control technique to provide fast transient response with minimal overshoot in tracking a specific target. However, it is reported that due to the non-minimum phase property of the yaw channel of helicopter, the embedded controller has to be redesigned. To achieve desired performance and robustness under aggressive manoeuvres, Liu et al. [3] proposed a robust control scheme by synthesizing the LQR controller with the robust compensator for attitude control of 3 DoF laboratory helicopter. One of the distinguishing features of this work is that the performance of the system under aggressive missions has been validated on a benchmark Quanser helicopter. Kadmiry and Driankov [4] put forward a Fuzzy gain scheduler for altitude and attitude control of unmanned helicopter for stable and robust manoeuvrability. However, only the simulation results illustrating the tracking performance of the fuzzy controller are reported. Modelling a small scale helicopter as an underactuated 3 DoF Lagrangian system, Vilchis et al. [5], experimentally demonfor optimal LQR tracking control of 2 DoF laboratory helicopter, 023 strated the performance of nonlinear control strategy for altitude control. Using the rotation matrix, Raptis et al. [6] investigated the performance of backstepping controller to autonomously follow the predefined yaw and pitch trajectories.

b54cf49378baeceba75b8751c2d2b9dd58f6c518	observer-based adaptive smc for nonlinear uncertain singular semi-markov jump systems with applications to dc motor		This paper deals with the observer-based adaptive sliding mode control (OBASMC) design for nonlinear uncertain singular semi-Markov jump systems. The system satisfies the singular property and follows a stochastic semi-Markov process related to Weibull distribution. Due to the influence of sensor factors in practical systems, the state vectors are not always known. Additionally, the unavoidable measurement errors in the actual system always lead to the model uncertainties and the unknown nonlinearity. Our attention is to design the OBASMC law for such a class of complex systems. First, by the use of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are given, such that the sliding mode dynamics are stochastically admissible. Then, the OBASMC law is proposed to guarantee the reachability in a finite-time region. Finally, the practical system about dc motor model is given to verify the validity.	complex systems;fault detection and isolation;filter (signal processing);lyapunov fractal;markov chain;nonlinear system;reachability;semiconductor industry	Wenhai Qi;Guangdeng Zong;Hamid Reza Karimi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2018.2797257	observer (quantum physics);observational error;sliding mode control;control theory;nonlinear system;markov process;mathematics;dc motor;markov chain;jump	Embedded	67.15295105755985	1.5137032686839007	46675

Presented method estimates unknown disturbances that enter the process and predicts process variables based on extended Kalman filter (EKF). Suggested strategy predicts future variables without linearization, so the results are more precise and reliable. Disturbance outset is computed based on residuals analysis. Using this method, control system (or operator) will have additional time before the abnormal or emergency situation occurs, thus more effective decisions can be made. To ensure the method efficiency, a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is simulated and results are presented.	control system;extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;reactor (software)	E.

Prior knowledge of the linearized equations of motion is used to guarantee that the closed-loop system meets performance and stability objectives when the plant operates in a linear parameter-varying (LPV) regime. In the presence of unmodeled dynamics or failures, the NN controller adapts to optimize its performance online, whereas constrained ADP guarantees that the LPV baseline performance is preserved at all times. The effectiveness of an adaptive NN flight controller is demonstrated for simulated control failures, parameter variations, and near-stall dynamics.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;baseline (configuration management);biologic preservation;biological neural networks;cardiomyoplasty;controllers;dynamic programming;game controller;linear iga bullous dermatosis;population parameter;usb on-the-go;lopinavir	Stefano Ferrari;James E.

18322708c007ef444de9e2735d6c7109704f8ce0	periodic control of unmanned aerial vehicles based on differential flatness		Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are making increasingly long flights today with significantly longer mission times. This requires the UAVs to have longer endurance as well as have long range capabilities. With regards to this, many researchers have shown the non-optimality of the steady state flight of aircrafts and how periodic trajectories may benefit the cause. This work re-establishes the non-optimality of a steady state flight and proposes a sub-optimal periodic solution using the concept of differential flatness. An example of an Aerosonde UAV is used to illustrate the percentage improvement in cost of the periodic control solutions.	aerial photography;simulation;steady state;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Oladapo Ogunbodede;Souransu Nandi;Tarunraj Singh	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8430793	control engineering;computer science;steady state;periodic graph (geometry);flatness (systems theory);control theory;atmospheric model;trajectory	Robotics	64.02918380654606	-14.500894228778037	46969

The varying step Gill numerical integration algorithm is used to solve Model a, where lumped inertias represent gears, nonlinear springs with periodically varying stiffness represent gear meshes, and linear springs represent supports. Model b is developed from a finite element-contact analysis of gear dynamics and solved using dynamic explicit algorithm. Time-varying mesh stiffness excitation, tooth contact and loss are intrinsic to Model b. All errors deemed as approximately equivalent to a comprehensive mesh error are also considered. Float system parameters, assembly variations, and manufacturing errors are identified to quantify their effects on dynamic load sharing factor.

The overall goal is to develop a distributed approach that solves small subproblems while minimizing a fleet-level objective. In the new algorithm, vehicles solve their subproblems in sequence while generating feasible modifications to the prediction of other vehicles' plans. In order to avoid reproducing the global optimization, the decisions of other vehicles are parameterized using a much smaller number of variables than in the centralized formulation. This reduced number of variables is sufficient to improve the cooperation between vehicles without significantly increasing the computational effort involved. The resulting algorithm is shown to be robustly feasible under the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. Furthermore, the fleet objective function is proven to monotonically decrease as the algorithm cycles through the vehicles in the fleet and over the time. The results from simulations and a hardware experiment demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the fleet objective by temporarily having one vehicle sacrifice its individual objective, showing the cooperative behavior.	aerial photography;algorithm;centralized computing;computation;course (navigation);game controller;global optimization;loss function;marginal model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem;real-time clock;robustness (computer science);scalability;simulation;state transition table;stochastic matrix;testbed;trajectory optimization;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Yoshiaki Kuwata;Jonathan P.

50bf587b15264fd0c32a0cbe80312792ce4878e1	boundary control of linear uncertain 1-d parabolic pde using approximate dynamic programming		This paper develops a near optimal boundary control method for distributed parameter systems governed by uncertain linear 1-D parabolic partial differential equations (PDE) by using approximate dynamic programming. A quadratic surface integral is proposed to express the optimal cost functional for the infinite-dimensional state space. Accordingly, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is formulated in the infinite-dimensional domain without using any model reduction. Subsequently, a neural network identifier is developed to estimate the unknown spatially varying coefficient in PDE dynamics. Novel tuning law is proposed to guarantee the boundedness of identifier approximation error in the PDE domain. A radial basis network (RBN) is subsequently proposed to generate an approximate solution for the optimal surface kernel function online. The tuning law for near optimal RBN weights is created, such that the HJB equation error is minimized while the dynamics are identified and closed-loop system remains stable. Ultimate boundedness (UB) of the closed-loop system is verified by using the Lyapunov theory. The performance of the proposed controller is successfully confirmed by simulation on an unstable diffusion–reaction process.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;boolean network;coefficient;control theory;dynamic programming;epilepsies, partial;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;identifier;jacobi method;kernel;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;numerical partial differential equations;parabolic antenna;petri net;population parameter;radial (radio);radial basis function network;simulation;state space;undefined behavior;unstable medical device problem;weight;hamilton rating scale for depression	Behzad Talaei;Sarangapani Jagannathan;John Singler	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2669944	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;control theory;pde surface	Robotics	62.30768861735932	-2.8455012580242887	47023

The nonminimum-phase systems are approximated by minimum-phase systems. The proposed formulation is applied to the disturbance observation problems for multivariable nonminimum-phase systems with arbitrary relative degrees. The disturbances, which are assumed bounded, are the combination of the external disturbances, the nonlinearities and the model uncertainties of the system. The estimation error of the disturbances is controlled by the design parameters. Furthermore, the accuracy of the estimation also depends on the frequencies of the disturbances.

A foamed polystyrene mould is used as not only the master mould for making the corresponding sand mould but also the lost–foam pattern for full mould casting, i.e., lost–foam casting. Recently, the development of a flexible machining robot for foamed polystyrene materials is expected in the cast metal industries because of the high cost and inefficiency of conventional large sized CNC machine tools. In this paper, a machining robot based on an industrial robot is developed for foamed polystyrene materials by applying the already developed robotic CAM system. A compact and lightweight high performance tool is also considered and attached to the arm tip. The feed rate of an end mill is skilfully regulated by a fuzzy reasoning method. The design of the machining robot using the robotic CAM system and fuzzy feed rate controller is presented to efficiently produce foamed polystyrene moulds.	robot	Fusaomi Nagata;Akimasa Otsuka;Keigo Watanabe;Maki K.

The estimator also incorporates the dynamics of the seeker track loop. The state model estimates the acceleration of the target directly along with relative position and velocity. This model also include the ratio of the air density and the ballistic coefficient and its time derivatives as elements of the state vector to account for the aerodynamic drag in the endo-atmospheric phase. Such formulations obviate the need for priori empirical models of air density and drag coefficient. Performance results of the proposed method have been compared with a well-known model from the literature with and without the model of the measurement dynamics and the nonstationary, correlated measurement noise under closed-loop guidance employing the augmented proportional navigation (APN) law for endo-atmospheric ballistic target tracking. It is clearly seen that the proposed method yields more accurate estimates of target acceleration and the relative kinematics.	algebraic petri net;coefficient;radio frequency;velocity (software development)	Shrabani Ghosh;Anirban Krishna Bhattacharya;Siddhartha Mukhopadhyay;Aurobinda Routray	2012	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2012.6324691	acceleration;control engineering;atmospheric model;kinematics;ballistics;radar tracker;vehicle dynamics;simulation;aerodynamics;angular velocity;noise measurement;drag;mathematical model;control theory;physics	Robotics	62.93264204959882	-14.428829071141356	47158

Both faults and disturbances are assumed to be in low frequency domain. The communication delays are uniformly modeled by multiple random variables obeying the Bernoulli distributions, which are mutually correlated by a prior Pearson correlation coefficient matrix. Then the closed-loop system is formulated as a special jump linear system. The generalized definitions of the H2 and H ∞ indexes for such underlying systems are proposed to measure the detection and control performances, respectively. Then a mixed H 2 / H ∞ SFDC approach is proposed to achieve the desired detection and control objectives. To cope with the H2 performance index in a given frequency range directly, by Parseval lemma and S-procedure, a relaxed condition is presented to reduce the conservatism of the existing results.

The method is based on the propagation of position and orientation velocities starting from the rover reference frame and going through various joints and linkages to the wheels. The concept of an extended DH table is introduced for rovers and mobile robots, and equations of the motion are set up in a compact form.

Semistability is a key property, as it ensures that the actual estimation error does not diverge exponentially. We explore structural properties of the filter to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for semistability. The condition does not involve limiting gains nor the solution of Riccati equations, as they can be difficult to obtain numerically and may not exist. In the linear time invariant scenario we obtain algebraic, easy to test conditions for semistability and stability, which complement results available in the context of detectable systems.

Robots have to move to complete their tasks while maintaining communication among themselves and with their human operators, in many cases without the aid of a communication infrastructure. Guaranteeing connectivity enables robots to explicitly exchange information needed in collaborative task execution, and allows operators to monitor or manually control any robot at all times. Network paths should be multi-hop, so as not to unnecessarily restrict the team range. In this work we contribute a complete system which integrates three research aspects, usually studied separately, to achieve these characteristics: a multi-robot cooperative motion control technique based on a virtual spring-damper model which prevents communication network splits, a task allocation algorithm that takes advantage of network link information in order to ensure autonomous mission completion, and a network layer which works over wireless 802.11 devices, capable of sustaining hard real-time traffic and changing topologies. Link quality among peers is the key metric used to cooperatively move the robots and maintain uninterrupted connectivity, and the basis for novel ideas presented in each subsystem. Simulations and experimental results with real robots are presented and discussed.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computer simulation;experiment;high- and low-level;line-of-sight (missile);network topology;parallel computing;preemption (computing);real-time clock;real-time computing;task parallelism;telecommunications network;windows 3.0	Danilo Tardioli;Alejandro R.

Standard approaches to output synchronization of heterogeneous systems require either the solution of the output regulator equations or the incorporation of a p-copy of the leader's dynamics in the controller of each agent. By contrast, in this paper neither one is needed. Moreover, here both the leader's and the follower's dynamics are assumed to be unknown. First, a distributed adaptive observer is designed to estimate the leader's state for each agent. The output synchronization problem is then formulated as an optimal control problem and a novel model-free off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to solve the optimal output synchronization problem online in real time. It is shown that this optimal distributed approach implicitly solves the output regulation equations without actually doing so. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	reinforcement learning	Hamidreza Modares;Subramanya P. Nageshrao;Gabriel A. D. Lopes;Robert Babuska;Frank L.

a3b4d8cf24c6534963377f9213d962e351c41b6f	model predictive control of constrained non-linear time-delay systems		This paper proposes a model predictive control scheme for non-linear time-delay systems with input constraints. Based on the results for systems without delays, asymptotic stability of the closed loop is guaranteed by utilizing an appropriate terminal cost functional and an appropriate terminal region such that the optimal cost for the finite-horizon problem is an upper bound on the optimal cost for the associated infinite-horizon problem. Two structured procedures are presented to determine offline the terminal cost and the terminal region for a class of non-linear time-delay systems. For both procedures, sufficient conditions can be formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities based on the Jacobi linearization of the system about the origin. The first procedure uses a combination of Lyapunov–Krasovskii and Lyapunov– Razumikhin conditions in order to compute a locally stabilizing controller and a control invariant region. The second procedure only applies Lyapunov–Krasovskii arguments but may yield more complicated control invariant regions. The effectiveness of both schemes is compared for the example of a continuous stirred tank reactor with recycle stream.	jacobi method;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;online and offline;reactor (software);time complexity	Marcus Reble;Reza Mahboobi Esfanjani;Seyyed Kamaleddin Yadavar Nikravesh;Frank Allgöwer	2011	IMA J.

The parameters of the model are identified by measured data of the real arm, so it is expected that the dynamic behavior of the model is similar to that of the real arm. First, the modeling scheme is proposed, then the equations of motion of an N degree of freedom flexible arm using this model are derived to simulate its dynamic b e havior. The results of simulation and experiment show the validity of this modeling scheme. Recently, a need has developed for light and fast industrial robots. For use in space, long arms are needed that are light in comparison to their load. Such arms aze aptly named flexible arms because their elasticity demands compensation of the arm deformations and vibrations. In general, a mathematical model is required for analyzing or controlling a flexible manipulator. There were many previous studies making models by using partial differential equations [1,2,3] or by using finite element method [4]. The partial differential equation approach can describe the arm dynamics precisely, but can only describe simple beams, and is difficult to extend to multi-link arms, because of its complicated boundary conditions. The finite element approach can model a real arm precisely by using many elements, but needs a lot of calculation. On the other hand, there are also approaches which use some simple dynamic elements, such as rigid links and springs [5,6]. These approaches involve some approximation, but are simple enough to apply for the real-time control of real flexible arms, easy enough to understand dynamic behavior of the model. And in these approaches, the extension to multi-link flexible manipulators is easy. In this paper, a modeling scheme using virtual rigid links and passive joints is proposed. A flexible link is modeled by simple dynamic elements, some virtual rigid links and passive joints that consists of passive elements such as springs and dampers. The parameters of virtual links and passive joints are identified from measured data of dynamic and static characteristics of the real flexible link. The whole arm is modeled by connecting models of individual links, so it doesn't need complex boundary conditions. The dynamic structure of this model is similar to that of finite element method and [6], but the way to determine the parameters is different. This modeling scheme identify the parameters from measured data of the dynamic and static characteristics of the real links, while the finite element method and [6] use the local characteristics such as material constants or shape of crw-section. So the behavior of this model is expected to be similar to that of the real arm. This model includes some modeling error, because the model of a flexible link consists of 2, 3 or several virtual rigid links. But it is easy to understand the dynamic behavior, and does not need much calculation. 2 Propowl of m . . . . . and Dassive it&& %1 S t r u m of the model and d e t e """" of Darameters . . It is proposed to make the model of flexible links using some virtual rigid links which are connected by virtual passive joints consisting of springs and dampers (shown in Fig.1). At the motor shaft, virtual passive joint is also placed which represents the joint elasticity. This model has parameters such as length, mass, inertia of virtual links, and spring constant , damping coefficient of passive joints. The point of this modeling is how to determine the parameters so as to make the behavior of the model coincide with that of the real arm. There are many ways to determine the parameters of the model from some measured data. In this paper, they are determined as follows. First, some static characteristics (e.g. deformation of end-tip under certain load) and dynamic characteristics (e.g. eigen frequency) of the real arm are measured. Then the parameters of the model are determined to make the characteristics of the model which are calculated from the parameters coincide with those of the real arm. That is, in the form of equations, letting dynamic characteristics of the real arm be a r d , static characteristics be arr, whole characteristics be a, = [ a , d T I arSTlT = [ar], ~,2,.--]~, and those of the model that are calculated from the parameters be a, = [amdT, amrTIT = [a,], (~,a,-**]~, the parameters are determined to minimize the index is as follows Mz11 MA2 ] [ ( 3 t 2 ) * ] + [ ( k ; ) , 0 Mz21 M z 2 2 ( 4 , 3 ) 1 (k13)z ] [ ki ] = 0, ( 2 )"""	approximation;coat of arms;coefficient;eigen (c++ library);elasticity (data store);finite element method;industrial robot;mathematical model;real-time clock;simulation	Tsuneo Yoshikawa;Koh Hosoda	1991		10.1109/IROS.1991.174614	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;equations of motion;control theory;quantum mechanics	Robotics	72.00395831184625	-19.706479526102004	47497

An observer design for pose and velocity estimation for three-dimensional rigid body motion, in the framework of geometric mechanics, is presented here. Resorting to convenient defined Lyapunov function, a nonlinear observer on the Special Euclidean Group (SE(3)) is derived. This observer is based on the exponential coordinates, which are used to represent the group of rigid body motions. Exponential convergence of the estimation errors is shown and boundedness of the estimation error under bounded unmodeled torques and forces is established. Since exponential coordinates can describe uniquely almost the entire group of rigid body motions, the resulting observer design is almost globally exponentially convergent. The observer is then applied to the free dynamics of a rigid vehicle. Numerical simulation results are presented to show the performance of this observer, both in the absence and with unmodeled forces and torques.	computer simulation;geographic coordinate system;geometric mechanics;image noise;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;state space;time complexity;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Sérgio Bras;Maziar Izadi;Carlos Silvestre;Amit K.

First, by analyzing the control and learning processes, a discrete system for P-type ILC is established, and the ILC design problem is then converted to a stability problem for such a discrete system. Next, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the control input and the tracking errors is obtained by introducing a new norm and using the generalized Gronwall inequality, which is less conservative than the existing one. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by a numerical example.	discrete system;information processing;iterative method;numerical analysis;social inequality;system camera	Yong-Hong Lan;Zhe-Min Cui	2018	Algorithms	10.3390/a11060085	mathematics;mathematical optimization;discrete system;distributed parameter system;iterative learning control;gronwall's inequality;convergence (routing)	Robotics	71.90891883089623	3.274176723924058	47534

The fingers of a robot hand require power when grasping an object and speed when opening and closing. Therefore a CVT is ideal to improve the power transmission of a finger joint. Existing friction CVTs are too big and heavy to be installed in a finger joint. By focusing on the fact that finger joints do not necessarily rotate 360 degrees, a remarkably simple and small load-sensitive CVT can be developed based on a crank CVT. The mechanism consists of a five-bar linkage and a torsion coiled spring. We have developed one joint with the CVT and have experimentally verified that the CVT can increase its reduction ratio from 0.5 to 3.3 in response to a load.	closing (morphology);crank (person);experiment;linkage (software);robot;torsion (gastropod)	Takeshi Takaki;Toru Omata	2004	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004.

One of the difficulties in designing a suitable control scheme which can achieve accurate trajectory tracking and good control performance is to guarantee the stability and robustness of control system, due to friction forces, external disturbances error, and parameter variations. To deal with this problem, the RBF network is investigated to the joint position control of an n-link robot manipulator. The RBF network is one approach which has shown a great promise in this sort of problems because of its fast learning algorithm and better approximation capabilities. The adaptive RBF network can effectively improve the control performance against large uncertainty of the system. The adaptive turning laws of network parameters are derived using the back-propagation algorithm and the Lyapunov stability theorem, so that the stability of the entire system and the convergence of the weight adaptation are guaranteed. In this control scheme, a robust compensator plays as an auxiliary controller to guarantee the stability and robustness under various environments such as the mass variation, the external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties. Finally, the simulation and experimental results in comparison with adaptive fuzzy and wavelet network control method are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.	adaptive filter;algorithm;approximation;artificial neural network;backpropagation;control system;lyapunov fractal;optimal control;radial (radio);radial basis function network;robot;servo;simulation;software propagation;wavelet	Cuong Van Pham;Yao-Nan Wang	2015	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-015-1873-4	robust control;simulation;sliding mode control;adaptive control;computer science;control theory;artificial neural network	Robotics	63.75524558226581	-9.96788017167281	47610
863cbcde7c08d385f1d272fc29e93e59d19c28a6	robust boundary iterative learning control for a class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems with unmatched uncertainties and disturbance		Abstract In this paper, the robust boundary iterative learning control for the output tracking and disturbance attenuation of the 2 × 2 nonlinear hyperbolic system is addressed. Since the measurement limitation, the control and measurement are implemented at the same boundary of the system and the disturbance is not necessary to be estimated, which makes the iterative learning control be easy in implementation and low in measurement cost. By using the characteristic method, the robust convergence with respect to iteration-varying uncertainties arising from initial states shift, external disturbances, model plants uncertainties and disturbed reference trajectories is analyzed without any model reduction, rigorously. It is shown that the robust convergence bound is continuously dependent on the bounds of the iteration-varying uncertainties.

In this paper, we study the event-triggered model predictive control (MPC) problem for continuous-time nonlinear systems subject to bounded disturbances. An event-triggered mechanism is first designed by measuring the error between the system state and its optimal prediction; the event-triggered MPC algorithm that is built upon the triggering mechanism and the dual-mode approach is then designed. The rigorous analysis of the feasibility and stability is conducted, and the sufficient conditions for ensuring the feasibility and stability are developed. We show that the feasibility of the event-triggered MPC algorithm can be guaranteed if, the prediction horizon is designed properly and the disturbances are small enough. Furthermore, it is shown that the stability is related to the prediction horizon, the disturbance bound and the triggering level, and that the state trajectory converges to a robust invariant set under the proposed conditions. Finally, a case study is provided to verify the theoretical results.	nonlinear system	Huiping Li;Yang Shi	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.03.015	robust control;control engineering;simulation;nonlinear system;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.68003818085639	0.18780175652613396	47662

In this work, the Cartesian trajectory planning of free-floating manipulators is studied. A methodology is developed in which, for given end-effector trajectories, appropriate initial system configurations are found that result in singularity avoidance during end-effector motion.

The global Kalman filter is decomposed into separate reduced-order local filters via the use of a decoupling transformation. A near-optimal control law is derived by approximating the coefficients of the truly optimal control law. The order of approximation of the optimal performance is  O ( e   N  ), where  N  is the order of approximation of the coefficients. A real world power system example demonstrates the failure of  O ( e  2 ) and  O ( e  4 ) approximations and the necessity for the existence of the  O ( e   N  ) theory. The proposed method produces the reduction in both off-line and on-line computational requirements and leads to convergence under mild assumptions. In addition, only low-order systems are involved in algebraic calculations and no analyticity requirement (a standard assumption for the power series method) is imposed on system coefficients.	steady state;stochastic gradient descent	Xuemin Shen;Zoran Gajic	1990	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(90)90010-F	kalman filter;control engineering;calculus;control theory;mathematics	EDA	73.4639116158698	-2.4966430704007445	47714

This paper presents a new wave-based bilateral teleoperation structures to attenuate the wave reflection, at the same time, by scaling the structure parameters to improve the force and speed tracking performance. And according to the wave scattering theory, passivity of the new structure is analyzed. Experiments show that the proposed method not only guarantees the stability of the system, but also improves the position tracking and force feedback performance.	bilateral filter;reflection (computer graphics)	Min Zheng;Wei Xiao;Qinghai Chen	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34384-1_13	passivity;scattering theory;engineering;control engineering;scaling;teleoperation;haptic technology	Robotics	68.91799595221651	-12.798693361846931	47723
cf9a876db966e59af1e0a78d55b4dbf7ec6501b4	dealing with input delay and switching in electrohydraulic servomechanism mathematical model		Electrohydraulic servomechanisms represent a field of maximum attractiveness in many industrial fields for about 70 years, but special attention is paid in particular to the performance and quality of these automatic systems in flight controls of aircraft. Electrohydraulic servomechanism considered in this paper is modeled by five dimensional switched nonlinear systems of differential equations. Intrinsically, the mathematical model of the electrohydraulic servomechanism has several shortcomings: critical case for stability and switching type nonlinearity. The shortcoming of the critical case of stability was eliminated in this paper by naturally introducing the internal leakage between the two chambers of the hydraulic cylinder in the mathematical model. Instead, the control delay was introduced, also naturally. It is worth mentioning that this mixed problem, of the electrohydraulic servomechanism switching type delayed mathematical model, is quite difficult in itself and has not been considered, as far as we know.	cylinder seal;display lag;input lag;mathematical model;negative feedback;nonlinear system;spectral leakage	Daniela Enciu;Ioan Ursu;George Tecuceanu	2018	2018 5th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2018.8394891	flight control surfaces;differential equation;leakage (electronics);hydraulic cylinder;servomechanism;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.19248266596307	-6.229558787040091	47744

In this study, the human operator is assumed to act as a dynamical system, and its complexity and performance is analyzed through the entropy rate of its generated output command. We investigated the characteristics of the human operator when controlling an unstable system under different time delays and higher degrees of task instability. The entropy rate for dynamical systems, also called the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, was estimated based on the numerical method proposed by Grassberger and Procaccia.	broadcast delay;control system;control theory;dynamical system;entropy rate;feedback;human interface device;instability;kolmogorov complexity;numerical method	Mircea Lupu;Mingui Sun;Zhi-Hong Mao	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	71.30912669430187	-0.39204306515247145	47752

The system is highly non-linear and somehow difficult to model therefore resorting to robust control is required.The work in this paper addresses this problem by presenting two types of robust control. One uses neural network control, which has powerful learning capability, adaptation and tackles nonlinearities; in our work the learning performed on-line is based on a binary reinforcement signal without knowing the nonlinearities appearing in the system and no preliminary off-line learning phase is required. The other control law is a Classical variable structure which is robust against parameters variations and external disturbances. Experimental results together with a comparative study are presented and discussed.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;electroactive polymers;experiment;network interface controller;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;performance;reinforcement learning;robotic arm;robust control;robustness (computer science)	Syrine Boudoua;Mourad Chettouh;Mustapha Hamerlain	2009			robust control;artificial muscle;robotic arm;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control	Robotics	63.58781344420189	-10.182166832070662	47815

The most commonly used models for the effect of muscle relaxants during general anesthesia comprise a high number (greater than eight) of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. The main issue concerning the neuromuscular blockade system identification is that, in the clinical practice, the input signals (drug dose profiles to be administered to the patients) vary too little to provide a sufficient excitation of the system. The limited amount of measurement data also indicates a need for new identification strategies. A new single-input single-output Wiener model with two parameters is hence proposed to model the effect of atracurium. An extended Kalman filter approach is used to perform the online identification of the system parameters. This approach outperforms many conventional identification strategies, and shows good results regarding parameter identification and measured signal tracking, when evaluated on a large patient database. The new method proved to be adequate for the description of the system, even with the poor input signal excitation and the few measured data samples present in this application. It turns out that the method is of general validity for the identification of drug dynamics in the human body.	extended kalman filter;system identification	Margarida Martins da Silva;Torbjörn Wigren;Teresa Mendonça	2012	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2011.2107742	kalman filter;control engineering;muscle;human body;simulation;system identification;information science;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;nonlinear system identification;extended kalman filter;solid modeling	Visualization	55.149415637384934	-7.906501817774624	47847

This paper presents a multiagent solution to the platoon control problem with a linear configuration. In our case, a platoon is a vehicle train composed of a head vehicle and a variable number of followers. The head vehicle is human-driven or autonomous, whereas each follower vehicle controls its movement by interacting only with the preceding one. To this end, the platoon control system was designed as a reactive multiagent system where each follower vehicle is an agent. Each agent's behavior is specified by a physics inspired model, which allows to compute vehicle's speed and direction from a single perception: the distance to the preeding vehicle. Platoon stability emerges as a global result of individual interactions. Furthermore, adaptability to different kinds of vehicles is obtained by adjusting the model's physical parameters. Another important aspect is related to platoon's evolution, mainly by vehicle merging and splitting. To assert the transition from abstract to concrete, both simulations and experimentations have been implemented.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;control system;interaction;multi-agent system;platoon (automobile);simulation	Jean-Michel Contet;Franck Gechter;Pablo Gruer;Abder Koukam	2007	19th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence(ICTAI 2007)	10.1109/ICTAI.2007.56	coevolution;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation	Robotics	56.53427502286982	-20.94433580184424	47948

However, CTC scheme requires precise dynamical models of biped robot. To handle this impossibility, we proposed an approach combing CTC and fuzzy logic controller to regulate the dynamic walking of a planar 7 degrees-of-freedom under-actuated biped robot to follow a specified trajectory. A computed torque is used to achieve high speed and high precision tracking while the fuzzy controller behaves remedies for any parameter deviation compensating thus for unknown uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, computer simulation are carried on and results are presented to show tracking capability and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	mobile robot	Soraya Bououden;Foudil Abdessemed;Abderraouf Benali	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-01665-3_86	computer simulation;motion control;simulation;computer science;degrees of freedom	Robotics	65.17866209244882	-10.954191708518968	47954

The paper formulates local stability conditions for the analysed class of neural networks using Lyapunov’s first method. Moreover, a stabilization problem is defined and solved as a constrained optimization task. In order to tackle this problem, a gradient projection method is adopted.

Due to the complicated structure of type-2 systems, they lack systematic control design and hence the stability of the system is not guaranteed. This paper presents stability analysis of dynamic type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems. Novel inference mechanisms for type-2 TSK systems for the case when antecedents are type-2 and consequents are crisp numbers (A2-C0) are developed and utilized in fuzzy model generation. Owing to the simple nature of the proposed methods, they are easy to implement in real-time applications. One of the proposed inference mechanisms is used and the sufficient stability conditions for these systems are derived. It is shown that the criteria obtained herein must satisfy some linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and an algorithm is also presented to solve the obtained LMI. Two numerical examples are provided that detail the design method. The methodology presented proves to be an efficient approach to systematically design stable dynamic type-2 TSK fuzzy systems.	algorithm;control engineering;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;numerical analysis;numerical method;real-time clock;real-time computing	Mohammad Biglarbegian;William W.

First, the L_ equations that arise from the quadratic optimal control problem are studied. The matrix cost is only assumed to be hermitian. Conditions for existence of the maximal hermitian solution are derived in terms of the concept of mean square stabilizability and a convex set not being empty. A connection with convex optimization is established, leading to a numerical algorithm. A necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a stabilizing solution (in the mean square sense) is derived. Sufficient conditions in terms of the usual observability and detectability tests for linear systems are also obtained. Finally, the coupled algebraic Riccati equations that arise from the L_-control of discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems are analyzed. An algorithm for deriving a stabilizing solution, if it exists, is obtained. These results generalize and unify several previous ones presented in the literature of discretetime coupled Riccati equations of Markovian jump linear systems.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;algorithm;convex optimization;convex set;linear algebra;linear system;mathematical optimization;maximal set;mean squared error;numerical analysis;optimal control;optimization problem;recursion;the matrix	Oswaldo Luiz V.

Two behaviors are independently designed at the design stage and then combined them by a behavior selector at the running stage. A behavior selector using a bistable switching function chooses a behavior at each action step so that the mobile robot can go for the goal position without colliding with obstacles. Fuzzy logic maps the input fuzzy sets representing the mobile robot's state space determined by sensor readings to the output fuzzy sets representing the mobile robot's action space. Fuzzy rule bases are built through the reinforcement learning which requires simple evaluation data rather than thousands of input-output training data. Since the fuzzy rules for each behavior are learned through a reinforcement learning method, the fuzzy rule bases can be easily constructed for more complex environments. In order to find the mobile robot's present state, ultrasonic sensors mounted at the mobile robot are used. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations. >	fuzzy logic;mobile robot;reinforcement learning;sensor	Hee Rak Beom;Hyung Suck Cho	1995	IEEE Trans.

More recently, many robotics researchers are making their best efforts to improve the locomotion speed, as well as the stability and robustness, of quadruped robots. The high-speed locomotion creates various challenges in the development of actuators, mechanical design, and control algorithms of the robot. In this paper, a linear actuation system for the high-speed locomotion of a quadruped robot is introduced. The proposed actuator is designed based on the principle of brushed direct-current electric motor systems. For the minimal impedance and improved force capacity, the actuator is designed with dual layers of cores, which are aligned parallel to permanent magnets. The mechanical and electrical properties of the actuation system, such as back-drivability, controllability, and response time, are verified by experimental results. A robotic leg, which is the rear leg of a cheetah-like robot, is designed with the proposed actuator, and is introduced briefly in this paper also.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;computer simulation;multi-core processor;requirement;response time (technology);robotics;robust control;systems modeling	Byeonghun Na;Hyun-jin Choi;Kyoungchul Kong	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2013.6631144	robust control;control engineering;mobile robot;magnet;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;robot control;actuator	Robotics	72.2416448727668	-21.900474667621904	48191

While prior work has modeled the cable as a massless rigid link, in this paper, we consider the cable to be elastic with both spring stiffness and damping. We derive a coordinate-free dynamical model of the system. We use singular-perturbations to show that a geometric controller developed for the case of an inelastic cable still works for the case of an elastic cable to achieve almost global exponential tracking of a desired load position to within a certain bound. We provide numerical results to validate the proposed controller for various spring and damping coefficients for the cable.	action (physics);c date and time functions;coefficient;dynamical system;elasticity (cloud computing);emoticon;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;numerical analysis;principle of least action;singular value decomposition;time complexity	Prasanth Kotaru;Guofan Wu;Koushil Sreenath	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963553	control theory;computer science;control engineering;control theory;massless particle;payload;stiffness;attitude control;exponential function	Robotics	67.16951630166434	-16.068885856674374	48246

This increased utility demands that manipulator designs be carefully optimized to achieve the kinematic dexterity required to perform their numerous intended tasks. The optimization of redundant manipulator designs to improve isotropy has been studied at great length, but a vast majority of the work done focuses on planar manipulation tasks and workspaces that, unlike many modern manufacturing environments, offer few or no physical impediments to motion. In this paper we investigate the incorporation of secondary manipulation goals, in particular obstacle avoidance, into the calculation of kinematic isotropy measures. We will use these weighted isotropy measures as a performance metric for redundant manipulators working in obstacle-laden workspaces, and employ the metric as part of an objective function for a global search design optimization problem. The effectiveness of the weighted isotropy design optimization will be demonstrated by increasing the global dexterity of a sub-optimal seven degree-of-freedom manipulator design used for pick-and-place tasks within a small, enclosed workspace.	algorithmic efficiency;back-face culling;expectation–maximization algorithm;futures studies;galaxy morphological classification;genetic algorithm;global optimization;integer factorization;kinematic chain;mathematical morphology;mathematical optimization;obstacle avoidance;optimization problem;smt placement equipment;serial manipulator;workspace	Frank L.

A 24 DoF kinematic model of the human hand is defined to realistic movements. This model is based on the human skeleton. Dynamic and static constraints have been included in order to improve the movement realism. Two simplified hand models with 9 and 6 DoF have been developed according to the constraints predefined. These simplified models involve some errors in reconstructing the hand posture. These errors are calculated with respect to the 24 DoF model and evaluated according to the hand gestures. Finally, some criteria are defined to select the hand description best suited to the features of the manipulation task.	authorization;ieee xplore;poor posture	Salvador Cobos;Manuel Ferre;Miguel Angel Sánchez Urán;Javier Ortego;César Peña	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4651053	control engineering;computer vision;kinematics;simulation;engineering;mathematical model;electronic packaging;statistics	Robotics	68.4544722001792	-22.568143295442304	48310

It was shown that the method works for a rigid manipulator where one of the joints is damaged and can not be controlled. It is important for space applications to have some means of control while the system is compromised. Control law has been proposed for the task of trajectory tracking and practical stability was achieved for the system. Three scenarios, for each joint, were presented. Each scenario compares error outputs when proposed controller has no information that the joint is broken and while this piece of information is incorporated into control algorithm in form of factitious force.	algorithm	Wojciech Domski;Alicja Mazur	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046858	control theory;computer science;control engineering;manipulator;trajectory;convergence (routing);matrix (mathematics);control theory	Robotics	65.4064550805793	-21.42583217875309	48371

We extend work of Sterner [1] and Frost & Elser [2] using a dynamic model of homeostatic control within tolerance limits by consumers feeding on unbalanced diets based on nonlinear assimilation as a primary mechanism. Differential assimilation provides a suitable, if incomplete, mechanism for homeostasis where the limiting element defines the accumulation trajectory of nutrients incorporated into the consumer.	data assimilation;difference-map algorithm;ecosystem;elemental;homeostasis;mathematical model;nonlinear system;nutrient cycle;relational operator;tree accumulation;unbalanced circuit	J.

The problem can be viewed as an extension of the classical problem of semiglobally stabilizing the trajectories of a controlled system to a compact set. The problem also encompasses a version of the classical problem of output regulation. Under only a weak minimum phase assumption, it is shown that there exists a controller solving the problem at hand. The paper is deliberately focused on theoretical results regarding the existence of such a controller.

This familiar kitchen trick has been well analyzed [1]. Besides simply standing up, however, an egg spun at sufficiently high speed can make a series of hops up off the table surface as it rises.

Power-shaping control is a recent approach for the control of nonlinear systems based on the physics of the dynamical system. In this paper we apply the power-shaping control approach to the exothermic CSTR study case. A global Lyapunov function is derived for the open-loop exothermic CSTR. This Lyapunov function is then reshaped by the means of a controller in order to stabilize the process at a desired temperature.

CSVC algorithms include binary (2-state) CSVC (BCSVC), quadrature (4-state) CSVC (QCSVC) and some multi-state CSVCs. In this paper, we focus on QCSVC. For a quadrature complex-valued classification problem, QCSVC is identical to the 4-quadrature amplitude modulation demodulation methods in digital communications.

The design is based on considering the flexible mechanical structure as a singular perturbed system, which allows us to assume the existence of slow (rigid) and fast (flexible) modes that separately can be controlled. The rigid dynamics are controlled by means of a robust sliding adaptive approach with well-established stability properties. The flexible dynamics can be controlled using H ∞ or optimal designs, which successfully handle the actual interaction between the slow and fast subsystems. This composite approach achieves good closed-loop tracking properties, both in simulation and experimental results on a laboratory-flexible arm.

The main benefits are low cost, low complexity and robustness. A round rigid foot of small radius works well on hard terrain; however, it is prone to sink into soft terrain. Sinking can be avoided by increasing the radius of the foot, but in that case a round foot will roll during the leg-support phase, causing the hip to become misplaced and the robot to assume an incorrect attitude. This paper analyses this problem and provides a hip-control algorithm for restoring leg coordination. The algorithm is implemented in a real leg with a large-radius ball foot in order to evaluate how the algorithm would perform if applied to a real robot. c © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In recent works, the kernel recursive least squares CMAC (KRLS–CMAC) was proposed as a superior alternative to the standard CMAC as it converges faster and does not require tuning of a learning rate parameter. One improvement to the standard CMAC that has been discussed in the literature is eligibility, and vector eligibility. With vector eligibility the CMAC is able to control online motion control problems that it could not previously, stabilize the system much faster, and converge to a more intelligent solution. This paper integrates vector eligibility with the KRLS–CMAC and shows how the combination is advantageous through two simulated control experiments.	artificial neural network;biconnected component;cerebellar model articulation controller;content-addressable memory;converge;experiment;genetic algorithm;inverted pendulum;kernel (operating system);one-key mac;recursion;recursive least squares filter	Carl Laufer;Nitish Patel;George G.

The proposed procedure is based on a suitable laser model obtained by simplifying the rate and propagation equations. By proper manipulation of the simplified laser equations, the estimation problem is formulated in the bounded error estimation framework, where a-priori information on physical parameters can be taken into account. A two stage scheme is presented where the first stage requires the solution to a nonconvex optimization problem, while the second stage is formulated as a linear regression problem. A suitable convex relaxation scheme for solving the nonconvex optimization problem is presented, along with a discussion of its convergency properties. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of simulated data obtained from a commercial laser simulator.	algorithm;convex optimization;estimation theory;fiber laser;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;software propagation	Vito Cerone;Valentino Razza;Diego Regruto	2013	2013 American Control Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;regression analysis;statistics	Robotics	55.26613591144347	-0.1879202688584066	48790

Two different types of propagating quasi-periodic waves with identical parameter sets are experimentally verified. The associated numerical results are distinguished by comparing trajectories on the phase planes and by analyzing the one-parameter bifurcation diagrams. Furthermore, the experiments reveal five different types of switching oscillations. The associated numerical results are also presented, and the stability of the switching oscillations (when constrained to an invariant subspace) is numerically investigated. We also calculate spectral distribution for one type of the switching oscillation.		Kuniyasu Shimizu	2014	I. J.

The existence of such a controller is given in terms of the solvability of bilinear matrix inequalities, which are to be solved by a newly proposed algorithm. A numerical example is used to illustrate the validity of the design methodology.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;control system;control theory;lyapunov fractal;markov property;numerical analysis;pdf/a;random graph	Dan Huang;Sing Kiong Nguang	2007	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434340	control theory;control theory;distributed parameter system;control system;lyapunov function;networked control system;mathematics;control engineering;linear system;markov process;full state feedback	Embedded	67.79640036964149	0.9331546894984226	48931

For high load applications of mobile robots, an accurate tire model that considers wheel slip needs to be studied to achieve robustness of the system response. First, a simple operator-manipulator coordination system is developed based on explicit force control. Then, a position controller for the platform is designed to minimize the effect of wheel slip on control performance and integrated with the force controller for the operator-manipulator subsystem based on a motion coordination scheme. Then, a new type of human-robot coordination control method is developed, in which robust force control of the manipulator and impedance control of the mobile platform are integrated to achieve robust response and smooth interaction between the operator, the manipulator and the mobile platform. In simulation, the developed methods are compared for control performance on following the operator's motion intention.	robot	Jae H.

Relative to previous works, the presented method avoids the reliance on the force dynamics on the characteristics of the micro-objects. Furthermore, the estimation is a closed-loop kind technique so that convergency can be ensured efficiently. To perform these, we consider the force at the tip of a piezocantilever as an unknown input and we use an Unknown Input Observation technique. We especially use the Inverse-Dynamics-Based UIO technique because it is well suited for a piezo-cantilever model. The experiments show that the performances of the observer are convenient for micromanipulation/ microassembly tasks.	experiment;inverse dynamics;performance;piezoelectricity	Micky Rakotondrabe;Philippe Lutz	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152178	cantilever;control engineering;probability density function;simulation;engineering;automatic control;mathematical model;control theory;inverse dynamics;force;statistics	Robotics	67.60894542689313	-17.74617577292111	49021

Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model is used to extend the results of the classical digital redesign technique to complex nonlinear systems. Unlike the conventional intelligent digital redesign technique reported in the literature, the proposed method utilized the recently developed LMI optimization technique to obtain a digitally redesigned fuzzy-model-based controller. Precisely speaking, the intelligent digital redesign problem is converted to an equivalent optimization problem, and the LMI optimization method is used to find the digitally redesigned fuzzy-model-based controller. A numerical example is provided to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach.	fuzzy logic	Wook Chang;Young Hoon Joo;Jin Bae Park	2001	Int. J.

The VSC supplies power to the prosthesis motor and regenerates energy from the prosthesis motor for storage in a supercapacitor bank. An artificial neural network controls the VSC switching so that the prosthesis motor generates a knee torque that matches the torque that is output from a passivity-based controller (PBC). The neural network, PBC, and prosthesis motor parameters are optimized with an evolutionary algorithm to achieve knee angle tracking. Several reference trajectories from able-bodied walking were tracked with an RMS tracking error of less than 0.5° while regenerating up to 67 Joules of energy during four gait cycles.	artificial neural network;evolutionary algorithm;periodic boundary conditions;shadow copy;voltage source	Taylor Barto;Dan Simon	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963783	control theory;computer science;control engineering;control theory;motor drive;artificial neural network;torque;tracking error;voltage source;dc motor;pulse-width modulation	Robotics	69.58538850087348	-15.24689671808956	49135

This software can be used both in classical and in modern control theory subjects. The tool used to generate this graphical interface is Easy Java Simulations, which allows us to implement interactive simulations of physical systems in a quite intuitive way. Two different physical systems have been included: a position control system and an active vehicle suspension model. The user can choose any of these two systems and configure freely all their parameters. Also, an identification process of the system can be carried out by introducing a specific input and measuring the evolution of the output or other variables. After that, the controller can be designed and tested. Several configurations have been included in the tool: PID and controllers through state feedback. The second option includes the possibility of adding a state observer in case only the input and the output are measurable and an integral action to set the steady state. The graphical simulations offer the maximum interactivity since the user can change any of the parameters of the controllers during the simulation and/or the value of the reference input and observe the evolution of the system and the graphical representation of the evolution of the output. In this paper we present some details of implementation of the platform and the educational possibilities it offers.	computer simulation;control system;control theory;graphical user interface;interactivity;java;pid;programming tool;steady state	Luis Payá;Valerio Isaak Montoya;David Úbeda;Luis Miguel Jiménez García;Óscar Reinoso	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2016.7587922	control engineering;simulation;computer science;control theory	Robotics	58.04652993679592	-11.600455373514727	49235
a6ea611f5b7680a0cd2d4ba997ccab7fe0cb5c6b	first steps towards translating hzd control of bipedal robots to decentralized control of exoskeletons		This paper presents preliminary results toward translating gait and control design for bipedal robots to decentralized control of an exoskeleton aimed at restoring mobility to patients with lower limb paralysis, without the need for crutches. A mathematical hybrid dynamical model of the human-exoskeleton system is developed and a library of dynamically feasible periodic walking gaits for different walking speeds is found through nonlinear constrained optimization using the full-order dynamical system. These walking gaits are stabilized using a centralized (i.e., full-state information) hybrid zero dynamics-based controller, which is then decentralized (i.e., control actions use partial state information) so as to be implementable on the exoskeleton subsystem. A control architecture is then developed so as to allow the user to actively control the exoskeleton speed through his/her upper body posture. Numerical simulations are carried out to compare the two controllers. It is found that the proposed decentralized controller not only preserves the periodic walking gaits but also inherits the robustness to perturbations present in the centralized controller. Moreover, the proposed velocity regulation scheme is able to reach a steady state and track desired walking speeds under both, centralized, and decentralized schemes.	centralized computing;computational fluid dynamics;constrained optimization;distributed control system;dynamical system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;poor posture;robot;simulation;steady state;velocity (software development)	Ayush Agrawal;Omar Harib;Ayonga Hereid;Sylvain Finet;Matthieu Masselin;Laurent Praly;Aaron D.

5054667d6ef2c577f5549e829b741055717677ed	design and simulation analysis for integrated vehicle chassis-network control system based on can network		Due to the different functions of the system used in the vehicle chassis control, the hierarchical control strategy also leads to many kinds of the network topology structure. According to the hierarchical control principle, this research puts forward the integrated control strategy of the chassis based on supervision mechanism.The purpose is to consider how the integrated control architecture affects the control performance of the system after the intervention of CAN network. Based on the principle of hierarchical control and fuzzy control, a fuzzy controller is designed, which is used to monitor and coordinate the ESP, AFS, and ARS. And the IVC system is constructed with the upper supervisory controller and three subcontrol systems on the Simulink platform. The network topology structure of IVC is proposed, and the IVC communication matrix based on CAN network communication is designed. With the common sensors and the subcontrollers as the CAN network independent nodes, the network induced delay and packet loss rate on the system control performance are studied by simulation. The results show that the simulation method can be used for designing the communication network of the vehicle.		Wei Yu;Ning Sun	2016	J.

11cfc442c6cc97871b038c738925e01fc1954f0a	modeling and density estimation of an urban freeway network based on dynamic graph hybrid automata	piecewise affine linear system;switched state observer;dynamic graph hybrid automata;density estimation;urban freeway network	In this paper, in order to describe complex network systems, we firstly propose a general modeling framework by combining a dynamic graph with hybrid automata and thus name it Dynamic Graph Hybrid Automata (DGHA). Then we apply this framework to model traffic flow over an urban freeway network by embedding the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) into the DGHA. With a modeling procedure, we adopt a dual digraph of road network structure to describe the road topology, use linear hybrid automata to describe multi-modes of dynamic densities in road segments and transform the nonlinear expressions of the transmitted traffic flow between two road segments into piecewise linear functions in terms of multi-mode switchings. This modeling procedure is modularized and rule-based, and thus is easily-extensible with the help of a combination algorithm for the dynamics of traffic flow. It can describe the dynamics of traffic flow over an urban freeway network with arbitrary topology structures and sizes. Next we analyze mode types and number in the model of the whole freeway network, and deduce a Piecewise Affine Linear System (PWALS) model. Furthermore, based on the PWALS model, a multi-mode switched state observer is designed to estimate the traffic densities of the freeway network, where a set of observer gain matrices are computed by using the Lyapunov function approach. As an example, we utilize the PWALS model and the corresponding switched state observer to traffic flow over Beijing third ring road. In order to clearly interpret the principle of the proposed method and avoid computational complexity, we adopt a simplified version of Beijing third ring road. Practical application for a large-scale road network will be implemented by decentralized modeling approach and distributed observer designing in the future research.	algorithm;anatomy, regional;automata theory;cns disorder;cefotiam;complex network;computational complexity theory;decentralised system;directed graph;dual;embedding;freeway;graph - visual representation;hybrid automaton;linear function;linear system;logic programming;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerous;piecewise linear continuation;two-hybrid system techniques;density;disease transmission	Yangzhou Chen;Yuqi Guo;Ying Wang	2017		10.3390/s17040716	control engineering;simulation;density estimation;computer science;statistics		54.11389793240743	-13.322905524066186	49287

The main contribution of this paper is to develop an algorithm that is able to design this fault-tolerant controller systematically in an optimal sense. The optimality is in terms of minimizing the number of resources required for fault detection and identification at initialization (i.e., the fault-tolerant controller has the minimum initial state).

According to the PMSM mathematical model and the sliding mode observer (SMO) control theory, the SMO model is given. The stability condition of SMO is studied to make sure that the observer is stable in converging to the sliding mode plane. Compared to conventional sliding mode observer, the proposed observer based on sliding mode observer and phase-locked loop can effectively reduce the influence of the sliding mode chattering and improve the precision of the rotor position estimation. This paper analyses the structure and performance of the proposed SMO strategy with Simulink-based simulation. The simulation results show that the novel sliding mode observer is more effective than the conventional method.	control system;control theory;mathematical model;phase-locked loop;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;simulink	Narisha;Zhiwei Li;Henan Qiu;Xudong Wang	2017	IJES	10.1504/IJES.2017.10002586	real-time computing;sliding mode control;state observer	Robotics	65.94480428695698	-11.628423027051694	49423

An approach to reliability analysis is proposed based on the use of entropy which is invariant with respect to homogeneous coordinate frame transformations. This yields an easily calculated set of entropy constraints that must be met to ensure reliable operation. An example problem illustrates the technique and presents general results for visual positioning. >		John E. McInroy;George N.

This allows comparison of different move-blocking regimes based on cost performance only, without considering domain size also.

(2000)) employing empirically determined lift/drag curves have been shown to accurately model both the transient and steady state response of marine thrusters. This paper first reports on the development of an asymptotically stable open-loop thrust tracking controller that exploits this new nonlinear thruster model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stable model based thrust control law reported for this class of marine thrusters.	nonlinear system;thrust	Ralf Bachmayer;Louis L.

This categorization is based on the number of cusp points of quaternary, binary, generic and non-generic manipulators. It was found three subsets of manipulators with 0, 2 or 4 cusp points and one homotopy class for generic quaternary manipulators. This classification allows us to define the design parameters for which the manipulator is cuspidal or not, i.e., for which the manipulator can or cannot change posture without meeting a singularity, respectively.	categorization;poor posture;singularity project	Maher Baili;Philippe Wenger;Damien Chablat	2007	CoRR		topology;control theory;mathematics;geometry	Robotics	69.77363688452733	-20.6762856209176	49618

Open-loop playback of high frequencies offers a promising way to generate rich contact transients and textures, but complex high frequency dynamics cause distortion. This paper explores the equalization and dynamic decoupling of multi-DOF haptic devices for accurate open-loop playback. Toward this end, a user study is performed to determine the frequency limit of human force direction sensitivity at 35Hz. This information together with experimental system identification techniques is used to develop a strategy for equalization in different frequency bands. Finally, MIMO equalization is accomplished through online simulation of the system model under the control of an LQR tracking controller	control theory;coupling (computer programming);distortion;equalization (communications);experimental system;frequency band;frequency response;haptic technology;high frequency content measure;mimo;mimo-ofdm;psychoacoustics;state-space representation;system analysis;system identification;usability testing;voice coil;web-based simulation	Robert Wilson;Sonny Chan;John Kenneth Salisbury;Günter Niemeyer	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5650383	human–robot interaction;control engineering;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;haptic technology;statistics	Robotics	69.71401831052924	-13.201894173489436	49686

Different from traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC) strategies, the performance index of the outer controller is constructed by integrating the entropy and mean value of the tracking error with the constraints on control energy. The inner controller is implemented by a proportional controller. Compared with the conventional PID-P and MPC-P cascade control methods, the proposed cascade control strategy can effectively decrease fluctuations of hydro-turbine speed under non-Gaussian disturbance conditions in practical hydropower plants. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed cascade control method.	algorithm;control system;control theory;entropy (information theory);experiment;optimal control;pid;portable document format;simulation	Mifeng Ren;Di Wu;Jianhua Zhang;Man Jiang	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16063136	controller;control theory	Robotics	59.854313524765516	-7.413095054999612	49697

The proposed control approach comprises a neural controller and a robust compensator. The neural controller using a wavelet neural network (WNN) is the main controller based on backstepping method; and the parameters of WNN are on-line tune by adaptation laws from the Lyapunov stability theorem. The robust compensator is designed to dispel the approximation error, so the asymptotic stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, a mass-spring-damper system is performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	approximation error;artificial neural network;game controller;lyapunov fractal;online and offline;wavelet;wnn	Chiung-Chou Liao;Chiu-Hsiung Chen;Ya-Fu Peng;Sung-Chi Wu	2013	2013 9th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2013.6606219	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.10290534831545	-9.787502219467044	49709

It proposes a new methodology for robot ranking, which is based on estimation of the end-effector resistance to cutting forces for several machining tasks, which are optimally located within the robot workspace. To cover wide range of applications, a set of isotropic, quasi-isotropic and extended benchmark tasks are considered. It is shown that regardless of the benchmark problem, seral manipulators are preferable for small and medium tasks while quasi-serial ones' better suit large-dimensional tasks. The proposed technique was applied for the comparison analysis of 10 industrial robots of both serial and quasi-serial architectures with similar working radius and payload of about 200 kg.	benchmark (computing);industrial robot;robot end effector;workspace	Alexandr Klimchik;Evgeni Magid;Anatoly Pashkevich	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759063	simulation;machining;engineering;engineering drawing;force	Robotics	71.65034901967029	-21.588353443443907	49750
