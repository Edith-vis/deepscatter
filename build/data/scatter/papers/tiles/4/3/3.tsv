The structure can be easily implemented and modified with conventional GNSS receivers, and the new frequency discriminator has absolute linearity in a wide pull in range. The principle and performance of the method are described and analyzed in detail. Simulation and field test with a software receiver show that this method can effectively track a weak signal compared with other presented methods in an open loop.	carrier frequency;discriminator;numerical analysis;numerically controlled oscillator;satellite navigation;simulation	Wenfei Guo;Kunlun Yan;Hongping Zhang;Xiaoji Niu;Chuang Shi	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2350489	frequency synthesizer;telecommunications;control theory	Visualization	56.92369809321399	68.25718241496216	5972

In this paper, a new blind classification method is proposed for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with unknown or variable signal to noise ratios. The algorithm is capable to adapt to the input SNR. In this algorithm, a passive-aggressive learning algorithm is applied to high confidence classified samples in a general classifier that is trained by different SNR signals. The selection of appropriate features helps the general system to work for a set of initial samples of each class. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm approaches to a well-trained system in the target SNR, even in low SNRs.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;detection theory;modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hamidreza Hosseinzadeh;Farbod Razzazi;Afrooz Haghbin	2012	2012 6th IEEE International Conference Intelligent Systems	10.1109/IS.2012.6335131	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition	Robotics	54.014738685402406	82.70384389078511	8369

Conventional Kalman-based tracking methods often require time, amplitude, phase information and their derivatives for each receiver antenna, however its location estimation accuracy does not become good even with many transmitting pulses. The present method employs relative phase-difference information and nonuniform pulse generation scheme, which can greatly reduce the number of transmitting pulses while preserving the tracking accuracy.

f77dc8d72e29ec1f825cf06e26cf028f6807d957	robust high resolution time of arrival estimation for indoor wlan ranging		This paper proposes a novel robust high resolution time of arrival (TOA) estimation method for IEEE 802.11g/n range estimation in indoor environments. The algorithm identifies the TOA of ranging symbols by means of baseband signal processing using a single 802.11 channel. A subsample signal model provides high timing resolution. The CLEAN deconvolution algorithm, coupled with a parameter optimization step, provides robustness to multipath. Two ranging symbols are investigated: the 802.11 standard long training sequence and an impulsive symbol. In real-world wireless line of sight experiments, at ranges of up to 25 m, the method when applied to impulsive symbols was found to provide median ranging errors of 0.34 and 0.93 m with directional and omnidirectional antennas, respectively.	algorithm;autocorrelation;baseband;clean (algorithm);computational complexity theory;deconvolution;distortion;experiment;fractal antenna;image resolution;mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;time of arrival	Ahmed Makki;Abubakr Siddig;Chris J.

Scanning of this phase gradient at a controlled rate /spl beta/ at a receiver converts it to a frequency shift /spl delta//spl omega/ proportional to /spl omega//spl beta/r, enabling r to be determined without use of time or phase reference. This enables us to introduce source distance as the basic dimension, instead of carrier frequency and spread spectrum encoding, for separation of signals from multiple sources. The entire bandwidth above a minimum wavelength that depends on the spacing between transmitters can be used by each transmitter for dedicated communication with the given receiver. Preliminary results using DSP implementation, and limits of the technique are discussed.	bandwidth (signal processing);carrier frequency;digital signal processor;gradient;multiplexing;transmitter;wave packet	Vdot Guruprasad	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424665	transmitter;statistical time division multiplexing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver;spread spectrum;bandwidth allocation	Visualization	57.78274291531718	75.00717818874574	10093

In such radars, each element is capable of transmitting a different waveform; in this paper, we focus on modifying a multiplicative weight at each transmitter to improve detection performance. Several authors have considered the problem of optimizing the transmit weights and the receive filter generally to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Crucially, these previous works assumed a priori knowledge of the required second-order statistics. In this regard, we make two key contributions: First, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to estimate these required statistics using only signals received in previous coherent processing intervals (CPIs). Essentially, we estimate the transmit interference covariance matrix using receive data. The estimation does not assume any specific structure for the clutter covariance matrix. By using the most recent CPIs in the design, our approach makes it possible to track changes in the interference environment, and, therefore, adaptively design the transmit code in real time. Second, we introduce reduced-dimension processing for transmit adaptivity. As in the case of receive space-time adaptive processing (STAP), it is crucial to be able to perform filter design with only a limited number of available training samples. While reduced-dimension processing is well established for receive adaptivity, as we will see, transmit reduced-dimension processing requires a completely different formulation. We consider transmit code design for a single look angle-Doppler bin and also for a range of Doppler bins in the case that the target Doppler shift is unknown. Finally, we present simulation results, in the context of phase-perturbed propagation and airborne radars, to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods.	airborne ranger;beamforming;clutter;coherence (physics);communications satellite;doppler effect;filter design;human body weight;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;radar;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;space-time adaptive processing;transmitter;waveform	Mahdi Shaghaghi;Raviraj S.

The results obtained so far show a significant decrease of the required gate count when compared with a standard LMS implementation, while increasing the ANC bandwidth and signal to noise (S/N) ratio. This novel adaptive noise canceller is then useful for enhancing the S/N ratio of data collected from sensors (or sensor arrays) working in noisy environment, or dealing with potentially weak signals.	algorithm;field-programmable gate array;gate count;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Antonio Di Stefano;Alessandro Scaglione;Costantino Giaconia	2005	Seventh International Workshop on Computer Architecture for Machine Perception (CAMP'05)	10.1109/CAMP.2005.22	electronic engineering;real-time computing;speech recognition;computer science	Arch	54.661441240625294	78.2886960911056	20621

Based on the study of OPNET pipeline stages, this paper designs and implements a set of practical HF channel pipeline stages, with modification of pipeline stages as Receiver Group, Closure, Propagation Delay, Receiver Power and Background Noise. A typical HF communication network has been simulated by taking the modified HF channel pipeline stages into consideration.

The collision probability due to a random selection of CDMA codes and TDMA channels bounds the number of IDs successfully transmitted to a reader during a limited time frame. However, theoretical analysis showed that the re-transmission greatly reduced the collision probability and that an ID error rate of 2.5 × 10−9 could be achieved when 1, 000 ID tags responded within a time frame of 400 msec in ideal communication channels. The proposed collision-resistive communication scheme for a thousand multiplexed channels was modeled on a discrete-time digital expression and an FPGA-based emulator was built to evaluate a practical ID error rate under the presence of background noise in communication channels. To achieve simple anti-noise communication in a multiple-response RFID system, as well as unurged re-transmission of ID data, adjusting of correlator thresholds provides a significant improvement to the error rate. Thus, the proposed scheme does not require a reader to request ID transmission to erroneously responding tags. A reader also can lower noise influence by using correlator thresholds, since the scheme multiplexes IDs by CDMA-based communication. The effectiveness of the re-transmission was confirmed experimentally even in noisy channels, and the ID error rate derived from the emulation was 1.9 × 10−5. The emulation was useful for deriving an optimum set of RFID system parameters to be used in the design of mixed analog and digital integrated circuits for RFID communication. key words: RFID, anti-collision, TD-CDMA, low-power, impulse modulation, inductive coupling, hardware emulation	code;cyclic redundancy check;emulator;error detection and correction;experiment;field-programmable gate array;inductive coupling;integrated circuit;low-power broadcasting;modulation;multiplexing;radio-frequency identification	Yohei Fukumizu;Shuji Ohno;Makoto Nagata;Kazuo Taki	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.2.408	radio-frequency identification;real-time computing;td-cdma;inductive coupling;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;computer security;hardware emulation	Security	54.52298051638182	78.52127160621167	23481

This paper presents an algorithm which improves the simulation speed of estimating EMC of RCE in a complex EME, based on a stage by stage frequency-energy filtering criterion. This algorithm considers different interference types including: Blocking and intermodulation. It consist of the following steps: simplified energy criterion where filtration is based on comparing the free space interference level to the industrial noise, frequency criterion which checks whether the interfering emissions characteristic overlap with the receiver's channels characteristic and lastly the detailed energy criterion where the real channel interference level is compared to the noise level. In each of these stages some interference cases are filtered out by the relevant criteria. This reduces the total number of dual and different combinations of RCE involved in the tedious detailed energy analysis and thus provides an improved simulation speed.	algorithm;arbitrary code execution;electromagnetic environment;encrypted media extensions;iso 10303;interference (communication);intermodulation;noise (electronics);quality of service;remote component environment (rce) (was: reconfigurable computing environment);simulation	Clement Temaneh-Nyah	2013	2013 European Modelling Symposium	10.1109/EMS.2013.19	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Arch	58.980174671735654	63.73291814799189	23791

The approach is direct in the sense that the positions are estimated directly from the base-band signals received with an antenna array. The difficult problem of estimating the delays and directions of arrivals of all multi-path components is eliminated. Our new approach rather exploits the full space-time structure in the multi-channel model for the multi-path signals. The method overcomes the limitations of purely spatial array signal processing concerning the number of resolvable path and solves the extremely demanding data association problem inherent in conventional localization procedures. Furthermore, the approach is blind with respect to the knowledge of the transmitted signals. It solely exploits the knowledge of the pulse shaping filter and assumes that the locations of the main scatterers relative to the receiving antenna are known. Furthermore, results for the detection of the number of mobile stations in a multi-path environment are presented.	algorithm;channel (communications);correspondence problem;multi-user;noise shaping;pulse shaping;signal processing	Bruno Demissie	2011	14th International Conference on Information Fusion		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;smart antenna;communication;sensor array	Robotics	56.781720291952325	77.53860393028059	23866

Four powerful ML's multi-classifiers (ensemble) algorithms (Boosting (Bos), Bagging (Bag), Stacking (Stack) and Random Forest (RF)) were used at the receiver side of the OFDM system to detect if the received noisy signal contained impulse noise or not. The ML's ensembles were trained with the Middleton Class A noise model which was the noise model used in the OFDM system. In terms of prediction accuracy, the results obtained from the four ML’s Ensembles techniques show that ML can be used to predict impulse noise in communication systems, in particular OFDM.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;ensemble learning;high-level programming language;impulse noise (audio);machine learning;multiplexing;radio frequency;random forest;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;stacking	Ali N.

With the help of a CRM operation, a reconstructed wideband signal with a narrow pulse width can be obtained. Compared with the traditional time domain spectrum reconstruction technique (TSRT), ISRT is less time-consuming since much less samples are needed. Compared with the traditional frequency domain spectrum reconstruction technique (FSRT), the reconstructed signal is a chirp signal, which has no limitation on the subsequent imaging algorithm. What is more, processing steps of ISRT are optimized, and the computational burden is less than that of TSRT and FSRT. Both simulation results and real data processing have verified the validity of ISRT. 本文提出了一种改进的频谱重建方法。此方法仅在频域就可以对各子带信号进行精确的频谱重建, 这大大降低了频谱重建的运算量。同时, 此方法通过对匹配滤波后的子带信号进行调频率调制来降低频谱重建后宽带信号的点数, 这又大大提高了此方法的效率。因此, 相对于传统的时域和频域频谱重建方法, 此方法具有更高的效率, 并且其重建得到的宽带chirp信号具有较少的点数, 这有利于降低后续SAR成像处理的运算量。	algorithm;chirp;computation;computer simulation;nyquist rate;pulse-width modulation;simulation	Wenbin Gao;Zegang Ding;Donglin Zhu;Tao Zeng;Teng Long	2015	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-015-5329-3	telecommunications;computer science	Embedded	55.0071039858704	79.54456766374236	23992

By constructing a steering matrix with each column vector corresponding to the steering vector of a selective beam and a constraint vector with each entry equal to the gain of a selective beam, we can achieve an adaptive array beamformer with multiple-beam constraints. For coping with the performance degradation due to the presence of coherent jammers, a matrix reconstruction scheme in conjunction with an iterative algorithm is presented to alleviate the coherent jamming e!ect.

Receiver configuration requires selecting four parameters that determine detection performance and adaptation rate. A semi-analytic method of determining the false alarm rate is proposed. This procedure avoids time consuming simulations to find the false alarm rate when comparing receiver configurations. It also significantly reduces the parameter search space for finding detection probability. An example worked using this technique shows that good detector performance and rapid adaptation are both available with properly selected detector parameters.	constant false alarm rate;detection theory;maxima;nonlinear system;semiconductor industry;simulation	Bruce F.

SAT-AIS is a joint initiative from the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to define a sustainable space-based system that will provide AIS data to institutional organisations and other entities. The AIS communication system was not originally designed for a capture from space. As a consequence, a space-based AIS receiver faces severe technical issues, in particular a drastic amount of co-channel interferences. Astrium is working under ESA contract on an affordable SAT-AIS solution with a strong emphasis on a high-performance AIS payload and processing chain. We propose a multi-antenna AIS receiver coupled with an adaptive multi-user processing solution suited to maximize the detection of AIS messages. The proposed algorithm implements a number of diversity techniques to take advantage of the variability of received signal characteristics, especially the Direction of Arrival (DOA), incident polarization, Doppler spread, signal strength and path delay.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;beamforming;direction of arrival;esa;entity;multi-user;polarization (waves);spatial variability	Mathieu Picard;Mohamed Rabie Oularbi;Grégory Flandin;Sébastien Houcke	2012	2012 6th Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems Conference (ASMS) and 12th Signal Processing for Space Communications Workshop (SPSC)	10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2012.6333088	simulation;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	EDA	57.486107227085206	65.00379403673708	25837

I N T R O D U C T I O N In digital communication systems, data symbols are transmitted at regular intervals. Time dispersion caused by nonideal channel frequency response characteristics, or by multipath transmission, may create inter-symbol interference (ISI), and it has become a limiting factor in many communication environments. Furthermore, the nonlinear ISI that often arises in high-speed communication channels degrades the performance of the overall communication system [1]. To overcome the effects of nonlinear ISI and to achieve high-speed reliable communication, nonlinear channel equalization is necessary. The conventional approach to linear or nonlinear channel equalization requires an initial training period, with a known data sequence, to learn the channel characteristics. In contrast to standard equalization methods, the so-called blind (or self-recovering) equalization methods operate without a training sequence [2]. Because of its superiority, the blind equalization method 0895-7177/05/$ see front matter ~) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The principal advantages of the Ultra Tightly Couple (UTC) structure is that a Doppler frequency derived from the INS is integrated with the tracking loops to improve the receiver tracking capability. The Doppler frequency shift is calculated and fed to the GPS tracking loops for elimination of the effect of stochastic errors caused by the Doppler frequency. The navigation information from INS can be converted into the Doppler information, which can be integrated with the GPS tracking loops to mitigate the Doppler on the GPS signal, resulting in the threshold improvement, thereby improving the overall system performance. An algorithm for bridging GPS outages using the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for providing better prediction of Doppler residual between GPS and prediction in order to maintain regular operation of the navigation system.

Traditional robust linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) STAP method uses magnitude constraint to maintain the mainlobe of the STAP beamformer. In this paper, a joint magnitude and phase constrained (MPC) STAP method is proposed with the phase constraint incorporated in the response vector of the beamformer. The explicit expression of the phase constraint is derived by exploring the conjugate symmetric characteristic of the adaptive weights. With joint magnitude and phase constraints imposed on several discrete points in the mainlobe region, the MPC-STAP approach has good robustness against target contamination. In addition, the linear-phase response can be guaranteed by the proposed method, which provides distortionless response in both spatial and temporal domains. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A novel joint magnitude and phase constrained space-time adaptive processing (STAP) method is proposed.The explicit expression of the phase constraint is derived, which guarantees distortionless response of STAP radar.The proposed method is robust against target contamination.	space-time adaptive processing	Jingwei Xu;Shengqi Zhu;Guisheng Liao;Lei Huang	2015	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2015.08.011	mathematical optimization;real-time computing;space-time adaptive processing;control theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	54.84963219376046	77.18114040077202	25964

Narrowband interference from other applications is a significant problem. In this paper we investigate a number of signal processing schemes to detect and overcome one or more relatively narrowband interferers. By making use of the limited time duration of the channel impulse response we are able to recover the TOA with high accuracy in most cases, even when the channel frequency response has large amount of missing data due to interference. Our proposed approach treats the corrupted channel frequency response as a non-uniform sampling of the true frequency response and draws on ideas from compressive sensing to recover an estimate of the missing frequency response samples. We also consider the computational complexity of a variety of potential TOA recovery methods and examine their effectiveness as a function of the interferer bandwidth. We demonstrate our method using real data measured in non line-of-sight conditions in a typical office building.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;bandwidth (signal processing);compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;frequency response;geolocation;interference (communication);line-of-sight (missile);missing data;multipath propagation;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;software propagation;time of arrival	David Humphrey;Mark Hedley	2010	2010 IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506535	multipath propagation;frequency response;missing data;telecommunications;computer science;non-line-of-sight propagation;noise;multiple signal classification;time of arrival;signal processing;geolocation;communication complexity;interference;computational complexity theory;compressed sensing;bandwidth;statistics	Mobile	56.257951504061346	78.0578636260144	29070

16a3583706a65d33f3a092206435f9b56ec33dfa	direction of arrival estimation with uniform planar array		Analog/digital/hybrid beamformer/receiver designs for mmWave communication have attracted great research attentions including directional of arrival (DOA) estimation. Traditional investigation of smart antennas for wireless communications has primarily focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antennas and there are little attention and literature on other smart antennas array topologies. Those DOA estimation algorithms designed for ULA (with received signal as a vector) can not immediately be applied for uniform planar array (UPA) structure (with received signal as a matrix). In this work, start with UPA DOA estimation system model, we process the received matrix through a simple vectorization process to construct a received vector. With theoretical proof of the vectorization process equivalence, conventional DOA estimation based on ULA can easily be applied to UPA structure. We apply several DOA estimation algorithms to UPA for one DOA arriving signal or multiple DOA arriving signals, with both perfect known autocorrelation matrix and estimated autocorrelation matrix through sample averaging, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOA estimation process for UPA.	algorithm;autocorrelation matrix;automatic vectorization;beamforming;charge-coupled device;direction of arrival;emoticon;smart antenna;turing completeness	Lili Wei;Qian Li;Geng Wu	2017	2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2017.8287882	electronic engineering;planar array;autocorrelation matrix;network topology;wireless;matrix (mathematics);algorithm;direction of arrival;computer science;vectorization (mathematics);smart antenna	EDA	57.04636367943728	77.90295369107095	29472

Since the modulated signal has a constant envelope, optical amplifiers can be used to boost the signal power along the bus to a level sufficient for reliable detection. Also, since a single laser source is used, a higher quality device (for example, with small linewidth) is more readily affordable. This system is analyzed to determine the limits of performance due to noise. The analysis indicates that many wideband signals could be accommodated if noise sources only, rather than signal distortions caused by nonideal optical devices, were the limiting factor. For example, with optical amplifiers distributed along the bus, this system can support 1000 10-MHz users. >	wavelength-division multiplexing	Leonard J. Cimini	1989	IEEE Trans.

00a6968bb22a6deeb0a1e2e92943fe15361ab9a0	performance limits and geometric properties of narrowband array localization		Location-aware networks have been of great importance and interest in many applications for both civil and military use since recent years. This paper studies the wireless network consisting of several anchor nodes and one agent equipped with an antenna array whose position is to be estimated in a far-field multipath environment. To exploit all the information in the received signal, the localization accuracy is determined directly based on the waveform rather than the metrics extracted from the signal, as well as the narrowband system assumption treating baseband signal and carrier frequency differently. Then the Cramér-Rao bound on localization accuracy shows that the localization information can be decomposed into distance and direction parts. Furthermore, the anchor-agent and antennaarray geometries are also studied in this paper, which concludes that uniformly circular oriented array (UCOA) and anchors with diversified direction are optimal in localization, respectively.

The tests, performed by the Communications Research Centre Canada (CRC), were to determine the ability of the receivers to maintain successful reception on a desired DTV channel in the presence of a single or double adjacent/taboo channel interference. As the FCC has also performed tests with similar purposes on a variety of consumer grade DTV receivers, some comparisons are also made between the CRC and FCC test results. The results of this experiment may be helpful in providing a better perspective in devising technical criteria for the sharing of the TV bands with other services. An example of such services is the TV Band Devices (TVBD), which is suggested to operate in the """"white spaces"""" of the TV bands. TVBDs must protect DTV or any other services (incumbents) that are already allowed to operate in the TV spectrum, and can not claim protection from them."""	atsc standards;cyclic redundancy check;interference (communication);tv tuner card;television channel frequencies;white spaces (radio)	Khalil Salehian;Yiyan Wu;Gilles Gagnon	2010	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2009.2039688	electronic engineering;multi-band device;digital television;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;white spaces	Visualization	60.14042440490195	62.85829912208394	32848

Canonical signal features for this methodology are identified. A consistency requirement is proposed and used to develop a general approach for determining appropriate class prototypes in discriminant space. It is shown that the class indicator, which is a commonly used class prototype in pattern recognition applications, will often violate the consistency requirement. The general results are used to obtain a solution to a previously posed complexity-performance trade-off problem for matched-filter-tapped-delay-line receivers for serial signal classification in an M -ary data transmission system.	prototype	William A.

In multiuser time-varying environments this fact becomes even more important because acquisition and tracking performance can heavily degrade communication reliability. In this paper a new neural network estimator is presented, and it is compared to the performance of a fuzzy logic acquisition estimator and stability acquisition estimator in the multiresolutive acquisition system. The new neural network acquisition estimator improves the results for both fuzzy logic and stability estimators, through the estimation of the probability of being acquired and the signal to noise ratio for single user and multiuser communication.	artificial neural network;fuzzy logic;multi-user;signal-to-noise ratio	Rosa Maria Alsina Pages;Clàudia Mateo Segura;Joan Claudi Socoró;Marc Deumal Herraiz	2008	2008 Eighth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems	10.1109/HIS.2008.29	electronic engineering;computer science;machine learning;statistics	Robotics	54.42605457046505	82.3021213407761	34189

1cea29ef23150132d58d52d5358ad41a1611d314	tracking of gps parameters using particle filter		For proper functioning of the GPS system, tracking the code and carrier effectively in GPS receivers is important. The time taken for a signal to propagate from a satellite is calculated by a GPS receiver by analyzing the “pseudo random code” it generates, to that of code generated in the signal from the satellite. So it is important to effectively track the code before they become out of phase. The tracking medium synchronizes consecutively, the acquired satellite signal with the code and carrier frequencies that are locally generated. To track these parameters Kalman filter is used. To improve the efficiency of estimation and to obtain faster and accurate results particle filter (PF) is proposed, which further reduces the complexity as compared to that of the Kalman filter.		M.

Several range-limiting factors are discussed and a cable utility design for two representative two-wire digital subscriber transmission systems is presented. The two transmission systems are time compression multiplexing (TCM) and echo canceller (EC), utilizing the AMI line code and full cosine rolloff line equalization for both systems. A new impulse noise evaluation is applied to cable utility design, because impulse noise is one of the most stringent range-limiting factors, especially for TCM in utilizing existing subscriber loops. Comparison of TCM with EC is also carried out according to various range-limiting factors. As a result, it is noted that the 320 kbit/s line bit rate TCM is more applicable in NTT's exchange area coverage than the 160 kbit/s EC to achieve the 2B + D basic interface transmission.

An orthogonal waveform set design method of time-stagger coding and hyperbolic coding stepped-frequency linear frequency modulated (SFLFM) pulse train is proposed in this paper. First, the transmitting time of SFLFM subpulses is time-stagger coded to decrease the autocorrelation sidelobe peaks (ASP) and cross-correlation peaks (CCP) when |τ|≥Tp|τ|≥Tp, where τ   is the time delay and TpTp is the subpulse duration. Then the frequency firing order of the SFLFM subpulses for every waveform is hyperbolic coded to lower the CCP when |τ|<Tp|τ|<Tp. When the subpulse number of SFLFM pulse train is N  , the ASP and CCP of the designed orthogonal waveform set is approximately 1/N1/N. The design procedure of the proposed method is demonstrated via a case study, and the orthogonality of the designed waveform set is verified by simulating the autocorrelation function, cross-correlation function, auto-ambiguity function and cross-ambiguity function.	waveform	Ren-li Zhang;Weixing Sheng;Xiaofeng Ma;Yubing Han	2016	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2016.07.005	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Graphics	57.117004146669395	72.36105511403817	37906

Based on the multi-channel equalization model in the WSN transmission system, various experimental analyses and performance comparisons proved that the convergence rate of the method proposed in this study was higher than that of general existing algorithms. The final experimental analysis proved that the higher the sampling rate was, the higher the convergence rate and the smaller the mean square error would be. The sampling rate had an important effect on the blind equalization, and it was proved that the method proposed in this study had an improved blind equalization algorithm to some extent.	algorithm;artificial neural network;blind equalization;channel (communications);computation;convex function;equalization (communications);information sciences institute;internet of things;local convergence;maxima and minima;network theory;precondition;rate of convergence;signal processing	Wen-Tsai Sung;Sung-Jung Hsiao	2014	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2013.11.002	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;transmission system	ML	56.23843177170819	82.2497493490888	38232

The proposed system utilizes the low complexity adaptive algorithm for interference suppression and beamforming. The constraint condition for the beamforming algorithm is per satellite constraint, which ensures each GNSS satellite has the largest signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR). The adaptive beamforming with restraint is translated into the adaptive filter problem without restraint by generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure, which could be realized easily by adaptive algorithm. It is confirmed by the practical test that the proposed system can suppress interference and form the multi-beam very effectively with low complexity.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;beamforming;constraint algorithm;gsc bus;interference (communication);satellite navigation;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;zero suppression	Xiao-dong Yuan;Jianwei Wan;Zhu Cheng;Bin-bin Shi;Hao Fu	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096831	electronic engineering;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	Robotics	55.498711890011954	76.76447385719761	38925

This phenomenon is particularly important when multiple signals, allocated at different frequencies, pass through nonlinear devices simultaneously. In this paper we extend a known fast counting algorithm (FCA) of intermodulation components and compare it with other counting algorithms. The results obtained show significant improvement on the processing time. The carrier configuration is modelled by using indicator polynomials. We show that the distribution of high order intermodulation products can be computed in a reduced amount of time, by extending the algorithmic results relevant to third order intermodulations. In addition, we notice that in particular situations even order intermodulations are also important. They occupy the adjacent harmonic zones, generally allocated to other services, so that the achievable performance deteriorates. We extend an algorithm which computes the position of even and odd order intermodulations, and we make it faster and computationally more efficient. These results may improve both the optimisation of the spectrum shape and the analysis of the nonlinear effects. Comparisons with some other direct counting algorithms are made in terms of accuracy and speed.	algorithm;amplifier;fast fourier transform;formal concept analysis;intermodulation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;polynomial	Giuseppe Baruffa;Gianluca Reali	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.060080	telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics;intermodulation	Visualization	55.79985285231202	69.56310791699775	39067

In this study, sparse linear array optimal beam synthesis SLA-OBS technology is proposed to improve the capture ability of AIS messages by forming a narrow beam pattern that points in the direction of the desired AIS messages. To capture the desired signal within the narrow beam pattern, the directions of arrival DOA and the number of sources from ships are first estimated. Then, the ideal narrow beam pattern and minimal number of array elements are achieved synchronously with the CPLEX optimal tool. The simulations show that the message detection probability with the proposed method is greater than 95%, even when the situations are very serious, whereas the number of sparse linear antennas is small no more than six.

An array is usually used to enhance processing performance. However, some of the underwater sensors may be floating. In such cases, inaccurate phase calibration can lead conventional array processing to fail. In this paper, we design an underwater bistable network. Bistable systems have the Stochastic Resonance(SR) property, and a bistable network can enhance the SR property, which can improve system performance in low SNR. And in such systems we do not need to calibrate the phase. We give the output SNR in theory and simulation to show its performance.

The former is used to cancel the inverted intensity modulation induced by the XGM effect, which generates a clean optical carrier for the uplink service, while the latter enhances the inverted intensity modulation signal generated by the XGM effect, providing the downlink service.	baseband;centralized computing;demultiplexer (media file);elegant degradation;experiment;modulation;optical carrier transmission rates;optical amplifier;polarization (waves);polarizer;radio over fiber;semiconductor;telecommunications link	Beibei Zhu;Shilong Pan	2013	2013 6th IEEE/International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)	10.1109/ICAIT.2013.6621484	materials science;electronic engineering;pulse-amplitude modulation;telecommunications;intensity modulation;cross-phase modulation;optics;optical performance monitoring;optical amplifier;optical modulation amplitude;optical cross-connect	Robotics	64.53027105691862	60.81747159240754	42130

Unlike the traditional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar which emits coherent waveforms to form a focused beam, the MIMO radar can transmit orthogonal (or incoherent) waveforms. These waveforms can be used to increase the system spatial resolution. The waveforms also affect the range and Doppler resolution. In traditional (SIMO) radars, the ambiguity function of the transmitted pulse characterizes the compromise between range and Doppler resolutions. It is a major tool for studying and analyzing radar signals. Recently, the idea of ambiguity function has been extended to the case of MIMO radar. In this paper, some mathematical properties of the MIMO radar ambiguity function are first derived. These properties provide some insights into the MIMO radar waveform design. Then a new algorithm for designing the orthogonal frequency-hopping waveforms is proposed. This algorithm reduces the sidelobes in the corresponding MIMO radar ambiguity function and makes the energy of the ambiguity function spread evenly in the range and angular dimensions.	algorithm;ambiguity function;angularjs;authorization;code;coherence (physics);frequency-hopping spread spectrum;gate array;ieee xplore;mimo;numerical analysis;radar;simulated annealing;waveform	Chun-Yang Chen;Palghat P.

The navigation filter uses five state variables, three position and two clock states, to create the replica code and carrier measurements for a static test. There are no individual channel states or feedback mechanisms. Closing the individual loops solely through the navigation filter makes this a purely vector method. For short baselines, where differential atmospheric errors are small, the DVPLL can be used on single-frequency data. An L1-only live-sky static test was performed using the method, resulting in a three-dimensional accuracy of 1.3 mm for a zero-baseline and 5.3 mm for an 18.5 m baseline.	baseline (configuration management);closing (morphology);differential phase;feedback;global positioning system;phase-locked loop;rover (the prisoner);satellite navigation;single-frequency network	James Brewer;John Raquet	2016	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2016.140160	electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;engineering;base station;control theory;mathematics;correlation;satellite;remote sensing	Visualization	57.01124861331124	67.7504548092676	48067

VLC in indoor energy management is attractive due to characteristics that data are transferred through light and possible to be spatial security and localization. Variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) especially is suitable for the indoor energy management because of supporting a full dimming range and being implemented simply. This paper proposes a timing tracker for timing synchronization in the VPPM-VLC system. The proposed timing tracker is evolution of the early-late detection to the VPPM-VLC system by considering characteristics of the VPPM-VLC signaling in perspective on the timing tracker. This paper describes design results for a VPPM-VLC receiver with the proposed timing tracker, and presents behavioral simulation results for the verification of the proposed timing tracker. The simulation results shows that the proposed VPPM-VLC timing tracker estimates the timing-offset and compensates timing mismatch through buffer control.	hardware description language;modulation;quality of service;simulation;transmitter;vlc media player	Jin-Doo Jeong;Il-Woo Lee;Jong-Wha Chong	2017	2017 20th International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2017.8301839	architecture;real-time computing;wireless;pulse-position modulation;quality of service;visible light communication;synchronization;energy management;computer science;demodulation	Embedded	54.25142611859727	63.00140497578624	49770

Many crosstalk cancellation techniques have been proposed to help mitigate crosstalk, but whilst they lead to impressive performance gains, their complexity grows with the square of the number of lines within a binder. In binder groups which can carry up to hundreds of lines, this complexity is outside the scope of current implementation. In this paper, we investigate partial crosstalk cancellation for upstream VDSL. The majority of the detrimental effects of crosstalk are typically limited to a small subset of lines and tones. Furthermore, significant crosstalk is often only seen from neighbouring pairs within the binder configuration. We present a number of algorithms which exploit these properties to reduce the complexity of crosstalk cancellation. These algorithms are shown to achieve the majority of the performance gains of full crosstalk cancellation with significantly reduced run-time complexity.	algorithm;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;file binder;time complexity;while	Raphael Cendrillon;Marc Moonen;George Ginis;Katleen Van Acker;Tom Bostoen;Piet Vandaele	2004	EURASIP J.

More attention is paid to the effect of transmit/receive gating. Range blinds are avoided by ensuring the pulse travels to and from the maximum detect range before the next pulse is emitted. It is shown that certain complementary sets with column orthogonality are adequate for our applications. Although the echo is partially suppressed by the gate, the compressed output retains zero range sidelobe performance. Simulation demonstrates that P4 codes are insentivity to Doppler effect in PCICW radars so it can simplify the receiver complexity, and the experiment shows that the sidelobes level are -90dB compared to the mainlobe.	interrupt;processor design	Zhisheng Yan;Biyang Wen;Caijun Wang;Jian Huang;Xiaojing Huang	2010	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.7.1441	electronic engineering;waveform;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;radar	EDA	61.26547749607559	61.048130029317676	53076

c5bf5ccfee7f380206b185027953b295515d86f9	orthogonal wideband hybrid-coding radar waveforms design		To obtain wideband orthogonal waveforms of radar systems with high-range resolution and good correlation properties, this paper proposes two types of orthogonal wideband hybrid-coding waveforms, polyphase discrete frequency (PDF) waveforms and polyphase signed-chirp (PSC) waveforms. Using an intra-pulse hybrid modulation, highrange resolution can be obtained, and good correlation properties between different waveforms are easier to optimize within a larger optimization space. Specifically, good correlation properties of the PDF waveforms are indeed easier to achieve without a loss of range resolution, as occurs with a discrete frequency coding waveform. Compared with polyphase coding waveforms, the signal bandwidth of each PSCwaveform is twice as large as that of sub-pulse chirp signals, and superior correlation properties are obtained. Finally, various designed waveforms optimized by the genetic algorithm are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed wideband hybrid-coding waveforms.	bandwidth (signal processing);chirp;cross-correlation;discrete frequency domain;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;modulation;multi-function printer;polyphase quadrature filter;portable document format;radar;waveform	Libao Wang;Fei Gao;Jia Xu;Dang-wei Wang;Mi He;Junquan Yuan	2017	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-016-0905-6	function generator;telecommunications;electrical engineering;arbitrary waveform generator	Mobile	57.22205143621168	72.58227573604192	55222

The resultant model can achieve accurate results with reasonable speed and can be used readily for a wide range of different situations. In the EDFA CCB both forward and backward amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) are considered. Practical application of the block is demonstrated in the analysis of a four node wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical fiber ring network using EDFAs to compensate the section losses. We find that for such a system non-uniform sampling of the ASE spectrum offers an advantage for reducing storage requirements and running time of the simulation compared with uniform sampling. The CCB is also used in the simulation of a WDM optical fiber communication system using 9 cascaded EDFAs, which are highly saturated, to compensate for the transmission loss of the fiber.

The rake idea is well-known in wireless communications; it involves constructively combining different multipath components that arrive at the receiver antennas. Unlike spread-spectrum signals used in wireless communications, speech signals are not orthogonal to their shifts. Therefore, we focus on the spatial structure, rather than the temporal. Instead of explicitly estimating the channel, we create correspondences between early echoes in time and image sources in space. These multiple sources of the desired and the interfering signal offer additional spatial diversity that we can exploit in the beamformer design. We present several “intuitive” and optimal formulations of acoustic rake receivers, and show theoretically and numerically that the rake formulation of the maximum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio beamformer offers significant performance boosts in terms of noise and interference suppression. Beyond signal-to-noise ratio, we observe gains in terms of the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metric for the speech quality.

A 112 Gb/s PM-QPSK signal is transmitted over a 3200km dispersion-unmanaged link. The intradyne coherent receiver includes single-step digital backpropagation based on the enhanced- SSFM algorithm. In comparison, conventional DBP requires twenty steps to achieve the same performance. An analysis of the computational complexity and structure of the two algorithms reveals that the overall complexity and power consumption of DBP are reduced by a factor of 16 with respect to a conventional implementation, while the computation time is reduced by a factor of 20. As a result, the proposed algorithm enables a practical and effective implementation of DBP in real-time optical receivers, with only a moderate increase of the computational complexity, power consumption, and latency with respect to a simple feed-forward equalizer for dispersion compensation.	algorithm;backpropagation;coherent;computation;computational complexity theory;digital back-propagation;equalization (communications);experiment;gigabyte;nonlinear system;real-time clock;split-step method;time complexity	Marco Secondini;Simon Rommel;Francesco Fresi;Enrico Forestieri;Gianluca Meloni;Luca Potì	2015	2015 International Conference on Optical Network Design and Modeling (ONDM)	10.1109/ONDM.2015.7127275	control engineering;electronic engineering;dispersion;telecommunications;computer science;backpropagation;machine learning;computational complexity theory	Robotics	56.14354786000306	71.09156071978651	57053

In practice, however, this perfect synchronization assumption is not reasonable since modulation classifiers operate in a non-cooperative manner and therefore, the receiver has little prior knowledge about the transmitted signals and no training is available. In this paper, we first address asynchronous MC for high-order QAMs through blind time synchronization. A characteristic function (CF) based approach is proposed to improve the performance of the conventional cumulant method. We then move on to consider asynchronous MC with frequency offset. We propose a hybrid MC scheme based on blind time synchronization, differential processing, and cumulants to solve this difficult problem.	characteristic function (convex analysis);frequency offset;modulation	Qinghua Shi;Yi Gong;Yong Liang Guan	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.214	pulse-amplitude modulation;characteristic function;quadrature amplitude modulation;telecommunications;computer science;frequency offset;self-clocking signal;control theory;statistics;quadrature modulation;cumulant	Metrics	54.29103115826373	82.25915742352007	58291

Exact antenna beam pointing and tracking of moving targets are thereby key requirements for the relay satellite. In this work we propose an adaptive calibration and beamforming methodology based on least mean squares (LMS) which is suitable for a GEO data relais. The target System consists of the combination of a high gain reflector fed by a digitally steerable patch antenna array. The proposed method is first presented by numerical co-simulation of the antenna and the calibration algorithm. The results are then validated in an outdoor experimental setup with all digital signal processing implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We demonstrate the tracking ability and pointing performance of the digitally enhanced reflector antenna with gain fluctuations smaller than 3 dB over a field of view of 2.9°. The demonstrated performance shows that the digitally enhanced reflector antenna is a suitable candidate for long distance space communications.	beamforming;relay	Andreas Winterstein;Lukasz A.

Using a cascade architecture of the CM array with a series of adaptive signal cancelers, we derive a parallel set of constrained beamformers. The canceler weights provide estimates of the direction vectors of the captured signals across the cascade stages, which are used in a parallel implementation of the linearly constrained CM (LCCM) array. Since the direction vectors are obtained directly fromthe canceler weights, the hybrid implementation does not require prior knowledge of the array response matrix. If the source signals are sufficiently separated in angle, then they can be captured individually across the parallel stages. When the sources are correlated, the cascade CM array does not completely cancel the captured signals, and previous versions of the parallel CMarray do not always capture different sources across the stages. These problems are handled by the proposed hybrid LCCM architecture based on the signal canceler constraints. Computer simulations for example cochannel scenarios are provided to illustrate some properties of the system.	modulus of continuity;multistage amplifier;simulation	Vishwanath Venkataraman;John J.

960618c186542b250244bd002b702442039afdd9	a bds interference suppression technique based on linear phase adaptive iir notch filters	adaptive linear phase iir notch filter;correlation peak distortion;interference suppression;non-linear phase compensation	The continuous wave interferences (CWIs) and the narrow-band interferences (NBIs) have significantly impacted the acquisition, tracking and positioning accuracy of Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) receivers. As an interference suppression technology with a simple structure and low hardware cost, the adaptive infinite-duration impulse response (IIR) notch filter has been widely employed in the receivers to mitigate the CWIs and the NBIs. However, the nonlinear phase characteristics introduced by the IIR notch filters into the navigation receivers, may cause the distortion of navigation signals. It also leads to amplitude and phase distortion of the correlation peak in acquisition and loop tracking, which consequently brings on positioning errors in the measurement domain. This problem, however, has been ignored by many previous papers. Meanwhile, some other researchers came up with the idea of equalizers and all-pass networks compensating the distortion, which is also highly infeasible. Therefore, we propose a new method of an adaptive linear phase IIR notch filter with low hardware cost which is composed of three parts—the complex IIR notch filters, the IIR linear phase structure, and the adaptive and variable step-size algorithms. Applying this method, interference suppression and the correlation peak distortion compensation can be achieved with a modest increase hardware cost. This paper compares the performance of the new method with other IIR filters in both CWI and NBI scene and presents the effects of its parameters on the anti-jamming performance. Simulation results show that the proposed module has better anti-jamming performance in NBI scene and can compensate for the correlation peak distortion in the meantime.	adaptive algorithm;angle closure glaucoma;beidou navigation satellite system;block code;cdisc basic data structure dataset;catastrophic interference;conceptualization (information science);convergence (action);data curation;diamond-blackfan anemia 1;digital curation;electronic counter-countermeasure;impacted tooth;infinite impulse response;interference (communication);large;linear phase;narrow band imaging;nonlinear system;paper;phase distortion;radio jamming;rate of convergence;satellite navigation;simulation;vena cava filters;zero suppression;lobe	Hongbo Zhao;Yinan Hu;Hua Sun;Wenquan Feng	2018		10.3390/s18051515	electronic engineering;engineering;linear phase;impulse response;continuous wave;amplitude;phase distortion;distortion;band-stop filter;infinite impulse response	Vision	57.471235203600926	73.05980156334516	61674

Using a realistic magnetic channel model, MRAN equalizer's performance is compared with the nonlinear neural equalizer of Nair and Moon (1997), referred to as maximum signal-to-distortion ratio (MSDR) equalizer. MSDR equalizer uses a specially designed neural architecture where all the parameters are determined theoretically. Simulation results indicate that MRAN equalizer has better performance than that of MSDR equalizer in terms of higher signal-to-distortion ratios.

Clipping is cutting off the amplitude of the received signal over threshold level without its phase change in order to reduce noise effects. The equalizer compensates for effects of PLC channel. The performance is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER). From simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed clipping scheme has slightly better performance than conventional PLC system. The results of the paper can be applied to PLC systems for smart grid.	bit error rate;clipping (computer graphics);convolutional code;equalization (communications);grid computing;impulse noise (audio);noise reduction;power-line communication;simulation;x.690	Yocheol Kim;Jung Nam Bae;Jin Young Kim	2011	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2011.5735480	embedded system;electronic engineering;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;smart grid	HPC	53.86427811018241	79.81496015878847	67761

Dispersion slope mismatch are precisely compensated for all 14 C+L band channels by writing fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) at appropriate locations. Gain variation among multiple channels can be reduced from 6.5 dB to ±0.2 dB. The overall pump efficiency is 25% improved for C band signals by recycling the residual pump power. With several merits as mentioned, the hybrid EDFA/RFA may find potential applications in WDM long-haul systems and optical networks.	decibel;doping (semiconductor);fiber to the x;l band;loopback;optical amplifier;optical fiber;pumping (computer systems);raman scattering;wavelength-division multiplexing	Shien-Kuei Liaw;Yu-Sheng Huang;Hsin-Kai Hung;Nan-Kuang Chen;Kuei-Chu Hsu;Yi-Lin Yu;Ting Wang;Alina Manshina;Yuriy Tver'yanovic	2010	International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems	10.1109/ICUMT.2010.5676529	erbium;telecommunications;gain;optical pumping;optical amplifier;wavelength-division multiplexing;optical communication;fiber bragg grating	Arch	64.61750095900295	61.00468222366767	67850

It requires at least four satellites to accurately estimate the location. Since GPS signals suffer from various high power interference signals and jammers, we employ efficient interference suppression techniques such as a minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) beamformer or a generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC). Most of them require the GPS signal angle of arrival (AOA), and we utilize the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) or Estimation of Signal Parameter via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) to estimate GPS AOA. However, they must choose the GPS AOAs from all estimated AOAs when existing high power interference signals, because they include AOAs of the interference signals. In this paper, we propose the AOA choosing algorithm for multiple GPS signals in the environment of high-power interference signals. The proposed algorithm is based on the comparison of the estimated AOAs for the received signal before despreading and the output signal of the despreader, for choosing GPS AOAs. A representative computer simulation example is presented to illustrate the performance of the AOA choosing algorithm for the multiple GPS signals.	angle of arrival;beamforming;computer simulation;gps signals;gsc bus;global positioning system;interference (communication);music (algorithm);radio jamming;selection algorithm;zero suppression	Suk-Seung Hwang;Goo-Rak Kwon;Jae-Young Pyun;Seokjoo Shin	2013	2013 Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ACSSC.2013.6810323	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;communication	Mobile	55.85228945734834	76.94329491068778	75065

A serious problem in the design of wideband beamformers with optimized beam patterns is the sensitivity in regard to sensor mismatch, sensor noise, and sensor position errors. Especially in case of beam patterns with high sidelobe attenuation, standard methods like limiting the beamformer coefficient vector norm, or diagonal loading of the sensor correlation matrix are not sufficient to deal with sensor mismatch. Therefore, we use an adaptive calibration of the array sensors. The adaptive calibration filters are trained during a setup phase, and use the same filter structures as the fixed beamformer. After calibration, the filter coefficients are convolved with the optimized beamformer coefficients. Experimental results show the improved performance of arrays with microphones having rather large sensor tolerances.	adaptive filter;beamforming;experiment;mathematical optimization;matthews correlation coefficient;microphone;radiation pattern;second-order cone programming;sensor	Gerhard Doblinger	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;acoustics;engineering;control theory	Robotics	58.811912340818864	73.23316644354703	75716

Unlike previous approaches using sparse arrays, the signals here are assumed to be uncorrelated between multiple arrays which, in fact, may be receiving the same source during different time intervals. This paper presents an approach which jointly exploits spatial-orientation and broadband temporal diversity in order to estimate the spatial spectrum even when the inter-element spacing within each array is greater than a half-wavelength. A dynamical model for the spatial spectrum is employed to formulate a maximum likelihood estimate, which is computed via a recursive version of the expectation-maximization algorithm using data from different arrays. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the ability of the method to suppress spatial grating lobes and increase low SNR target detection in an interference dominated environment.	aliasing;aliasing (computing);dynamical system;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);recursion;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;spatial network;spectral density estimation;tiling array	Jonathan L.

Results show that the proposed method gives a highresolution (1 degree) DOA estimation in an uncorrelated signal environment. The novelty lies in that the MUSIC algorithm is applied to a simplified antenna configuration. Only 1 analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) is used in this antenna, which features low power consumption, low cost, and ease of fabrication. Modifications to the conventional MUSIC algorithm do not bring much additional complexity. The proposed technique is also free from the negative influence by the mutual coupling among antenna elements. Therefore, it offers an economical way to extensively implement smart antennas into the existing wireless mobile communications systems, especially at the power consumption limited mobile terminals such as laptops in wireless networks.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;digital-to-analog converter;direction of arrival;kernel density estimation;laptop;mobile phone;smart antenna	Chen Sun;Nemai Chandra Karmakar	2004	EURASIP J.

For this reason the development of a consistent theory allowing comparative analysis was needed and the concepts of effective C/N0 and SSCs (Spectral Separation Coefficients) were introduced as reliable measures of the interfering degradations. However these parameters were defined only in the analog domain, not considering specific features due to digital synthesis. In this article an alternative derivation for the analog case and the extension to digital devices are provided. The analysis is particularly focused on the acquisition block, the first element of a GNSS receiver that provides a roughly estimated code delay and Doppler shift. The innovative approach presented in the paper is based on the fact that effective C/N0 and SCCs are interpreted in terms of ROCs (Receiver Operative Characteristics) showing how the system performance strictly depends on these parameters.	coefficient;computer simulation;doppler effect;eb/n0;qualitative comparative analysis;satellite navigation;source code control system	Daniele Borio;Letizia Lo Presti;Paolo Mulassano	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;gnss augmentation;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	HPC	55.20172150492296	79.02979498950296	79604

Main features of the new structure are: (i) a single parameter is used to steer the processor to any desired radial distance; (ii) a set of fixed frequency invariant orthogonal beamformers are used to transform array data into beamspace; and (iii) consequently, only a single set of beamspace weights are needed to process wideband beamspace data. The utility of the novel structure is illustrated by applications in interference cancellation and direction/range estimation.	coherence (physics);estimation theory;interference (communication);radial (radio)	Thushara Dheemantha Abhayapala;Darren B.

WDM systems offer many advantages for optical communications with several unique features and requirements in terms of their implementation. This is because the design characteristics and realization of WDM components are crucial and depend particularly on the type of materials used for fabrication. In this article, we investigate the design characteristics of a wavelength demultiplexer using the effective index method in order to determine the propagation constants and field distributions of fundamental modes in dielectric waveguides. In order to analyze the impact of computation method on the design characteristics of the demultiplexer, the effective index is computed by an analytic approach. To this end, we propose a new algorithm for developing an analytic model. We can confirm that design characteristics of WDM components depend on the approach chosen for computing the effective indexes.	computation;dots per inch;interference (communication);multiplexer;numerical analysis;numerical method;requirement;software propagation	Monia Najjar;R.

Existing modulation classification algorithms include classic likelihood approaches and feature-based approaches. In this study, approximate entropy, a nonlinear method to analyze a time series, is proposed as a unique characteristic of a modulation scheme. It is projected as a robust feature to identify signal parameters such as number of symbol levels, pulse lengths, and modulation indices of a continuous phase modulated (CPM) signal. The method is then extended to classify CPM signals with differing pulse shapes, which include raised cosine and Gaussian pulses with varying roll-off factors and bandwidth-time products, respectively. This approximate entropy feature-based approach results in high classification accuracies for a variety of signals and performs robustly even in the presence of synchronization errors and carrier phase offsets. Results are presented in the form of extensive simulations.	algorithm;approximate entropy;artificial intelligence;computational complexity theory;finite difference;instantaneous phase;modulation;nonlinear system;pre-shared key;roll-off;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density estimation;time series	Saurabh U.

7cadb5e798687a6abfb994ec43af6ce2cc097344	cross correlation mitigation for c/a code gps receivers		Many new applications of the Global Positioning System (GPS) are required to process weak GPS signals in the presence of other strong GPS signals. Unfortunately, the 1023 chip Gold code sequences used for the GPS C/A spreading codes limit the dynamic range of a typical GPS receiver such that the power difference between the strongest and weakest GPS signal is limited to less than 21 dB. When this condition is not satisfied, the multiple access interference (MAI) experienced can cause difficulties, ranging from poor measurement quality through to weak signal acquisition and tracking failures. This research investigates cross correlation mitigation (CCM) using digital signal processing performed within the GPS receiver, with the following research contributions: a) Development of a novel CCM technique called Adaptive Orthogonalisation Using Constraints in which the de-spreading code used to track the GPS signal is dynamically adjusted to reject MAI from other strong GPS signals. Computer simulations as well as a full C implementation using a software correlator were performed and the software correlator tested using GPS IF samples captured from a GPS receiver connected to a hardware GPS simulator. The limitations of this technique were also analysed. b) Development of a CCM technique called Delayed Parallel Interference Cancellation (DPIC) in which slave channels are employed to estimate the MAI between pairs of strong and weak signals, with the slave channel outputs subtracted from the weak signal correlations following appropriate scaling. Thorough performance characterisation of the technique was performed using computer simulations. The algorithm was validated using both a C software correlator and a Verilog hardware correlator by processing MAI affected signals generated using a hardware GPS simulator. A comparison of DPIC with other related methods is also provided. c) Development of ‘on-the-fly’ data bit estimation for data bit estimation as required for subtractive type CCM techniques such as DPIC and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). d) Development of a comb-filtering statistical technique to indicate the presence of MAI and continuous wave interference (CWI). Algorithms enabling calculation of detection thresholds using the comb-filter noise statistic (CFNS) are also presented and validated using computer simulations.

This method is by determining the optimal focusing frequency, so that each sub-band of the wideband signal is focused on the optimal focusing frequency by using the focusing matrix, and then the conventional delay-and-sum transmit multi-beam forming algorithm is employed to complete the constant beam-width transmit multi-beam forming. The simulation results show that, in the case of wideband, all the width of main beam array output and the multi-beam pointing can keep in a constant value. The performance of the transmit multi-beam forming by using the optimal focusing frequency is better than by the other frequency.	beamforming	Qi Zhang;Yunhao Li;Ying Xiong;Bin Tang	2014		10.1109/CSE.2014.207	broadband;telecommunications;computer science;radar imaging	Crypto	57.68332165037422	75.09665440493414	87368

On the other hand, because of the  high  sampling  rate,  coherent  Time  of  Arrival  (TOA) estimation  algorithms  are  not  practical  for  low  cost,  low complexity UWB systems. In order to improve the precision of  TOA  estimation,  an  Energy  Detection  (ED)  based  non­ coherent TOA estimation algorithm using Artificial Neural Networks  (ANN)  is  presented  which  is  based  on  the skewness  after  energy  detection.  The  expected  values  of skewness  and  kurtosis  with  respect  to  the  Signal  to  Noise Ratio (SNR) are investigated. It is shown that the skewness is  more  suitable  for  TOA  estimation.  The  best  threshold values for different SNRs are investigated and the effects of integration  period  and  channel  modes  are  examined. Comparisons with other ED based algorithms show  that  in CM1  and CM2  channels,  the proposed  algorithm provides higher precision and robustness  in both high and low SNR environments.	algorithm;coherence (physics);estimation theory;neural networks;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;time of arrival;ultra-wideband	Xue-rong Cui;Hao Zhang;T.

The goal is to minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of target's scattering coefficient estimate in the presence of clutter and interference, which is equivalent to maximizing the signal-to-clutter-plus-interference ratio. A discrete-time signal model is assumed and practical constant-modulus or low peak-to-average-power ratio (PAR) constraints are imposed on the transmit signal. Several optimization methods are proposed for this joint design. Furthermore, the MSE criterion is expressed in the frequency domain and a corresponding MSE lower bound is derived. Numerical examples for different types of interferences are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.	clutter;coefficient;discrete-time signal;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;modulus robot;radar;sonar (symantec);signal-to-noise ratio	Petre Stoica;Hao He;Jian Li	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2011.2179652	telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain;statistics	Visualization	54.21966297363207	75.46327281669765	87914

It is shown that indeed, there exists a wavelength range of ASE for achieving maximum gain. The gain can be increased by 14 dB if wavelength bandwidth of 1480–1554 nm is selected instead of pumping with the broadband ASE (1480–1700 nm). By auxiliary pump using ASE sliced in the 1533 nm window, gain as high as 28 dB and NF as low as 5.5 dB can be achieved for shorter fiber length. To achieve gain of 25–30 dB for the L-band signal only a EDF length of 30 m is required in the case of tuned ASE launching at 1533 nm as compared to 40 m and 65 m by optimized ASE bandwidth and broadband. The values of noise figure do not show significant variation in any of the three configurations. It is apparent that using single wavelength ASE pumping at 1533 nm reduces the fiber length by 10 m (compared to optimized ASE bandwidth pumping) and by 32 m (compared to broadband ASE bandwidth pumping), when L-band EDFA is designed for 25–30 dB signal gain and NF less than 6 dB. These results will be important in designing cascaded wideband EDFA for Optical Fiber Communication (OFC) systems.	adaptive server enterprise;l band;optical amplifier	Shubhendu Bhardwaj;Subhash C.

It can effectively reduce the noise of a pseudo-range with a very simple filter construction, but it occasionally causes an ionosphere-induced error for low-lying satellites. Herein, we propose an optimal single-frequency (SF) divergence-free Hatch filter that uses a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) message to reduce the ionospheric divergence and applies the optimal smoothing constant for its smoothing window width. According to the data-processing results, the overall performance of the proposed filter is comparable to that of the dual frequency (DF) divergence-free Hatch filter. Moreover, it can reduce the horizontal error of 57 cm to 37 cm and improve the vertical accuracy of the conventional Hatch filter by 25%. Considering that SF receivers dominate the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) market and that most of these receivers include the SBAS function, the filter suggested in this paper is of great value in that it can make the differential GPS (DGPS) performance of the low-cost SF receivers comparable to that of DF receivers.	cns disorder;differential gps;direction finding;dual;filter bank;gnss augmentation;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;hearing loss, high-frequency;kernel bandwidth;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;radio frequency;satellite viruses;satellite navigation;single-frequency network;smoothing (statistical technique);telling untruths;hatching;width	Byungwoon Park;Cheolsoon Lim;Youngsun Yun;Euiho Kim;Changdon Kee	2017		10.3390/s17030448	electronic engineering;gnss augmentation;telecommunications;engineering;control theory;gnss applications	Mobile	57.920030565004424	68.9289937185842	88695

Examples of classical combinations are the super-widelane and widelane combinations. The main aspects are to increase the wavelength and to reduce the influence of the ionosphere, while keeping the noise amplification moderate. In the present paper, a new type of combinations is introduced. These combinations leave the geometry invariant. A particular class of such combinations is discrete and finite. An exhaustive search leads to interesting new widelane combinations. Some have very long wavelengths, e.g. 29.31 m. Others have excellent ionospheric suppression, e.g. 28.78 dB at a wavelength of 3.256 m. The best ionospheric suppression of 38.30 dB is obtained for a narrowlane combination with a wavelength of 2.69 cm.	brute-force search;decibel;effective method;galileo;image scaling;noise (electronics);noise reduction;noise shaping;requirement;zero suppression	Patrick Henkel;Christoph Günther	2007	2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2007.353640	galileo;electronic engineering;satellite navigation;astronomy;telecommunications;computer science;brute-force search;ionosphere;optics	ML	57.97166031290371	74.5176635425809	88763

As optical networking moves towards burst and packet switching, the effects of changes of optical power levels on one wavelength, or channel, can have an impact on the behavior of other wavelengths passing through the same amplifier and impair network performance. We have observed in our simulations of EDFA operation that both the amplitude and duration of EDFA transients will decrease when gradual changes are made to the input power of the EDFA. It was also verified in [D.H. Richards, J.L. Jackel, M.A. Ali, A theoretical investigation of dynamic all-optical automatic gain control in multichannel EDFA’s and EDFA cascades, J. Select. Top. Quantum Electron. 3 (4) (1997)] that the switching time of the channel dropping operation can influence the amplitude and duration of EDFA transients. We show that this effect can be exploited to successfully suppress EDFA transients by power shaping. Our approach is to increase/decrease the power of an added/dropped channel gradually, rather than abruptly. Power shaping can be implemented by adapting existing link layer protocols. It is general and can be applied to amplifiers using different technologies, including EDFAs, solid state and Raman amplifiers. c © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose a low power direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) sequence is superimposed onto the interrogator's signal during tag to reader communication. The chip rate and sequence length is chosen to fit an entire DSSS sequence into each backscattered bit. During the tag to reader communication, the bits sent by the tag are decoded and a time domain recording with the length of one DSSS period is made for each bit. By cyclic alignment of each recording and subtracting the averaged recording of a “0”-bit from the one of a “1”-bit, static echos and antenna coupling effects are perfectly canceled. In addition, noise variance is reduced, improving the SNR. Finally, by applying a cyclic correlation with the transmitted DSSS sequence and locating the correlation maximum, the distance to the RFID tag can be determined.	electronic product code;radio-frequency identification;signal-to-noise ratio;ultra high frequency	Holger Arthaber;Thomas Faseth;Florian Galler	2015	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2469664	telecommunications;computer science;antenna;spread spectrum;backscatter;modulation	Mobile	54.775839931347214	65.49170021425789	89904

We naturally formulate the problem of MAI suppression as minimizing asymptotically a sequence of cost functions under some linear constraint defined by the desired user's signature. The proposed algorithms embed the constraint in the direction of adaptation, and thus the adaptive filter moves toward the optimal filter without stepping away from the constraint set. In addition, using parallel processors, the proposed algorithms attain good performance behavior with low computational complexity. Geometric interpretation clarifies an advantage of the proposed methods over some conventional methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve much faster convergence than conventional methods with a moderate number of concurrent processors.	adaptive filter;algorithm;central processing unit;embedded system;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);parallel projection;set theory;simulation;stepping level;zero suppression	Masahiro Yukawa;Renato Lu&#x00ED;s Garrido Cavalcante;Isao Yamada	2005	Proceedings.

RTSim is developed to test the radar systems starting from the initial algorithm development until the final field testing stages. In this way, it is possible to avoid the costly field tests in constantly changing conditions and test the radar systems in a controlled but highly complex environments. In the real-time operation scenario, Radar Signal Processing Unit (RSPU) sends the parameters of the radar signal to the RTSim. For each receive channel, RTSim generates baseband IQ (16-bit I, 16-bit Q) signals using these parameters and user programmed environment including targets, jammers, atmospheric effects, clutter, and radar related system noise. The generated baseband signals are sent to RSPU over fiberoptic lines.	16-bit;algorithm;baseband;clutter;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;optical fiber;radar;radio jamming;real-time clock;signal processing;software propagation;stationary process	Halit Ergezer;Furkan Keskin;Osman Günay	2014	2014 4th International Conference On Simulation And Modeling Methodologies, Technologies And Applications (SIMULTECH)		man-portable radar;continuous-wave radar;electronic engineering;radar tracker;radar engineering details;radar lock-on;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;fire-control radar;passive radar;radar horizon;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;envelope;pulse-doppler radar;clutter;3d radar;radar imaging;radar;radar jamming and deception;hardware-in-the-loop simulation	EDA	58.22500130567074	64.08369656521535	92471

First, the exact algorithms for T2TF without memory (T2TFwoM) are presented for three information configurations: with no, partial and full information feedback from the fusion center (FC) to the local trackers. As one major contribution of this paper, the impact of information feedback on fusion accuracy is studied. It is shown that in T2TFwoM, which uses only the track estimates at the fusion time, information feedback will have a negative impact on the fusion accuracy. Then, the exact algorithms for T2TF with memory (T2TFwM) are derived for configurations with and without information feedback. Operating at full rate, T2TFwM is equivalent to the centralized measurement fusion (CMF) regardless of information feedback. However, at a reduced rate, a certain amount of degradation in fusion accuracy is unavoidable. In contrast to the case of T2TFwoM, information feedback is beneficial in T2TFwM.	centralized computing;elegant degradation;exact algorithm;feedback;full rate;fuser (unix);global optimization;list of content management frameworks	Xin Tian;Yaakov Bar-Shalom	2009	2009 12th International Conference on Information Fusion		computer vision;simulation;computer science;control theory	Robotics	58.91573201786148	62.31245797318908	92787

Band limited pseudo noise stimuli which are generated by using a computer controlled arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) connected to an I/Q modulator drive the input of the amplifier under test ( AUT ). The complex envelopes of the pseudo noises are measured using a sampling scope. A vector error correction is applied in order to remove systematic errors due to the imperfections of the measurement channels .Using this technique, the linearity of L and Ka band amplifiers was characterized by the noise power ratio criterion (NPR). This paper focuses also on the particular attention that must be paid to the statistical properties and peak to average ratio (PAR) of pseudo noise test signals which significantly impact the NPR measurement accuracy.

An RDF-CFLANN structure uses functional expansion utilities to nonlinearly transform its input signals into the output space. In most MLP structures, one or more hidden layers are needed to nonlinearly map the input signals to the output signal space. Therefore, the complexity of the RDF-CFLANN structure is generally much lower than that of an MLP structure. In addition, the required amount of computing at the training mode can also be reduced. The comparisons of the mean squared error (MSE) and the average transmission bit error rate (BER) among RDF-CFLANN, DF-CFLANN and CFLANN are presented in this paper. Simulation results demonstrate that RDF-CFLANN presents the best performance among the three structures. 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.	artificial neural network;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;direction finding;equalization (communications);feedback;mean squared error;memory-level parallelism;nonlinear system;quad flat no-leads package;real-time clock;resource description framework;simulation;steady state;x.690	Wan-De Weng;Che-Shih Yang;Rui-Chang Lin	2007	Inf.

The problem arises when the actual direction of arrival of the signal is slightly off the assumed direction of arrival. The adaptive algorithms consider the actual signal a jammer as the direction of arrival is not exactly specified. In this paper, it is shown how to prevent signal cancellation when the direction of arrival is not known exactly. Multiple look direction constraints are used to prevent signal cancellation. This paper outlines the principles and illustrates how this concept can be incorporated in an adaptive nulling situation using a deterministic direct data domain approach. r 1998 Academic Press	adaptive algorithm;angularjs;clutter;data domain;direction of arrival;loss of significance;radar;silicon on insulator	S.

The channels we consider are with a continuous time delays and sparse, and we assume a common support of the channel coefficients of the SIMO channels associated with different antennas, resulting from the same scatterer. To exploit these properties, we propose a new channel estimation algorithm based on the atomic norm minimization for the Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) model. A joint estimation of the delays corresponding to the same scatterer is obtained using the combination of the atomic norm regularized minimization for the MMV model and the MUSIC method. Then, based on the availability of the channel correlation information, the path gains are estimated using the LS or the MMSE method. Additionally, we derive a theoretical estimate of the channel estimate Mean Square Error for the asymptotically increasing number of receive antennas. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we compare its performance with other state of the art algorithms.	dispersive partial differential equation;sparse	Slavche Pejoski;Venceslav Kafedziski	2017	MONET	10.1007/s11036-016-0748-y	computer science;minification;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;mathematical optimization;algorithm;distributed computing;mean squared error;communication channel	EDA	54.25102328474242	77.24338364391339	96836

To achieve a high spatial resolution, a 400-mm×200-mm elliptical offset Cassegrain antenna with high beam e ffici ncy and low sidelobes is employed [2]. In order to protect the highly sensitive receiver from electromagnetic interference due to the electromagnetic environment around the ISS, the configuration of the quasioptical antenna feed system is fairly complicated, and this makes the requirements for the optical alignment of the components of antenna feed system demanding. In this paper, we propose an experimental method to evaluate the antenna feed system by a phase retrieval method in which the complex beam pattern is estimated by measuring the amplitude patterns at three di fferent planes in the feed system. Furthermore, the far-field antenna pattern is demonstrated to be estimated from thus retrieved feed beam pattern.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;electromagnetic environment;experiment;interference (communication);phase retrieval;radiation pattern;requirement;simplified molecular-input line-entry system;smart antenna	Takeshi Manabe;Tomo Fukami;Toshiyuki Nishibori;Kazuo Mizukoshi;Satoshi Ochiai	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.6.1760	antenna feed;beam waveguide antenna;international space station;periscope antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;near and far field;offset dish antenna;cassegrain antenna;radiation pattern;estimation theory;phase retrieval	ML	67.59570813553783	61.73378871477423	97208

The current commercial VSAT systems operating in either C-band or Ku-band generally have their remote terminal antenna reflectors and the antenna feed horn radomes coated with hydrophobic materials. The aim is to prevent the antenna and radome surfaces from becoming wet during a rainfall. This precaution relieves the burden of added rain margin necessary on the link budget. The magnitude of the propagation loss when the antenna reflector and the antenna feed horn radome surfaces are wet is determined. The results can indicate whether the expense of applying and maintaining the hydrophobic materials on the VSAT remote antennas and radomes is justified under specific loss conditions. >	antenna effect	Jonathon Y.

29e618477833a74d540c9e1e95e73e099f8c5801	time-reversal music imaging with time-domain gating technique		A time-reversal (TR) approach with multiple signal classification (MUSIC) provides super-resolution for detection and localization using multistatic data collected from an array antenna system. The theory of TR-MUSIC assumes that the number of antenna elements is greater than that of scatterers (targets). Furthermore, it requires many sets of frequencydomain data (snapshots) in seriously noisy environments. Unfortunately, these conditions are not practical for real environments due to the restriction of a reasonable antenna structure as well as limited measurement time. We propose an approach that treats both noise reduction and relaxation of the transceiver restriction by using a time-domain gating technique accompanied with the Fourier transform before applying the TR-MUSIC imaging algorithm. Instead of utilizing the conventional multistatic data matrix (MDM), we employ a modified MDM obtained from the gating technique. The resulting imaging functions yield more reliable images with only a few snapshots regardless of the limitation of the antenna arrays. key words: time-reversal (TR) technique, TR-MUSIC imaging, ultra wideband (UWB), gating technique	algorithm;linear programming relaxation;music (algorithm);master data management;noise reduction;snapshot (computer storage);super-resolution imaging;t-symmetry;transceiver;transistor;ultra-wideband	Heedong Choi;Yasutaka Ogawa;Toshihiko Nishimura;Takeo Ohgane	2012	IEICE Transactions		telecommunications	Visualization	56.34099352154358	77.96377829109358	100918

Depending on the expected bandwidth of the signals of interest, techniques involving the processing of multiple input data blocks, with or without overlap, may be used to optimize the detection performance. These include the predetection summation (averaging) of power spectral estimates or the use of a two-stage processing strategy where the final detection decision is based on the majority vote of detection decisions obtained for the individual input data blocks.

99051598f773a2a68a4501d0f6f6308b12661e61	design and application of the distributed ionospheric coherent scatter radar		In this letter, a newly designed distributed coherent scatter radar for localization of ionospheric irregularities is presented. It is composed of a detection network that can detect ionospheric irregularities with the help of a time synchronization module. To achieve a fairly narrow beam with high directive gain, an antenna array is used in this transmitter module. The frequency band is from high frequency (HF) to very HF to detect irregularities at different scales. In addition, the radar uses a universal serial bus to reduce its size, which allows it to be easily moved to different areas. An iterative ray tracing method is also applied to localize the ionospheric irregularities. The results indicate that the radar can effectively track ionospheric irregularity in 3-D space.	coherent;direction of arrival;directive (programming);distributed computing;frequency band;iterative method;radar;ray tracing (graphics);serial communication;skywave;transmitter;usb	Lei Qiao;Gang Chen;Jin Wang	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2749605	bistatic radar;remote sensing;mathematics;radar imaging;radar lock-on;low-frequency radar;continuous-wave radar;radar;man-portable radar;fire-control radar	Embedded	56.928965694100484	76.5871379332697	103377

In this paper a new method of UWB radar signals generation with two-channel is presented. The realization structure is given, and the principle of signal synthesis is analyzed. At the same time, an automatic adjustment measure of signal phase is proposed for phase discontinuity of waveform in this method.

Measurements are made at one or more receiver sites without requirements for time synchronization. The approach requires knowledge of the receiver locations and plan-view map data that includes 2D outlines of major reflecting structures such as buildings. The approach can accommodate both cooperative and noncooperative sources, contingent on accurate estimation of differential delays contained within the channel impulse response. Simulation examples employing a map with multiple reflecting structures are considered to demonstrate the technique. Results are computed for a case involving the use of multiple simultaneous receivers that surround the source. Ambiguity regions are shown for up to five receiver locations, as well as for the combined results from all receiver ambiguity maps. Since the ambiguity regions with this approach are different than traditional ambiguity patterns, the technique can potentially be fused with other geolocation approaches to improve ambiguity resolution.	ambiguity function;clock synchronization;committed information rate;contingency (philosophy);convex hull;geolocation;map;multipath propagation;requirement;simulation;synchronization (computer science);the mask;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Jared Baker;Thomas G.

6fa0a2bfb6dfc355e4acca433300855287f8fba2	macroscopic interferometry: rethinking depth estimation with frequency-domain time-of-flight		A form of meter-scale, macroscopic interferometry is proposed using conventional time-of-flight (ToF) sensors. Today, ToF sensors use phase-based sampling, where the phase delay between emitted and received, high-frequency signals encodes distance. This paper examines an alternative ToF architecture, inspired by micron-scale, microscopic interferometry, that relies only on frequency sampling: we refer to our proposed macroscopic technique as Frequency-Domain Time of Flight (FD-ToF). The proposed architecture offers several benefits over existing phase ToF systems, such as robustness to phase wrapping and implicit resolution of multi-path interference, all while capturing the same number of subframes. A prototype camera is constructed to demonstrate macroscopic interferometry at meter scale.	group delay and phase delay;instantaneous phase;interference (communication);prototype;sampling (signal processing);sensor;wrapping (graphics)	Achuta Kadambi;Jamie Schiel;Ramesh Raskar	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	10.1109/CVPR.2016.103	robustness (computer science);frequency domain;computer vision;artificial intelligence;metre (music);sampling (statistics);interferometry;group delay and phase delay;computer science;interference (wave propagation);time of flight	Vision	58.062890898648334	61.39319728931276	107624

To examine the effects of the phase noise on FMCW radar performance, a model of an FMCW radar with a noisy PLL is developed. A filter-based technique for modeling the PLL phase noise is described. The radar model shows that PLL in-band phase noise affects the spatial resolution of the FMCW radar, whereas PLL out-of-band phase noise limits the maximum range. Finally, we propose a set of design constraints for PLL based on the model simulation results.	arnold tongue;image quality;modulation;out-of-band agreement;phase noise;phase-locked loop;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Debashis Dhar;Paul T.

bf8c5a7f87ce88057cadb31d3f09acd67e4d26e1	3d folded loop uav antenna design		Utilization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as “drones”, has a great potential for many emerging applications, such as delivering the connectivity on-demand, providing services for public safety, or recovering after damage to the communication infrastructure. Notably, nearly any application of drones requires a stable link to the ground control center, yet this functionality is commonly added at the last moment in the design, necessitating compact antenna designs. In this work, we propose a novel electrically small antenna element based on the 3D folded loop topology, which could be easily located inside the UAV airframe, yet still delivering good isolation from the drones own noise sources. The complete manufacturing technique along with corresponding simulations/measurements are presented. Measurements and evaluations show that the proposed antenna design is an option to achieve genuinely isotropic radiation in a small size without sacrificing efficiency.

However, the phase distortions resulting from array processing may limit the applicability of these methods for high precision applications using carrier phase based positioning techniques. This paper studies the phase distortions occurring with the adaptive blind beamforming method in which satellite angle of arrival (AoA) information is not employed in the optimization problem. To cater to non-stationary interference scenarios, the array weights of the adaptive beamformer are continuously updated. The effects of these continuous updates on the tracking parameters of a GNSS receiver are analyzed. The second part of this paper focuses on reducing the phase distortions during the blind beamforming process in order to allow the receiver to perform carrier phase based positioning by applying a constraint on the structure of the array configuration and by compensating the array uncertainties. Limitations of the previous methods are studied and a new method is proposed that keeps the simplicity of the blind beamformer structure and, at the same time, reduces tracking degradations while achieving millimetre level positioning accuracy in interference environments. To verify the applicability of the proposed method and analyze the degradations, array signals corresponding to the GPS L1 band are generated using a combination of hardware and software simulators. Furthermore, the amount of degradation and performance of the proposed method under different conditions are evaluated based on Monte Carlo simulations.	adaptive beamformer;angle of arrival;antenna device component;array processing;beamforming;cns disorder;conflict (psychology);constrained optimization;data collection;elegant degradation;estimated;futures studies;gnss applications;global positioning system;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);interference (communication);l band;leucaena pulverulenta;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;numerous;optimization problem;phase distortion;satellite navigation;sensor;simulation;simulators;stationary process;visually impaired persons;weight	Saeed Daneshmand;Thyagaraja Marathe;Gérard Lachapelle	2016		10.3390/s16111824	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;adaptive beamformer	Mobile	55.798842264968535	77.12132471941096	110945

VDSL aims at bringing truly broadband access, greater than 52 Mbps in the downstream, to the mass consumer market. This is achieved by transmitting in frequencies up to 12 MHz. Operating at such high frequencies gives rise to crosstalk between the DSL systems in a binder, limiting achievable data-rates. Crosstalk is typically 10-15 dB larger than other noise sources and is the primary limitation on performance in VDSL. In downstream transmission several crosstalk precompensation schemes have been proposed to address this issue. Whilst these schemes lead to large performance gains, they also have extremely high complexities, beyond the scope of current implementation.In this paper we develop the concept of partial crosstalk precompensation. The majority of the crosstalk experienced in a DSL system comes from only a few other lines within the binder. Furthermore its effects are limited to a small subset of tones. Partial precompensation exploits this by limiting precompensation to the tones and lines where it gives maximum benefit. As a result, these schemes achieve the majority of the gains of full crosstalk precompensation at a fraction of the run-time complexity. In this paper we develop several partial precompensation schemes. We show that with only 20% of the run-time complexity of full precompensation it is possible to achieve 80% of the performance gains.	crosstalk;downstream (software development)	Raphael Cendrillon;George Ginis;Marc Moonen;Katleen Van Acker	2004	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2004.07.013	electronic engineering;digital subscriber line;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	55.51403619886999	81.30966737256465	113913

However, the mutual interference among the waveforms may lead to performance degradation in resolving spatially close returns. In this paper, we consider the use of space-time coding (STC) to mitigate the waveform cross-correlation effects in MIMO radar. First, it turns out that a joint waveform optimization problem can be decoupled into a set of individual waveform design problems. Second, a number of monostatic waveforms can be directly used in a MIMO radar system, which offers flexibility in waveform selection. We provide conditions for the elimination of waveform cross correlation, and discuss four kinds of space time codes. In addition, we also extend the model to partial waveform cross-correlation removal based on waveform set division. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of STC in MIMO radar for waveform decorrelation.	certified computer examiner;code;cross-correlation;decorrelation;elegant degradation;interference (communication);mimo;mathematical optimization;motion compensation;optimization problem;pulse compression;radar;stationary process;tree accumulation;waveform	Xiufeng Song;Shengli Zhou;Peter Willett	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2048207	telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;space–time code;statistics	Metrics	56.473140085206	73.28055622297741	115344

Because broadcasters are adding IBOC to their existing systems, it is vital that they achieve maximum power efficiency while working within their existing space and power limitations. There are currently three different strategies proposed for accomplishing this goal, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. One strategy is to establish a separate, second antenna for the digital service. The other two strategies involve combining the analog and digital signals, either in a single hybrid transmitter or at the output of separate analog and digital transmitters. This paper discusses the equipment required for accomplishing this last strategy.	analog signal;fm broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;performance per watt;requirement;transmitter	Robert F.

Then, we fed this time series as an observation sequence into the hidden Markov model to predict these switches before they happen so that the secondary user (SU) can adjust its transmission strategies accordingly. The experimental results show that new approach performs very well for predicting the primary users channel state in time domain with low computational complexity.	baum–welch algorithm;cognitive radio;computational complexity theory;hidden markov model;ibm systems network architecture;markov chain;network switch;one-class classification;time series;welch's method	Ahmed Mohammed Mikaeil;Bin Guo;Xuemei Bai;Zhijun Wang	2014	The 2014 2nd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI 2014)	10.1109/ICSAI.2014.7009406	cognitive radio;simulation;speech recognition;prediction;computer science;sensor;machine learning;hidden semi-markov model;time series;mathematical model;predictive modelling;markov model;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	AI	55.91876120422131	86.49853909699652	119116

To design an effective equalizer to prevent the inter-symbol interference in such scenario is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop equalizers based on a nonlinear neural structure (wavelet neural network (WNN)) and train it’s weighted by a recently developed meta-heuristic (symbiotic organisms search algorithm). The performance of the proposed equalizer is compared with WNN trained by cat swarm optimization (CSO) and clonal selection algorithm (CLONAL), particle swarm optimization(PSO) and least mean square algorithm (LMS). The performance is also compared with other equalizers with structure based on functional link artificial neural network (Trigonometric FLANN), radial basis function network (RBF) and finite impulse response filter (FIR). The superior performance is demonstrated on equalization of two non-linear three taps channels and a linear twenty-three taps telephonic channel. It is observed that the performance of the gradient algorithm based equalizers fails in the presence of burst error. The robustness in the performance of the proposed equalizers to handle the burst error conditions are also demonstrated.	artificial neural network;big data;burst error;byte;chief security officer;clonal selection algorithm;equalization (communications);finite impulse response;gradient;heuristic;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;radial (radio);radial basis function network;search algorithm;trigonometric polynomial;wavelet;wnn;x.690	Satyasai Jagannath Nanda;Nidhi Jonwal	2017	Appl.

e4d076c660dc992f5bfe8d73112414a87c443699	rising edge detection used as toa estimator for mode s signals with multipath propagation		Local area multilateration (LAM) systems installed at airports suffer from multipath propagation caused by reflections from objects such as buildings, hangars, masts or shelters. Receiving multiple overlapped signals from different radio propagation channels deteriorates the time of arrival (TOA) estimation. In this paper the edge detection algorithm is used to estimate the TOA of 1,090 MHz Mode S downlink signals with overlapping multipath. This algorithm is a fundamental tool in image processing, it detects the zero crossing of the Laplacian signal and is applied on the rising edge of the first pulse. Herein we have shown in a real-world example, that the edge detection leads to better results than the threshold detection algorithm in terms of TOA estimation accuracy when having multipath overlapping. In addition, the low-cost implementation is suitable for deployment in centralized or decentralized time-synchronized LAM systems and requires only one single receive stream.	algorithm;centralized computing;digital signal processor;edge detection;field-programmable gate array;image processing;multilateration;multipath propagation;radio wave;reflection (computer graphics);signal edge;software deployment;software propagation;telecommunications link;time of arrival;zero crossing	Stephan Bernhart;Erich Leitgeb;Gerhard A.

Based on the fact that the output power of an optimized beamformer achieves a maximum if the steering vector coincides with that of the desired signal, the technique iteratively searches for the correct ‘steering vector’ of a broadband source with a known bandwidth. By approximating the ‘steering vector’ by its first order Taylor series expansion in terms of the steering angle, the maximization process reduces to a one-dimensional optimization problem. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance achievable.	beamforming	Meng Hwa Er;B. C.

62d897d3b3fc6c001d2858d82db50bf20a83a599	experimental validation for opto-acoustic distance measurement based on code division multiple access amplitude modulation and differential carrier phase estimation		In this contribution, an opto-acoustic system for distance measurement between a transmitter and a receiver is presented. This distance measurement is part of an indoor localization system which uses multilateration to obtain the position and orientation of rigid bodies. The novelty of the presented distance measurement is the efficiency in the sense that high accuracy is obtained with the use of standard components, making the overall localization system affordable and facilitating its prevalence. This efficiency is achieved by the simultaneous use of spread spectrum time-of-flight (TOF) on the one hand, and carrier phase measurements on the other hand. Specifically, we use a two-channel link which is made up of an ultrasound and an infrared channel, the latter using the same carrier frequency as the ultrasound channel. In order to render the system extendible for multiple transmitters and receivers, which is necessary for its use in the multilateration setup, code-division-multiple-access amplitude modulation using Gold codes is employed, as all ultrasound and infrared signals share the same carrier frequency. This is also advantageous for multipath scattering suppression. The phase difference between the ultrasound and infrared carrier signals offers a highly accurate but ambiguous distance signal. On the other hand, correlation of the received code-modulated signals establishes a TOF measurement yielding a coarse but largely unique distance signal in the form of a probability density function. The combination of those signals results in a highly accurate and unique position estimation. Experimental results obtained on our test rig are presented to show the performance of the unilateral distance measurement.	acoustic cryptanalysis;carrier frequency;code;extensibility;indoor positioning system;internationalization and localization;matlab;modulation;multilateration;particle filter;quantum phase estimation algorithm;real-time clock;transmitter;yet another;zero suppression	Philipp Rapp;Dominik Esslinger;Oliver Sawodny;Cristina Tarín	2017	2017 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2017.8115891	multipath propagation;pulse-amplitude modulation;electronic engineering;engineering;multilateration;code division multiple access;transmitter;spread spectrum;amplitude modulation;communication channel	Mobile	58.31085607184316	78.60280728742941	125532
c50121aa4b3e91499f067928ab1a037e16ddbdbd	time-delay estimation via cpd-gevd applied to tensor-based gnss arrays with errors		Safety-critical applications (SCA), such as autonomous driving, and liability critical applications (LCA), such as fisheries management, require a robust positioning system in demanding signal environments with coherent multipath while ensuring reasonably low complexity. In this context, antenna array-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers with array signal processing schemes allow the spatial separation of line-of-sight (LOS) from multipath components. In real-world scenarios array imperfections alter the expected array response, resulting in parameter estimation and filtering errors. In this paper, we propose an approach to time-delay estimation for a tensor-based GNSS receiver that mitigates the effect of multipath components while also being robust against array imperfections. This approach is based on the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition by a Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition (GPD-GEVD) to recover the signal for each impinging component. Our scheme outperforms both the Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) eigenfilter and Direction of Arrival and Khatri-Rao factorization (DoA/KRF) approaches, which are state-of-the-art tensor-based schemes for time-delay estimation, particularly when array imperfections are present.	autonomous car;coherence (physics);collaborative product development;direction of arrival;estimation theory;filter (signal processing);iso/iec 11404;line-of-sight (missile);multipath mitigation;multipath propagation;positioning system;satellite navigation;signal processing;singular value decomposition	Daniel Valle de Lima;João Paulo Carvalho Lustosa da Costa;Felix Antreich;Ricardo Kehrle Miranda;Giovanni Del Galdo	2017	2017 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2017.8313098	mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;filter (signal processing);signal processing;antenna array;singular value decomposition;estimation theory;gnss applications;mathematics;direction of arrival	Visualization	55.240970009004876	77.25115671240899	126261
d5d4bf27ea157cef2d5edc29b3f3613d07907dfc	channel propagation model identification for spectrum database: a spark based pvos-elm		Spectrum database plays an increasingly important role in spectrum measurements and monitoring, which lays foundations for accurate and real-time spectrum sensing in future cognitive radio networks. A successful identification of the channel propagation model is of great importance to construct spectrum database so as to give an accurate picture of spectrum use in real-world environments. In this paper, based on the principle behind the voting-based online sequential extreme learning machine (VOS-ELM) and the Spark cloud computing platform, a novel parallel VOS-ELM (PVOS-ELM) algorithm will be proposed and implemented for real-time channel model identification in real-world propagation environment. The power measurement, kurtosis and skewness etc. will be used as features which are extracted from the received signal. Furthermore, the novel data parallel and task parallel processing schemes will be proposed to improve the computation efficiency of the proposed algorithm on Spark cloud computing platform. Extensive simulations and experiments with real-world data samples will be carried out. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed Spark based PVOS-ELM algorithm enjoys a significant accuracy performance improvement in channel identification and a much higher computation efficiency.	algorithm;channel (communications);cloud computing;cognitive radio;computation;data parallelism;elm;experiment;identification scheme;kl-one;kullback–leibler divergence;parallel computing;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation;software propagation;system identification;vos or openvos;waveform	Bo Zhou;Xiaopu Liu;Jianbin Li;Bo Bai;Wei Chen;Hui Tian	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108216	cognitive radio;cloud computing;spark (mathematics);database;computer science;extreme learning machine;feature extraction;computation;system identification;communication channel	Embedded	54.64718803106947	85.57655797150055	126471

Feedback synchronous system of chaotic semiconductor lasers is presented and synchronous error and decoding formulae are demonstrated. Synchronization between two chaotic laser systems with distributed feedback semiconductor lasers at wavelength of 1.31 µm is simulatively achieved with almost zero synchronous error. Parameter mismatch, synchronous transient response and noise effect on the system are studied. Robustness of synchronization and anti-perturbation can increase by increasing the feedback coefficient of the system. Influence of group-velocity-dispersion and self-phase modulation of optical fiber on chaotic laser signal and synchronization are analyzed, and it is found that group-velocity-dispersion affects pulse shape, synchronization and decoding, and limits optical fiber propagation distances, and self-phase modulation does not affect pulse shape, while its product of nonlinear phase shift can affect synchronization and decoding, and restrict propagation distances of optical fiber chaotic communication system and hence the maximum optical power formula is educed.

The scenario is examined in which a programmable, frequency-agile receiver is required to monitor a wide bandwidth for threat emitters from a known list. A theory is developed to allow the sweep time of the receiver, together with individual dwell times on each band, to be jointly optimised in order to minimise the intercept time with threat emitters. In theoretical and simulation studies, it is found that improvements of more than 10%, and sometimes much more, can be achieved on maximum and expected intercept times with respect to other periodic and jittered search strategies.	agile software development;computer programming;mathematical optimization;scheduling (computing);simulation;visual intercept	I.

Effective mitigation of multipath is offered by using an antenna array with beamforming capabilities. However, arrays are physically large and unwieldy from a signal processing perspective and hence not suitable for a small handheld device. In this paper, a receiver consisting of a single antenna that is moved arbitrarily in space forming a synthetic antenna is considered. Blind calibration of the resultant spatial array is achieved through the use of fourth order cummulants. As demonstrated in this paper, a synthetic array, based on this blind calibration method can practically enhance the LOS signal by suppressing multipath through spatial filtering and thereby improve the TOA performance. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.	beamforming;coexist (image);mobile device;monte carlo method;multipath propagation;resultant;signal processing;simulation;synthetic data;time of arrival	Ali Broumandan;John Nielsen;Gérard Lachapelle	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.86	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;signal processing;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	55.99075068709137	77.1358791622479	127824

In this beamformer, each of the received array signals is only processed by one single coefficient and its output is an instantaneous weighted combination of the received signals. One interesting property of it is that it has a totally different beam response depending on whether we are considering the negative frequency component or the positive frequency component of the impinging signals. As a result, the implementation of this beamformer is not as straightforward as the traditional ones and a special arrangement is required for its effective operation. Two implementation schemes are proposed for complex-valued impinging signals and real-valued impinging signals, respectively, supported by design and simulation results.	beamforming;coefficient;simulation	Wei Liu	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;acoustics;telecommunications;engineering;adaptive beamformer	HPC	57.70939693971573	75.15423328274875	128018

5869245710f5a71136dbf43d8b4960feda41e3b3	improvements on deinterleaving of radar pulses in dynamically varying signal environments		Abstract An electronic support system receiver which is a passive receiver picks up an interleaved stream of pulses and extracts their pulse parameters. These parameters are sent to a deinterleaving subsystem which sorts them and forms pulse cells that each are assumed to belong to a specific emitter. In this paper, we develop a method for this task of deinterleaving of radar pulse sequences. For this aim, a novel pulse amplitude tracking algorithm is proposed for dynamically varying signal environments wherein radar parameters can change abruptly. This method particularly works for air-to-air engagements where pulse amplitude distortion due to channel effects can be considered negligible. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm incorporated with a clustering algorithm improves deinterleaving of radar emitters that have agile pulse parameters such as airborne radars.	radar	Kenan Gencol;Ali Kara;Nuray At	2017	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2017.06.010	pulse-amplitude modulation;mathematics;mathematical optimization;common emitter;cluster analysis;distortion;radar;electronic engineering;telecommunications;pulse (signal processing);communication channel	EDA	55.98650077470152	75.08925661152709	134602

Phased array technology offers a solution by combining multiple elements together in such a way that their radiation characteristics constructively interfere. Typically, the antenna elements are distributed periodically over lattice grids; however, this can lead to undesirable effects such as scan blindness and surface wave propagation. Instead, randomly distributing the radiators can attain the same performance increases without suffering from the detrimental effects of periodic structures. This work provides an analysis of the array behavior for planar triangular randomly distributed antenna arrays (TRA). A probabilistic theory is presented followed by numerical experiments from both the array factor analysis and Ansys HFSS finite-element simulations. Measurements of a prototype array system show main beam scanning capabilities.	beamforming;ct scan;converge;data structure;experiment;factor analysis;finite element method;hfss;lattice qcd;numerical analysis;numerical method;phased array;prototype;randomness;risk assessment;simulation;software propagation;statistical model;surface wave	Nam Nicholas Ma;Kristopher Buchanan;Jeffrey T Jensen;Gregory H.

Current ultrasonic positioning systems have limitations when simultaneously locating multiple transmitters in three-dimensional (3D) space using narrowband ultrasonic transducers. They are also unable to calculate a transmitter's position in 3D using traditional multilateration algorithms when receivers are positioned in a single plane. Recently, we developed a robust optimization algorithm for locating a single transmitter in 3D when all the receivers were positioned in a single plane which was shown to accurately locate a single transmitter with sub-millimetre accuracy. Here, we extend this algorithm to simultaneously locating multiple transmitters by compensating signal interference using narrowband orthogonal division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. Our experimental results show that the proposed system has the precision required for medical applications and is of lower cost and complexity than alternative traditional optical systems.	algorithm;complexity;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multilateration;multiplexing;positioning system;robotic mapping;robust optimization;transducer;transmitter	Md.

Since surveillance systems are highly visible to intercept receivers, a traditional high-gain phased-array antenna beam is replaced by a series of low-gain FDA beams with spoiled frequency increments to reduce the system visibility, without degrading the surveillance system performance. Moreover, a cognitive closed-loop update scheme is presented to update the operation parameters in real time for improved moving-target tracking performance.

The motivation of this paper is to propose a segmented range detection (SRD) method on the foundation of plentiful mature research on the target detection of LFMCW radar. According to the SRD method, the detection range (about 150m in the scene of vehicular collision warning) is divided into several segments and triangular modulation waveform which consists of several different frequencies is designed. Compared with typical digital signal processing method, the SRD method can availably decrease the bandwidth of the IF signal, therefore the in-band noise will be significantly reduced and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) improved. Additionally, different range resolutions can be achieved and average range resolution improved. The SRD method is also validated through multiple outdoor experiments with the use of 60 GHz LFMCW millimeter-wave radar system designed by our research group. The efficiency of the SRD method is demonstrated in terms of ranging accuracy and range resolution after the analysis of experiment results.	digital signal processing;experiment;fast fourier transform;modulation;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;waveform	Yizhong Wu;Ying Bao;Zhiguo Shi;Jiming Chen;Youxian Sun	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594415	frequency modulation;electronic engineering;continuous wave;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;automotive industry;noise;digital signal processing;extremely high frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;bandwidth;systems design;modulation	Robotics	55.28815888341148	79.5997871511696	137079

Nevertheless, for the prevalence of additional FTTH, the so-called 'last one mile problem', which entails a huge cost for constructing optical fiber networks to end-users, has to be solved. To this end, it is necessary to improve economical efficiency of the products for network access and simplify the installation of the network. For the reasons mentioned above, special performance of optical fibers for dropand indoor-cables in FTTH, such as a low bending loss for small bending diameter and easy storage of surplus fibers, is required 1). Increasing the effective refractive index of a propagating mode or squeezing the electromagnetic field of the mode is effective in reducing bending loss in fibers. For example, FutureGuide® -SR15 which has a core with high refractive index has a permissible bending radius of 15 mm, half of that of a conventional single-mode fiber (C-SMF). Furthermore, an optical fiber using a trench index profile is bendinginsensitive to a bending radius of 7.5 mm and shows low splicing loss to C-SMF 2). However, if the bending insensitivity of a fiber with a conventional index profile is required for an extremely small bending radius, e.g. 5 mm, the mode field diameter (MFD) of the fiber is inevitably reduced and high splicing loss to CSMF is induced. We have applied holey fibers 3) to solve this problem. A hole-assisted holey fiber (HA-HF) has a conventional raised-index core surrounded by air holes and hence possesses the properties of both conventional fibers and holey fibers such as low transmission loss and large anomalous dispersion 4). Since the air holes make a large refractive index difference between core and cladding, an HA-HF can also have very low bending loss without reducing its MFD so much. For the structure of HA-HFs, one layer 5) and two layers 6) of air holes have been already proposed. HAHFs with one layer of air holes have a simple structure, but the problem with them is that suppressing bending loss also strengthens the confinement of higher-order modes and results in long cut-off wavelengths of the higher-order modes. HA-HFs with two layers can solve the problem but they have complicated structures. In this paper, we will propose a novel type of HAHF, which has two layers of air holes with only three holes for each layer. The size of the holes in different layers is allowed to be different so that low bending loss and short cut-off wavelength of a higher-order mode can be obtained simultaneously. A step-index core similar to C-SMFs is used so that the HA-HFs can be spliced to C-SMFs with low loss. One of the fibers we have made in trial has single-mode operation from 1.28 μm and has a bending loss of 0.012 dB/turn for a bending diameter of 5 mm. Furthermore, average splicing losses of 0.05 dB between the HA-HF and C-SMF and 0.08 dB between the HA-HFs by fusion splicing have been obtained.	access network;cladding (fiber optics);environmental tests;fiber to the x;fusion splicing;helicon filter;interconnection;loss function;mode field diameter;optical fiber;performance	Ning Guan;Katsuaki Izoe;Katsuhiro Takenaga;Ryuji Suzuki;Kazuhiko Aikawa;Kuniharu Himeno	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e89-c.2.191	mechanical joint;single-mode optical fiber;photonic crystal;photonic-crystal fiber;fiber to the x;telecommunications;plastic-clad silica fiber;optics;engineering drawing;all-silica fiber;physics	Web+IR	68.29763265472133	60.64700961478301	138831

Here the bacterial dynamics is used to determine an optimum set of the excitation current amplitudes of antenna elements and element separations of a non-uniform planar circular antenna arrays which can achieve minimum side lobes levels for a fixed first null beam-width. In our proposed algorithm, there are only three bacterial searching agents. One primary bacterium follows two secondary bacteria to reach global optima. The design results obtained using CBDO shows that it provides better side lobe level reduction than that obtained using modified IWO, basic IWO, DE, PSO and GA.

However, the basic capabilities of the VLA have changed little since it was designed. A major expansion utilizing modern technology is currently under way to improve the capabilities of the VLA by at least an order of magnitude in both sensitivity and in frequency coverage. The primary elements of the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) project include new or upgraded receivers for continuous frequency coverage from 1 to 50 GHz, new local oscillator, intermediate frequency, and wide bandwidth data transmission systems to carry signals with 16 GHz total bandwidth from each antenna, and a new digital correlator with the capability to process this bandwidth with an unprecedented number of frequency channels for an imaging array. Also included are a new monitor and control system and new software that will provide telescope ease of use.

In addition, reliable detection of radio controlled (RC) devices in the presence of multiple actual devices is a challenging task. RC devices employing super regenerative receivers (SRRs) and super heterodyne receivers emit unintended radiations in their ON-state. This paper introduces a novel detection scheme that combines self-similarity and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based detection with minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) method. In addition, detection accuracy is improved using multiconstrained genetic algorithms (GAs). RSSI method detects multiple devices from received signal strength and Hurst parameter identifies self-similar SRR devices. Regularized MVDR improves detection of multiple devices by jamming unwanted signals and signals from known angle of arrival. Regularization reduces variation in detection due to environmental noise. Multiconstrained GA is implemented in the cases where MVDR fails. The experimental results for detection have also been presented for multiple SRR receivers (door bells at 315 MHz).	amiga reflections;angle of arrival;genetic algorithm;heterodyne;hurst exponent;imaging phantom;interference (communication);jam;line-of-sight (missile);mathematical optimization;multipath propagation;rss;radio control;radio jamming;simpl;self-similarity;signal reflection;software propagation;software release life cycle	Vivek Thotla;Maciej J.

The filter operation required is derived by using the likelihood ratio, averaged over the unknown frequency shift. For large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and white Gaussian noise, the performance of the filter is essentially identical to that of maximum likelihood detectors (e.g., periodograms [1]-[3]), and the choice of filter is principally based on convenience. However, for small SNRs, or when cumulative probability of detection is of interest, the average likelihood receiver is preferable. The detection characteristic, given and discussed in Section III, is seen to consist of the sum of pairwise products of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the individual pulses, added to the sum of the pulse envelopes. For very small integrated SNRs, little improvement over the phase-incoherent (square law) detector is possible, since the velocity estimates have very high variances. For small SNR per pulse but many pulses, the advantage over incoherent detection may be considerable; this remains to be investigated. For large SNR, the discussion of maximum likelihood receivers is germane. The filter has two properties that are convenient for the circuit designer. First, only various simple iterated sums of correlations of each received pulse with a sine wave at the carrier frequency, and with a cosine wave at the carrier frequency, are required. Thus, if m pulses are received, 4m numbers must be formed and stored. Second, the computation of the likelihood ratio may be carried out by a differential procedure. If the likelihood ratio for m pulses, L(m) , is available, L(m+1) is formed by adding 2(m+1) numbers to L(m) . Thus, only 2m  2 -step numerical operations, not 2^{2m} are needed after each pulse. This property suggests that the test might be carried out sequentially. If sequential analysis is performed, digital rather than analog procedures might prove more convenient, since the required amounts of delay (i.e., of memory duration) cannot be specified in advance.	coherence (physics);doppler effect;radar	Ivan Selin	1965	IEEE Trans.

This beampattern offers a potential to localize the targets in two dimensions in terms of slant ranges and azimuth angles. However, it is difficult to obtain the target location information from a standard FDA radar due to the couplings in range and angle responses. In this paper, we propose a transmit subaperturing scheme on the FDA radar for range and angle estimation of targets. The essence is to divide the FDA elements into multiple subarrays and optimize the transmit beamspace matrix with the use of convex optimization. We also discuss several practical issues for designing the FDA radar system parameters. Since the subarrays offer decoupled range and angle responses, the targets can be located using the beamspace-based multiple signal classification algorithm. The range and angle estimation performance is evaluated by comparing with the Cramér-Rao lower bound.	algorithm;convex optimization;music (algorithm);mathematical optimization;phased array;radar	Wen-Qin Wang;Hing-Cheung So	2014	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2014.2305638	continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;convex optimization;telecommunications;bistatic radar;low probability of intercept radar;pulse-doppler radar;mathematics;radar imaging	Visualization	57.65767136610386	76.07442404109301	146611
342c4ebc86240545d08b03f4ab5598e65a14c79e	a comparison of pulse compression techniques for ranging applications		In this chapter, a comparison of Golay code based pulse compression (GCPC) technique with the Neuro-Fuzzy based pulse compression (NFPC) technique is demonstrated for ranging systems. Both of these techniques are used for the suppression of range side lobes that appear during the pulse compression process of the received echo pulse at the receiver for target(s) detection. Golay code is a pair of complementary codes and has an inherent property of zero side lobes when the two auto-correlation results of the complementary code pair are added. On the other side, neural network based pulse compression techniques are also developed to reduce the range side lobes. Both the techniques are different in nature but they share the common objective of range side lobe suppression in target detection. The differentiation parameters chosen for the comparison of GCPC and NFPC techniques include the computational complexity, range side lobe suppression levels, noise rejection capability, Doppler tolerance capability, range resolution capability as well as the training and convergence requirements of these pulse compression techniques. All these comparison criteria are found to determine the overall performance measures of the pulse compression techniques for ranging applications especially in case of detection and ranging of multiple closely spaced and weak targets. This comparison may be useful for a system designer to select a particular type of pulse compression technique for a specific ranging application.	pulse compression	Aamir Hussain;Zeashan H.

To improve TOA estimation, a new energy detector based threshold selection algorithm which employs a neural network is proposed. The minimum slope, kurtosis, and skewness of the received energy block values are used to determine the normalized thresholds for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The effects of the channel and integration period are evaluated. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed approach provides better precision and is more robust than other solutions over a wide range of SNRs for the CM1.1 and CM2.1 channel models in the IEEE 802.15.3c standard.	machine learning;time of arrival	Xiaolin Liang;Hao Zhang;Tingting Lv;T.

We naturally formulate the problem of MAI suppression as an asymptotic minimization of a sequence of cost functions under some linear constraint defined by the desired user's signature. The proposed algorithms embed the constraint into the direction of update, and thus the adaptive filter moves toward the optimal filter without stepping away from the constraint set. In addition, using parallel processors, the proposed algorithms attain excellent performance with linear computational complexity. Geometric interpretation clarifies an advantage of the proposed methods over existing methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve (i) much higher speed of convergence with rather better bit error rate performance than other blind methods and (ii) much higher speed of convergence than the non-blind NLMS algorithm (indeed, the speed of convergence of the proposed algorithms is comparable to the non-blind RLS algorithm)."""	intelligence amplification;parallel projection;zero suppression	Masahiro Yukawa;Renato Lu&#x00ED;s Garrido Cavalcante;Isao Yamada	2005	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e88-a.8.2062	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;mathematics	Visualization	54.34160693846374	74.77857490168388	149890

Mass-market and commercial navigation devices are being increasingly exploited for in-car navigation and for vehicular applications based on positioning. However, the low computational burden that can be afforded by such devices requires the implementation of low-complexity algorithms, allowing real-time and on-demand processing. This is the case, for instance, for open-loop architectures and of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based techniques, which estimate the frequency component of the GNSS signal through a discrete Fourier transform. A state of the art of such methods is first carried out, outlining their benefits, regarding robustness and stability, and their limitations, mainly concerning the accuracy. Successively, an innovative refinement technique is introduced, based on the computation of a frequency correction term. Further enhancements are then proposed to solve particular issues, such as the estimation of the sign of the correction term and the impact of the initial frequency error. In particular, zero forcing and a double fast Fourier transform (FFT), which represent the main contribution of this paper, are proposed to increase the accuracy without increasing the computational load. A complete analytical derivation and theoretical description is provided, along with a detailed performance assessment. Finally, a performance comparison with existing techniques and with the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for frequency estimation is given, confirming the excellent behavior of the proposed algorithm for the signal conditions and strengths that are typical of a vehicular scenario and in the presence of frequent interruptions.	approximation algorithm;automotive navigation system;complexity;computation;computer performance;cross-correlation;decibel;discrete fourier transform;discriminator;emoticon;estimation theory;fast fourier transform;hp 48 series;interference (communication);mathematical model;monte carlo method;numerical sign problem;parallel computing;pulse-doppler radar;real-time clock;refinement (computing);robustness (computer science);satellite navigation;simulation;sinc function;spectral density estimation;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Nicola Linty;Letizia Lo Presti	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2398196	fast fourier transform;electronic engineering;simulation;gnss augmentation;doppler effect;telecommunications;noise;accuracy and precision;statistics	Robotics	55.018000177028895	79.84517470835192	150638

It works when the interferences are much stronger than the desired signals and noise, and its main advantage is that the direction of arrival (DOA) information of the desired signals is not required. In this paper, a new method for suppressing strong interferences for satellite navigation based on antenna arrays is proposed. The idea is to replace the auxiliary antenna outputs in the traditional power minimization method by the principal components of received array signals, leading to an improved performance, as verified by our simulations.	direction of arrival;interference (communication);satellite navigation;simulation;zero suppression	Bo Qiu;Wei Liu;Renbiao Wu	2013	2013 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2013.6625363	single antenna interference cancellation;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;remote sensing	EDA	55.72336281266162	76.97001224634502	150698

Unlike a conventional multi-active antenna array, signals impinging on parasitic elements in an ESPAR array cannot be processed, and only the output of the sole active element can be processed. In this context, for an ESPAR array, a sparse representation of the DoA estimation problem is formulated by first using an overcomplete dictionary composed of samples from the array manifold and then projecting them onto a set of directional beampatterns. The projection matrix is designed to divide the angle space of the receive antenna array into sectors which are accessed via their corresponding sector beampatterns formed on a time division basis. The sparse signal spectrum is reconstructed by the l1-SVD (singular value decomposition) method [1], where the sparsity is enforced by the l1-norm penalty. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.	algorithm;angularjs;compressed sensing;dictionary;direction of arrival;discretization;multiuse model view;radio frequency;ruby document format;signal reconstruction;simulation;singular value decomposition;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;spectral density;taxicab geometry	Rongrong Qian;Mathini Sellathurai;Jonathon A.

In this paper, the transmission performance of impulse UWB signals over optical fiber is analyzed. Three types of UWB signals generated based on three different techniques are considered. Since optical signals with different optical spectra would have different tolerances to fiber dispersion, the transmission performance of the three types of UWB signals is studied. First, the impact of fiber chromatic dispersion on UWB waveforms and their spectra is evaluated. Then, the transmission performance of data-modulated UWB signals in an optical fiber is investigated, with a general model to analyze the signal power spectral density (PSD) being developed. The PSD of an UWB signal with on-off keying (OOK), bi-phase modulation (BPM) and pulse position modulation (PPM) schemes is calculated. Evolution of the PSD as a function of transmission distance is then performed. The suitability of the three types of UWB signals for UWBoF applications is also evaluated. The study provides a guideline for the design and development of a practical UWBoF system.	key (cryptography);on-off keying;optical fiber;performance evaluation;pulse-width modulation;spectral density;ultra-wideband;wobble frequency	Shilong Pan;Jianping Yao	2010	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2010.100813	telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber	Networks	61.96599843113642	62.96258033958035	151235

This paper compares three Doppler sensitive sonar waveforms including coherently-processed pulse trains, uniform frequency combs, and nonuniform co-prime frequency combs in terms of their delay-Doppler responses. It is shown that the use of comb waveforms can reduce Doppler sidelobes without trading Doppler resolution, unlike windowing. The pulse train and uniform comb are evaluated in terms of their ambiguity functions, while the co-prime comb was processed using a technique that exploits the co-prime structure to reduce the number of tones necessary to achieve a delay-Doppler response similar to that of a uniform comb. The cost of using a co-prime comb rather than a uniform comb is increased bandwidth extent.

96ea4a27428396b4b8e4510d74a0d8b8b61c1c48	multi-band covariance interpolation with applications in massive mimo		In this paper, we study the problem of multiband (frequency-variant) covariance interpolation with a particular emphasis towards massive MIMO applications. In massive MIMO, the communication between each Base Station (BS) with $M$ » 1 antennas and each single-antenna user occurs through a collection of scatterers in the environment, where the channel vector of each user at BS antennas consists in a weighted linear combination of the array responses of the scatterers, where each scatterer has its own angle of arrival (AoA) and complex channel gain. The array response at a given AoA depends on the wavelength of the incoming planar wave and is naturally frequency dependent. While in typical wireless communication applications the signal bandwidth is narrow enough, such that the channel second-order statistics (notably, the channel covariance matrix) can be considered frequency independent, in many other applications such as Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) the uplink (UL) and the downlink (DL) channels are separated by a large frequency interval, such that the dependence of the channel covariance on frequency cannot be ignored. In this paper, we show that although this dependence is generally negligible for a small number of antennas M, it results in a considerable distortion of the covariance matrix when M →∞. Moreover, we prove that this frequency-dependent distortion can be fully compensated by a suitable covariance interpolation in frequency. We analyze the covariance interpolation problem mathematically and prove its stability under a very mild reciprocity condition on the angular power spread function (PSF) of the users. We also investigate the validity of our results using numerical simulations.

This information serves as an input data for the creation of the look-up table, which assigns the processed amplitudes and phases at both ports of the antenna to the certain angle. This allows for a sensing with very high range resolution with simultaneous determination of the angular direction of the target.

e7cfc92bc384700241e7dd23da3822c4d39c6f6f	narrowband rfi suppression for sar system via efficient parameter-free decomposition algorithm		Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as a wideband radar system, is easy to be interfered by radio frequency systems, such as the radio, television, and cellular works. Since the narrowband radio frequency interference (RFI) has a relatively fixed frequency during the synthetic aperture time, it is removed as a low-rank term of the received signal in recent research. In this paper, we employ a novel “low-rank + sparse” decomposition model to extract the low-rank RFI and protect the strong scatterers of a useful signal, which is explicit and more efficient than the previous augmented Lagrange function model. Because the radar signal is complex, we exploit soft thresholding instead of hard thresholding in the Go Decomposition algorithm, which is defined as the revised traditional decomposition (RTD) method. Soft thresholding can recover the phase term correctly for a further focused image. Both the previous augmented Lagrange method and the proposed RTD method need to search the values of user parameters with high computational complexity. In order to eliminate the bother of tuning user parameters, a parameter-free decomposition (PFD) method is proposed to adaptively estimate the user parameters. Also, by considering the property of the useful signal, the PFD method protects the useful signal with adaptive thresholds for each snapshot. It has a better performance for RFI suppression, but costs slightly more computational time compared with the RTD method. The real SAR data and the measured RFI are provided to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed methods.	algorithm;approximation;computation;computational complexity theory;correctness (computer science);function model;interference (communication);lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;phase frequency detector;radar;radio frequency;signal reflection;snapshot (computer storage);sparse matrix;synthetic data;thresholding (image processing);time complexity;zero suppression	Yan Huang;Guisheng Liao;Jingwei Xu;Jie Li	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2018.2797946	function model;time–frequency analysis;mathematics;narrowband;synthetic aperture radar;radar;phase frequency detector;thresholding;electromagnetic interference;algorithm	EDA	56.3202364212177	78.16404541525613	157439

It is shown that the far field pattern of the array is determined by a set of weights and it is approximately invariant over a wide range of frequencies.

Such arrays represent an attractive option for design of many low-comlexity low-cost ultrawideband systems, where narrow beamwidth is achieved by increase of element spacing. This paper empirically explores the minimum bandwidth required for suppression of the grating lobes. It is found that the relative bandwidth required to suppress grating lobes is independent on the centre frequency, element spacing, and number of elements. There is a weak dependency of the bandwidth on the type of the pulse used, but the general conclusion is that the relative bandwidth has to exceed 100% in order to suppress the grating lobes. It is, however, noted that whilst sparse array with a low number of antenna elements can suppress the grating lobes and posses a narrow beam, the compromise for this feature is a reduction of the level of spatial filtering between the main lobe and other directions, when compared to arrays where grating lobes are suppressed by dense spacing.	acoustic lobing;bandwidth (signal processing);phased array;radiation pattern;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;smart antenna;sparse matrix;superposition principle;ultra-wideband;while;zero suppression	Vit Sipal;David J.

Complex bathymetry and propagation effects may cause multipath spreading of the transmitted signal before it arrives back at the receiver. Correlating with a replica of the transmitted signal may thus severely degrade the performance of a system. The paper explores the use of a multilayer perceptron to compensate for channel and other medium effects in a acoustically complex environment. It is shown that adaptation to the environment in such scenarios can lead to significant processing gain and that a multilayer perceptron is capable of implementing this type of processing.	multilayer perceptron	Charles W.

The random binary phase modulation coding technique is applied to the original transponder signal waveforms to improve the autocorrelation and sidelobe performance. A detailed study of the characterizations of this waveform and its potential for target detection is presented. The impact of random phase coding is analyzed from both signal spectrum (based on stochastic signal model) and radar ambiguity functions (based on deterministic signal model). The combination of pulse-position modulation and maximum length binary random phase coding sequence is shown to have satisfactory performance. In terms of optimal receiver, the traditional correlation receiver (or matched filter) and mismatched filters with different criteria are analyzed. The tradeoffs of receiver design for transponder-based radars are discussed. The experimental implementation of a transponder-based radar sensor with arbitrary waveform generator and commercial, off-the-shelf components is introduced and discussed. The experiment results show that noncooperative target detection using such a radar sensor is feasible with appropriate design of waveforms, system architecture and signal processors.	algorithm;autocorrelation;automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast;central processing unit;clutter;emulator;experiment;interference (communication);matched filter;mathematical optimization;prototype;pulse-width modulation;radar;sensor;spectral density;systems architecture;transponder;waveform	Shang Wang;Yan Zhang;Andrew Huston;Zhengzheng Li;Michael Mallo;John Fagan	2011	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2011.5937262	spectrum;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;transponder;arbitrary waveform generator;pulse-doppler radar;phase modulation;matched filter;correlation;radar;remote sensing;ambiguity function;systems architecture	Mobile	58.6340394194663	69.920722769921	161563

However, digital phased array algorithms are of high computational complexity, which leads to correspondingly high circuit complexity in a VLSI implementation. A 2-D IIR beam space-time plane-wave digital filter can achieve the required electronically-scanned RF beams albeit at an order of magnitude lower circuit complexity compared to phased arrays at the cost of non-linear phase response. The proposed method approximately rectifies the non-linearity in the phase response using an FFT-based phase compensation method which linearises the response at higher frequencies close to the Nyquist limit where the phase non-linearity is worst in the beam filter response. FPGA prototypes using a Xilinx Virtex-4 Sx35-10ff668 device on an XtremeDSP Kit-4 are provided, which show real-time operation at up to 315 MHz.	algorithm;beamforming;circuit complexity;computational complexity theory;digital filter;direction of arrival;distortion;fast fourier transform;field-programmable gate array;group delay and phase delay;infinite impulse response;linear phase;linearizer;microwave;nonlinear system;nyquist frequency;optic axis of a crystal;phase response;phased array;radar;radio frequency;rapid prototyping;real-time clock;signals intelligence;smart antenna;transfer function;ultra-wideband;very-large-scale integration	Sewwandi Wijayaratna;Arjuna Madanayake;S.

A model of probing waveform, which allows performing digital beam forming at functional level is proposed. The bearing resolution of MIMO radar is estimated based on radiation pattern and ambiguity function modeling.

This multipath angle spread is well known to lead to loss of spatial signal coherence across a receiving sensor array, requiring complicated combining schemes to achieve optimal performance, particularly when the signal is only partially coherent across the array. We show that the discrete Fourier transform serves as an efficient, robust, and asymptotically optimal spatial combiner for uniform linear arrays in multipath channels. In addition, the proposed spatial processing allows for convenient integration of conventional frequency-domain methods for angle-of-arrival searches. Simulation results show that the proposed combining scheme provides near-optimal performance at significantly less computation, even for arrays of modest size.	angle of arrival;angularjs;asymptotically optimal algorithm;coherence (physics);computation;discrete fourier transform;multipath propagation;power dividers and directional couplers;radar;sonar (symantec);simulation	Anil M.

This results in circuits being designed with ldquosufficientrdquo margins leading to lower efficiency and high power consumption. In this paper, we develop an adaptive power management strategy for RF systems that optimally trades-off power vs. performance for the RF front-end to maintain operation at or below a specified maximum bit error rate (BER) across temporally changing operating conditions. As the communication channel degrades, more power is consumed by the RF front end and vice versa. Since the maximum bit-error rate specification is not violated, minimum voice or video quality through the wireless channel is always guaranteed.	best, worst and average case;bit error rate;channel (communications);interference (communication);noise margin;power management;radio frequency;requirement;transceiver;x.690	Rajarajan Senguttuvan;Shreyas Sen;Abhijit Chatterjee	2007	2007 25th International Conference on Computer Design	10.1109/ICCD.2007.4601956	electronic engineering;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;video quality;front and back ends;operant conditioning;radio frequency;wireless;transceiver;channel	Mobile	53.802614697677555	64.0967627134577	164868

This optimisation algorithm is used to replace the high-dimensional optimisation procedure, necessary to compute the joint maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters using several separate maximisation processes, which can be performed sequentially. Spherical arrays provide wide scan coverage with low grating lobe levels. Because a uniform antenna element distribution on this spherical surface gives rise to the smallest variations in received signal levels over the whole angular space, a uniform distribution of antennas on a sphere is used. For this completely general three-dimensional array, we have for the fitst time investigated the resolution of the SAGE algorithm, the convergence and the bit error rate as a function of the signal to noise ratio. We will show that this algorithm is a powerful tool that can be applied successfully for high-resolution parameter extraction.	algorithm;direction of arrival;estimation theory	Jo Verhaevert;Emmanuel Van Lil;Antoine Van de Capelle	2004	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2003.12.003	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;smart antenna;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	ML	53.82580595417027	70.96882447074482	166216

A number of crosstalk cancellation techniques have been proposed to address this. Whilst these schemes lead to large performance increases they also have high run-time complexities, a problem which grows rapidly with the number of lines within a binder. Since the majority of crosstalk typically comes from only a few dominant crosstalkersit is possible to do partial crosstalk cancellation. In this paper we present a low-complexity, partial crosstalk cancellation technique for VDSL based on line selection. We derive the optimal line selection technique, and several low-complexity selection algorithms which give near-optimal performance in most scenarios. These techniques lead to significant reductions in runtime complexity whilst giving similar performance to full crosstalk cancellation.	crosstalk;elegant degradation;file binder;selection algorithm;while	Raphael Cendrillon;Marc Moonen;Dhananjay Gore;Arogyaswami Paulraj	2003		10.1109/ICASSP.2003.1202737	real-time computing;digital subscriber line;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	55.3247387050835	81.36793392144988	167964

The classical Volterra series provides an accurate model of many nonlinear systems, but the number of parameters grows extremely quickly as the memory depth and polynomial order are increased. Recently, concepts from compressed sensing have been applied to nonlinear system modeling in order to address this issue. This work investigates the theory and practice of applying compressed sensing techniques to nonlinear system identification under the constraints of typical radio frequency (RF) laboratories. The main theoretical result shows that these techniques are capable of identifying sparse Memory Polynomials using only single-tone training signals rather than pseudorandom noise. Empirical results using laboratory measurements of an RF receiver show that sparse Generalized Memory Polynomials can also be recovered from two-tone signals.	analogue electronics;compressed sensing;distortion;nonlinear system identification;out-of-band agreement;polynomial;pseudorandom noise;radio frequency;selective calling;sparse matrix;systems modeling;systems theory	Andrew K.

This provides extra degrees of freedom compared to the traditional transmit beamforming approach. It has been shown in the recent literature that MIMO radar systems have many advantages. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of waveforms and receiving filters in the MIMO radar when the prior information of target and clutter are available. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the waveforms and receiving filters such that the detection performance can be maximized. The proposed algorithm guarantees that the SINR performance improves in each iteration step. The numerical results show that the proposed methods have better SINR performances than existing design methods.	algorithm;beamforming;clutter;iteration;iterative method;mimo;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;performance;radar;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;transmitter;waveform	Chun-Yang Chen;Palghat P.

We consider a Binary Offset Carrier shaping function as used in satellite positioning, which is a time-limited pulse with a large excess bandwidth, and a Data Aided synchronization scenario, where we have a constant time-delay and a Brownian phase evolution with a linear drift. The proposed study is relative to the use of an oversampled signal model after matched filtering, leading to a colored reception noise and a non-stationary power signal. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we derive the Hybrid Cramér-Rao Bound for the joint phase/Doppler estimation problem. Then, we propose a method for the joint time-delay/carrier synchronization, which couples an Extended Kalman Filter and an Expectation-Maximization type algorithm. Our numerical results show the potential gain of using the oversampled signal for carrier synchronization, obtaining better performances than using a classical synchronizer, and good time-delay estimation.	ambiguous name resolution;bandlimiting;converge;distortion;doppler effect;expectation–maximization algorithm;extended kalman filter;frequency offset;global positioning system;iteration;iterative method;linear algebra;ncsa mosaic;noise shaping;numerical analysis;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;offset binary;oversampling;performance;roll-off;sampling (signal processing);samsung sgr-a1;satellite navigation;shannon (unit);signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process;synchronizer (algorithm);time complexity	Jordi Vilà-Valls;Laurent Ros;Jean-Marc Brossier	2012	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2011.06.008	electronic engineering;oversampling;expectation–maximization algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;machine learning;control theory;gnss applications;extended kalman filter	EDA	54.412921716551345	76.35293664525128	169748

A new set of polyphase sequences is presented with good correlation properties as well as resilience to Doppler shifts.

1f2f464983e219420fe88f38c7aa61edfdeb3514	median-pump wavelength assignment scheme for optical networks with parametric wavelength conversion	optical packet switching;wavelength assignment;wavelength conversion	This paper proposes a wavelength assignment scheme for optical networks with parametric wavelength conversion to minimize the number of wavelength converters when the number of wavelengths is given. Wavelength conversion is needed to reducing the number of wavelengths required in the network, since the number of wavelengths is limited. A parametric wavelength converter (PWC) can be used to reduce the number of wavelength converters because of its multiple wavelengths conversion function. PWC uses the pump wavelength to define original and converted wavelengths. The setting of the pump wavelength affects the converted wavelengths. Thus, the number of transmission wavelengths depends on the position of the pump wavelength. The proposed scheme is a heuristic scheme that considers the position of pump wavelength. An output wavelength that sets the pump wavelength near to the middle of the transmission wavelength band is selected. The proposed scheme designs each PWC to maximize the number of wavelength conversions supported. Numerical results with our examined networks indicate up to 37% reduction in the total number of converters required, compared to a scheme that the position of pump wavelength is not considered. Moreover, the reduction is 42% reduction compared to an optical network with single channel wavelength converters. c © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	algorithm;heuristic;subscriber identity module;time complexity;wavelength-division multiplexing	Nattapong Kitsuwan;Maesaporn Leelasetakul;Eiji Oki	2015	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2014.05.009	telecommunications	Vision	64.99994594394248	62.41054240403568	171048

They exist commonly in different scenarios and degrade the performance of PLC systems significantly. Accurate estimation of the NBN and the PIN are important for the power line channel characterization and can help improve the quality of service (QoS). In contrast to other noise classes, both NBN and PIN may exhibit strong cyclic behaviors. In this work, the cyclic properties of both of them are investigated. Based on the results, an universal algorithm is developed to detect and cancel narrowband and periodic impulsive components from PLC signals. The proposed method is executed purely on the physical layer and does not require specialized hardware. Its performance is verified through simulations and real measurements.	algorithm;cyclostationary process;logical volume management;power-line communication;quality of service;simulation	Bin Han;Cornelius Kaiser;Klaus Dostert	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248409	gaussian noise;effective input noise temperature;noise;burst noise;colors of noise;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;noise measurement;noise;low-noise amplifier;noise;noise figure;noise floor;phase noise;power-line communication;carrier-to-receiver noise density;noise generator	EDA	60.144776104896145	60.821645343349125	177033

High penetration ability and absence of multipath effects make it advantageous over other indoor localization techniques based on electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Moreover, the circular rotating magnetic field’s specific structure enables it to be distinguished from common magnetic interferences, which generally lack this feature. A dual-axis search-coil magnetometer is placed at a known location with a known orientation and it is used to localize the mobile platform equipped with a source of a rotating magnetic field. We have carried out a theoretical analysis obtaining closed-form expressions for the bearing and distance. The analytical expressions allow calculations without high computational complexity as often required by the numerical analysis methods. The localization method has been tested using a computer simulation in order to evaluate its performance. We have developed a system prototype that has been successfully tested in our laboratory. In a test area of 7 m  $\times7$  m, the experimental results yield a mean localization error of 0.11 m and a maximal localization error of less than 0.29 m. The high accuracy of the method and the absence of resource-intensive calculations allow low-power, real-time implementation.

Through our work we propose and demonstrate a combination of semiconductor optical amplifier based-PSA and injection locking (IL) of semiconductor laser to squeeze both amplitude and phase noise thereby improving the quality of regeneration. We also investigate the effect of the sequence of the two squeezing processes on the quality of regeneration. We conclusively prove that, under optimal operating conditions, appropriate sequencing of amplitude squeezing and phase squeezing is indeed capable of obtaining a better overall noise performance.	data rate units;injection locking;lock (computer science);modulation;noise reduction;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optical amplifier;phase noise;polar surface area;rewriting;semiconductor;simulation	Sai Kanth Dacha;Arjun Natarajan Iyer;Aneesh Sobhanan;Deepa Venkitesh	2017	2017 Twenty-third National Conference on Communications (NCC)	10.1109/NCC.2017.8077068	phase noise;phase-shift keying;nonlinear optics;optical amplifier;telecommunications;amplitude;four-wave mixing;injection locking;amplifier;physics;electronic engineering	EDA	64.30040067855415	61.08803836936973	179224

As the association between the TDOA/FDOA measurements obtained by each pair of satellites and the corresponding emitters is typically not known, the emitter-measurement association and the emitters' locations need to be jointly estimated. In this paper, we first formulate the joint estimation problem as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem. Then, we propose a semidefinite relaxation-based approach to tackle the problem and demonstrate its efficacy via simulations.	fdoa;geolocation;lagrangian relaxation;lambert's cosine law;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;multilateration;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation	Kehu Yang;Lizhong Jiang;Anthony Man-Cho So	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472210	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;multilateration;mathematics;fdoa	Robotics	58.00404973498165	76.32106415197903	183471

However, for the analysis of systems with high SNR and/or high sensitivity, the narrowband assumption can not provide sufficient detail. Furthermore, if the DF system has a switched receiver architecture, the performance of the system is greatly affected by the signal bandwidth rather than the SNR. In this study, for signal with non-zero bandwidth, direction finding performance of the switched receivers was analyzed. Analysis results were compared with the analyzes made using narrowband assumption and supported by the simulation results.	bandwidth (signal processing);direction finding;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	Huseyin Yildiz	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404564	architecture;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;electronic engineering;narrowband;direction finding;communication channel	Mobile	54.47573886569219	78.55814028074622	183995

In the literature it is almost universally assumed that the radio noise is a white Gaussian stochastic process and we are testing also how often deviations from this baseline are found. Our measurement approach is able to capture frequency and time domain data at very high accuracy. In this paper we report the first results from several different spatially separated measurement areas, enabling the study of noise levels at diverse indoor and outdoor locations.

8d3ce7964ae87c270d9908fc11b4d2b555d6797e	simultaneous determination of modulation types and signal-to-noise ratios using feature-based approach		This paper presents a low-complexity technique for simultaneous determination of modulation types and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in wireless communication systems. The proposed approach exploits the extracted features of patterns observed in signals’ asynchronous amplitudes histograms, for the simultaneous determination of these quantities using support vector machine. Features extraction has been performed by a well-known technique called principal component analysis which is used to extract the most significant features before being supplied to the artificial intelligent system. Simulations for three commonly-used modulation types have been conducted under real-world channel conditions. The results conclude that the presented approach can accurately identify the modulation types with 99.83% accuracy despite the existence of real-world channel impairments. Furthermore, the algorithm is capable of SNRs estimation over a broad range of 0–30 dB with average estimation error of 0.79 dB. The proposed paper exploits the simplicity of generating asynchronous amplitudes histograms to enable cost-effective and reduced-complexity implementation in cognitive wireless systems.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;asynchronous serial communication;computer simulation;modulation;principal component analysis;signal-to-noise ratio;support vector machine	Tarik Adnan Almohamad;Mohd Fadzli Mohd Salleh;Mohd Nazri Mahmud;Adnan Haider Yusef Sa&#x2019;D	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2809448	phase-shift keying;support vector machine;asynchronous communication;principal component analysis;modulation;feature extraction;computer science;distributed computing;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;signal-to-noise ratio;communication channel	Robotics	54.15069339995809	82.1922351807819	187815

The purpose of the comparison is to determine which of the two approaches more accurately estimates height using a Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (FMCW) automotive radar. First the process of peak detection and target number extraction is described, then the three dimensional (3D) high resolution recursive Fourier algorithm RELAX is used to enhance the range, Doppler, and angular resolution of the detected targets. Next, the DBF and the DBS algorithms are described, and used to estimate the height of an entrance gate 4.5 m high, based on the RELAX output spectrum. Finally height measurement results of DBF and DBS are shown, discussed and compared. The results show that DBS is a powerful and hardware efficient method capable of retrieving very accurate target heights, without requiring multiple vertical antennas.	algorithm;angularjs;beamforming;direct-broadcast satellite;fractal antenna;image resolution;linear programming relaxation;mimo;modulation;radar;recursion;sensor;vertical market software	Amir Laribi;Markus Hahn;Jürgen Dickmann;Christian Waldschmidt	2017	2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317811	artificial intelligence;fourier transform;computer vision;beam (structure);acoustics;radar;doppler effect;engineering;angular resolution;frequency modulation;beamforming;sharpening	Robotics	57.93094865178775	72.60291012886672	188494

However, it results in a poor resolution and high sidelobes. To address these challenges, a new algorithm namely delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS) was introduced having lower sidelobes compared to DAS. To improve the resolution of DMAS, a beamformer is introduced using minimum variance (MV) adaptive beamforming combined with DMAS, so-called minimum variance-based DMAS (MVB-DMAS). It is shown that expanding the DMAS equation results in multiple terms representing a DAS algebra. It is proposed to use the MV adaptive beamformer instead of the existing DAS. MVB-DMAS is evaluated numerically and experimentally. In particular, at the depth of 45 mm MVB-DMAS results in about 31, 18, and 8 dB sidelobes reduction compared to DAS, MV, and DMAS, respectively. The quantitative results of the simulations show that MVB-DMAS leads to improvement in full-width-half-maximum about 96%, 94%, and 45% and signal-to-noise ratio about 89%, 15%, and 35% compared to DAS, DMAS, MV, respectively. In particular, at the depth of 33 mm of the experimental images, MVB-DMAS results in about 20 dB sidelobes reduction in comparison with other beamformers.	adaptive beamformer;beamforming;chromium;computation;data general eclipse mv/8000;eighty nine;experiment;full width at half maximum;mandibular right second molar tooth;mental suffering;monomorium minimum basophil bound ab:acnc:pt:bld:qn:lhr;multiplication;numerical analysis;photoacoustic imaging;plasminogen inactivators;real-time clock;sample variance;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;train communication network;algorithm;amsonic acid;multivesicular body assembly;width	Moein Mozaffarzadeh;Ali Mahloojifar;Mahdi Orooji;Saba Adabi;Mohammadreza Nasiriavanaki	2018	Journal of biomedical optics	10.1117/1.JBO.23.2.026002		HPC	55.74988991132571	75.96244893438543	189371

A properly designed interpolation matrix is used to jointly achieve transmit array interpolation and design transmit beamforming. The transmit array interpolation problem is cast as a convex optimization problem based on minmax criterion. Our designs enable to control the side-lobe levels of the transmit beampattern and enforce different transmit beams to have rotational invariance with respect to each other, a property that enables the use of computationally efficient direction finding techniques. It is shown that the rotational invariance can be achieved independently in both the elevation and the azimuth spatial domains, allowing for independent elevation and azimuth direction finding.	acoustic lobing;algorithmic efficiency;beamforming;convex optimization;direction finding;interpolation;mimo;map;mathematical optimization;minimax;optimization problem	Aboulnasr Hassanien;Sergiy A.

cc62bf938199b55ee14ade30ef80f820d7d0d9f1	dispersion compensation using high-positive dispersive optical fibers		The common and traditional method for optical dispersion compensation is concatenating the transmitting optical fiber by a compensating optical fiber having a high-negative dispersion coefficient. In this Letter, we take the opposite direction and show how an optical fiber with a high-positive dispersion coefficient is used for dispersion compensation. Our optical dispersion compensating structure is the optical implementation of an iterative algorithm in signal processing. The proposed dispersion compensating system is constructed by cascading a number of compensating sub-systems, and its compensation capability is improved by increasing the number of embedded sub-systems. We also show that the compensation capability is a trade-off between the transmission length and bandwidth. We use the simulation results to validate the performance of the introduced dispersion compensating module. Photonic crystal fibers with high-positive dispersion coefficients can be used for constructing the proposed optical dispersion compensating module.

In contrast to state-of-the-art barrage jammers, which continuously jam entire frequency bands irrespective of current signal activities, responsive jammers regularly perform wideband scans of the radio spectrum and are thus able to react to observed signals. By this means, the available transmit energy can be focused on currently relevant spectral areas, which potentially leads to significantly improved jamming efficiencies. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of this jamming technology with focus on vehicle- or convoy-protection jamming against radio-controlled improvised explosive devices (RCIEDs). Bringing in experience from our product development as well as from theoretical studies, we discuss various system design aspects of responsive anti-RCIED jammers and point out the main technological challenges. In particular, the issues of jam-duration optimization and time synchronization of multiple responsive jammers are discussed in some detail.	frequency band;jam;mathematical optimization;new product development;radio control;radio jamming;responsive web design;systems design	Jan Mietzner;Patrick Nickel;Askold Meusling;Patrick Loos;Gerhard Bauch	2012	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2012.6316774	algorithm design;synchronization;explosive material;telecommunications;computer science;noise measurement;radio spectrum;computer security;bandwidth	Visualization	59.308064360402916	69.36385392871432	190463

It was found that the body proximity effect was mainly blocking the radiation up to 20 dB towards the body side, and the hands on the keyboard were mainly blocking the radiation up to 10 dB towards the direction at an angle to the head. It was also found that the highest EM absorption in the typing and non-typing situations occurred in the hand and in the chest, respectively, and the hands on the keyboard had a significantly blocking effect for the SAR spread to the head region.

Thus, CPM technology is widely used in communication systems. The shape of frequency pulse can influence the bandwidth occupancy of CPM, and smoother phase trajectories are obtained by using smoother frequency pulses. In this paper, a mathematical Pan-function model of the optimized frequency pulse is established and solved by introducing Fourier series, which can provide smooth phase trajectories of CPM signal. The simulations of the CPM signal quadrature modulation and coherent demodulation are performed using the MATLAB software. Moreover, the spectral characteristics of the obtained optimized CPM signal were analyzed and compared with the minimum shift keying (MSK) signal and other CPM signals with smooth frequency pulses. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method provides an excellent bandwidth efficiency compared to other existing methods discussed in this paper. The whole system has been successfully downloaded to field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. The operating results are consistent with expected results, verifying the correctness of this method.	bandwidth (signal processing);carrier recovery;coherence (physics);correctness (computer science);field-programmable gate array;function model;key (cryptography);matlab;mathematical optimization;modulation;simulation;spectral efficiency;verification and validation	Wei Xue;Wenjing Shang;Sergey B.

The active radar networks are composed of multiple radar transmitters and multichannel receivers placed on moving platforms. First, the log-likelihood function of the received signal for a Rician target is derived, where the received signal scattered off the target comprises of dominant scatterer (DS) component and weak isotropic scatterers (WIS) components. Then, the analytically closed-form expressions of the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the Cartesian coordinates of target position and velocity are calculated, which can be adopted as a performance metric to access the target parameter estimation accuracy for LFM-based radar network systems in a Rice fading environment. It is found that the cumulative Fisher information matrix (FIM) is a linear combination of both DS component and WIS components, and it also demonstrates that the joint CRLB is a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), target's radar cross section (RCS) and transmitted waveform parameters, as well as the relative geometry between the target and the radar network architectures. Finally, numerical results are provided to indicate that the joint target parameter estimation performance of active radar networks can be significantly improved with the exploitation of DS component.	aoc2 gene;arpp21 gene;architecture as topic;cartesian closed category;cesarean section;cross section (geometry);entity name part qualifier - adopted;estimation theory;fisher information;hearing loss, high-frequency;modulation;numerical analysis;population parameter;radar;signal-to-noise ratio;transmitter;velocity (software development);waveform;weakness;disease transmission	Chenguang Shi;Sana Salous;Fei Wang;Jianjiang Zhou	2016		10.3390/s16122072	electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications	Mobile	58.45597418931071	76.68474044907103	191693

This work aims to improve the performance of TIR estimation by making use of the temporal correlation between successive received signals, and minimize the mean square error (MSE) of TIR estimation. The waveform design approach is based upon constant learning from the target feature at the receiver. Under the multiple antennas scenario, a dynamic feedback loop control system is established to real-time monitor the change in the target features extracted form received signals. The transmitter adapts its transmitted waveform to suit the time-invariant environment. Finally, the simulation results show that, as compared with the waveform design method based on the MAP criterion, the proposed waveform design algorithm is able to improve the performance of TIR estimation for extended targets with multiple iterations, and has a relatively lower level of complexity.	algorithm;antenna device component;computational complexity theory;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);control system;data curation;digital curation;extraction;feedback;iteration;kalman filter;mean squared error;natural science disciplines;numerous;radar;real-time clock;simulation;transmitter (medical device);time-invariant system;transmitter device component;waveform;disease transmission;transmission process	Yu Yao;Junhui Zhao;Lenan Wu	2018		10.3390/s18061743	electronic engineering;engineering;radar;waveform;cognition	EDA	54.598309703214326	75.98708088900396	196131

Several instrument modes (ScanSAR mode for example) require a steering on the elevation antenna pattern. In order to come up with RF performance predictions for the various antenna beams, it is necessary to develop an efficient method to synthesize and analyze the beams. In this study, a mathematical model is developed for RADARSAT2 antenna and implemented in a workstation named, the RADARSAT2 antenna pattern synthesis workstation (APSW). The APSW performs two major tasks: antenna pattern modeling and antenna pattern synthesis. The Genetic Algorithm is used for an optimum antenna synthesis. The APSW is described in this paper. Examples of antenna pattern generated by the APSW in the presence of T/R failures, as well as the optimum T/R excitation law to be applied for minimizing the T/R failure impact are also presented.	column (database);computational electromagnetics;genetic algorithm;mathematical model;phased array;radiation pattern;radio frequency;workstation	Ridha Touzi;Charles E.

The modulation accuracy is a measure of how far a test signal is from a reference signal at the symbol values when some parameters in a reconstruction model are optimized for best agreement. This paper provides an approach to computation of error vector magnitude as described in several standards from measured or simulated data. It is shown that the error vector magnitude optimization problem is generally non-convex. Robust estimation of the initial conditions for the optimizer is suggested, which is particularly important for a non-convex problem. A Bender decomposition approach is used to separate convex and non-convex parts of the problem to make the optimization procedure simpler and robust. A two step global optimization method is suggested where the global step is the grid method and the local method is the Newton method. A number of test cases are shown to illustrate the concepts.	audio power amplifier;computation;convex function;convex optimization;estimation theory;frequency offset;global optimization;gradient;hessian;initial condition;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;modulation;newton's method;nonlinear system;optimization problem;qr decomposition;signal processing;test case;transmitter	Tobias Lindstrøm Jensen;Torben Larsen	2013	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.022513.120093	mathematical optimization;transmitter;electronic engineering;convex optimization;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;newton's method;decomposition;radio receiver;vector optimization;statistics;modulation	ML	53.92263111688246	80.74786395906698	198534
