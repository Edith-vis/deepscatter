The image is modeled as a Markov Random Field (MRF), and color image restoration is cast as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation problem. We propose a First Order Interchannel Interaction (FOII) model for image restoration. Simulated annealing algorithm is then used to minimize the posterior energy function. We compare the simulation results of conventional non interaction (NI) approach and the proposed FOII approach. Proposed model is fairly general, and the results are satisfactory even when interchannel degradation parameter is unknown.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;circuit restoration;color image;elegant degradation;gaussian blur;image restoration;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;simulated annealing;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Narasimha Kaulgud;Uday B.

This paper focused on the information extraction of non-wood forest based on Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) data. Band characteristics were analyzed to get understanding of this data wholly by information content, correlation coefficient and Optimum Index Factor (OIF). A new set of data with eight bands were obtained by the fusion of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the first three components of Principal Component Analysis (PCA1, PCA2, PCA3) and the four bands of ALOS data. Various kinds of vegetations, especially non-wood forest was analyzed through the Spectral Feature Model (SFM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) with association of topographical map and field investigation data. Results show that NDVI and PCA can improve the extraction accuracy of non-wood forest. In addition, SFM reduces the phenomenon of mixed classification and improves the information extraction accuracy of non-wood forest, which will provide reference for the classification of vegetation.	coefficient;feature model;information extraction;optical internetworking forum;principal component analysis;self-information;topography	Enping Yan;Hui Lin;Dengkui Mo;Liming Bai;Hua Sun	2010	2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569673	topographic map;computer science;data mining;maximum likelihood;information extraction;statistics	DB	78.5381309369905	-59.21649867833077	4422

Supported by the Carbon Special Program and the Ecological Decade Program, the spatial patterns of land cover changes and its driving forces were investigated in Southwestern China from 1990 to 2010 in this paper. The residential land expansion, croplands lost, plateau lake extension and shrinkage, forests recovery and increasing rubber and orchard plantations are the general characteristics of land cover changes in Southwestern China. National macro-policies (such as Western Development Strategy and Ecological Protection Projects), urbanization, rural labors transfer, hydropower development, climate change and natural disasters are the main driving forces for land cover changes in this region over the last two decades.	ecosystem services;orchard;plateau effect	Ainong Li;Guangbin Lei;Jinhu Bian;Zhengjian Zhang	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730418	carbon;meteorology;common spatial pattern;land development;hydrology;remote sensing	SE	82.99371365006371	-56.78194455528254	4426

This hidden pattern can be visualized by overlaying the original image with watermarked ones. Also it can be visualized using a simple XNOR operation. In this paper we propose a method called dot diffusion with nonlinear thresholding (DDNT) to embed hidden data in halftone images and its modification to color halftone images which will be called CDDNT. The main advantage of this method is that the hidden pattern's intensity can be adjusted by three parameters. Also it utilizes the inherent parallelism in dot diffusion halftoning method, although it suffers from its lower visual quality than some other halftoning methods such as error diffusion.	algorithm;digital watermarking;error diffusion;nonlinear system;parallel computing;simulation;thresholding (image processing);watermark (data file);xnor gate	Omid Taheri;Ahmad Movahedian Attar;Mohammad Mehdi DaneshPanah	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366208	computer vision;computer science;theoretical computer science;diffusion;error diffusion;information hiding;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	57.768708887093915	-63.9323090642274	4461

Our framework is based on an interleaved pixel arrangement, where a pixel measures phase at a different modulation frequency from its neighboring pixels. We demonstrate that: (1) it is practical to capture ToF images that contain phases from two frequencies in a single shot, with no loss in signal fidelity, (2) phase unwrapping can be effectively performed on such an interleaved phase image, and (3) our method preserves the original spatial resolution. We find that the output of our framework is comparable to results using two shots under separate modulation frequencies, and is significantly better than using a single modulation frequency.	instantaneous phase;modulation;pixel	Changpeng Ti;Ruigang Yang;James Davis	2016	2016 Fourth International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)	10.1109/3DV.2016.74	continuous phase modulation;delta modulation;electronic engineering;pulse-frequency modulation;geography;telecommunications;optics;analog transmission	Vision	73.62717337083835	-69.65211029969447	4501

All image quality methods compare two images by providing a quantitative score that describes the degree of similarity, or in other words, the level of distortion between them. In this work, we propose a new full reference image quality measure using some statistical functions called Copulas. To our knowledge, this is the first time that copulas are used for image quality measurement. Our algorithms use the steerable pyramid technique to decompose the original and the distorted images. Then we exploit some of copula functions properties to calculate the image quality of the distorted image (such as a forged image) with respect to its original. The experimental results of our method show that the effectiveness of our method is comparable or better than the state of the current state of the art methods. In addition, our method is simple and fast.	algorithm;clutter;digital image processing;distortion;image quality;marshall rose;pyramid (image processing);structural similarity	Saif alZahir;Radwa Hammad	2015	2015 IEEE 28th Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129452	image quality;image warping;image texture;computer vision;feature detection;transform coding;distortion;binary image;image processing;digital image processing;pattern recognition;mathematical model;mathematics;mutual information;top-hat transform;statistics	Vision	61.76053675023037	-64.53469736586244	4576

The problem is posed within the framework of the vector space approach to color systems. The measure of the goodness of a set of color scanning filters presented in earlier work is used as an optimization criterion to design color scanning filters modeled in terms of known, smooth, nonnegative functions. The best filters are then trimmed using the gradient of the mean square DeltaE(ab) error to obtain filters with a lower value of perceptual error. The results obtained demonstrate the utility of the method.	choose (action);color;elegant degradation;expectation–maximization algorithm;filter design;gradient;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;normal statistical distribution;scanner device component;solutions;trat1 wt allele;technical standard	Poorvi L.

The variation in silicate mineralogy from felsic to mafic is represented as a shift of the main spectral feature (reststrahlen band) towards longer wavelengths. This characteristic is utilized in mapping silicate mineralogy using multispectral TIR data. We use some lithologic indices on ASTER TIR data (L1B and L2) of a metamorphic terrain in NW India to map surface lithologies. The test area represents metamorphosed rocks with almost pure silicates (quartzites) on one end, and impure carbonates and mafic rocks (amphibolites) on the other. The results demonstrate that atmospherically corrected surface radiance data lead to an overall improvement in remote lithology mapping. Surface emissivity data derived using temperature and emissivity separation (TES) algorithm are used to generate a silica abundance map of the study area in conjunction with an empirical model. Field and laboratory analyses of select rock samples collected from the study area are used to validate remote silica abundance estimates.	algorithm;multispectral image;netware	Ashish Misra;Ravi P.

The experiments show that: 1) the geometric structures of reconstructed trajectories contain useful information for nonlinear signal classification; 2) shape analyzers in terms of computer vision are able to capture such information; and 3) the proposed framework provides a means to access the rich information contained in the geometric structures of reconstructed trajectories.	computer vision;experiment;feature extraction;nonlinear system;shape analysis (digital geometry);state space;time series	Su Yang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2005.849038	signal reconstruction;computer vision;feature extraction;computer science;state space;machine learning;time series;pattern recognition;shape analysis;mathematics	Vision	67.96338920277476	-58.531395393788785	4669
828aae95af788bbd7fbc5a0099fcd14c56e9f0d9	using the shape characteristics of rain to identify and remove rain from video	aspect ratio	Dynamic weather effects such as rain cause rapid, distracting motion in a video sequence. This paper aims to remove rain and similar effects from video footage using a multi-step approach; Regions are identified as being potentially affected by rain if they exhibit a short-duration intensity spike. Falling rain drops are imaged by a video camera in a predictable way, as a streak with a consistent range of possible aspect ratios. To preserve scene motion, regions identified by this criterion are investigated, and those that do not fit into the expected range of aspect ratios are ignored. Information about the direction of rainfall is also used to reduce false detections. The effectiveness of this technique is shown on a number of video sequences. The method presented provides advantages over existing techniques.

Detailed documentation necessitates recording it at different levels of details or spatial reso lutions. A general approach would entail a co mbination of 3D data from different 3D sensors and information from different sources in order to meet set r solution targets. We used a prototype multi-resolution 3D laser imaging scanner that allowe d acquiring the shape information of the three main chambers with a spatial resolution that improves with shorter standoffs. The system can record 3D data at a camera-to-object distance which ranges from 0.5 m to 10 m. At a standoff of 0.75 m, it provides a depth uncertainty of 0.08 mm and an optical lateral resolution of 0.2 mm on actual rock surfaces. This paper pre sents the project and the results obtained. The 10-day long visit into the Grotto generated more that 100 GB of 2 D and 3D data that requires the development of new tools for modelling and managing the archive.	10g-pon;3d computer graphics;3d modeling;3d reconstruction;archive;digital 3d;documentation;expect;lateral thinking;passive optical network;pictogram;prototype;sensor;the 100	J.-Angelo Beraldin;François Blais;Luc Cournoyer;Michel Picard;Daniel Gamache;Virginia Valzano;Adriana Bandiera;M.

But due to backscattering of microwave signals, these images get contaminated with speckle noise. This paper proposes an improved local statistics filter for filtering the speckle noise from the SAR images. The proposed filter is a combination of mean and hybrid median filters, employing a novel 7x7 filtering template. The performance of the proposed filter is tested against the standard Hybrid Median filters for which the evaluated values show better performs in terms of PSNR (in dB) and SSI.	noise reduction	Vikrant Bhateja;Anubhav Tripathi;Anurag Gupta	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-01778-5_3	speckle noise;median filter;computer vision;root-raised-cosine filter;salt-and-pepper noise;remote sensing	ML	66.764870016094	-65.99242021908057	4769

An edge-based median filtering (EMF) algorithm is proposed for adaptive deinterlacing. A criterion of motion vector reliability (MVR) is also introduced for better interpolation. For each motion compensated block, two motion vectors between opposite-parity fields and one between same-parity fields are taken into account. Experiments show that the proposed MVR and EMF are both very efficient. Outputs of the proposed EMF are much more similar to original progressive videos than those of objectively best EMF methods nowadays, without obvious visual distortions.

A new short-range 24GHz close proximity detection (CPD) microwave radar technology for providing situational awareness to the driver of large vehicles is presented. A series of experiments are performed in which the radar is used to detect a variety of static targets. The CPD radar is able to detect light vehicles at ranges from 2.2m to 17.6m within a horizontal arc of 160° with superior angular resolution to many existing low-cost radars. From this data, key characteristics of the radar's performance and the radar cross-section of light vehicles at 24GHz are calculated. The data gathered allows the design of future tests and the development of a model of the radar that allows a better understanding of its performance characteristics and can be used for occupancy grid mapping.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;chirp;collaborative product development;experiment;filter (signal processing);map;radar;signal processing;window function	Bryan Clarke;Stewart Worrall;Graham M.

However, one critical problem in these systems is filling the disocclusion due to the 3-D warping process. This paper exploits the temporal correlation of texture and depth information to generate a background reference image. This is then used to fill the holes associated with the dynamic parts of the scene, whereas for static parts the traditional inpainting method is used. To generate the background reference image, the Gaussian mixture model is employed on the texture information, whereas, depth maps information are used to detect moving objects so as to enhance the background reference image. The proposed holes filling approach is particularly useful for the single-view-plus-depth format, where, contrary to the multi-view-plus-depth format, only information of one view could be used for this task. The experimental results show that objective and subjective gains can be achieved, and the gain ranges from 1 to 3 dB over the inpainting method.	2d-plus-depth;algorithm;decibel;depth map;free viewpoint television;google map maker;inpainting;mixture model;singular value decomposition;wrapping (graphics)	Chao Yao;Tammam Tillo;Yao Zhao;Jimin Xiao;Huihui Bai;Chunyu Lin	2014	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2014.2321671	computer vision;information science;computer science;mixture model;mathematics;multimedia;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.94047283507143	-55.446981634402555	4804

The use of randomly decorrelated low-discrepancy sequences in the path-tracing algorithm allows faster visual convergence. However, the parallel tracing of incoherent rays often results in poor memory cache utilization, reducing the ray bandwidth efficiency. Interleaved sampling [Keller et al. 2001] partially solves this problem, by using a small set of distributions split in coherent ray-tracing passes, but the solution is prone to structured noise. On the other hand, ray-reordering methods [Pharr et al. 1997] group stochastic rays into coherent ray packets but their implementation add an additional sorting cost on the GPU [Moon et al. 2010] [Garanzha and Loop 2010].	algorithm;cpu cache;coherence (physics);discrepancy function;global illumination;graphics processing unit;low-discrepancy sequence;monte carlo integration;parallel computing;path tracing;randomness;ray tracing (graphics);sampling (signal processing);sorting;spectral efficiency	Arthur Dufay;Pascal Lecocq;Romain Pacanowski;Jean-Eudes Marvie;Xavier Granier	2016		10.1145/2897839.2927392	sampling;path tracing;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	65.49551104139663	-52.96373301845261	4816

It is essential to develop effective mapping algorithms to realize WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) color reproduction. 1  We had previously found that three-dimensional gamut mapping is superior to the two-dimensional mapping, when we applied Mahalanobis distance as a color difference equation, such as BFD color difference formula, 2,3  However, in our previous experiments, a clipping method was used that maps all out-of-gamut colors to the surface of the gamut, and no change was made to colors inside the gamut. Since this method could possibly cause loss of gradation in an image, we had investigated non-linear compression for the three-dimensional gamut mapping in this study. The results of visual experiments indicated that preferred compression method depends on image contents. If the saturated colors that are out-of-gamut contain high frequency components, a certain degree of compression was needed. On the other hand, if those colors only have gradual change with low frequency components, clipping method was preferred.	color management	Naoya Katoh;Masahiko Ito	1999			computer vision;low frequency;optics;color space;physics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	61.82059749612893	-60.4782729741731	4820
eaa759fb32da6490769d4ff2bb6dcb3340561dae	an alternative approach to determine critical angle of contrast reversal and surface roughness of oil slicks under sunglint		ABSTRACTThe critical angle is the angle at which the contrast of oil slicks reverse their contrasts against the surrounding oil-free seawater under sunglint. Accurate determination of the critical angle can help estimate surface roughness and refractive index of the oil slicks. Although it’s difficult to determine a certain critical angle, the potential critical angle range help to improve the estimation accuracy. In this study, the angle between the viewing direction and the direction of mirror reflection is used as an indicator for quantifying the critical angle and could be calculated from the solar/viewing geometry from observations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The natural seep oil slicks in the Gulf of Mexico were first delineated using a customized segmentation approach to remove noise and apply a morphological filter. On the basis of the histograms of the brightness values of the delineated oil slicks, the potential range of the critical angle was determined, and th...

However, representing populations in heterogeneous urban regions with a finer resolution is a challenge. This study aims to obtain fine-scale population distribution based on 3D reconstruction of urban residential buildings with morphological operations using optical high-resolution (HR) images from the Chinese No. 3 Resources Satellite (ZY-3). Specifically, the research area was first divided into three categories when dasymetric mapping was taken into consideration. The results demonstrate that the morphological building index (MBI) yielded better results than built-up presence index (PanTex) in building detection, and the morphological shadow index (MSI) outperformed color invariant indices (CIIT) in shadow extraction and height retrieval. Building extraction and height retrieval were then combined to reconstruct 3D models and to estimate population. Final results show that this approach is effective in fine-scale population estimation, with a mean relative error of 16.46% and an overall Relative Total Absolute Error (RATE) of 0.158. This study gives significant insights into fine-scale population estimation in complicated urban landscapes, when detailed 3D information of buildings is unavailable.	3d modeling;3d reconstruction;accessibility;approximation error;automata theory;body mass index;categories;cellular automaton;dasymetric mapping;epidemiology;genetic heterogeneity;guanosine diphosphate;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;high-resolution scheme;image resolution;limited stage (cancer stage);master of business informatics;mathematical morphology;mean squared error;numerous;population;population dynamics;refinement (computing);sampling (signal processing);scintimammography;sensor;shadow copy;simulation;speaking (activity)	Shixin Wang;Ye Tian;Yi Zhou;Wenliang Liu;Chenxi Lin	2016		10.3390/s16101755	dasymetric map;remote sensing	Vision	81.57618434811818	-54.69762580652385	4891
3beff1b088873bb271b1e6990dc0a911fa0ded0a	combining audio and video metrics to assess audio-visual quality		In this work, we studied the use of combination models to integrate audio and video quality estimates to predict the overall audio-visual quality. More specifically, an overall quality prediction for an audio-visual signal is obtained by combining the outputs of individual audio and video quality metrics with either a linear, a Minkowski, or a power function. A total of 7 different video quality metrics are considered, from which 3 are Full-Reference and 4 are No-Reference. Similarly, a total of 4 audio quality metrics are tested, 2 of which are Full-Reference and 2 are No-Reference. In total, we tested 18 Full-Reference audio-visual combination metrics and 24 No-Reference audio-visual combination metrics. The performance of all combination metrics are tested on two different audio-visual databases. Therefore, besides analysing the performance of a set of individual audio and video quality metrics, we analyzed the performance of the models that combine these audio and video quality metrics. This work gives an important contribution to the area of audio-visual quality assessment, since previous works either tested combination models only on subjective quality scores or used linear models to combine the outputs of a limited number of audio and video quality metrics.	algorithm;database;linear model;machine learning;monkey's audio;noise reduction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;software quality;structural similarity;video	Helard Becerra Martinez;Mylène C.

In this paper, a remote sensing method is proposed based on viewpoint transformation and a modified Kendall rank correlation measure to detect changes in oblique aerial images. First, the different viewpoints of the aerial images are compromised and then, a local pattern descriptor based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient is introduced. A new distance measure referred to as Kendall's Tau-d (Tau distance) coefficient is presented to determine the changed regions. The developed system is applied on oblique aerial images with very low aspect angles that obtained using an unmanned aerial vehicle in two different days with drastic change in illumination and weather conditions. The experimental results indicate the robustness of the proposed method to variant illumination, shadows and multiple viewpoints for change detection in aerial images.	aerial photography;coefficient;kendall tau distance;oblique projection;unmanned aerial vehicle	Mohammad Saleh Javadi;Mattias Dahl;Mats I.

The vector radiative transfer equation contains a general nondiagonal extinction matrix and a phase matrix that are averaged over particle orientations. The nondiagonal extinction matrix accounts for the difference in propagation constants and the difference in attenuation rates between the two characteristic polarisations. The Mueller matrix based on the first-order and second-order multiple scattering solutions of the vector radiative transfer equation is calculated.

However, forest scenarios are characterized by a temporal decorrelating volume canopy scatterer, and a set of related open problems exists, in particular for Tomo-SAR techniques to be applied to space monitoring of biomass. Multipass/multibaseline 4D Differential Tomography (Diff-Tomo) is a promising advancement in this field, furnishing space-time signatures of multiple scatterer dynamics in the SAR cell, in particular with urban applications. In this paper, to deal with the forest decorrelation issues in Tomo-SAR, experimental advances are presented of the original extension of Diff-Tomo methods for analyzing vegetated scenes, to extract jointly geometric and dynamic information of forest layers. The Diff-Tomo enabled functionalities are separation in the height dimension of different temporal coherence levels that are mixed (undiscriminated) in classical total coherence analyses (“Tomography of coherences”), and 3D Tomography robust to temporal decorrelation.

In both quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed decoupling scheme allows for robust and accurate estimation of camera parameters. In particular, the presented dense camera calibration formulation leads to substantial improvements both in the reconstructed 3D geometry and in the super-resolution texture estimation.	3d modeling;3d reconstruction;algorithm;bundle adjustment;calculus of variations;camera resectioning;coupling (computer programming);epipolar geometry;estimation theory;experiment;linear programming relaxation;map;maximum flow problem;optical flow;sparse matrix;super-resolution imaging;texture mapping;variational principle	Mathieu Aubry;Kalin Kolev;Bastian Goldlücke;Daniel Cremers	2011	2011 International Conference on Computer Vision	10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126396	3d reconstruction;iterative reconstruction;computer simulation;image texture;three-dimensional space;computer vision;camera auto-calibration;estimation;calibration;camera resectioning;image resolution;photometry;computer science;mathematics;geometry;solid modeling;computational model;superresolution	Vision	54.052515976093986	-52.198914272843105	5048
78d4ed096a24f971a02b65fa8c4a0c8ae9fb00c8	demonstration of dual-channel tops sar imaging with airborne c-band data		Multichannel in azimuth synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating in the terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) acquisition mode has attracted much attention recently for its capability to achieve ultrawide-swath imaging with a high spatial resolution. In order to verify the feasibility and operability of this newly developed remote sensing concept, a C-band airborne azimuth dual-channel TOPS SAR has been designed by the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, as a test bed for future spaceborne realizations. This paper introduces the experimental SAR system and reports the data processing results of an outfield experiment conducted in late September 2014. The importance of the experiment resides in its potential to validate several important technical aspects of this novel SAR operation with real experimental data, including channel mismatch cancellation and unambiguous signal reconstruction. Besides, two kinds of processing methods are proposed to calibrate the influence of antenna phase center fluctuation occurred in the dual-channel TOPS SAR. Finally, the experimental results obtained, including the phase mismatch cancellation and the focused imageries, are presented and analyzed.	academy;airborne ranger;antenna device component;dual;multi-channel memory architecture;operability;quantum fluctuation;science;signal reconstruction;synthetic data;tops;testbed	Huaitao Fan;Zhimin Zhang;Robert Wang;Ning Li;Wei Xu;Z.

It consists of two major components: an early vision model (multi-channel and designed speciically for complex natural images), and a visual attention model which indicates regions of interest in a scene through the use of Importance Maps. Visible errors are then weighted, depending on the perceptual importance of the region in which they occur. We show that this technique produces a high correlation with subjective test data (0.93), compared to only 0.65 for PSNR. This technique is particularly useful for images coded with spatially varying quality.	human visual system model;image quality;map;peak signal-to-noise ratio;region of interest;test data	Wilfried Osberger;Neil W.

The non-local self-similarity is based on the observation that image patches tend to repeat themselves in natural images and videos; and the local structural regularity observes that image patches have regular structures where accurate estimation of pixel values via regression is possible. Explicitly unifying both properties, our proposed non-local kernel regression framework is more robust in image estimation and the algorithm is applicable to various image and video restoration tasks. In this work, we apply the proposed model to image and video denoising, deblurring and super-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on both single images and realistic video sequences demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework for desnoising, deblurring and super-resolution tasks over previous works both qualitatively and quantitatively.	algorithm;autostereogram;circuit restoration;deblurring;nl (complexity);noise reduction;pixel;self-similarity;super-resolution imaging;video denoising	Haichao Zhang;Jianchao Yang;Yanning Zhang;Thomas S.

These effects are simulated in image synthesis by integrating incoming radiance at each pixel over the lense aperture. Unfortunately, aperture integration is extremely costly for defocused areas where the incoming radiance has high variance, since many samples are then required for a noise-free Monte Carlo integration. On the other hand, using many aperture samples is wasteful in focused areas where the integrand varies little. Similarly, image sampling in defocused areas should be adapted to the very smooth appearance variations due to blurring. This article introduces an analysis of focusing and depth-of-field in the frequency domain, allowing a practical characterization of a light field's frequency content both for image and aperture sampling. Based on this analysis we propose an adaptive depth-of-field rendering algorithm which optimizes sampling in two important ways. First, image sampling is based on conservative bandwidth prediction and a splatting reconstruction technique ensures correct image reconstruction. Second, at each pixel the variance in the radiance over the aperture is estimated and used to govern sampling. This technique is easily integrated in any sampling-based renderer, and vastly improves performance.	algorithm;cinema 4d;iterative reconstruction;light field;monte carlo integration;monte carlo method;pixel;rendering (computer graphics);sampling (signal processing)	Cyril Soler;Kartic Subr;Frédo Durand;Nicolas Holzschuch;François X.

In many applications including cell phone and webcam the imaging sensors capture low resolution images due to low cost sensors or physical limitation of the hardware. So, the proposed resolution enhancement technique could be used as an inexpensive software alternative. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated with several grayscale and color video streams and found successful when compared to other state of the art techniques.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;closed-circuit television;gaussian blur;grayscale;image resolution;mobile phone;pixel;resolution enhancement technologies;sensor;simulation;streaming media;super-resolution imaging;webcam	Mohammad Moinul Islam;Vijayan K.

The popularly used method, the integrating NDVI and classification is chosen and analyzed further. The result shows that the estimation model is not accurate enough for LSE is underestimated at either end of the fractional vegetation cover (Pv) range which would lead to overestimating of corresponding Land Surface Temperature (LST). The drawback is modified based on the threshold method, that is, for natural surface and when Pv <; 0.165, ε= εsoil; for town surface and when Pv <; 0.1375, ε= εm; and for Pv >; 0.5, ε= εv. Finally, a processing way adapting for the improved model in large area is presented and the emissivity model before modification and after improvement is applied to Beijing, China to identify emissivity and further to retrieve LST using image based method. The results show that the large difference between LSE and corresponding LST is located in the town surface and soil with low Pv and that a decrease of emissivity by 0.011058 at 318K will increase LST by about 1K. Thus a promising improvement of comparative accuracy can be expected.	mathematical model;statistical classification	QingNi Huang;Huadong Guo;Xiaohuan Xi;Xinwu Li;Xiaoping Du;Huaining Yang	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351741	meteorology;atmospheric temperature;contextual image classification;temperature;geology;image retrieval;hydrology;emissivity;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	EDA	84.82134712790966	-61.838866431860865	5266

However, the speckle emerging in SAR images decreases the accuracy of image classification and segmentation. Consequently, it should be filtered correctly. In fact, insufficient averaging generates biased estimates of H/α/A parameters and overaveraging degrades the resolution cell. In this paper, we investigated bias estimation deeply. We enhanced bias compensation of the entropy. The implication of bias for PolSAR data classification has not been studied yet. We demonstrated that bias have an important consequences on PolSAR data classification.

Two representative landslide cases, Toraji typhoon occurred in 2001 and 921 earthquake occurred in 1999, are used to analyze the causes of different kinds of landslide disasters in the paper. The test area for the 921 earthquake case is 3700 km2, the recognized number of landslide in the event is 7279, and total area for the landslides is 14766 Ha. Moreover, the maximum area of one landslide is 532 Ha, the average area for the landslides is 2 Ha, and its corresponding standard deviation is 13 Ha. In the test case of Toraji typhoon, the total study area is 8847 km2, the number of landslides is 10359, and total area for the landslide is 22305 Ha. The maximum area of a landslide is 232 Ha, the average area for the landslides is 2.2 Ha, and its corresponding standard deviation is 6.2 Ha.	test case;typhoon	Kuan-Tsung Chang;Jin-King Liu;Wei-Chen Hsu;Tian-Yuan Shih	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723628	meteorology;seismology;geologic hazards;geomorphology;typhoon;geology;landslide;geotechnical engineering;landslide classification;storm;physics;planetary boundary layer	EDA	81.97690076042956	-57.82744084849982	5295

A computational camera uses unconventional optics to capture a coded image and software to decode the captured image to produce new forms of visual information. We show examples of computational cameras that capture wide field of view images, high dynamic range images, multispectral images, and depth images.

5f99e7583a6de7f2d241b9666258fa3c458f2218	development of surface inspection machine for organic photo conductor(opc)		The OPC is one of the most important component in the electrophotography process. So far its surface defects which degrade print quality were inspected by human-eye. We have developed the OPC surface inspection system employing an image processing technique. In this paper, we describe (1) an optical system to get the OPC surface image, (2) its analysis algorithm to specify the various defects and (3) the hardwarelsoftware implementation to reduce the processing time. As a result, the OPC Hillock defects is the most fatal defect of the inspection system was realized with high OPC, because it does not only degrade the print performance and flexibility. quality but also can cause the damages to other components. For the reason, it is important to detect the small hillock defects at the size of 0.1 1. The OPC and OPC defects mrn. The OPC's we are working on have three layers, i.e. UL, CGL, and CTL, on the metal base, as shown in Fig. 1. The defects in each layer have different characteristics in terms of size and category (Table. 1).	algorithm;computation tree logic;core opengl;image processing;open platform communications;software bug;telecommunications link;windows photo gallery	Osamu Nakayama;Shinji Kobayashi;Katsuyuki Omura;Takahiro Asai;Mitsuhiro Tomoda;Teruki Kamada	1994			computer vision;image processing;mathematics;artificial intelligence	EDA	60.88700342494289	-53.027303406383716	5483

We obtain several optimal arrangements of sample directions, which minimize the variance of these estimates. They are based on changing the size or shape of the pixels or the shape of the hemicube, or using non-uniform pixel grids. The best reduces the variance by 43%. The variance calculation is based on the assumption that the errors in the estimate are caused by the projections of single polygon edges, and that the positions and orientations of these edges are random. This replaces the infinite dimensional space of possible environments by the two dimensional space of great circles on the unit sphere, making the numerical variance minimization possible.	computer form factor;empirical risk minimization;hemicube (computer graphics);numerical analysis;pixel	Nelson L.

But for sport images such as basketball and football images, these methods may falsely classify parts of court fields as unimportant regions, while parts of grandstands as important regions. Such results are not consistent with human perception. In this paper, a semantic aware image resizing approach is proposed. We extract the semantic information automatically. We segment the court fields as important regions and detect the boundary of court fields as the semantic edges. Considering the complementary characteristic of discrete image resizing approaches such as seam carving and continuous approaches such as warping, seam carving and warping are jointly used in our scheme. We define the Semantic Weight Function (SWF) based on the semantically important regions. Then semantic aware seam carving (SASC) is proposed based on the SWF. Next we define the Deformation of Semantic Edges (DSE) to assess the image deformation caused by seam carving. Finally seam carving and warping are joined using the DSE. We compare our approach with approaches like scaling, seam carving and semantic aware seam carving (SASC). Experimental results show that our approach preserves more semantically important regions with less deformation. Our approach also preserves the aspect ratio of key objects.	digital video;flicker (screen);gradient;image scaling;image warping;retargeting;swf;seam carving;weight function	Lifang Wu;Yu Gong;Xingdi Yuan;Xiuzhen Zhang;Lianchao Cao	2012	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-012-1002-7	seam carving;computer vision;computer science;multimedia	Vision	56.760838449583005	-61.29335999169136	5852

The knowledge of natural polarimetric hydrometeor scattering signatures, on the other hand, has been limited in theoretical calculations, simulations, and radar measurements. In this paper, an experimental approach was designed with the assistance of a controlled laboratory environment. An advanced vector network analyzer-based scatterometer system has been developed in harmony with an environmentally monitored anechoic chamber with special configurations for hydrometeor measurements. The polarimetric radar cross section (RCS) of various natural and man-made icy hydrometeor samples is measured across wide X-band frequencies and compared with theoretical modeling results. The dual-polarization radar variables and hydrometeor melting parameters are derived from the RCS measurements with interesting observations obtained. The described technology and results serve as the basis of a new hydrometer microphysics knowledge base for hydrometeor classification processing in the next-generation multichannel dual-polarized hazard monitoring radars.	antivirus software;cross section (geometry);drude particle;icy;knowledge base;packet analyzer;polarimetry;radar;sensor;simulation	Yan Zhang;Andrew Huston;Michael Mallo;Zhengzheng Li;Guifu Zhang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2025984	meteorology;knowledge base;network analyzer;atmospheric sciences;hazard;computer science;engineering;environmental monitoring;radar cross-section;remote sensing	Visualization	81.90833593480772	-65.26979254308552	5916

Both adapt to changes in lighting environment and are time dependent. This study developed metrics for characterizing time-course of automatic exposure (AE) and white balance (AWB) controls in video cameras. To evaluate subjective preference for AE and AWB videos, specific scenes with natural lighting changes were designed. Our results show that the subjective preference AE time course is fast and without overshoot. In addition preference speed for the time-course of AWB was about six seconds for videos used in this study.	color balance;human visual system model;overshoot (signal);signal processing;steady state;video	Mikko Nuutinen;Valtteri Valkonen;Pirkko Oittinen;Toni Virtanen	2013	2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)		computer vision;geography;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	62.46487306694809	-61.30200440973321	5930

Correlations between flux tower measures of GPP and models for years between 2003 and 2007 were established for 30 sites across USA, Canada, and Brazil. Correlations were seen to range from very strong to weak, depending on seasonal variation in photosynthetic capacity (which is influenced by chlorophyll content) exhibited by the vegetation at each site. At least one of the three models obtained a statistically significant relationship with GPP at every site. Results indicate that chlorophyll content (as measured by the MTCI) is a most relevant community property for estimating primary productivity and chlorophyll-related vegetation indexes provide favorable approximations of the GPP of terrestrial vegetation. The inclusion of radiation information (photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR)) into the models extended the applicability of the models and the accuracy of the GPP estimate. Although further investigation is required to fully understand the applicability of these models and their parameters, these results point to the possibility of a total remote sensing approach to GPP estimation.	approximation;graph partition;seasonality;terrestrial television;tower of hanoi	Doreen S.

To gain insight into the chemical and meteorological processes that lead to high air pollutant concentrations over this area, the parallel package PNAM (Parallel Naples Airshed Model) has been developed, for the numerical simulation of photosmog episodes on urban and regional scale domains. PNAM has been applied to a photosmog episode which occurred on 26 July 1995. On this day, due to the stagnant conditions and the intensive solar radiation, a high ozone concentration was reported for the Naples basin. The performance of PNAM has been assessed by comparing measured air quality data with simulated data for O 3, NO, NO2 and CO. PNAM was able to reproduce temporal and spatial characteristics of measured air quality data, although some discrepancies were evident, probably mainly due to the emission inventory, which was based only on total annual emissions.  2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

787bffa5990c41c7d91aad0bc0f3b9bc7f9dcb64	urban built-up area extraction from landsat tm/etm+ images using spectral information and multivariate texture	landsat;multivariate texture;urban built up area;ocsvm	Urban built-up area information is required by various applications. However, urban built-up area extraction using moderate resolution satellite data, such as Landsat series data, is still a challenging task due to significant intra-urban heterogeneity and spectral confusion with other land cover types. In this paper, a new method that combines spectral information and multivariate texture is proposed. The multivariate textures are separately extracted from multispectral data using a multivariate variogram with different distance measures, i.e., Euclidean, Mahalanobis and spectral angle distances. The multivariate textures and the spectral bands are then combined for urban built-up area extraction. Because the urban built-up area is the only target class, a one-class classifier, one-class support vector machine, is used. For comparison, the classical gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is also used to extract image texture. The proposed method was evaluated using bi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ data of two megacity areas in China. Results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the use of spectral information alone and the joint use of the spectral information and the GLCM texture. In particular, the inclusion of multivariate variogram textures with spectral angle distance achieved the best results. The proposed method provides an effective way of extracting urban built-up areas from Landsat series images and could be applicable to other applications.

We introduce an efficient algorithm to estimate the optical characteristics of the TM imagery and to remove the atmospheric effects from it. Our algorithm introduces a set of techniques to significantly improve the quality of the retrieved images. We pay a particular attention to the computational efficiency of the algorithm thereby allowing us to correct large TM images quite fast. We also provide a parallel implementation of our algorithm and show its portability and scalability on several parallel machines.

This method has been tested with L-band CAROLS airborne data highly corrupted by interferences. RFI is a major limiting factor in passive microwave remote sensing. Although the 1.4–1.427 GHz bandwidth is protected, RFI sources close to these frequencies may still corrupt radiometer measurements. In order to reduce RFI bad effects on the brightness temperature measurements, a new instrument called spectral analyzer has been added to the CAROLS radiometer system. A post processing algorithm based on a selective filtering with the division of bandwidth in subbands is proposed. Two discriminant analysis based on the computation of kurtosis and Mahalanobis distance have been compared, evaluated and validated in order to separate accurately the RF interference with natural signal.	airborne ranger;algorithm;analyzer device component;analyzer, device;computation;high-frequency ventilation;interference (communication);l band;linear discriminant analysis;microwave;rnf34 gene;radio frequency;radiometry;spectrum analyzer;brightness	Pascal Fanise;Mickaël Pardé;Mehrez Zribi;Monique Dechambre;Christophe Caudoux	2010		10.3390/s110303037	l band;electronic engineering;calibration;spectrum analyzer;radiometry;temperature;telecommunications;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Mobile	81.05915320976483	-65.80561067742512	6044

7f4ec9ab8f36c25460dd4172fe1162ac635835eb	compression of multispectral images - combining spatial and spectral compression	multispectral images	One major disadvantage of multispectral imaging is the amount of data that needs to be stored for each multispectral image. In the past, several authors have proposed compression schemes to overcome this disadvantage. Most of these papers dealt with compression either in the spectral or in the spatial realm only, although some authors proposed to divide the data into luminance and color components and to subsample the latter, resulting in a combined method. Unfortunately, using multispectral imaging the luminance component depends on the illuminant used during the reconstruction of the color. Using a narrowband illuminant every single wavelength could correspond to the luminance information. This paper proposes a method that overcomes this difficulty by using a more basic approach. The reason, why it is possible to subsample the color channels in conventional color imaging is the dependence of the MTF of the human eye on the wavelength of the observed light. Therefore, it is possible to subsample each spectral band separately (yielding spatial compression). Furthermore, a spectral compression method is proposed, that is compatible to the spatial compression, resulting in a method that combines spatial and spectral compression of the multispectral image. Finally, the compatibility to conventional imaging will be addressed and it will be shown, that the new method allows achieving limited compatibility.	channel (digital image);data compression;image plane;könig's lemma;move-to-front transform;multispectral image;pixel	Friedhelm König	2003			multispectral image;multispectral pattern recognition;coating;photographic emulsion;compression (physics);composite material;emulsion;gelatin;materials science;electrical resistivity and conductivity	Vision	66.8800855909527	-64.14397092326531	6118

This radar is subject to radio-frequency interference (RFI) in its passband from 1258 to 1262 MHz, a region also allocated for terrestrial radio location. Due to its received-power sensitivity requirements, the expected RFI environment poses significant challenges. We present the results of a study evaluating the severity of terrestrial RFI sources on the operation of the Aquarius scatterometer, and propose a scheme to both detect and remove problematic RFI signals in the ocean backscatter measurements. The detection scheme utilizes the digital sampling of the ambient input power to detect outliers from the receiver noise floor which are statistically significant, and flags nearby radar echoes as potentially contaminated by RFI. This detection strategy, developed to meet tight budget and data downlink requirements, has been implemented and tested in hardware, and shows great promise for the detection and global mapping of L-band RFI sources.	interference (communication);l band;noise floor;radar;radio frequency;requirement;sampling (signal processing);telecommunications link;terrestrial television	Adam P.

The filter is based on the use of M (robust maximum likelihood)-estimators and R(rank)-estimators derived from the statistical theory of rank tests. At the first stage, to provide impulsive noise rejection, the introduced image filters uses the central pixel of the filtering window and the redescending M-estimators combined with the median estiinator. At the second stage, to provide multiplicative noise suppression, a modified Sigma filter that implements the calculation scheme of a redescending M-estimator, is used. Visual and analytical analysis of simulation results shows that the proposed image filter has demonstrated fine detail preservation, good multiplicative noise suppression and impulsive noise removal.	additive white gaussian noise;composite image filter;image processing;multiplicative noise;noise reduction;pixel;rejection sampling;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;zero suppression	Volodymyr I.

In the Russian Far East, since forest fires occur every year, they have had a great influence on the earth environment. Especially, the fire smoke influences the region where a forest fire doesn’t occur because it extends more widely than a fire does. In this paper, we examined the extension of the distribution of the forest fire smoke in the Russian Far East for ten years from 1994 to 2003. We used 380 scenes of NOAA AVHRR. The smoke distribution and precipitation were compared about data as which the number of cases and the season of the fire occurrence were almost the same. As a result, the smoke distribution extended terribly when precipitation was a little. And, the influence of precipitation was greater than that of the fire occurrences. We analyzed the number of fire occurrences for ten years. We used 1185 scenes for the analysis. In 1998, precipitation was the least of ten years and there were a lot of fire occurrences. The generated fire smoke extends more widely because the number of fire occurrences increases when precipitation is a little. Therefore, precipitation is very sensitive factor when we monitor the environmental pollution by wide distribution of fire smoke. We examined the relation among the forest fire, smoke, and precipitation, and showed the importance role of precipitation.	fire-control system;the forest	Koichi Kawano;Jun-ichi Kudoh;Masanori Nakano	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

The proposed glare model is considered by stimulus size, contrast ratio, stimulus position, averaging luminance, viewing angle, and the number of stimuli. For the model, two-step subjective experiment was conducted. Based on the results, the glare model was composed by two components depending on contents; perceptual contrast and area ratio between stimulus and background. The model can be applied to a glare suppression algorithm to improve visibility and comfort from mobile display in a dark environment.	algorithm;contrast ratio;mobile phone;viewing angle;zero suppression	Wonhee Choe;Min Woo Lee	2015	2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Consumer Electronics - Berlin (ICCE-Berlin)	10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2015.7391313	computer vision;geography;optics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	62.55934212773421	-61.031238609051044	6281

In 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey recommended an integrated strategy for Earth science and applications from space that included numerous recommendations for Laser and Lidar based observations.[1]. For the past 15 years, NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) [2] has invested in new technologies in the area of Lidar remote sensing to enable new Earth Science measurement capabilities. Much progress has been made, leading to new airborne and spaceborne instrumentation. However, significant challenges remain before the potential of Lidar can be realized.	airborne ranger;ecosystem;heart rate variability;terrestrial television	George J.

Which controls the distribution and change of other ecological and environmental factors to some extent and plays an important role in extracting more detailed landform information in the whole geomorphological system. In this article, based on the project """"1:1,000,000 digital geomorphologic mapping in China"""". A semi-automatic method was designed to extract the basic landform types from Srtm-DEM and TM imagery and which was demonstrated with a case study of the Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province. Firstly, The primary plain and mountain were automatically extracted from Srtm-DEM by intergrating Borough's slope model with Natural Breaks and Manual slope classification. Secondly, the sketch map of the basic landform types was obtained through overlaying the altitude and relief value. Thirdly, the more precise basic landform types boundaries were obtained and manually interpreted based on previously obtained plain and mountain boundary and expert's interpretation of TM imageries who takes into account the relationship between landform and other geographical phenomena, such as geology, vegetation, landuse, and soil. Therefore, the method of semi-automatic extraction of landform information based on Srtm-DEM and TM imagery was primarily realized. Compared to historic 1:500,000 geomophological maps, the results show that the overall kappa coefficient of accurate assessment was more than 80%, which is satisfied. In addition, the method introduced in this article has the advantages to other methods: it can improve the work efficiency and reduce the workload of the researchers, and the forms of the results are digital and can be updated on time."""	digital elevation model;map;matthews correlation coefficient;semiconductor industry	En Long;Wei-ming Cheng;Cheng-hu Zhou;Yong-hui Yao;Hai-jiang Liu	2007	2007 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423213	extraction;geomorphology;image resolution;geology;landform;information extraction;china;vegetation;remote sensing	EDA	80.61116466642984	-55.83686124535223	6300

Moreover, the flows of cohorts can regionally overlap. Together, these conditions yield a complex tracking scenario that can not be addressed by optical flow techniques that assume piecewise coherent flows, or by multiparticle tracking techniques that suffer from the local ambiguity in particle assignment. Here, we propose a graph-based assignment of particles in three consecutive frames to recover from image sequences the instantaneous organized motion of groups of particles, i.e. flows. The algorithm makes no a priori assumptions on the fraction of particles participating in organized movement, as this number continuously alters with the evolution of the flow fields in time. Graph-based assignment methods generally maximize the number of acceptable particles assignments between consecutive frames and only then minimize the association cost. In dense and unstable particle flow fields this approach produces many false positives. The here proposed approach avoids this via solution of a multi-objective optimization problem in which the number of assignments is maximized while their total association cost is minimized at the same time. The method is validated on standard benchmark data for particle tracking. In addition, we demonstrate its application to live cell microscopy where several large molecular populations with different behaviors are tracked.	airport security;airports;alert:type:point in time:^patient:nominal;algorithm;autodesk 3ds max;behavior;benchmark (computing);chamaecyparis lawsoniana;coherence (physics);computer vision;control theory;convergence (action);densely packed decimal;frame (physical object);graph (discrete mathematics);graph - visual representation;interlaced video;iterative method;mathematical optimization;microscope device component;multi-objective optimization;numerous;on the fly;optical flow;optimization problem;pack unit;particle swarm optimization;physical object;population;population parameter;randomness;real-time clock;requirement;smoothed-particle hydrodynamics;stationary process;track (course);unstable medical device problem;weight	Alexandre Matov;Marcus M.

There are the PSF features in the cepstrum images of blurred images. We can estimate the PSF by searching pixels in the cepstrum images. However, cepstrum images also show features of ground truth images which don't have effects from shaking, so we can't estimate the PSF accurately. We propose an estimation method of the PSF by using GA.We adopt the cepstrum images as a fitness function,thus the estimation results aren't affected by other features in cepstrum images.We have just confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method by using some simulations.	cepstrum;digital camera;experiment;fitness function;ground truth;optical character recognition;pixel;simulation;software release life cycle;structural similarity	Takumi Shimomukai;Michifumi Yoshioka;Hidekazu Yanagimoto	2011	2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops	10.1109/ICMLA.2011.165	image restoration;computer vision;speech recognition;genetic algorithm;ground truth;computer science;pattern recognition;point spread function;optical transfer function;mathematics;image segmentation;fitness function	Vision	56.77705104594032	-64.56996579988636	6369

However, these techniques collect information mainly through information of spectrum, texture, and surface features. This paper put forward a field information extraction method based on profiles. Supported by high-precision DEM data, this method starts with discrete elevations and conducts analysis on profiles in many directions. It finds out the farmland in a testing area by firstly marking the straight line on a profile as farmland and others as non-farmland and then taking the classifications of fields into overall consideration. It has been proven in the test that, with the increase of precision of DEM data, the method is both feasible and promising.	image resolution;information extraction;item unique identification;texture mapping	Zaigui Yang;Min Lu;Qing Deng;Jian Jia;Huang Huang	2015	2015 23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2015.7378573	computer vision;geography;data mining;remote sensing	EDA	76.30329163786763	-58.264394975854174	6442

One of the most critical problems in synthetic range-profile reconstruction is the distortion induced by the target motion. Radial target velocity and acceleration generate second- and third-order phase terms in the received signal, which produce range shift and point-spread-function smearing. The distortions induced by the target motion produce, as a consequence, a signal-to-noise ratio loss. Recently, a method based on contrast maximization has been proposed in order to compensate target radial motions using single-polarization data. In this paper, an extension of such an algorithm is proposed that exploits fully polarimetric data in order to improve the target radial motion compensation.	distortion;expectation–maximization algorithm;motion compensation;polarimetry;polarization (waves);radar;radial (radio);signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development);verification and validation	Andrea Cacciamano;Elisa Giusti;Amerigo Capria;Marco Martorella;Fabrizio Berizzi	2010	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2035444	distortion;polarization;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Vision	76.68423936032917	-67.366285875404	6460

In order to remove this effect from the comparison, two methods are investigated: BRDF effect modeling in direct comparison and seasonal oscillation regression. The BRDF modeling method employs both a simple linear model and an empirical model. The seasonal oscillation method has improved by adding a curve regression, where the seasonal oscillation is derived from MetOp-A measurement data since its launch and used for the regression of MetOp-B measurements. Using these methods, the reflectance ratios of MetOp-B over MetOp-A in three reflective solar channels have been derived, which are 1.034 for channel 1, 0.912 for channel 2, and 0.805 for channel 3A. The uncertainties of the derived ratios are estimated in the range of 4.7%-6.4%. The model accuracy and uncertainty have been discussed. Initial calibration updates based on these results have been delivered for the MetOp-B operational L1B product, and a routine update is performed monthly. The methods used in this work are also applicable to the intercomparison of other visible and NIR instruments.	bidirectional reflectance distribution function;linear model	Tiejun Chang;Xiangqian Wu;Fuzhong Weng	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2356334	meteorology;calibration;astronomy;atmospheric sciences;oscillation;physics;satellite;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.4360626580981	-62.11214239562304	6487

In high-resolution radars, the targets may extend along multiple consecutive range cells, which are called range-spread targets. In this paper, we consider the range-spread target detection problem in the compound Gaussian clutter with the square root of inverse Gaussian texture. Three adaptive detectors are proposed based on Bayesian one-step generalized likelihood ratio test, maximum a posteriori generalized likelihood ratio test and Bayesian two-step generalized likelihood ratio test, respectively. Finally, the detection performances of the proposed detectors are evaluated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed detectors have better detection performance of range-spread target than the conventional generalized likelihood ratio test detector.	clutter	Shu-Wen Xu;Jian Xue;Penglang Shui	2016	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2016.06.009	gaussian random field;econometrics;likelihood-ratio test;pattern recognition;constant false alarm rate;mathematics;generalized inverse gaussian distribution;gaussian function;statistics	Robotics	72.32996579377557	-63.93796082868779	6682
ceb45f91e1cbb82142c9efad767635fd593098d0	a smooth local polynomial model of vignetting		The vignetting is one of image distortions, which refers to the fall-off of pixel intensity due to optical properties of the camera and lens system. The effect of vignetting on image is unwanted in image processing and analysis. The vignetting of the camera-lens system can be determined using the vignetting model. The local vignetting polynomial model allows to fit the vignetting data with more flexibility, but at the cost of increased of vignetting function distortions. This paper introduces a new smooth local polynomial vignetting model, which is a modification of local vignetting polynomial model. The conducted experiments on broad range of lens settings shows that filtering allows to improve the vignetting function smoothness.	altered level of consciousness;automatic control;distortion;experiment;image processing;pixel;polynomial;silesian library;source lines of code	Andrzej Kordecki;Artur Bal;Henryk Palus	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046944	image processing;filter (signal processing);pixel;adaptive optics;artificial intelligence;polynomial and rational function modeling;polynomial;physics;lens (optics);vignetting;computer vision;optics	Robotics	61.03977235467943	-59.009650447016504	6757

Furthermore, detailed characterization of forest soil organic horizons is of paramount importance for ecological studies and for carbon cycle and global changerelated studies. Ultrawideband ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired above beech forest litter were used to analyze the effects of litter on the backscattering and investigate the ability of GPR to quantitatively characterize the properties of the forest floor. Radar measurements were performed over different litter configurations (i.e., single layers of recently fallen litter (OL) or of fragmented litter (OF), and combined OL-OF layers) and thicknesses. Radar data were processed through full-wave inversion. Over the considered frequency range (0.8-4.0 GHz), attenuation of the radar signal increased as both frequency and litter thickness increase, due to scattering and dielectric losses. These effects were accounted for in the radar model through frequency dependence of litter apparent electrical conductivity. Good agreement (RMSE = 9.5 × 10-3 m) was observed between estimated and measured litter thicknesses. Radar data inversions provided reliable estimates of litter electromagnetic properties, with relative dielectric permittivity values around 1.2 and 3.9 for OL and OF litters, respectively, and corresponding values of 0.032 and 0.080 Sm-1 for litter apparent electrical conductivity at 4.0 GHz. These results show great promise for the use of GPR for noninvasive characterization of forest litter.	airborne ranger;carbon cycle;fragmented object;frequency band;kriging;microwave;motorola canopy;prince of persia: the fallen king;radar;random forest;sensor;the forest;thickness (graph theory);ultra-wideband	Frédéric André;Mathieu Jonard;Sébastien Lambot	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2328776	hydrology;soil science;remote sensing	Mobile	84.695279462308	-63.19588907248895	6774

The maximum cross correlation (MCC) method, which has been widely applied to optical remote sensing data to derive sea surface velocities, is applied to X-band SAR data from TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX), which were operating in pursuit monostatic mode. Because of the short temporal interval of TSX and TDX’s pursuit acquisitions, temporal de-correlation is minimized to derive tidal current fields that exhibit significant temporal and spatial variations. In addition, we combined data from TDX and another X-band SAR, COSMO-SkyMed, to obtain a virtual SAR constellation data pair, which was also analyzed using the MCC method to derive the tidal current field. Case studies of Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea and Amrum Island in the North Sea are presented. The SAR-derived tidal current fields were compared to the results of numerical model simulations, high-frequency (HF) radar measurements and in situ measurements. MCC coefficients that are greater than 0.8 are an appropriate threshold for the further derivation of tidal currents. Comparisons to finite volume community ocean model, HF radar and general estuarine transport model results yield root-mean-square errors of 0.13, 0.06, and 0.05 m/s, respectively. Measurements from three field stations were also compared to the MCC SAR retrievals, yielding differences of 0.3, 0.07, and −0.09 m/s.	aperture (software);cosmo-rs;coefficient;computer simulation;cross-correlation;finite volume community ocean model;radar;synthetic data	Yongzheng Ren;Xiao-Ming Li;Guoping Gao;Thomas Busche	2017	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2666086	meteorology;sea surface temperature;space-based radar;synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Visualization	80.84438895002721	-63.79401806443425	6821

In the classical non-local means image denoising approach, the value of a pixel is determined based on the weighted average of other pixels, where the weights are determined based on a fixed isotropically weighted similarity function between the local neighborhoods. In the proposed algorithm, we demonstrate that noticeably improved perceptual quality can be achieved through the use of adaptive anisotropically weighted similarity functions between local neighborhoods. This is accomplished by adapting the similarity weighing function in an anisotropic manner based on the perceptual characteristics of the underlying image content derived efficiently based on the Mexican Hat wavelet.

We focus on the noisy deblurring problem, which generalizes image superresolution and denoising. Controlled subjective experiments suggest that joint example-based regularization and total variation regularization can provide subjective gains over total regularization alone, particularly when the example images contain similar structural elements as the test image. We also investigate whether the regularization parameters can be trained by cross-validation, and we compare the reconstructions using crossvalidation judgments made by humans or by fully automatic image quality metrics. Experiments showed that of five image quality metrics tested, the structural similarity index (SSIM) correlates best with human judgement of image quality, and can be profitably used to cross-validate regularization parameters. However, there is a significant quality gap between images restored using human or automatic parameter cross-validation.	categorization;cross-validation (statistics);deblurring;experiment;gaussian blur;humans;image processing;image quality;matrix regularization;noise reduction;software quality assurance;standard test image;structural similarity;super-resolution imaging;test data;test set;total variation denoising	Hyrum S.

0dd1184e0ad94c4aa0da765018aea6d49313c9ff	parisar: patch-based estimation and regularized inversion for multibaseline sar interferometry		Reconstruction of elevation maps from a collection of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained in interferometric configuration is a challenging task. Reconstruction methods must overcome two difficulties: the strong interferometric noise that contaminates the data and the  $2\pi $  phase ambiguities. Interferometric noise requires some form of smoothing among pixels of identical height. Phase ambiguities can be solved, up to a point, by combining linkage to the neighbors and a global optimization strategy to prevent from being trapped in local minima. This paper introduces a reconstruction method, Parisar, that achieves both a resolution-preserving denoising and a robust phase unwrapping (PhU) by combining nonlocal denoising methods based on patch similarities and total-variation regularization. The optimization algorithm, based on graph cuts, identifies the global optimum. Combining patch-based speckle reduction methods and regularization-based PhU requires solving several issues: 1) computational complexity, the inclusion of nonlocal neighborhoods strongly increasing the number of terms involved during the regularization, and 2) adaptation to varying neighborhoods, patch comparison leading to large neighborhoods in homogeneous regions and much sparser neighborhoods in some geometrical structures. Parisar solves both issues. We compare Parisar with other reconstruction methods both on numerical simulations and satellite images and show a qualitative and quantitative improvement over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods for multibaseline SAR interferometry.	algorithm;aperture (software);baseline (configuration management);computational complexity theory;cut (graph theory);distortion;global optimization;image noise;instantaneous phase;linkage (software);map;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nl (complexity);noise reduction;nonlocal lagrangian;numerical analysis;patch (computing);pixel;preprocessor;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;reflection (computer graphics);sensor;simulation;smoothing;synthetic data;total variation denoising	Giampaolo Ferraioli;Charles-Alban Deledalle;Loïc Denis;Florence Tupin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2765761	iterative reconstruction;pi;elevation;computer vision;artificial intelligence;global optimization;remote sensing;mathematics;synthetic aperture radar;smoothing;non-local means;speckle pattern	Vision	72.74683825916294	-66.6798246901654	6888
b86b343714153978a526881fadc73c759d7b3ddf	comparison of the retrieval of sea surface salinity using different instrument configurations of micap		The Microwave Imager Combined Active/Passive (MICAP) has been designed to simultaneously retrieve sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST) and wind speed (WS), and its performance has also been preliminarily analyzed. To determine the influence of the first guess values uncertainties on the retrieved parameters of MICAP, the retrieval accuracies of SSS, SST, and WS are estimated at various noise levels. The results suggest that the errors on the retrieved SSS have not increased dues poorly known initial values of SST and WS, since the MICAP can simultaneously acquire SST information and correct ocean surface roughness. The main objective of this paper is to obtain the simplified instrument configuration of MICAP without loss of the SSS, SST, and WS retrieval accuracies. Comparisons are conducted between three different instrument configurations in retrieval mode, based on the simulation measurements of MICAP. The retrieval results tend to prove that, without the 23.8 GHz channel, the errors on the retrieved SSS, SST, and WS for MICAP could also satisfy the accuracy requirements well globally during only one satellite pass. By contrast, without the 1.26 GHz scatterometer, there are relatively large increases in the SSS, SST, and WS errors at middle/low latitudes.	error detection and correction;microwave;power supply unit (computer);requirement;simulation;ws-policy	Lanjie Zhang;Zhenzhan Wang;Xiaobin Yin	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10040550	remote sensing;wind speed;geology;scatterometer;surface roughness;latitude;sea surface temperature;sss*;salinity;microwave	Web+IR	83.86988366286677	-63.12224962997045	6897

In order to improve the spatial resolution of a given hyperspectral image, a new spatial and spectral image fusion approach via pixel group based non-local sparse representation is proposed, which exploits the spectral sparsity and spectral non-local self-similarity of the hyperspectral image. The proposed approach fuses the hyperspectral image with a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image of the same scene to obtain a hyperspectral image with high spatial and spectral resolutions. The input hyperspectral image is used to train the spectral dictionary, while the sparse codes of the desired HSI are estimated by jointly encoding the similar pixels in each pixel group extracted from the high-spatial-resolution multispectral image. To improve the accuracy of the pixel group based non-local sparse representation, the similar pixels in a pixel group are selected by utilizing both the spectral and spatial information. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on two remote sensing image datasets. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms a number of sparse representation based fusion techniques, and can preserve the spectral information while recovering the spatial details under large magnification factors.	code;dictionary;horizontal situation indicator;image fusion;lr parser;multispectral image;neural coding;pixel;self-similarity;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Jing Yang;Ying Li;Jonathan Cheung-Wai Chan;Qiang Shen	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9010053	full spectral imaging;computer vision;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;pixel connectivity	Vision	67.83388587302456	-66.0925422856905	6988
af2789eee94c37f875147b274812831c984dd06e	a critical survey of state-of-the-art image inpainting quality assessment metrics		7 Image inpainting is the process of restoring missing pixels in digital images in a plausible way. Research in image inpainting has received considerable attention in di erent areas, including restoration of old and damaged documents, removal of undesirable objects, computational photography, retouching applications, etc. The challenge is that the recovery processes themselves introduce noticeable artifacts within and around the restored image regions. As an alternative to subjective evaluation by humans, a number of approaches have been introduced to quantify inpainting processes objectively. Unfortunately, existing objective metrics have their own strengths and weaknesses as they use di erent criteria. This paper provides a thorough insight into existing metrics related to image inpainting quality assessment, developed during the last few years. The paper provides, under a new framework, a comprehensive description of existing metrics, their strengths, their weaknesses, and a detailed performance analysis on real images from public image inpainting database. The paper also outlines future research directions and applications of inpainting and inpainting-related quality assessment measures.	circuit restoration;computational photography;digital artifact;digital image;inpainting;pixel	Muhammad Ali Qureshi;Mohamed A.

This serves as a preparation for multi-temporal hyperspectral airand space-borne data expected to be available in coming years. Half of the trees were watered throughout the year; the other half were cut off from water supply for a five-week period in late summer. Plant health and soil, as well as leaf water status, were monitored. Moreover, hyperspectral images of the trees were acquired four times during the experiment. Results show that the experimental imaging setup is well suited for recording hyperspectral images of objects, like the beech pots, under natural illumination conditions. The high spatial resolution makes it feasible to discern between background, soil, wood, green leaves and brown leaves. Furthermore, it could be shown that dryness stress is detectable from an early stage even in the limited spectral range considered. The decline of leaf chlorophyll over time was also well monitored using imaging spectroscopy data.

A series of Gaussian synthetic surfaces with various surface complexities were employed to comparatively analyze the simulation accuracies of Coons patch and the classical interpolation methods, such as IDW, Natural neighbor, SPLINE and KRIGING. Results indicate that irrespective of terrain comoons patch igital elevation models urface modeling ccuracy plexity, Coons patch is much more accurate than the classical interpolation methods, and the accuracy of Coons patch is about 327.30, 15.19, 3.66 and 40.07 times as high as the accuracies of IDW, Natural neighbor, SPLINE and KRIGING on average. A real-world test area was used to test the effect of sampling density on the simulation accuracy. The results indicate that Coons patch has a higher accuracy than the classical interpolation methods regardless of sampling density. In a word, Coons patch as an accurate interpolation method can be used for grid-based DEM construction.	coons patch;digital elevation model;interpolation;investigative data warehouse;kriging;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spline (mathematics);steven anson coons;synthetic intelligence	Chuanfa Chen;Yanyan Li;Honglei Dai	2011	Int.

We first show that an ultrasonic rangefinder alone is unable to accurately measure the level of water on a road due to thermal effects. Using additional passive infrared sensors, we show that ground temperature and local sensor temperature measurements are sufficient to correct the rangefinder readings and improve the flood detection performance. Since floods occur very rarely, we use a supervised learning approach to estimate the correction to the ultrasonic rangefinder caused by temperature fluctuations. Preliminary data shows that water level can be estimated with an absolute error of less than 2 cm.	approximation error;machine learning;sensor;supervised learning	Mustafa Mousa;Christian G.

New with ETM+ is a 15-m panchromatic (P) band. With image sharpening techniques, this higher resolution P data, or as an alternative, the 10-m (or 5-m) P data of the SPOT satellite, can increase the spatial resolution of the multispectral (MS) data. Sharpening requires that the lower resolution MS image be coregistered and resampled to the P data before high spatial frequency information is transferred to the MS data. For visual interpretation and machine classification tasks, it is important that the sharpened data preserve the spectral characteristics of the original low resolution data. A technique was developed for sharpening (in this case, 3:1 spatial resolution enhancement) visible spectral band data, based on a model of the sensor system point spread function (PSF) in order to maintain spectral fidelity. It combines high-pass (HP) filter sharpening methods with iterative image restoration to reduce degradations caused by sensor-system-induced blurring and resembling. Also there is a spectral fidelity requirement: sharpened MS when filtered by the modeled degradations should reproduce the low resolution source MS. Quantitative evaluation of sharpening performance was made by using simulated low resolution data generated from digital color-IR aerial photography. In comparison to the HP-filter-based sharpening method, results for the technique in this paper with simulated data show improved spectral fidelity. Preliminary results with TM 30-m visible band data sharpened with simulated 10-m panchromatic data are promising but require further study.	multispectral image	George P.

In heterogeneous canopies, simulations with the canopy reflectance model five-scale show that nadir view vegetation indices, such as NDVI and simple ratio (SR), based on near infrared and red reflectance are more closely related to the gap fraction at the solar zenith angle than the LAI. The gap fraction is important in canopy light interception. At the solar zenith angle, it can be used to estimate the amount of sunlit LAI. But the knowledge or LAI and foliage heterogeneity are both needed to estimate shaded leaves that are also important in the carbon cycle. In our previous studies, we developed a methodology to retrieve the foliage heterogeneity, represented by a clumping index, from remote sensing. The retrieval is accomplished with an anisotropy index using broadband directional reflectance at the hotspot and at the darkspot. The combination of nadir, hotspot, and darkspot views allows the LAI retrieval for a given cover type. However, directional measurements are not usually acquired with the same sun-target-sensor geometry, so the anisotropy kernel-based four-scale linear model for anisotropy reflectance (FLAIR) is used to interpolate the directional reflectance from ADEOS-POLDER data to acquire hotspot and darkspot reflectance at a common geometry in the near infrared band. A landcover map at 1-km based on SPOT-VGT data acquired in 1998 and directional POLDER data acquired over Canada in June 1997, are used to map the clumping index. The results show consistent clumping index values compared to in-situ values, and that SR and the anisotropy index are not correlated to each other, indicating that both indices are related to different canopy properties.	motorola canopy	Sylvain G.

Particularly, a zero-mean heavy-tailed model, Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) model, is employed as the prior, which is believed to be capable of modelling the distribution of wavelet coefficients more accurately than traditional Gaussian model. To keep the calculations feasible, a practical implementation scheme is presented. The proposed approach is validated by simulation experiments for both general HS and MS image fusion as well as the specific case of pansharpening. The experimental results of the proposed approach are also compared with its counterpart employing a Gaussian prior for performance evaluation.	coefficient;experiment;gaussian (software);image fusion;mixture model;multispectral image;performance evaluation;simulation;wavelet	Yifan Zhang;Shaohui Mei;Mingyi He	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049727	multispectral image;computer vision;bayesian probability;geology;hyperspectral imaging;pattern recognition;remote sensing	Robotics	71.89791627065195	-64.31398226184157	7238

This is in contrast to traditional stereo, in which the error grows quadratically with depth, which means that the accuracy in the near range far exceeds that of the far range. This accuracy in the near range is unnecessarily high and comes at significant computational cost. It is, however, non-trivial to reduce this without also reducing the accuracy in the far range. Many datasets, such as video captured from a moving camera, allow the baseline to be selected with significant flexibility. By selecting an appropriate baseline and resolution (realized using an image pyramid), our algorithm computes a depthmap which has these properties: 1) the depth accuracy is constant over the reconstructed volume, 2) the computational effort is spread evenly over the volume, 3) the angle of triangulation is held constant w.r.t. depth. Our approach achieves a given target accuracy with minimal computational effort, and is orders of magnitude faster than traditional stereo.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;baseline (configuration management);computation;heightmap;pyramid (image processing);rate of convergence	David Gallup;Jan-Michael Frahm;Philippos Mordohai;Marc Pollefeys	2008	2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587671	iterative reconstruction;computer stereo vision;stereo cameras;stereo camera;computer vision;pyramid;image resolution;computer science;stereopsis;accuracy and precision;pixel;computer graphics (images)	Vision	66.7066007949793	-55.022542625864105	7255

As by-products of such alteration various precious metals (gold, silver, copper etc) form. Spectral matching techniques are traditionally used in geologic studies using hyperspectral data to generate surface mineral maps which allow to characterize hydrothermal alteration. Using a combination of Al-MgOh and FeOH absorption features we can link spectral features to mineral chemistry thus linking spectroscopy to geochemistry of alteration systems. With contextual image analysis techniques applied to ratio images of combined absorption features we can detect boundaries between alteration zones from hyperspectral data. This allows to reconstruct paleo fluid pathways and interpret these in terms of discharge and recharge areas which are important areas for mineral prospectivity of these systems. The facies successions are important indicators for the genetic nature of these systems. Studying the Australian hydrothermal system of the Pilbara as a proxy to mineral zonations found on the planet Mars allows us to understand the nature of these mineral distributions on Mars.	charge-induced voltage alteration;discharger;image analysis;map;object-based language;rechargeable battery;the australian	Freek D. van der Meer;Frank van Ruitenbeek;Harald van der Werff;Chris A.

945a2f32ddffb70defd0fdb0752e69486b92fb14	an augmented linear mixing model to address spectral variability for hyperspectral unmixing		Hyperspectral imagery collected from airborne or satellite sources inevitably suffers from spectral variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to accurately estimate abundance maps. The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented LMM, to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity and atmospheric effects) and instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), and material nonlinear mixing effects, by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary, whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads to a well-known low-coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art methods.

fe46ca3f0fd598926440db905b145b9949ca65b2	robust adaptive normalized cross-correlation for stereo matching cost computation	cost function image color analysis radiometry distortion robustness mutual information;radiometric distortion stereo correspondence matching cost	Stereo matching is a challenging task because stereo images are affected by many factors, such as radiometric distortion, sun and rain flare, flying snow, occlusion, textureless and noisy image regions, and object boundaries. However, most of the existing methods for stereo matching aim to solve only one specific problem. As a result, their performance is degraded significantly when operating with stereo images captured under a variety of scenes and conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel matching cost function based on adaptive normalized cross-correlation (ANCC). We demonstrate several weaknesses of ANCC and propose techniques to resolve them. In addition, we employ available information, such as intensity mean, intensity variance, and support window radius, to estimate the parameters of the proposed matching cost function. Compared with ANCC, the proposed matching cost function reduces the error rates from 24.1% to 17.8% in the Middlebury data set and from 64.1% to 26.4% in the KITTI data set. In addition, for noisy stereo pairs, the proposed function reduces the error rate from 73.6% to 37.3%. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results based on stereo images in different data sets under various conditions show that our proposed matching cost function outperforms state-of-the-art matching cost functions in indoor and outdoor stereo images having various radiometric distortions.	bit error rate;computation;computer stereo vision;cross-correlation;distortion;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;loss function;microsoft windows;pattern matching;time complexity;window function	Vinh Quang Dinh;Cuong Cao Pham;Jae Wook Jeon	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2539738	artificial intelligence;computer science;computer vision;cross-correlation;word error rate;mutual information;computer stereo vision;robustness (computer science);distortion;pattern recognition;normalization (statistics);data set	Vision	54.35137470857833	-55.969172876760574	7368

Our approach can be divided into three steps, blocks extraction, color balancing between blocks and composition. We formulate the problem of blocks extraction as solving compositing equations. Then according to the reference color histogram, every block extracted is applied histogram matching transform to reach color tones consistency entirely. Finally, all blocks are composited again using fractional opacities obtained from the first step. In addition to provide a effective way to block removing, our approach can handle inconsistencies of edge transitional region as well.	color balance;color histogram;compositing;histogram matching	Shiyu Jin;Guoping Wang	2017	2017 IEEE Third International Conference on Multimedia Big Data (BigMM)	10.1109/BigMM.2017.49	compositing;color histogram;big data;remote sensing;computer vision;histogram matching;computer graphics (images);computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	57.88633338381534	-60.867689970767195	7399
1c1221122f38574dcfad3d1307a4a8f4f8acad00	joint hdr and super-resolution imaging in motion blur		Images captured from consumer cameras are often prone to camera shake resulting in motion blur. Effect of motion blur is more common in high dynamic range imaging applications where multiple images are captured over a wide range of exposure settings. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to perform high dynamic range super-resolution (HDR-SR) imaging from a sequence of low dynamic range and low-resolution motion-blurred images. While existing works on HDR-SR assume the availability of blur-free input images, we propose an approach which is designed to handle blurring effects caused by the camera motion. Our approach attempts to harness the complementarity present in terms of the sensor exposure and blur to yield a high-quality image which has both higher spatial resolution as well as dynamic range. Experiments on synthetic and real examples demonstrate that the proposed method delivers state-of-the-art results.		Subeesh Vasu;Abhijeet Shenoi;A. N.

In this study, Polarimetric decomposition and the complex Wishart classifier are applied on ALOS-PALSAR data. Optical (ALOS-AVNIR) data within six days difference was used for visual interpretation of snow and non-snow classes. Application of Entropy-Anistropy-Alpha-Wishart classifier for training samples gives better classification results. To reduce speckle effects and to improve classification results, the refined Lee filter was applied on the covariance matrix several times, each time increasing the size of the moving window. Over all classification accuracy were observed 75.61%, 91.46%, 94.91%, 96.19%, 97.16% and 98.37% using different window sizes 1times1 (without filtered image), 3times3, 5times5, 7times7, 9times9 and 11times11 respectively for refined lee speckle filter. It is observed that classification accuracy increases as size of the filter window increases for speckle reduction.

However, it is still a difficult task to capture that perfect shot with your own camera when visiting these places, especially when your camera itself has limitations, such as a limited field of view. In this paper, we propose a framework to overcome the imperfections of personal photographs of tourist sites using the rich information provided by large-scale Internet photo collections. Our method deploys state-of-the-art techniques for constructing initial 3D models from photo collections. The same techniques are then used to register personal photographs to these models, allowing us to augment personal 2D images with 3D information. This strong available scene prior allows us to address a number of traditionally challenging image enhancement techniques and achieve high-quality results using simple and robust algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate automatic foreground segmentation, mono-to-stereo conversion, field-of-view expansion, photometric enhancement, and additionally automatic annotation with geolocation and tags. Our method clearly demonstrates some possible benefits of employing the rich information contained in online photo databases to efficiently enhance and augment one's own personal photographs.	2d to 3d conversion;2d-plus-depth;3d modeling;algorithm;autostereogram;collections (publication);consistency model;contain (action);database;geolocation;geotagging;image editing;image segmentation;internet;photometry;polygonal modeling;retargeting;sparse matrix;stereoscopy;super-resolution imaging;view synthesis;benefit;photograph	Chenxi Zhang;Jizhou Gao;Oliver Wang;Pierre Fite Georgel;Ruigang Yang;James Davis;Jan-Michael Frahm;Marc Pollefeys	2014	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2013.77	computer vision;the internet;computer science;photography;2d to 3d conversion;multimedia;image segmentation;segmentation;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	56.75055248171333	-56.082502063045105	7506

Hence, the objective of this work was to conduct a watershed analysis in two adjacent river basins with different land use characteristics to determine their influence on estuarine ecosystem response in the Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, U.S.A. All data sources for this study were available electronically on the Internet; the data were mined, managed, analyzed and transformed to simulate the estuarine ecosystem response to watershed-derived nutrient loads. Between 1992 and 2001, developed land use/land cover increased the most while forest cover decreased the most in both basins. Two hydrologic units nearest the coast were responsible for the greatest change in land cover. Nutrient concentrations and loads were significantly higher in the San Antonio River Basin than in the Guadalupe River Basin. Both river basins exhibited the highest flows ever recorded in 1992, however the magnitude of difference in loads between the two coastal hydrologic units for a wet and dry year was much greater in the Guadalupe River Basin (GRB) than in the San Antonio River Basin (SARB); this difference supports the concept that the GRB is a nonpoint source dominated system and SARB is a point source dominated system. There was a strong correlation between developed land use and nutrient concentrations in river water; the GRB had less developed land use and lower nutrient concentrations while the SARB had more developed land use and higher nutrient concentrations. Estuarine ecosystem response differed in the timing, duration and magnitude of DIN, phytoplankton and zooplankton when nitrogen loads from the Lower Guadalupe River were used as opposed to the Lower San Antonio. The two basins studied differ in their fundamental characteristics, i.e. precipitation, flow, human population density, etc., resulting in different drivers of nitrogen loading, point sources in the San Antonio River Basin and nonpoint sources in the Guadalupe River Basin, therefore, differing estuarine ecosystem responses.	ecosystem model;watershed (image processing)	Sandra S.

The research on regional evapotranspiration is very important to further our understanding of the global climate change, land surface atmosphere interaction, water cycle and ecological study. However, traditional site observation is only representative of the local site scale, which can not reflect the real regional conditions. Remote sensing provides a promising way to retrieve regional evapotranspiration. Heihe River Basin is the second largest inland river basin in northwest of China, water shortage has become a crucial problem to regional ecological, environmental, economic and other related areas. The research on regional evapotranspiration is in an urgent need in this area. SEBS model, a physically based model, was selected to retrieve regional evapotranspiration. Combined with MODIS products and site observations, evapotranspiration in typical days were estimated with SEBS model. The instantaneous results were validated with flux observation data from Yingke station. In most days SEBS model have good estimation of surface fluxes, the difference between observations and estimation is limited in 50W/m2. For longer time ET estimation, reference evapotranspiration fraction was selected to scale instantaneous measurements to daily and motherly evapotranspiration. Adjusted pan observations were used to validate the scaled daily results, the results indicate reference evapotranspiration fraction based method have good quality to scale daily ET. Moreover, clear spatial patterns of ET were found in Heihe River Basin. This spatial pattern is closely correlated with land use/land cover and water uses in Heihe River Basin.	electron tomography;regional lockout;spatiotemporal pattern	Yongmin Yang;Hongbo Su;Renhua Zhang;Yuan Rong	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049918	water use;evapotranspiration;water cycle;transpiration;estimation;water resources;geology;hydrology;soil science;evaporation;china;remote sensing	Mobile	84.95417017206286	-58.05971466058768	7792
0cb20db0df25595bc077b68b2238d6338e17a2ff	assessment of tree attributes extraction algorithms		Canopy Height Model (CHM)-based and point-based tree extraction algorithms are two common techniques to extract individual trees from airborne lidar data. In general, point-based algorithms process lidar points directly but suffer from intensive computation while CHM-based algorithms are efficient but fail to extract sub-dominant trees in dense canopies and their performances rely on the resolution of the CHM. To test which existing algorithm yields most accurate results, this paper compares Fixed-window local maxima algorithm, Popescu and Wynne's local maxima algorithm, variable area local maxima algorithm, individual-tree-crown delineation algorithm (ITC) and Li's point-based segmentation algorithm (LPS). The comparisons of the results to the reference data indicate although LPS extracts the largest number of individual trees, the extracted tree heights and crown widths are less accurate since LPS suffers from oversegmentation. In contrast, ITC outperforms other algorithms when measured by extracted tree heights and crown widths due to the adaptive window size. To testify if CHMs with better resolution promote the accuracy of extracted tree heights and crown widths since they provide more details, CHM-based algorithms are also applied to CHMs with different resolutions. The results indicate that although CHMs with better resolution help to yield more accurate tree heights, they do not necessarily result in more accurate crown widths.	airborne ranger;chemdraw;computation;crown group;dijkstra's algorithm;lightweight portable security;maxima and minima;motorola canopy;performance	Li Liu;Samsung Lim	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517999	computer vision;artificial intelligence;computer science;algorithm;maxima and minima;lidar	DB	77.3106632426557	-56.77197803405822	7828
556f9e77bdd170f18c1a4ffd492d1f0e6b7ee289	no reference quality assessment for screen content images with both local and global feature representation		In this paper, we propose a novel no reference quality assessment method by incorporating statistical luminance and texture features (NRLT) for screen content images (SCIs) with both local and global feature representation. The proposed method is designed inspired by the perceptual property of the human visual system (HVS) that the HVS is sensitive to luminance change and texture information for image perception. In the proposed method, we first calculate the luminance map through the local normalization, which is further used to extract the statistical luminance features in global scope. Second, inspired by existing studies from neuroscience that high-order derivatives can capture image texture, we adopt four filters with different directions to compute gradient maps from the luminance map. These gradient maps are then used to extract the second-order derivatives by local binary pattern. We further extract the texture feature by the histogram of high-order derivatives in global scope. Finally, support vector regression is applied to train the mapping function from quality-aware features to subjective ratings. Experimental results on the public large-scale SCI database show that the proposed NRLT can achieve better performance in predicting the visual quality of SCIs than relevant existing methods, even including some full reference visual quality assessment methods.	binary pattern (image generation);cns disorder;entity name part qualifier - adopted;gradient;gradient;histogram;human visual system model;image texture;inspiration function;local binary patterns;map;map;neuroscience discipline;scope (computer science);support vector machine;total peripheral resistance;vetispiradiene synthase activity	Yuming Fang;Jiebin Yan;Leida Li;Jinjian Wu;Weisi Lin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2017.2781307	support vector machine;computer vision;feature extraction;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;local binary patterns;image quality;human visual system model;mathematics;normalization (statistics);luminance;image texture	Vision	61.60803162803007	-65.22099772876545	7829

Using this model, they describe a method for the computation of optical flow and investigate its performance in a variety of conditions involving brightness variations of scene points, due to illumination nonuniformity, light source motion, specular reflection, and/or interreflection. It is shown that in the application of this method, care must be taken in the estimation of image derivatives using finite difference methods to prevent biases in the solution. A simple modification is suggested to overcome the problem. A comparison is made with two other models, including the classical brightness constancy model, through results from experiments with real images. >	optical flow	Shahriar Negahdaripour;Chih-Ho Yu	1993		10.1109/ICCV.1993.378241	computer vision;computer science;finite difference method;mathematics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	54.98388089309733	-52.60919885357107	7880

The proposed innovative approach for the three dimensional reconstruction is based on the joint exploitation of both amplitude and interferometric phase images of a multichannel SAR system. The information provided by the amplitude data is added to the 3D reconstruction chain, considering that in urban areas edges of amplitude image are likely also present in the interferometric phase one and conversely. Differently from other works present in literature, the proposed technique exploits the amplitude image, not only to improve the phase regularization, but also to improve the phase unwrapping step. The results will show the effectiveness of the method.	3d reconstruction;amplitude damping channel;computation;cut (graph theory);energy minimization;instantaneous phase;mathematical optimization;time complexity	Aymen Shabou;Florence Tupin;Giampaolo Ferraioli;Vito Pascazio	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650702	3d reconstruction;iterative reconstruction;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;image resolution;coherence;interferometry;optics;radar imaging;physics;pixel;remote sensing	Vision	72.6341031487164	-66.81283314735094	7887

These images also have a significant amount of noise, which is either due to the clouds or atmospheric humidity. The presence of noise compounds the problems associated with the detection of features, as the use of any traditional noise removal technique will also result in the removal of weak edges. Recently, there have been rapid advances in image processing as a result of the development of the mathematical theory of wavelet transforms. This theory led to multifrequency channel decomposition of images, which further led to the evolution of important algorithms for the reconstruction of images at various resolutions from the decompositions. The possibility of analyzing images at various resolutions can be useful not only in the suppression of noise, but also in the detection of fine features and their classification. This paper presents a new computational scheme based on multiresolution decomposition for extracting the features of interest from the oceanographic images by suppressing the noise. The multiresolution analysis from the median presented by Starck–Murtagh–Bijaoui [4], [5] is used for the noise suppression.	algorithm;feature extraction;image processing;multiresolution analysis;qr decomposition;wavelet transform;zero suppression	Kiran K.

Though extremely important for the scale space image representation and restoration of Gaussian blur, it is a horribly ill-posed problem, since minor noise leads to very erroneous result. To solve this ill-posed problem stably, we first apply a multiscale representation method to decompose an image into components of various scales. We then show that the ill-posedness is introduced by antidiffusing such components with scales smaller than the antidiffusion time t. This implies that, for a component with scale larger than the antidiffusion time t, we can do antidiffusion stably. On the other hand, for a component with smaller scale, if an attempt were made on antidiffusing it, the ill-posedness would result; conversely, if we leave it unchanged, the ill-posedness will no longer exist. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and is robust to noise because it is mainly performed by an integration computation (convolution), contrasting with the differential computation required by direct antidiffusion. Experimental results show its effectiveness in restoring Gaussian blurred images.		Qiang Li;Yuichi Yoshida;N.

Measurements have been made on a continuous basis since 2002. The NASA and JAXA standard soil moisture products were compared to the network observations, along with an alternative single channel algorithm. The results indicate that each algorithm has different performance statistics that depend upon the site. Results clearly show that there is much room for improvement in the algorithms adopted by JAXA and NASA.

Using as few as two images, the core of our method is the computation of a vote distribution for a number of illumination chromaticity hypotheses via correspondence matching. The hypothesis with the highest vote is accepted as correct. The estimated illumination chromaticity is then used together with the new matching invariant to match highlights, which inherently provides solutions for correspondence searching and specularity removal. Our method differs from the previous approaches: those treat these vision problems separately and generally require that specular highlights be detected in a preprocessing step. Also, our method uses more images than previous illumination chromaticity estimation methods, which increases its robustness because more inputs/constraints are used. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	computation;estimated;grayscale color map;illumination (image);matching;pixel;preprocessor;sensor;solutions;specular highlight;specularity;synthetic intelligence;algorithm	Qingxiong Yang;Shengnan Wang;Narendra Ahuja;Ruigang Yang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2010.2055573	computer vision;specular reflection;estimation;colors of noise;chromaticity;lighting;mathematics;pixel;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	53.892132740621626	-55.874195364174774	7967

Despite the increased ability to collect and store large volumes of data, few individual data sets exist that provide both the requisite spatial and temporal observational frequency for many urban and/or regional-scale applications. The motivating view of this paper, however, is that the relative temporal richness of one data set can be leveraged with the relative spatial richness of another to fill in the gaps. We also note that any single interpolation technique has advantages and disadvantages. Particularly when focusing on the spatial or on the temporal dimension, this means that different techniques are more appropriate than others for specific types of data. We therefore propose a spacetime interpolation approach whereby two interpolation methods – one for the temporal and one for the spatial dimension – are used in tandem in order to maximize the quality of the result. We call our ensemble approach the Space-Time Interpolation Environment (STIE). The primary steps within this environment include a spatial interpolator, a time-step processor, and a calibration step that enforces phenomenon-related behavioral constraints. The specific interpolation techniques used within the STIE can be chosen on the basis of suitability for the data and application at hand.

The goal of this work is to develop an algorithm to invert these distortions and produce an output digital image consistent with a scanner operating under ideal uniform motion conditions. The image restoration algorithm described in this paper applies to typical office scanners that employ a moving linear sensor array (LSA) or moving optics. The velocity of the components is generally not constant in time. Dynamic errors are introduced by gears, timing belts, motors, and structural vibrations. A companion paper characterizes the artifacts induced by nonuniform velocity. In this work, we make use of the instantaneous LSA velocity to reconstruct an underlying piecewise constant or piecewise linear model of the image irradiance function. The control points for the underlying model are obtained by solving a system of equations derived to relate the observed area samples with the instantaneous LSA velocity and a spatially-varying sampling kernel. An efficient solution exists for the narrow band diagonal matrix that results. The control points computed with this method fully define the underlying irradiance function. That function is then suitable for resampling under ideal scanning conditions to produce a restored output digital image.	algorithm;circuit restoration;control point (mathematics);digital image;distortion;image restoration;linear model;piecewise linear continuation;quantum fluctuation;resampling (statistics);sampling (signal processing);velocity (software development)	George Wolberg;Robert P.

Raindrop impacts and consequent runoff generation are the main driving forces of this geomorphic process of soil degradation. The potential ability for rainfall to cause soil loss is expressed as rainfall erosivity, a key parameter required by most soil loss prediction models. In Italy, rainfall erosivity measurements are limited to few locations, preventing researchers from effectively assessing the geography and magnitude of soil loss across the country. The objectives of this study were to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall erosivity in Italy and to develop a national-scale grid-based map of rainfall erosivity. Thus, annual rainfall erosivity values were measured and subsequently interpolated using a geostatistical approach. Time series of pluviographic records (10-years) with high temporal resolution (mostly 30-min) for 386 meteorological stations were analysed. Regression-kriging was used to interpolate rainfall erosivity values of the meteorological stations to an Italian rainfall erosivity map (500-m). A set of 23 environmental covariates was tested, of which seven covariates were selected based on a stepwise approach (mostly significant at the 0.01 level). The interpolation method showed a good performance for both the cross-validation dataset (R_cv^2 0.777) and the fitting dataset (R2=0.779).

This paper aims to obtain unambiguous imaging of static scenes and moving targets with the first Chinese dual-channel spaceborne SAR sensor. We propose an integrated imaging scheme with the dual-channel echoes. In the imaging scheme, the subspace-based error estimation algorithm is first applied to the spaceborne multichannel SAR system, followed by the reconstruction algorithm prior to imaging. The motion-adapted reconstruction algorithm for moving target imaging is initially achieved with the spaceborne multichannel SAR system. The results exhibit an effective suppression of azimuth ambiguities and false targets with the proposed process. This paper verifies the accuracy of the subspace-based channel error estimator and the feasibility of the motion-adapted reconstruction algorithm. The proposed imaging process has prospects for future HRWS SAR systems with more channels.	algorithm;dual;excretory function;image resolution;multi-channel memory architecture;nr1i2 wt allele;openstreetmap;sensor;synthetic data;velocity (software development);zero suppression	Tingting Jin;Xiaolan Qiu;Donghui Hu;Chibiao Ding	2017		10.3390/s17081709	reconstruction algorithm;electronic engineering;engineering;estimator;azimuth;synthetic aperture radar;computer vision;subspace topology;artificial intelligence;communication channel	Vision	75.78461181548818	-66.89835848638506	8051

We propose angular embedding as a more robust, efficient, and versatile alternative to LS, LLE, and NCUTS for obtaining a global brightness ordering from local differences. Our model explains a variety of brightness illusions with a single algorithm. Brightness of a pixel can be understood locally as its intensity deviating in the gradient direction and globally as finding its rank relative to others, particularly the lightest and darkest ones.	algorithm;angularjs;edge detection;gradient;parsing;pixel	Stella X.

These images are not required to share the same resolution or sensor characteristics. By working at the segment level we preserve the advantages of segment based image classification while also incorporating the benefits of using multiple image sources. Segment fusion is achieved by constructing a MRF graph over the segments with an edges connecting overlapping segments from different images. These edges penalize connected segments for taking different labels as a function of the degree of overlap. Experimentation on the fusion of Land-sat and SPOT5 imagery for classification of different forest types shows the ability of this method to deliver substantial improvements in classification accuracy.	computer vision;markov chain;markov random field;multi-source	Willem C.

Furthermore, this method is designed with the purpose of adding it to an already implemented document digitization pipeline. To justify our claims, we provide an accuracy analysis of our correction technique using simulated ground-truth data which allows individual sources of error to be determined and compared. These techniques are then applied on real documents that have been acquired using a 3D scanner.	3d scanner;archive;circuit restoration;color balance;ground truth;requirement;synthetic intelligence	George V.

In visual signal processing, the spatially nonuniformed distribution of perceptually meaningful information in image and video frames calls for a kind of Spatially-Weighted NMF ( sw NMF) that applies location dependent weights into the decomposition problem. In this paper we introduce sw NMF solution based on the hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS) approach. Then we exemplify its application to a new information display diagram named temporal psychovisual modulation (TPVM) with comparison with traditional HALS method and baseline algorithm of multiplicative update (MU).	modulation;non-negative matrix factorization	Zhongpai Gao;Guangtao Zhai;Jia Wang	2017	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2017.04.010	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;non-negative matrix factorization	ML	66.88240153367678	-67.1402625056634	8245
e9ccc4f4087adb03631056311960f4da1fd9c967	a computing framework of adaptive support-window multi-lateral filter for image and depth processing	depth image processing bilateral filter adaptive support window data aggregation integral image;noise abatement adaptive filters image denoising;o 1 algorithm adaptive support window based multilateral filter noise high frequency suppression 2d image processing 3d depth processing pixel wise weight binarization central anchor pixel cross subwindow based algorithm data aggregation irregularly shaped support window near constant time complexity edge preservation noise suppression quadrilateral filter trilateral filter;image color analysis noise kernel shape approximation methods image edge detection three dimensional displays	In this paper, a computing framework for adaptive-support-window-based multi-lateral filters is proposed. The so-called multi-lateral filters, extended from the well-known bilateral filter, have found their broaden applications in noise/high-frequency suppression for 2-D image and 3-D depth processing. Our filters rely on binarizing the traditional pixel-wise weights to be only 0 or 1, resulting in an adaptive support window whose shape depends on the local image structure of the central anchor pixel. A cross-subwindow-based algorithm is devised to compute the adaptive support window. A fast algorithm based on integral images is also devised for data aggregation within such an irregularly shaped support window. Taking advantage of the integral images, our scheme presents a near constant-time complexity regardless of the size and shape of the support window. Experiments show that both noise suppression and edge-preserving can be simultaneously achieved by using our proposed framework. The average speedup ratios of our scheme are 14X~49X and 1.3X~5.6X against the traditional and the O(1) implementations, respectively. Our scheme also has the advantage of easy extension to tri-lateral and quadri-lateral filters, whereas other O(1) algorithms might not.	algorithm;bilateral filter;computation;data aggregation;experiment;extensibility;field-programmable gate array;gabor filter;graphics processing unit;image processing;lateral computing;lateral thinking;level of detail;pixel;speedup;time complexity;triangular function;whole earth 'lectronic link;zero suppression	Guo-Shiang Lin;Chun-Yu Chen;Chun-Ting Kuo;Wen-Nung Lie	2014	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2014.2330391	adaptive filter;median filter;image noise;computer vision;mathematical optimization;feature detection;kernel adaptive filter;pattern recognition;mathematics;filter design;non-local means;composite image filter;salt-and-pepper noise	Vision	54.62563921179487	-64.5975095624488	8308

By measuring each of these categories separately, and then combining to form a single figure of merit or quality metric, a better understanding of the effects of compression on quality can be achieved. This approach is superior to the use of single overall measures of 'quality,' such as the mean squared error (MSE) measurement of distortion. Tone reproduction is assessed using cascaded transfer functions. Color reproduction is assessed using both the CIE (1976) L*a*b* color difference measure and a color metric, the color reproduction index, based on a proven model of color vision. Image sharpness and noise are evaluated using the modulation transfer function (MTF) and the noise power spectrum (NPS) respectively. These results are combined, together with characteristics of the display system and a 'typical' observer, in an image quality metric based on the square root integral (SQRI) metric. Comparisons are made between the various methods of assessment, and objectively measured quality is correlated with results from subjective scaling experiments. Problems with the application of methods based on linear systems analysis are described and possible solutions suggested.© (1997) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

By decomposing the image formation process into geometric and photometric parts, we are able to state the problem as a multilinear system which can be solved accurately and efficiently. As we treat each contribution as independent, the objective function is convex in the parameters and a global solution is guaranteed. We start by recovering 3D shape using a novel algorithm which incorporates generalization error of the model obtained from empirical measurements. We then describe two methods to recover facial texture, diffuse lighting, specular reflectance, and camera properties from a single image. The methods make increasingly weak assumptions and can be solved in a linear fashion. We evaluate our findings on a publicly available database, where we are able to outperform an existing state-of-the-art algorithm. We demonstrate the usability of the recovered parameters in a recognition experiment conducted on the CMU-PIE database.	3d modeling;algorithm;autostereogram;convex function;database;face;generalization (psychology);generalization error;image formation;loss function;optimization problem;photometry;specular highlight;usability	Oswald Aldrian;William A.

Because multiple observations are available at the same scale from the same time period, simply iterating a scalar-valued MKS algorithm leads to the degenerative case of estimating an unknown constant, and the smoothed covariance is therefore driven asymptotically towards zero as a function of iteration. A vector-valued implementation of the MKS algorithm can in principle solve this problem, but the number of arithmetic operations required to process an 1 × m observation vector grows as 3 m . We overcome this by processing the observations sequentially, such that the Kalman gain, estimate covariance, and the a posteriori estimate are calculated serially using the information form of the MKS algorithm. We also reduce computational load by omitting calculations of these parameters where no measurement is available. As a case study, we employ the serial-update, vector-valued MKS algorithm to fuse SAR images acquired over the Finke River Gorge in Central Australia.	airborne ranger;algorithm;extended kalman filter;global variable;gradient;image resolution;iteration;mks toolkit;smoothing;topography	Hojin Jhee;Sweung Cheung;K.

Previous research efforts either implemented Difference-of-two-Gaussians (DOG) bandpass filtering with resistive networks for edge'detection or image segmentation with so-called resistive fuses. By using a feedback mechanism, we combine the superior edge detection algorithm of two-layer parallel resistive networks with image segmentation. To allow an early estimation of the results achievable with this algorithm, a special simulation program was developed which simulates the behavior of an idealized electric circuit implementation of this algorithm. Simulation results not only for the new proposed algorithm but also for two-layer resistive networks and for networks with resistive fuses are presented. Moreover, the development of the simulation program also led to a new effective method for subsequent implementation of the algorithm.	algorithm;british informatics olympiad;edge detection;effective method;feedback;image segmentation;network analysis (electrical circuits);preprocessor;simulation	Chang-Han Yi;Robert Schlabbach;Holger Kroth;Heinrich Klar	1997		10.1007/BFb0032570	electrical network;computer vision;feature detection;edge detection;computer science;machine learning;deriche edge detector;feedback;band-pass filter;edge enhancement;image segmentation;canny edge detector;scale-space segmentation	Vision	61.03720969204926	-79.59916705792573	8803

Visual evaluation of the rock texture is done to determine the most significant features of the patterns for the analysis of heterogeneity of meso textures are grain size and grain size spatial distribution. These are compared to results of parameters calculated using image structure analyser. Images are capture with a scanner of the polished slabs that are 9*9 cm in size. The geo textures are expressed by four main parameters: textural entropy, homogeneity, contrast and textural correlation. Reducing the number of parameters to entropy and textural correlation significantly reduce the calculation time. These two parameters are considered to be the most significant. The other two, homogeneity and contrast, can be estimated. The parameter textural correlation yields better results than does textural entropy. Comparison of the analysis of textures visually and using image analysis shows that textural parameters have to be further worked in order to have a better performance.	mesoscopic physics;robert haralick	Margarida Taborda Duarte;Joanne Mae Robison Fernlund	2005		10.1007/11492542_87	image texture;computer vision;homogeneity;image analysis;particle-size distribution;image processing;computer science;heterogeneity;correlation;grain size	Vision	71.78493066282955	-59.60068490031333	8914

However, these models are always accompanied by staircase effect due to the property of bounded variation (BV) space. In this paper, we present two high order variational models based on total generalized variation (TGV) with two common and important non-quadratic fidelity data terms for blurred images corrupted by impulsive and Poisson noises. Since the direct extension of alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve three-block convex minimization problems is not necessarily convergent, we develop an efficient algorithm called Prediction–Correction ADMM to solve our models and also show the convergence of the proposed method. Moreover, we extend our models to deal with color images restoration. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed high order models can reduce staircase effect while preserving edges and outperform classical TV based models in SNR and SSIM values.

The variability of corn plant location and within-row spacing has been demonstrated to have a significant correlation with grain and biomass yield. They are included in many yield prediction models which are used to guide mid-season variable-rate fertilizer applications. A prototype sensing system was developed to automatically measure corn plant location and spacing on-the-go based on ground LiDAR technology. The system travelled along crop rows with a ground LiDAR sensor scanning at the bottom section of each corn plant. The possibility of corn stalk identification was increased because each stalk appeared in multiple scans from various view angles of the sensor. The first version of the prototyping system was developed earlier and resulted in a relatively low detecting accuracy. In this paper, an improved version of the prototyping system was presented with substantial additional field evaluation results. The system was improved in terms of the data acquisition platform and the data processing algorithms, specifically, the scan registration and stalk recognition procedures to reduce the misidentification errors. Additional field evaluation was conducted on 200 plants at their V8 growth stage. A total plant counting error of 5.5% and a 1.9cm of root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in spacing measurement were achieved between the sensor measurements and the manually measured ground truth data. The new data processing algorithm was also tested on the data collected with the first version system. The false positive plant counting error was reduced from 24.0% with the first version system to 14.0% with the improved algorithms.	algorithm;data acquisition;electron;mathematical optimization;system of measurement	Y.

A highly accurate estimation for object presence is obtained by projecting all grid cells associated with the object boundary on the image plane. Memory space and access time are reduced by run-length encoding of the boundary cells, while boundary cell projection time is reduced by exploiting projection templates and multiresolution volumes. Efforts have also been made towards a fast perspective projection as well as interactive classification. We further present task partitioning schemes for effective parallelization of both boundary cell projection and ray traversal procedures. Good load balancing has been reached by taking full advantage of both the optimizations in the serial rendering algorithm and shared-memory architecture. Our experimental results on a 16-processor SGI Power Challenge have shown interactive rendering rates for 2563 volumetric data sets at 10 - 30 Hz. This paper describes the theory and implementation of our algorithm, and shows its superiority over the shear-warp factorization approach.	3d projection;access time;graphics hardware;hardware acceleration;image plane;image quality;load balancing (computing);parallel computing;point in polygon;ray casting;rendering (computer graphics);run-length encoding;sequential algorithm;shared memory;task allocation and partitioning of social insects;tree traversal;volume rendering;volumetric display	Ming Wan;Arie E.

The trilateral filter makes use of reflectivity as well as spatial and intensity information so that geometric features, such as jump and roof edges, are preserved while smoothing. The range image inpainting technique based on belief propagation recovers a deteriorated range image using not only the adjacent range values but also the continuity of the reflectance image. We conduct simulations and experiments using synthesized images and actual range images taken by a laser scanner and verify that the proposed techniques suppress noise while preserving jump and roof edges and repair deteriorated range images.	3d scanner;belief propagation;experiment;image editing;inpainting;noise reduction;range imaging;reflection coefficient;scott continuity;simulation;smoothing;software propagation	Shuji Oishi;Ryo Kurazume;Yumi Iwashita;Tsutomu Hasegawa	2011	2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2011.6094443	laser scanning;three-dimensional space;computer vision;edge detection;feature extraction;computer science;noise;pattern recognition;mathematics;optics;grayscale;belief propagation	Robotics	56.94437910327713	-57.83440489416305	9022

The improvements include three main aspects. A quartic polynomial model is adopted to represent SAR signal in range-Doppler domain and 2-D frequency domain to improve precision. A constant scaling factor is employed to replace the reference frequency in the NCS, which makes NCS more flexible. A second chirp scaling operation is added to the end of the NCS so as to remove scaling effect on range direction of SAR image. Those improvements make NCS applicable to process highly squinted SAR data from a large range swath at a fine resolution	algorithm;chirp;image scaling;network computing system;non-volatile memory;nonlinear system;polynomial;quartic function;simulation	Kaizhi Wang;Xingzhao Liu	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings	10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661179	frequency domain	Robotics	76.09290342183584	-67.66200436089623	9036

Most imagers dedicated to address such dynamic ranges, need specific, and large pixels. However, canonical imagers can be used for high dynamic range (HDR) by performing multicapture acquisitions to compensate saturation. This technique is made possible at the expense of the need for large memory requirements and an increase of the overall acquisition time. On the other hand, the implementation of compressive sensing (CS) raises the same issues regarding the modifications of both the pixel and the readout circuitry. Assuming HDR images are sufficiently sparse, CS claims they can be reconstructed from few random linear measurements. A novel CS-based image sensor design is presented in this paper allowing a compressive acquisition without changing the classical pixel design, as well as the overall sensor architecture. In addition to regular CS, HDR CS is enabled thanks to specific time diagrams of the control signals. An alternative nondestructive column-based readout mode constitutes the main change compared to a traditional functioning. The HDR reconstruction, which is also presented in this paper, is based on merging the information of multicapture compressed measurements while taking into account noise sources and nonlinearities introduced by both the proposed acquisition scheme and its practical implementation.	algorithm;cmos;compressed sensing;diagram;electronic circuit;high dynamic range;image sensor;pixel;range imaging;requirement;sparse matrix	William Guicquero;Antoine Dupret;Pierre Vandergheynst	2016	IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging	10.1109/TCI.2016.2557073	embedded system;computer vision;computer science;image sensor;optics;physics	Vision	67.0506744736556	-61.16777631613115	9061

Fractal is an appropriate mathematical tool to explain the comprehensive variation. In this paper, the fractal dimension of segmented reflectance spectral curves was used to assess the leaf chlorophyll concentration by the moving window technique. Firstly, the size of moving window was defined in 10nm, 20nm, 30nm, 50nm, 75nm, 100nm and the best window size was chose by comparing the correlation between fractal dimension and chlorophyll content. Secondly, the fractal dimension with the best window was used to build the estimation model of chlorophyll content, and the estimation result was compared with various spectral VIs. The research result showed that (1) the window with the length of 50nm was the best for chlorophyll content assessment. (2) For different chlorophyll content, the variation of fractal dimension was mainly found in 475nm~650nm of visible light spectra and 720nm~770nm of near-infrared spectra, with the trend of changes conforming to the reflectance. (3) Comparing with several spectral VIs, the fractal dimension was better related with chlorophyll content. So, the fractal dimension of segmented reflectance spectral curve can be served as a new comprehensive parameter to estimate the chlorophyll content of vegetation.	fractal dimension;visual instruction set	Yanfang Xiao;Luxiang Li;Huili Gong;Demin Zhou	2012	2012 20th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/Geoinformatics.2012.6270349	geography;analytical chemistry;optics;remote sensing	Vision	86.8665992482073	-59.80031717275844	9145

The proposed method optimizes the angles between linear sub-arrays and planes of the two V-shaped sensor arrays to be isotropic. Optimization of the angles is done by using the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB), which accounts for the statistical coupling effect of elevation and azimuth angle estimation. The designed 3-D V-shaped sensor array is compared with different planar array.	direction of arrival	Fesih Keskin;Tansu Filik	2018	2018 26th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2018.8404725	artificial intelligence;computer vision;computer science;elevation;isotropy;planar array;coupling;sensor array;azimuth;optics;direction of arrival	EDA	78.18255800813841	-67.23031537916638	9231

This paper tested the capability of Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (PALSAR) multipolarization and polarimetric data for crop classification. L-band results were compared with those achieved with a C-band SAR data set (ASAR and RADARSAT-1), an integrated C- and L-band data set, and a multitemporal optical data set. Using all L-band linear polarizations, corn, soybeans, cereals, and hay-pasture were classified to an overall accuracy of 70%. A more temporally rich C-band data set provided an accuracy of 80%. Larger biomass crops were well classified using the PALSAR data. C-band data were needed to accurately classify low biomass crops. With a multifrequency data set, an overall accuracy of 88.7% was reached, and many individual crops were classified to accuracies better than 90%. These results were competitive with the overall accuracy achieved using three Landsat images (88.0%). L-band parameters derived from three decomposition approaches (Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, and Krogager) produced superior crop classification accuracies relative to those achieved using the linear polarizations. Using the Krogager decomposition parameters from all three PALSAR acquisitions, an overall accuracy of 77.2% was achieved. The results reported in this paper emphasize the value of polarimetric, as well as multifrequency SAR, data for crop classification. With such a diverse capability, a SAR-only approach to crop classification becomes increasingly viable.	aperture (software);inbound marketing;l band;phased array;polarimetry	Heather McNairn;Jiali Shang;Xianfeng Jiao;Catherine Champagne	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2026052	polarization;hydrology;information security;soil science;accuracy and precision;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	80.48054588462735	-58.46092205581577	9254

Their use for ash cloud detection and quantitative retrieval has been so far not fully investigated. In order to do this, a forward electromagnetic model is set up and examined taking into account various operating frequencies such as S-, C-, X-, and Ka-bands. A dielectric and microphysical characterization of volcanic vesicular ash is carried out. Particle size-distribution (PSD) functions are derived both from the sequential fragmentation-transport (SFT) theory of pyroclastic deposits, leading to a scaled-Weibull PSD, and from more conventional scaled-Gamma PSD functions. Best fitting of these theoretical PSDs to available measured ash data at ground is performed in order to determine the value of the free PSD parameters. The radar backscattering from spherical-equivalent ash particles is simulated up to Ka-band and the accuracy of the Rayleigh scattering approximation is assessed by using an accurate ensemble particle scattering model. A classification scheme of ash average concentration and particle size is proposed and a sensitivity study of ash radar backscattering to model parameters is accomplished. A comparison with C-band radar signatures is finally illustrated and discussed.	antivirus software;approximation;best practice;cellular automaton;content-based image retrieval;fragmentation (computing);ka band;microwave;radar;rayleigh–ritz method	Frank S.

Perlin [1985] introduced the idea of using a repeatable band-limited noise function to add stochastic variation to procedural shaders. We show that the quality of random number generation directly affects the quality of the noise produced, however, good quality noise can still be produced with a lower quality random number generator. Further, we show that the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) [Reddy 2003] can serve as the basis of a fast and high quality random number generator, and by changing the number of encryption rounds we can trade speed for quality.	algorithm;bandlimiting;computer graphics;display resolution;encryption;graphics processing unit;monte carlo method;perlin noise;random number generation;rendering (computer graphics);sampling (signal processing);shader;tea	Fahad Zafar;Marc Olano	2010		10.1145/1730804.1730973	parallel computing;computer hardware;computer science;optics;real-time rendering;irradiance;normal mapping;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	64.35869870151078	-52.41643839979252	9445

Approximation coefficients are denoised using Perona Malik anisotropic diffusion. Finally these processed coefficients are averaged to get a denoised image. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the previously formulated denoising algorithms both in terms of noise reduction and structural content preservation.	anisotropic diffusion;approximation;coefficient;noise reduction;similarity measure;structural similarity;subject reduction;temporally ordered routing algorithm;tomography;wavelet	Wajiha Habib;Adil Masood Siddiqui;Imran Touqir	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine	10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732512	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;anisotropic diffusion;wavelet transform;approximation theory	Robotics	57.71555529525554	-68.34283107897724	9460

The derivative calculation involves introducing sources at the receiver locations with subsequent back-substitution into the impedance matrix equation.

Therefore, an algorithm is utilized, which has shown to give very good results under low and moderate wind conditions. The algorithm extracts wind directions from wind induced streaks imaged by the SAR, which are very well aligned with the mean surface wind direction. Wind speeds are extracted from the SAR measured normalized radar cross section utilizing a scatterometer C-band model, which describes the dependency of the NRCS on wind speed, wind direction and incidence angle. The SAR-retrieved wind fields are compared to results of a high resolution numerical tropical cyclone model. Furthermore, the SAR-retrieved wind fields are used to quantitatively measure the dimension and location of the hurricane eye.	algorithm;cross section (geometry);cyclone;image resolution;incidence matrix;numerical analysis	Jochen Horstmann;Hans Graber;Wolfgang Koch;Steve Iris	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

Compared to X- and L-band radar signatures of rain over the ocean, C-band radar signatures are much more complex because rain can increase or decrease the radar backscattering due to ring wave generation by the rain drops impinging onto the sea surface and due to wave damping by turbulence generated in the upper water layer by the impact of the rain drops. Which of these two mechanisms dominates, depends on rain rate, drop size distribution, wind speed, and the temporal evolution of the rain event. Stratiform rain usually causes an increase of the radar backscattering, while most of the other forms of rain cause a mixture of increased and decreased radar backscattering.	antivirus software;dominator (graph theory);l band;projection screen;radar;turbulence;type signature	Werner Alpers	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7327040	meteorology;dbz;early-warning radar;space-based radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;atmospheric sciences;geology;radar horizon;weather radar;3d radar;radar imaging;radar;remote sensing;low-frequency radar	Embedded	81.66168281144347	-61.229134183833686	9573

This research presents a modular framework for assessing predictive accuracy of business-as-usual deforestation in the future by comparing two existing approaches: GEOMOD Modeling (GM) and Land Change Modeler (LCM). The comparison uses data from a case study in Chiquitania, Bolivia. Data from 1986 and 1994 are used to simulate land-cover of 2000; the resulting maps are compared with an observed land-cover map of 2000. GM and LCM simulate business-as-usual deforestations at the pixel level. The model structures of GM's linear extrapolation and LCM's Markov Chain are compared to review quantity of LUCC; and the model structures of GM's empirical frequency, LCM's logistic regression, and LCM's multilayer perceptron are compared to review (spatial) allocation of LUCC. Relative operating characteristics, figure of merit, and multiple resolution analysis are employed to assess predictive accuracy of multiple transition modeling. By design, GM lacks the potential to model multiple transitions, and the LCM's multilayer perceptron may produce different results for each simulation due to its stochastic element. Based on the model structure and predictive accuracy comparisons, the LCM seems more suitable than the GM for a REDD application. When a project is to employ a predictive method for its spatially explicit baseline setting, then it is highly recommended to use the proposed framework to assess accuracy of the baseline as part of a project design document.	elegant degradation	Oh Seok Kim	2010	Trans.

In this paper, a spatial light modulator based on a high-resolution twisted nematic liquid crystal display is used to record both reference and object beams. We have programmed the active region of the SLM, so that some part will work in the phase modulation mode and some part will work in the amplitude modulation mode. In our coaxial holography design, the central ring area is reserved for amplitude modulation of the object beam while the outer rings/annuli will cater for various phase modulation of the reference beams for multiplexed storage. A number of objects can then be stored/encoded in the same location of the hologram and later be reconstructed using the appropriate reference beams. Three different methods of phase modulating the reference beam are investigated, viz. the diffraction of blaze grating, the diffusion of random speckle and beam shaping. The coaxial multiplexing holographic data encoding and reconstruction are carried out experimentally in a single-beam 4-f setup using He-Ne laser with a wavelength of 632.8nm. A 2-D holographic medium is used for recording and the reconstructed images are captured by a camera on the image plane. From the results of simulation and experiment, it can be seen that all the images are reconstructed clearly and separately, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed novel technique of coaxial multiplexed storage/encoding.	areal density (computer storage);code;experiment;holographic data storage;holography;itil;image plane;image resolution;liquid-crystal display;modulation;multiplexing;noise shaping;reference beam;signal beam;simulation;spatial light modulator;twisted nematic field effect;viz: the computer game	Zhongyu Chen;Wei Jia;Tsing Chung;Fung Jacky Wen;Yuk Tak Chow;Po Sheun Chung	2012		10.1117/12.917569	telecommunications;optics;holography;physics	Vision	68.09955215391285	-60.360357903545854	9648

The multi-sensor fusion of panchromatic (PAN) and thermal infrared (TIR) images is a good example of this data fusion. While a PAN image has higher spatial resolution, a TIR one has lower spatial resolution. In this study, we have proposed an efficient method to fuse Landsat 8 PAN and TIR images using an optimal scaling factor in order to control the trade-off between the spatial details and the thermal information. We have compared the fused images created from different scaling factors and then tested the performance of the proposed method at urban and rural test areas. The test results show that the proposed method merges the spatial resolution of PAN image and the temperature information of TIR image efficiently. The proposed method may be applied to detect lava flows of volcanic activity, radioactive exposure of nuclear power plants, and surface temperature change with respect to land-use change.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;flow;fuse device component;image scaling;nuclear power plants;numerous;radioactivity;sensor;spectroscopy, near-infrared;test scaling	Hyung-Sup Jung;Sung-Whan Park	2014		10.3390/s141224425	text mining;temperature;computer science;bioinformatics;sensor fusion;remote sensing	Robotics	80.51227622553508	-59.740887246317094	9664

Due to the large amount of data that must be processed to determine multi-temporal height variations, algorithm optimization is crucial. Modelling satellite tracks as great circle arcs on a sphere allows the application of vector algebra and spherical trigonometry in searching crossovers and near-shots for height variation analysis. Two programs written in Fortran 90/95 are presented: the former reads and filters ICESat data from input GLA12 binary files, while the latter implements the search for multi-temporal height variations. The analysis of inter-annual height variations in a megadune field of East Antarctica shows decimetre-scale changes possibly related to wind-driven accumulation and erosion processes.

65c77d59b2314277a155ea6c62ed626bca1799ef	how to compensate the effect of using an incomplete wavelet base for reconstructing an image? - application in psychovisual experiment		One way in psychovisual experiment to understand human visual system is to analyze separately contents of different spatial frequency bands. To prepare images for this purpose, we proceed to a decomposition of the original image by a wavelet transform centered on selected scales. The wavelets used are Difference Of Gaussians (DOG) according to works modeling the human visual system. Before rebuilding the visual stimulus, various transformations can be performed on different scales to measure the efficiency of the observer, for a given task, according to the spatial frequencies used. The problem is that if we use an incomplete wavelet basis during decomposition, there is a significant loss of information between the original image and the reconstructed image. The work presented here offers a way to solve this problem by using coefficients appropriate for each scale during the decomposition step.	coefficient;difference of gaussians;experiment;frequency band;human visual system model;pattern recognition;wavelet transform	Sylvie Lelandais;Justin Plantier	2013			computer vision;mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics	Vision	60.007612665792685	-66.47468116926817	9710

It is a good looking approximation of the light radiation, however it is very expensive method. It needs a large number of samples to get fair effects. In this article we propose a speed increase of the AO rendering, by using the eye tracker. Human cannot see high frequency details in parafoveal, and we can render this area with less accuracy. We decrease the number of AO samples with distance from the observer gaze point.

Edges are active and expressive stimuli for human visual perception. However, it is hard to separate structure from details because edge strength and object scale are entirely different concepts. This paper proposes a structure-aware bilateral texture algorithm to remove texture patterns and preserve structures. Our proposed method is simple and fast, as well as effective in removing textures. Instead of patch shift, smaller patches represent pixels located at structure edges, and original patches represent the texture regions. Specifically, this paper also improves joint bilateral filter to preserve small structures. Moreover, a windowed inherent variation is adapted to distinguish textures and structures for detecting structure edges. Finally, the proposed method produces excellent experimental results. These results are compared to some results of previous studies. Besides, structure-preserving filtering is a critical operation in many image processing applications. Our proposed filter is also demonstrated in many attractive applications, such as seam carving, detail enhancement, artistic rendering, etc.	algorithm;artistic rendering;bilateral filter;edge detection;image editing;image processing;pixel;seam carving;sensor;smoothing;texture filtering;texture mapping;tree structure;window function	Ting-Hao Lin;Der-Lor Way;Zen-Chung Shih;Wen-Kai Tai;Chin-Chen Chang	2016	Comput.

The output grayscale image is modeled as a linear combination of three color channels where the mixing coefficients are computed by a constrained quadratic programming scheme using modulation domain features of the input color image. The optimization is formulated such that local color space distances between pixels in the input image are approximately preserved in the output grayscale image. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art conversion algorithms, often producing a grayscale image with better visual distinctions between patches that are close in the color space of the original image.	algorithm;channel (digital image);coefficient;color image;color space;grayscale;image conversion;mathematical optimization;modulation;pixel;quadratic programming;time complexity	Chuong T.

To account for the effects of precipitation, we analyze the co-located rain rates from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and propose the rain rate as a parameter of the GMF. The analysis indicates the deficiency of the NSCAT2 GMF developed for the NASA scatterometer, which overestimates the ocean 0 for tropical cyclones and ignores the influence of rain. It is suggested that the QuikSCAT 0 is sensitive to the wind speed of up to about 40–50 ms . We introduce modifications to the NSCAT2 GMF and apply the modified GMF to the QuikSCAT observations of Hurricane Floyd. The QuikSCAT wind estimates for Hurricane Floyd in 1999 was improved with the maximum wind speed reaching above 60 m/s. We perform an error analysis by comparing the QuikSCAT winds with the analyses fields from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division (HRD). The reasonable agreement between the improved QuikSCAT winds and the HRD analyses supports the applications of scatterometer wind retrievals for hurricanes.	angular defect;castle of the winds;error analysis (mathematics);graphical modeling framework;ku band;microwave;radar	Simon H.

The technique is based on the tripolarimetric calibration technique of Gasiewski and Kunkee, but is extended to provide a means of calibrating all four Stokes parameters. The extension is facilitated using a biaxial phase-retarding microwave plate to provide a precisely known fourth Stokes signal from the Gasiewski–Kunkee (GK) linearly polarized standard. The relations needed to determine the Stokes vector produced by the augmented standard are presented, and the effects of nonidealities in the various components are discussed. The application of the extended standard to determining the complete set of radiometer constants (the calibration matrix elements) for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer in a laboratory environment is illustrated. A calibration matrix inversion technique and error analysis are described, as well. The uncertainties associated with practical implementation of the fully polarimetric standard for spaceborne wind vector measurements are discussed relative to error thresholds anticipated for wind vector retrieval from the U.S. National Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;end-to-end principle;error analysis (mathematics);microwave;navier–stokes equations;polarimetry;stokes parameters	Janne Lahtinen;Albin J.

a52e0565b16730fd9dbac2ca97e047055c95bb2c	a sparse dictionary learning method for hyperspectral anomaly detection with capped norm		Hyperspectral anomaly detection is playing an important role in remote sensing field. Most conventional detectors based on the Reed-Xiaoli (RX) method assume the background signature obeys a Gaussian distribution. However, it is definitely hard to be satisfied in practice. Moreover, background statistics is susceptible to contamination of anomalies in the processing windows, which may lead to many false alarms and sensitiveness to the size of windows. To solve these problems, a novel sparse dictionary learning hyperspectral anomaly detection method with capped norm constraint is proposed. Contributions are claimed in threefold: 1) requiring no assumptions on the background distribution makes the method more adaptive to different scenes; 2) benefiting from the capped norm our method has a stronger distinctiveness to anomalies; and 3) it also has better adaptability to detect different sizes of anomalies without using the sliding dual window. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the desirable performance of our method.	anomaly detection;machine learning;microsoft windows;sensor;sparse dictionary learning;sparse matrix	Dandan Ma;Yuan Yuan;Qi Wang	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127037	computer vision;artificial intelligence;anomaly detection;sparse matrix;adaptability;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;gaussian;pattern recognition	Vision	70.88584858699947	-65.48491125465794	9802
8a1a990fd8c86fb37389388d7e6a956a75a5ffd0	monitoring forest phenology and leaf area index with the autonomous, low-cost transmittance sensor pastis-57		Land Surface Phenology (LSP) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) are important variables that describe the photosynthetically active phase and capacity of vegetation. Both are derived on the global scale from optical satellite sensors and require robust validation based on in situ sensors at high temporal resolution. This study assesses the PAI Autonomous System from Transmittance Sensors at 57◦ (PASTiS-57) instrument as a low-cost transmittance sensor for simultaneous monitoring of LSP and LAI in forest ecosystems. In a field experiment, spring leaf flush and autumn senescence in a Dutch beech forest were observed with PASTiS-57 and illumination independent, multi-temporal Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) measurements in five plots. Both time series agreed to less than a day in Start Of Season (SOS) and End Of Season (EOS). LAI magnitude was strongly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98. PASTiS-57 summer and winter LAI were on average 0.41 m2 m−2 and 1.43 m2 m−2 lower than TLS. This can be explained by previously reported overestimation of TLS. Additionally, PASTiS-57 was implemented in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) model for sensitivity analysis. This confirmed the robustness of the retrieval with respect to non-structural canopy properties and illumination conditions. Generally, PASTiS-57 fulfilled the CEOS LPV requirement of 20% accuracy in LAI for a wide range of biochemical and illumination conditions for turbid medium canopies. However, canopy non-randomness in discrete tree models led to strong biases. Overall, PASTiS-57 demonstrated the potential of autonomous devices for monitoring of phenology and LAI at daily temporal resolution as required for validation of satellite products that can be derived from ESA Copernicus’ optical missions, Sentinel-2 and -3.	allocate-on-flush;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);bus bunching;coefficient;cost efficiency;eos;esa;ecosystem;experiment;least absolute deviations;maxima and minima;motorola canopy;pointing device;randomness;sampling (signal processing);sensor;terrestrial television;time series;viewing angle	Benjamin Brede;Jean-Philippe Gastellu-Etchegorry;Nicolas Lauret;Frédéric Baret;Jan G.

03965c36ada1a21186b5ba73e3864da5b78f17c5	temporal analysis of s-band microwave backscattering from an inland reservoir surface		This letter presents an analysis of the temporal characteristics of electromagnetic waves scattered from a time-varying reservoir surface at low grazing angles. The data collection campaigns were conducted using a polarimetric S-band radar at Wachusett Reservoir in MA, USA, and VV and HH polarized radar returns were simultaneously captured. The temporal behavior of the backscattering from the reservoir surface was analyzed for 180 distinct radar geometries, focusing in particular on the impact of polarization, radar geometry, and wind condition. To understand the shape of the Doppler spectrum, the power spectral density is estimated by a periodogram. In addition, decorrelation time, Doppler centroid, and variance are estimated and compared with the associated Doppler spectral width and peak Doppler frequency. Results show that Doppler spectral width, decorrelation time, and the standard deviation of Doppler spectra are correlated. In addition, the Doppler frequency shift induced by the motion of the water surface is analyzed by peak Doppler frequency and Doppler centroid, which show dependence on radar geometry and wind direction.	decorrelation;doppler echocardiography;doppler effect;freshwater ecosystem;microwave;polarimetry;polarization (waves);radar;spectral density estimation;verification and validation	James Park;Saba Mudaliar;Panos Tzanos;Kung-Hau Ding	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2792147	backscatter;remote sensing;mathematics;spectral width;radar;spectral line;doppler effect;spectral density;optics;doppler radar;polarization (waves)	Visualization	81.92457316004973	-65.83562142326664	9835

Hence, it is urgent to timely conduct geological survey in disastrous region and take necessary measures to treat identified hazards. Field survey is reliable but too expensive and time-consuming. Satellite or manned aerial remote sensing have the advantages of region-scale coverage and moderate timeliness, but restricted by the factors of mist, image resolution, human safety, and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is a very promising approach for rapid disaster investigation in regional scope, as giving consideration to both accuracy and spatial coverage. In this paper, we demonstrate our practice and experiences in applying UAVs in the survey of mountain hazards from the aspects of UAV customization and modification, UAV image pre-processing, and UAV imagery Interpretation.	aerial photography;image resolution;preprocessor;sensor;turbulence;unmanned aerial vehicle;user agent	Jiayuan Lin;Heping Tao;Yangchun Wang;Zhou Huang	2010	2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567777	geography;cartography;remote sensing	Robotics	80.3875646588655	-56.07652194166753	9849

A neural network is proposed to compensate the sensitive regions for image quality enhancement. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is superior to conventional methods in perceptual image quality as well as the clarity and the smoothness in edge regions of the resultant images.	algorithm;artificial neural network;fuzzy concept;human visual system model;image quality;impulse noise (audio);median filter;noise reduction;pixel;recursion (computer science);resultant	Shih-Mao Lu;Sheng-Fu Liang;Chin-Teng Lin	2006	J.

However, the effectiveness of this technology for archaeological prospection has so far not been fully assessed. In this study, an integrated single-date and multi-temporal SAR data-processing chain was proposed to sharpen archaeological signs and hence their detection and monitoring. In total, 14 scenes of X-band Cosmo-SkyMed, C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band PALSAR data covering the Western Regions of the Silk Road Corridor in China were employed for two important archaeological sites including the Yumen Frontier Pass with emerging archaeological traces and Niya ruins with subsurface remains. The results pointed out that single-date satellite radar data were useful for the identification of subsurface traces buried under desert in the landscape-scale, whereas for the identification of emerging monuments, Sentinel-1 was limited by its lower spatial resolution compared to TerraSAR and PALSAR data. Multi-date products, such as interferometric coherence, the averaged radar signatures and RGB multi-temporal composites, were effective to sharpen archaeological traces as well as for change detection in Yumen Frontier Pass. This study presents a pilot assessment of satellite SAR data for the analysis and monitoring of archaeological features in the predominantly arid-sandy environmental characteristic of investigated sites.

Then, we derive and apply the spatial-temporal reliability provided by the error approximation in video stitching.

The GF-4 satellite is the first geostationary orbit (GEO) optical remote sensing satellite with medium resolution in China. In this paper, a novel ship-tracking method in GF-4 satellite sequential imagery is proposed. The algorithm has three stages. First, a local visual saliency map based on local peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is used to detect ships in a single frame of GF-4 satellite sequential images. Second, the accuracy positioning of each potential target is realized by a dynamic correction using the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) and automatic identification system (AIS) data of ships. Finally, an improved multiple hypotheses tracking (MHT) algorithm with amplitude information is used to track ships by further removing the false targets, and to estimate ships’ motion parameters. The algorithm has been tested using GF-4 sequential images and AIS data. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the algorithm achieves good tracking performance in GF-4 satellite sequential images and estimates the motion information of ships accurately.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;coefficient;conflict (psychology);electronic health records;estimated;estimation theory;experiment;geographic coordinate system;geosynchronous satellite;image resolution;mhtml;machine learning;multiple myeloma;nuclear export signals;numerous;peak signal-to-noise ratio;polynomial;population parameter;psychotherapy, rational-emotive;revision procedure;satellite viruses;ships;signals intelligence;source code;videocassette	Libo Yao;Yong Liu;You He	2018		10.3390/s18072007	engineering;satellite;computer vision;electronic engineering;artificial intelligence	Vision	75.38639514395078	-68.89552635951128	9981
26f348c5722cb33f527c6cf16a31f55746e81ddf	deep-learning convolutional neural networks for scattered shrub detection with google earth imagery		There is a growing demand for accurate high-resolution land cover maps in many fields, e.g., in land-use planning and biodiversity conservation. Developing such maps has been performed using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods, which usually reach good accuracies, but require a high human supervision and the best configuration for one image can hardly be extrapolated to a different image. Recently, the deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding results in object recognition in the field of computer vision. However, they have not been fully explored yet in land cover mapping for detecting species of high biodiversity conservation interest. This paper analyzes the potential of CNNs-based methods for plant species detection using free high-resolution Google Earth images and provides an objective comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs, which are protected as a priority habitat under the European Union Habitats Directive. According to our results, compared to OBIA-based methods, the proposed CNNbased detection model, in combination with data-augmentation, transfer learning and pre-processing, achieves higher performance with less human ∗Both authors have contributed equally to this work 1 ar X iv :1 70 6. 00 91 7v 1 [ cs .C V ] 3 J un 2 01 7 intervention and the knowledge it acquires in the first image can be transferred to other images, which makes the detection process very fast.

9ec2a557a6e59f8cc56f70c8786ce11a9dfb6a91	spectral correlation analysis of chlorophyll-a concentration for inland water		Remote sensing technology shows huge potential in the fields of monitoring the quality of water. Concentration analysis on phytoplankton chlorophyll-a in inland water has become a research hotspot in remote sensing. The purpose of this paper is to calculate correlation between the chlorophyll-a concentration and reflectance data acquired from the terrain spectrometer. The same comparison is done on the concentration of turbidity. The spectral data is captured from four different location of Zhuolu county in Hebei Province through a terrain spectrometer ranging from 351nm to 960nm. The 1 nm spectral resolution provides the capability to estimate the maximum sensitivity spectral data of the chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentration. Besides comparing each singe band with the concentration of chlorophyll-a and turbidity, the combinations of two different spectrums are also analyzed to acquire the maximum sensitivity. The correlation between single band reflection and chlorophyll-a concentration is serious impacted by concentration of turbidity. Meanwhile the difference, ratio and sum-difference combination of two spectrum band combination has shown different response when compared with chlorophyll-a and turbidity. The band combination algorithm can abstract the chlorophyll-a concentration from turbidity. It is proved that high correlation coefficient can be found in specific wavelength regions through the difference reflection between (698∼701nm) and (673∼684nm), the ratio reflection between (662∼681nm) and (532∼588nm), and the sum-difference reflection between (662∼677nm) and (559∼588nm).	algorithm;coefficient;java hotspot virtual machine	Pu Huang;Gaojin Wen;Zhiming Shang;Chunxiao Zhang;Zhaorong Lin;Jiyou Zhang	2017	2017 10th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302033	computer vision;terrain;analytical chemistry;artificial intelligence;computer science;correlation coefficient;wavelength;ranging;correlation;turbidity;spectrometer;spectral resolution	ML	82.95791308770976	-60.236412139287886	10145

A special filter is used on top of regular R, G and B filters of a camera, replacing one of the two green filters, with one of them. This gives a six channel multispectral image. A normal RGB image is produced by the RGB filters. The corresponding filtered RGB image is obtained using the filtered RGB channels. The two images of a scene allow estimating the illuminant using the chromagenic illuminant estimation algorithm. The proposed system is thus capable of acquiring not only multispectral image but also normal RGB image, and at the same time capable of estimating the illuminant under which the image is captured. This makes the system useful in many applications in color imaging and computer vision. Simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system.	algorithm;bayer filter;computer vision;experiment;multispectral image;pixel;simulation	Raju Shrestha;Jon Y.

The first subproblem is to determine the area of a pixel covered by an object, and the second is to compute a convolution integral to determine the contribution that each object makes to the intensity of a pixel. We propose fast approximations to both processes. To solve the first, we define a class of approximations based on  coverage masks  to simplify area-coverage computations for the purposes of rendering based on area sampling. We then use coverage mask information to develop a table lookup technique to approximate convolution integrals.	convolution;sampling (signal processing)	Eugene Fiume	1991	CVGIP: Graphical Model and Image Processing	10.1016/1049-9652(91)90016-D	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer graphics (images)	ML	65.09300178653257	-53.40315267796165	10334

2a3c4b5d6e394950f34bb73be9f20f4e1699af12	an autofocus cartesian factorized backprojection algorithm for spotlight synthetic aperture radar imaging		A backprojection (BP) algorithm is recognized as an ideal method for high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Several fast BP algorithms have been developed to enhance the efficiency of the BP integral. The Cartesian factorized BP (CFBP) algorithm is proposed recently to avoid massive interpolations and improve the performance. However, integrating autofocus techniques with the CFBP has not been discussed. In this letter, an autofocus CFBP algorithm is proposed to compatibly combine the autofocus processing within the CFBP. After modifying the spectrum compression step in the CFBP, the approximate Fourier transformation (FT) relationship between the modified compensated subaperture images and the corresponding range-compressed phase history data in the Cartesian coordinate is revealed. The phase error is obtained by the multiple aperture map drift method, and the singular value decomposition total least square method is combined to improve the estimate robustness. Employing the range blocking method, the range variance of the phase error is compensated. The proposed algorithm inherits the advantages of the CFBP. Experiments performed by the X-band airborne SAR system with a maximum bandwidth of 1.2 GHz validate the proposed approaches.	airborne ranger;aperture (software);approximation algorithm;backpropagation;blocking (computing);dbpedia;dhrystone;experiment;image resolution;interpolation;singular value decomposition;synthetic data;transport layer security	Yongyao Luo;Fengjun Zhao;Ning Li;Heng Zhang	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2829483	artificial intelligence;computer vision;autofocus;cartesian coordinate system;interpolation;mathematics;fourier transform;aperture;singular value decomposition;algorithm;synthetic aperture radar;bandwidth (signal processing)	Robotics	75.87198668076923	-67.47410627984263	10420
f8ea0bf5bd8d20c6fbafa0ca20be1a9a54cb7eba	persistent scatterer clustering for structure displacement analysis based on phase correlation network		In this paper, we propose a persistent scatterer clustering method for high-resolution structure displacement analysis. Persistent scatterer interferometry can monitor millimetric displacement of structures like bridges, buildings, and roads by analysis at persistent scatterers (PSs), pixels with high coherence in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, it requires great time and effort to map PSs to the structures in actual geographical space because there are many PSs on SAR images. The proposed method makes this mapping easy by separating the PSs into clusters corresponding to the structures they belong to. The separation is based on a new evaluation index derived from the correlation of phase and distance on a SAR image to consider how likely PSs are on a single rigid structure. The evaluation index is used to construct minimum spanning tree of PSs, and the tree is separated into clusters corresponding to the structures. An experimental result shows that the proposed method can obtain clusters of structures having various shapes and sizes.	aperture (software);cluster analysis;displacement mapping;file spanning;holographic interferometry;image resolution;minimum spanning tree;phase correlation;pixel;synthetic data	Taichi Tanaka;Osamu Hoshuyama	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128030	artificial intelligence;computer vision;computer science;synthetic aperture radar;minimum spanning tree;pixel;cluster analysis;interferometry;phase correlation;coherence (physics);correlation	Embedded	74.58248684276472	-64.33270222158403	10426

In this paper, we propose a novel unified color transfer framework with corruptive artifacts suppression, which performs iterative probabilistic color mapping with self-learning filtering scheme and multiscale detail manipulation scheme in minimizing the normalized Kullback-Leibler distance. First, an iterative probabilistic color mapping is applied to construct the mapping relationship between the reference and target images. Then, a self-learning filtering scheme is applied into the transfer process to prevent from artifacts and extract details. The transferred output and the extracted multi-levels details are integrated by the measurement minimization to yield the final result. Our framework achieves a sound grain suppression, color fidelity and detail appearance seamlessly. For demonstration, a series of objective and subjective measurements are used to evaluate the quality in color transfer. Finally, a few extended applications are implemented to show the applicability of this framework.	color mapping;image editing;iterative method;kullback–leibler divergence;zero suppression	Zhuo Su;Kun Zeng;Li Liu;Bo Li;Xiaonan Luo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Multimedia	10.1109/TMM.2014.2305914	probability distribution;edge-preserving smoothing;computer vision;probability density function;machine learning;pattern recognition;probability;histogram;mathematics;iterative method;probabilistic logic;statistics	Visualization	57.82624893938078	-62.660787647250274	10440

Object detection in SAR images is a challenging task as these images are inherently affected with speckle noise. This paper presents a novel algorithm based on bandlet transform for object detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Here first a bandlet based despeckling scheme is employed on the input SAR image and then a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is used for object detection. The input image is first decomposed using Bandlet transform and the bandlet coefficients so obtained are modified using soft thresholding rule on all sub bands, except for low frequency sub band. The optimum thresholds for each sub bands are computed using generalized cross-validation (GCV) technique which doesn't require the information on noise variance of the input image. The method takes advantage of the geometrical features of bandlet transform for retaining the edges and boundaries of the objects present in SAR images while removing the speckle effectively. Thus CFAR detection on despeckled image can effectively find an optimum threshold for object detection to maintain a constant false alarm rate. The proposed Bandlet transform based scheme surpasses the traditional despeckling and object detection schemes in wavelet domain, in terms of numerical and visual quality.	object detection	Nithin Raj;R.

The study of these images are critical tools to the use of information from these observations, since they are one of the main ingredients for synthesis codes of extragalactic objects. In this thesis is used both synthetic and observed images. The VLBA images show 2-dimensional observations generated from complex 3-dimensional astrophysical processes. In this sense, one of the main difficulties of the models is the definition of parameters of functions and equations to reproduce macroscopic and dynamic physical formation events of these objects, so that images could be study reliably and on a large scale. One of the goals of this thesis is to elaborate a generic form of observations, assuming that the formation of these objects had origin directly by similar astrophysical processes, given the information of certain parameters of the formation events. The definition of parameters that reproduce the observations are key to the generalization formation of sources and extragalactic jets. Most observation articles have focus on few or even unique objects. The purpose of this project is to implement an innovative method, more robust and efficient, for modeling and rendering projects of various objects, such as the MOJAVE Project, which monitors several quasars simultaneously offering a diverse library for creating models (Quasars and Blazars: OVV and BL Lacertae). In this thesis was implemented a dynamic way to study these objects. Presents in this thesis the adaptation of the Cross-Entropy algorithm for the calibration of the parameters of astrophysical events that summarize the actual events of the VLBA observations. The development of the code of the adaptation structure includes the possibility of extension to any image, assuming that these images are dispose in intensities (Jy/beam) distributed in Right Ascension (AR) and Declination (DEC) maps. The 7 Synthesis codes are algorithms of equations reproducing the formation of astrophysical events which can be compared with observations. 8 The generalism applied in this work includes the study of objects with any morphology, no matter the distance or classification. 9 Quasars are astronomical objects with a massive galactic nucleus, being much larger than a star and smaller than a galaxy. The name is short for quase-stellar radio source (almost stellar radio source). 10 Blazars are active galaxies with active nucleus and great variation in the energy flow. 11 OVV is a blazar subtype, short for """"Optically violent variable"""", which can have variation in brightness of up to 50% in a single day, high polarization (HPQ) and dominant core. 12 BL Lacertae is also a blazer subtype characterized by rapid and large amplitude variation of flux density with significant optical polarization and strong emission lines (ANGEL; STOCKMAN, 1980). code is validating by searching for self-convergence to synthetic models with the same structure, i.e, realistics simulations of components ejection, in milliarcsecond, similar to the observations of the MOJAVE project in 15.3 GHz. With the use of the parameters major semiaxis, angle of position, eccentricity and intensity applied individually to each observed component, it was possible to calculate the structure of the sources, the velocities of the jets, as well as the conversion in flux density to obtain light curves. Through the light curve, the brightness temperature, the Doppler factor, the Lorentz factor and the observation angle of the extragalactic objects can be estimated with precision. The objects OJ 287, 4C +15.05, 3C 279 and 4C +29.45 are studied in this thesis due the fact that they have different and complex morphologies for a more complete study."""

For the second modelling scenario, we applied a two-stage upscaling approach: firstly AGB for the LiDAR transects were estimated and used then to calibrate satellite imagery. Furthermore, we propagated uncertainties from field measurements to LiDAR-derived AGB and to the national wall-to-wall forest AGB maps. The estimated AGB maps (NFI- and LiDAR-calibrated) showed similar goodness-of-fit statistics compared to the independent validation dataset. However, the AGB map based on two-stage up-scaling method (i.e., from field AGB to LiDAR and from LiDAR-AGB to satellite imagery) showed much higher uncertainties compared to the traditional field to satellite up-scaling.	airborne ranger;aperture (software);image scaling;map	Mikhail Urbazaev;Christian Thiel;Felix Cremer;Christiane Schmullius	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518957	remote sensing;transect;satellite;satellite imagery;synthetic aperture radar;lidar;computer science;ranging;forest inventory	Visualization	83.39790304975993	-60.27859395496643	10552

Spectra sets are clustered into groups of similar contexts using a random measure model. Then appropriate classifiers are constructed for each context. The resulting context-based classification algorithm constructed within the random set framework then aggregates the classifiers results in an ensemble-like fashion. Results indicate that the proposed approach performs well in the presence of contextual factors.	algorithm;horizontal situation indicator;rca spectra 70;rough set;shading	Jeremy Bolton;Paul D.

7175da75cc6ad6ab610e98cab3c310c81e991870	evaluation of dsc (digital still camera) scene analysis error metric: part i		A fundamental problem in digital photography is the estimation of scene colorimetry from raw DSC image data. Currently, a standard is under development in this area (ISO 17321-2). In the development of this standard, few subjective experiments have been carried out until now relating to the estimation of scene colorimetry from noncolorimetric raw data, where no assumptions are made concerning the spectral radiance correlation statistics of the scene. Furthermore, there is not much information available concerning whether it is appropriate to use some assumption about spectral radiance correlation statistics when the statistics of the actual natural scene are unknown. This paper presents the first part of a study involving psychophysical tests to answer the following questions that are essential for the specification of a scene analysis color space, and for the specification of methods for transforming raw DSC data into scene colorimetric data. 1. What is the most appropriate error metric to be used for the determination of transformations from raw DSC data to scene colorimetry estimates, when no assumptions are made concerning the scene spectral radiance correlation statistics? The crucial point is to find the error metric that corresponds best with human perception. 2. How does this new error metric compare to existing criteria, and how do the existing criteria compare to each other when used to determine transformations based on specified spectral radiance correlation statistics assumptions? 3. Given that optimal error metrics are used to determine transformations, how do several spectral radiance correlation statistics assumptions compare to each other and to the maximum ignorance case when applied to natural scenes where the actual statistics are unknown? Several of the transformation methods specified in ISO 17321, and other methods that are extensions of the 17321 methods were applied to raw data from two DSCs with different spectral sensitivity characteristics. These DSCs were used to capture images of a variety of natural scenes, and the resulting images were processed using the different characterization transforms based on different error metrics. Critical visual evaluation of the final images by expert observers was used to eliminate the obviously poor characterizations. Psychophysical experiments were conducted to differentiate the performance of the remaining candidates.	color space;digital camera;digital photography;experiment	Jack M. Holm;Ingeborg Tastl;Steven D.

Soft-decision-adaptive interpolation (SAI) is one of the state of the art image interpolation algorithms. However, SAI may produce serious artifacts in small-scale edge areas. Bicubic interpolation performs better in preserving the fidelity of small-scale edges. But, bicubic interpolation may cause zigzag and blurring artifacts around strong edges. The proposed method combines the advantages of SAI and Bicubic together through image fusion.

8d2e90ebac873a09ebcc92f62d5243f7712371bd	searching for the optimal sampling design for measuring lai in an upland rainforest	satellite	Leaf Area Index (LAI) and vegetation cover are important metrics for deriving structural information of forest ecosystems across multiple scales. Ground-based measurements of LAI are necessary for up-scaling to coarse resolution satellite products as well as for calibrating and validating such products derived from airborne and satellite remote sensing datasets, which are increasingly being used for forestry and ecosystem health applications across the globe. A crucial consideration when gathering field measurements is determining a suitable sampling design, which ensures the collection of representative measurements. In this study, we address this question by obtaining LAI measurements across the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) 25ha Robson Creek Supersite, which is representative of upland rainforests in Far North Queensland. The Robson Creek supersite contains over 200 species of woody vegetation and has one of the highest levels of biomass found in forest ecosystems globally. A variety of ad hoc and established sampling designs such as the State wide Land cover and Trees Survey (SLATS) and the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI) cross elementary sampling unit protocol were applied across the site. Measurements obtained from the ground-based sampling designs were then compared to measurements derived from satellite imagery (i.e., Landsat). Preliminary results indicate the measurements obtained from between-plot sampling designs were highly correlated and comparable. On the other hand, there was disagreement between the ground-based measurements and values estimated from the Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) satellite product. The study suggests that at least in dense canopy forests, different sampling designs will yield similar results. Consequently, the sampling strategy should ultimately be driven according to the desired spatial resolution of the final product.	airborne ranger;ecosystem;hoc (programming language);image scaling;intel turbo memory;motorola canopy;sampling (signal processing);terrestrial television	William Woodgate;Mariela Soto-Berelov;Lola Suárez;Simon D.

However, it has long been the authors' belief that optimal performance in cartographic feature extraction can be obtained only by the combination, or fusion, of feature extraction systems which use differing information sources and processing methods. This paper describes experiments on the pairwise fusion of cartographic feature extraction systems; surface material maps obtained from the classification of hyper-spectral imagery, digital elevation models derived from stereo panchromatic imagery, and three-dimensional (3D) building hypotheses generated from single panchromatic images. Fusion experiments were performed on three test areas and detailed evaluations conducted. The results showed that using surface material or stereo information to focus processing of the building extraction system led to significantly better overall performance and runtimes. Utilizing building hypotheses to refine material classification showed mixed results, due partially to residual registration errors.	cartography;feature extraction	David M. McKeown;Steven D.

In this article, an operational approach was proposed to evaluating LAI of summer maize for different cultivars under different nitrogen treatments and developmental stages by selecting ten familiar remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs). The result indicated that VIs had the potential for faithfully estimating LAI, and the estimation power of VIs for assessing LAI was best from bell stage to silking stage, which primarily depended on the LAI dynamic variation during the process of the growth. When the estimation power of VIs was systematically verified with the other independent data set, the VIs could accurately evaluate LAI. The ratio spectral index of R810 /R560 was the best index to estimate LAI, which was wondrously sensitive to LAI dynamic variation almost without the influence of cultivars, growth stages and nitrogen treatments. The exponential regression model for LAI based on R810/R560  was also established with a mean determination of coefficient (R 2) of 0.9573 (P value=0.01) and a mean root mean square error (RAISE) of 0.0365. Therefore, the spectral index of R810/R 560 could be considered as a sensitive indicator as LAI of summer maize	british national vegetation classification;coefficient;mean squared error;raise;time complexity	Changwei Tan;Wenjiang Huang;Liangyun Liu;Jihua Wang;Chunjiang Zhao	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1370025	hydrology;regression analysis;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	85.43486908579872	-60.09907511526808	10794

Three soil samples, selected to represent a variety of soil properties, were monitored as the samples progressed from fully saturated to air dry. Two water absorption band features in SWIR were observed and selected as metric to relate water content changes. Counterintuitively, band depth did not decrease monotonically during the whole drying process. Although the change in water absorption band depths with water content varied with the soil type, all curves could be represented by several linear segments that related to similar drying states independent of soil properties.	lambertian reflectance;stellar classification	Jia Tian;William Philpot	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729803	absorption;moisture;water;water content;hydrology;soil science;lighting;reflectivity;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	82.3599080023102	-59.82032650737927	10836

Our algorithm is based on the hypothesis that distortions affect flow statistics both locally and globally. To capture the effects of distortion on optical flow, we measure irregularities at the patch level and at the frame level. At the patch level, we measure intra- and inter-patch level irregularities in the flow magnitude's variance and mean. We also measure the correlation in the patch level flow randomness between successive frames. At the frame level, we measure the normalized mean flow magnitude difference between successive frames. We rely on the robust NIQE algorithm for no-reference spatial quality assessment of the frames. These temporal and spatial features are averaged over all the frames to arrive at a video level feature vector. The video level features and the corresponding DMOS scores are used to train a support vector machine for regression (SVR). This machine is used to estimate the quality score of a test video. The competence of the proposed method is clearly demonstrated on SD and HD video databases that include common distortion types such as compression artifacts, packet loss artifacts, additive noise, and blur.	algorithm;optical flow	K.

Tidal flat reflectance is sensitive to conditions that constantly change and cause variation of interstitial water contents along with exposure time, remnant water, etc. It is difficult to retrieve sediment grain size from optical reflectance alone without correcting the tidal condition effects. In this study, the tidal flat surface reflectance model according to grain size is proposed by two-step PCA transformation to remove tidal effects. The proposed method showed a potential to classify sediment by grain size regardless of exposure time and tidal conditions. We applied the method to nine scenes of LANDSAT TM images acquired between 1988 and 2009. The preliminary results well demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective to monitor changes of grain size distribution at a large scale independent of tidal conditions. However, this method has a limitation particularly over the vegetated areas and sand shoals mainly because of strong reflection in the NIR channels compared with other areas. For the validation, this study requires further field survey to obtain more in-situ data.	interstitial webpage	Wook Park;Yoon-Kyung Lee;Dong-Jae Kwon;Joong-Sun Won	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947449	geomorphology;geology;hydrology;remote sensing	EDA	82.28553459029169	-59.99790274993411	10885
3c60ecfe80d6d80f5a5d886a6a92384b9173d402	edge-based noise cleaning of chrominance information in color images.	color image	It is well known that noise cleaning a full-color image, as if it were a set of independent single-channel images, produces suboptimal results. Instead, it is generally recognized that transforming a color image into a luminance-chrominance space permits the use of simple and aggressive chrominance noise-cleaning operations that minimize degradation of luminance information. These chrominance noise-cleaning techniques usually consist of simple blurring operations that treat all but the lowest chrominance modulations as unwanted noise. While this is effective for noise cleaning high-frequency noise and aliasing artifacts, it can also cause color to bleed across sharp, colored edges in the image. This paper describes a noise-cleaning technique that incorporates edge detection into the chrominance blurring operation in order to prevent color bleeding at image edges. The approach is to first create a map of edge activity in the image and, during noise cleaning, to adaptively increase the noise-cleaning support region for each pixel location based on the local edge activity. By protecting edge fidelity in this manner, noise-cleaning techniques that might otherwise be too aggressive may be applied to the chrominance information. In particular, larger support regions can be used in portions of the image with lower spatial activity. Not only does this increase the effectiveness of reducing colored, highfrequency noise in an image, but it also permits the reduction of lower spatial frequency aliasing artifacts. Introduction One type of noise found in digital camera images appears as low-frequency, colored blobs in regions of low spatial frequency, for example, a person’s face. See Fig. 1. These blobs, a type of chroma noise, produce a mottled appearance in an otherwise spatially flat region. These colored blobs are irregularly shaped and are typically 5 to 25, or more, pixels wide in a given direction. There are numerous existing ways for reducing chroma noise in digital images. Among these are numerous patents that describe chroma noise reduction methods using optical blur filters. These devices frequently address only high frequency chroma noise and are generally ineffective against low frequency chroma noise. Figure 1. Example of chroma noise. Another very common approach to chroma noise reduction is to use standard grayscale image noise reduction techniques on each color channel of the image, in effect, treating each color channel as a separate grayscale image. By treating a full-color image as three, unrelated grayscale images, any interactions or correlations between the color channels are ignored. As discussed below, the inherent relationships between the color planes of a digital image can be used to perform more effective chroma noise cleaning, for example, by transforming the image into a different color space that permits an easier separation of image noise from genuine scene content. Some approaches deal specifically with digital image processing methods for reducing or removing chroma noise artifacts. One class of digital camera patents discloses improvements to the color filter array (CFA) interpolation operation to reduce or eliminate high frequency chroma noise artifacts.

It has been tested in different contexts, which span from home entertainment to surgical environments. Nonetheless, to promote its adoption to solve real-world problems, the Kinect should be evaluated in terms of precision and accuracy. Up to now, some filtering approaches have been proposed to enhance the precision and accuracy of the Kinect sensor, and preliminary studies have shown promising results. In this work, we discuss the results of a study in which we have compared the most commonly used filtering approaches for Kinect depth data, in both static and dynamic contexts, by using novel metrics. The experimental results show that each approach can be profitably used to enhance the precision and/or accuracy of Kinect depth data in a specific context, whereas the temporal filtering approach is able to reduce noise in different experimental conditions.	bilateral filter;curve fitting;depth map;glossary of computer graphics;high-level programming language;kinect;median filter;missing data;noise reduction;perceptual computing;pixel;stationary process	Kyis Essmaeel;Luigi Gallo;Ernesto Damiani;Giuseppe De Pietro;Albert Dipanda	2014	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-014-1982-6	median filter;computer vision;simulation;computer science;multimedia;bilateral filter	HCI	64.49298867904803	-62.677116081434335	10935

The metric used the contrast sensitivity function, along with an adapted error pooling, and proved to perform better than state-of-the-art OQMs. In this work, we intend to improve the performance of the CPA metric. The new metric includes the most important steps of Human Visual System (HVS) based quality metric, namely spatial frequency consideration and masking effects. Besides, this work goes further than classical image quality assessment, and several objective quality metrics will be tested in a watermarking algorithm comparison scenario. We will show that the proposed metric is both able to accurately predict the observers score in a quality assessment task, and is also able to compare watermarking algorithms altogether on a perceptual quality viewpoint.	algorithm;cost per action;digital watermarking;human visual system model;image quality;multi-purpose viewer	Vinod Pankajakshan;Florent Autrusseau	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2010.5651583	image quality;computer vision;peak signal-to-noise ratio;image processing;digital watermarking;computer science;data mining;mathematics;multimedia;spatial frequency;human visual system model;frequency domain	EDA	62.3533241866686	-63.95109147147495	10945

To achieve the best resolution, it needs many cameras to capture views simultaneously. This is however not cost-effective. To solve this problem, we take photographs around the object in a constant angle interval. After this, the object movie system is constructed in a manner of viewpoint synthesis from originally captured images. To further reduce the data requirements of the object movie, we propose a method to retain effective regions in each captured image. Only the retained regions are used to synthesize the resulting virtual views. Experiments show that our algorithm can synthesize virtual views better and faster than previous methods. The results also show that when an object movie is constructed from camera views with 10-degrees of angle interval, the effective region selection can reduce about 40% of pixels in multi-view representation while also keeping good synthesized quality.	quicktime vr	Wen-Nung Lie;Bo-Er Wei	2002		10.1109/ICIP.2002.1040004	computer vision;method;cost-effectiveness analysis;interpolation;computer science;virtual reality;multimedia;image segmentation;solid modeling;memory;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	60.476674435725805	-54.2481175314653	11028

Most reported noise filters can only reduce impulse noise or Gaussian noise but it is not effective for filtering real video captured by CCD-based camera. Those filters usually have a fatal drawback: they cause object-overlapped or object-blurred phenomenon in an image frame while an object is moving. To overcome such problems, the proposed strategy is that a frame will be divided into stationary and moving regions and then the appropriate filtering techniques for each region are employed. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can provide a filtering speed of at least 36% over other filters, in addition, it still gives a higher visual quality while keeping a moderate compressing ratio.	charge-coupled device;filter (signal processing);frame language;impulse noise (audio);noise reduction;object-based language;stationary process	Chao-Ho Chen;Zhi-Hong Lin;Chin-Hsing Chen;Cheng-Liang Kao	2007	Third International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP 2007)	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2007.19	gradient noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;computer vision;speech recognition;colors of noise;dark-frame subtraction;value noise;impulse noise;computer science;noise measurement;noise;compression ratio;noise reduction;noise floor;noise;salt-and-pepper noise	Robotics	57.816592308518445	-60.9589465068374	11169

However, systemic errors of this product have been reported, particularly for nonforest ecosystems. Here, we test a simple and operational way to estimate GPP in nonforest ecosystems by inverting the MODIS evapotranspiration (ET) product (MOD16) using ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE = GPP/ET) . Field measurements from 17 nonforest AmeriFlux sites of GPP were used for validation. Results show that the inverted GPP from MOD16 (MOD16 GPP) agrees better with the observed GPP than MOD17 does. The overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean bias of MOD16 GPP are 19.63 g C/m2/8-day and -4.06 g C/m2 /8-day, respectively, which are lower than the corresponding values of MOD17 GPP ( RMSE = 23.82 g C/ m2/8-day and mean bias = -9.07 g C/m2/8-day). This finding suggests the potential to achieve a better assessment of GPP for nonforest ecosystems with a fine resolution.	algorithm;ecosystem;graph partition;mean squared error;terrestrial television;wue	Yuting Yang;Huade Guan;Songhao Shang;Di Long;Craig T.

The watermarking scheme is based on the design of a color visual model that is the modification of a perceptual model used in the image coding of gray scale images. The model is designed to estimate and utilize the noise detection threshold of each wavelet coefficient in luminance and chrominance components in order to satisfy the transparency and robustness required by color image watermarking techniques. Besides the visual masking given by taking into account the luminance content and the texture, the crossed masking effect and the effect given by the variance within the local region of the target coefficient are investigated such that the estimated noise detection threshold is more close to the real noise detection threshold. In a locally adaptive fashion based on the wavelet decomposition, the thresholds of subband coefficients in each color component are derived to construct a perceptually lossless quantization matrix for embedding watermarks. Performance in terms of robustness and transparency is obtained by embedding the maximum strength watermark while maintaining the perceptually lossless quality of the watermarked color image. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is more robust than the existing schemes while retaining the watermark transparency.	coefficient;color image;color space;digital watermarking;grayscale;lossless compression;quantization (image processing);simulation;visual modeling;wavelet transform	Kuo-Cheng Liu	2009	2009 13th International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference	10.1109/IMVIP.2009.19	computer vision;speech recognition;pattern recognition;mathematics	Vision	57.981213633634184	-65.92449449414708	11269

In order to overcome the deficiencies well, we present an image fusion method based on a simple and effective evaluation of local contrast. Experimental results demonstrate that image fusion is a feasible solution to the deficiencies of image enhancement, because the deficiencies, like the loss of details, the loss of local contrast and gray-world violation, can be effectively reduced by fusing an enhancement result and an original image. & 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The other indicator is a geomorphological category of the area. This work shows that ground stoniness can be automatically predicted with practical accuracy. Northern forests have less biomass and foliage, thus direct analysis of stoniness is possible from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. A test set of 88 polygons covering 3.3 km2 was human-classified and a method was developed to perform the stoniness classification over this set. The local curvature of the surface is approximated directly from the point cloud data without generating the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The method performs well with area under curve AUC = 0.85 from Leave-Pair-Out cross-validation, and is rather insensitive to missing data, moderate forest cover and double-scanned areas.	airborne ranger;approximation algorithm;computation;cross-validation (statistics);digital elevation model;distributed computing;missing data;point cloud;python;sensor;space partitioning;statistical classification;test set;the forest	Paavo Nevalainen;Maarit Middleton;Ilkka Kaate;Tapio Pahikkala;Raimo Sutinen;Jukka Heikkonen	2015	2015 International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)	10.1109/IPTA.2015.7367215	histogram;mathematics;geographic information system;statistics	Robotics	79.88800557171001	-57.97553152977308	11329

The proposed regularizers involve the Schatten norms of the Hessian matrix, which are computed at every pixel of the image. They can be viewed as second-order extensions of the popular total-variation (TV) semi-norm since they satisfy the same invariance properties. Meanwhile, by taking advantage of second-order derivatives, they avoid the staircase effect, a common artifact of TV-based reconstructions, and perform well for a wide range of applications. To solve the corresponding optimization problems, we propose an algorithm that is based on a primal-dual formulation. A fundamental ingredient of this algorithm is the projection of matrices onto Schatten norm balls of arbitrary radius. This operation is performed efficiently based on a direct link we provide between vector projections onto norm balls and matrix projections onto Schatten norm balls. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through experimental results on several inverse imaging problems with real and simulated data.	algorithm;complement total hemolytic ch50:acnc:pt:ser/plas:qn;convex function;dual;hessian;inline linking;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;pixel;projections and predictions;semiconductor industry;well-posed problem	Stamatios Lefkimmiatis;John Paul Ward;Michael Unser	2013	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2237919	medical imaging;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;inverse problem;mathematics;geometry;television	ML	55.57131482377437	-73.24210078682347	11349

Teff is one of the most staple crops in Ethiopia and it is estimated that it made up to 20% of all cultivated area in Ethiopia. This research will focus on developing a new approach to produce accurate and reliable teff distribution estimates in Ethiopia using time series remotely sensed data and household survey data. The production information from household survey and census usually are collected at subnational level and it is hard to know how the crops are distributed within the administrative unit. On the other hand, time series remote sensing data can be applied successfully in land cover classification studies but it is usually hard to identify crop types and distribution at pixel level without high quality ground truthing datasets which is very costly to acquire in at large scale in developing countries. The proposed method investigates the possibility of combining both information from household crop information (e.g. production, area) and NDVI time series in order to improve the crop allocation at finer resolution at large scale. The method developed in this study shows that available household data and satellite imagery can be used in mapping teff area. Combing information from different sources, the teff density map could be produced at higher resolution.	display resolution;pixel;time series	Zhe Guo	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946889	remote sensing	HCI	81.03775046694918	-57.7459791319072	11438

The dielectric constant was also computed based on an established dielectric mixing model by using different assumptions about inclusion shape. Computations were based on detailed measurements and observations of ice physical properties and crystalline structure. Comparison between measurements and model results was conducted to identify working models for first-year and multiyear ice. For first-year ice, models that employ the assumption of vertically oriented brine pockets are applicable to columnar ice and those with the assumption of randomly oriented brine pockets are applicable to frazil ice. The validity of the models are established only for ice temperatures less than -8/spl deg/C. For multiyear ice, there is no need to account for air bubble shape. The coexistence of brine and air inclusions in multiyear pond ice makes it characteristically different from hummock ice. Best results for pond ice were obtained from a simple model that accounts only for volume fractions of inclusions, rather than their shape. Physical parameters that can be retrieved directly from the dielectric constant are salinity of first-year ice at temperatures below -15/spl deg/C and density of multiyear hummock ice. Detailed measurements of permittivity and loss of first-year and multiyear ice are presented along with some insight into interactions between the dielectric constant and physical parameters.	microwave	Mohammed Shokr	1998	IEEE Trans.

One of the bullet rosettes is a planar crystal with four branches, the other two are spatial rosettes with six and eight branches. Two orientation models are used, one represents highly oriented crystals for which side and vertical incidence directions are considered, and the other represents: randomly oriented crystals (the incidence direction does not affect this case). It is observed that the linear depolarization ratio (LDR), as well as the copolarized correlation coefficient (/spl rho//sub h/spl nu//), can be used to differentiate columns from planar (including plates and stellar crystals) and spatial crystals based on their values at vertical incidence or their trends as a function of the elevation angle. For the random orientation case, LDR and /spl rho//sub h/spl nu// can differentiate columns from spatial crystals (except for sizes larger than 1.2 mm at 220 GHz) but not from planar crystals. Furthermore, the elevation angle dependence of LDR and Z/sub DR/ (differential reflectivity) has the potential for differentiating columnar, planar, and spatial crystals for sizes from a few tenths of a millimeter to 2 mm at 220 GHz, and from about 1 to 2 mm at 94 GHz. At 35 GHz, spatial crystals smaller than 2-mm resemble spherical particles in terms of their Z/sub DR/ and LDR signatures. The results for high-density (0.9 g cm/sup -3/) and low-density (representing hollow crystals) crystal models show significant differences in the values of LDR, Z/sub DR/, /spl rho//sub h/spl nu//, and the backscattering cross sections.

We accelerate alignment of the images by introducing a lightweight camera motion representation called homography flow. The aligned images are then fused to create a denoised output with rapid per-pixel operations in temporal and spatial domains. To handle scene motion during the capture, a mechanism of selecting consistent pixels for temporal fusion is proposed to """"synthesize"""" a clean, ghost-free image, which can largely reduce the computation of tracking motion between frames. Combined with these efficient solutions, our method runs several orders of magnitude faster than previous work, while the denoising quality is comparable.

A single case of a water vapor profile retrieval using a combination of the SSM/T-2 on the DMSP satellite and cloud parameters from the AVHRR on the NOAA satellite retrieved a reasonable cloud base. While hardly definitive, this case is suggestive. Here, we examine the cloud base signal in a combination of the SSM/I and SSM/T-2 on the DMSP satellite from a theoretical point of view. It is shown that the signal is strong enough for a useful retrieval only over the ocean. For low altitudes, a cloud top temperature (CTT) constraint, as could be provided from an infrared radiometer, is required. While difficult with the DMSP-NOAA satellite combination, this has become much easier with the recent launch of NOAA-K with the AMSU-B and AVHRR. It is shown that the signal is acceptable over the relevant range of cloud liquid water content values. To achieve useful results, some local tuning of the algorithm will be necessary. This tuning could take the form of water vapor profile covariance matrices, climatological estimates of the cloud liquid water density, or purely empirical methods. Broken and multilayer clouds provide additional complications to the problem.	algorithm;microwave;point of view (computer hardware company)	Thomas Wilheit;Keith D. Hutchison	2000	IEEE Trans.

ffe0d96ba0030cd94cecbdb10dc28f28345e7db5	an improved image denoising method based on contourlet transform and neighshrink algorithm		It is important how to denoising while using images for non-destructive detection. In order to effectively remove image noise and preserve the good image detail, in this paper, a new improved image denoising method has been proposed based on Contourlet and NeighShrink. Firstly, the image of the Contourlet coefficients is obtained by the Contourlet transform. And then, the Contourlet coefficients are contracted by the neighbourhood shrinkage method. Lastly, the image is denoised by the inverse Contourlet transform. Taking elevator fault detection as a practical application example in the simulation study, the images of the elevator machine and the wire rope are denoised after greying. The detection images of traction motor and wire rope are analysed and compared with the different denoising method. The simulation experiments show that the improved algorithm can better protect the image details of the elevator machine and the wire rope, avoiding the Gibbs phenomenon.	algorithm;contourlet;noise reduction	Jian Liu;Tingting Li;Ke Xu;Song Bo Wei;Ling Chang	2018	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2018.10012775	image noise;contourlet;engineering;gibbs phenomenon;noise reduction;algorithm;fault detection and isolation;wire rope	Vision	55.4237930369572	-64.11471700928303	11754

Moreover, their ability to measure turbulence quantities is unsatisfactory for wind-energy applications. This paper presents results from a measurement campaign during which multiple WindScanners were focused on one point next to a reference mast in complex terrain. This multi-lidar (ML) technique is also compared to a profiling lidar using the Doppler beam swinging (DBS) method. Firstand second-order statistics of the radial wind velocities from the individual instruments and the horizontal wind components of several ML combinations are analysed in comparison to sonic anemometry and DBS measurements. The results for the wind speed show significantly reduced scatter and directional error for the ML method in comparison to the DBS lidar. The analysis of the second-order statistics also reveals a significantly better correlation for the ML technique than for the DBS lidar, when compared to the sonic. However, the probe volume averaging of the lidars leads to an attenuation of the turbulence at high wave numbers. Also the configuration (i.e., angles) of the WindScanners in the ML method seems to be more important for turbulence measurements. In summary, the results clearly show the advantages of the ML technique in complex terrain and indicate that it has the potential to achieve significantly higher accuracy in measuring turbulence quantities for wind-energy applications than classical profiling lidars.	direct-broadcast satellite;experiment;extrapolation;first-order predicate;profiling (computer programming);radial (radio);radio masts and towers;shattered world;sonic the hedgehog 3;transfer function;turbulence	Lukas Pauscher;Nikola Vasiljevic;Doron Callies;Guillaume Lea;Jakob Mann;Tobias Klaas;Julian Hieronimus;Julia Gottschall;Annedore Schwesig;Martin Kühn;Michael Courtney	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8090782	wind power;meteorology;turbulence;optics;ecology;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	81.21051552064974	-66.00194821321453	11824
094534e6cc197cc9505b65753c3268695a808c66	effective water surface mapping in macrophyte-covered reservoirs in ne brazil based on terrasar-x time series		Abstract Water supplies in northeastern Brazil strongly depend on the numerous surface water reservoirs of various sizes there. However, the seasonal and long-term water surface dynamics of these reservoirs, particularly the large number of small ones, remain inadequately known. Remote sensing techniques have shown great potentials in water bodies mapping. Yet, the widespread presence of macrophytes in most of the reservoirs often impedes the delineation of the effective water surfaces. Knowledge of the dynamics of the effective water surfaces in the reservoirs is essential for understanding, managing, and modelling the local and regional water resources. In this study, a two-year time series of TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data was used to monitor the effective water surface areas in nine reservoirs in NE Brazil. Calm open water surfaces were obtained by segmenting the backscattering coefficients of TSX images with minimum error thresholding. Linear unmixing was implemented on the distributions of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) variance in the reservoirs to quantify the proportions of sub-populations dominated by different types of scattering along the TSX time series. By referring to the statistics and the seasonal proportions of the GLCM variance sub-populations the GLCM variance was segmented to map the vegetated water surfaces. The effective water surface areas that include the vegetation-covered waters as well as calm open water in the reservoirs were mapped with accuracies u003e77%. The temporal and spatial change patterns of water surfaces in the nine reservoirs over a period of two consecutive dry and wet seasons were derived. Precipitation-related soil moisture changes, topography and the dense macrophyte canopies are the main sources of errors in the such-derived effective water surfaces. Independent from in-situ data, the approach employed in this study shows great potential in monitoring water surfaces of different complexity and macrophyte coverage. The effective water surface areas obtained for the reservoirs can provide valuable input for efficient water management and improve the hydrological modelling in this region.	time series	Shuping Zhang;Saskia Foerster;Pedro Medeiros;José Carlos de Araújo;Björn Waske	2018	Int.

We think that, up to now, this technique has not received the attention that it deserves. By a frequency-domain analysis we show that it can isotropically suppress those aliasing spectra that contribute most to the postaliasing effect. Furthermore, we present an efficient GPU implementation, which requires only six trilinear texture fetches per sample. Overall, we demonstrate that the trilinear interpolation on the BCC lattice is competitive to the linear box-spline interpolation in terms of both efficiency and image quality. As a generalization to higher-order reconstruction, we introduce DC-splines that are constructed by convolving a Discrete filter with a Continuous filter, and easy to adapt to the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice as well.	academy;aliasing;b-spline;box spline;bricx command center;cubic function;dc-to-dc converter;digital scholarship;domain analysis;eurographics;graphics processing unit;image quality;medical imaging;quintic function;spline (mathematics);spline interpolation;thinking outside the box	Balázs Domonkos;Balázs Csébfalvi	2010		10.2312/PE/VMV/VMV10/275-282	medical imaging;computer vision;cubic crystal system;monotone cubic interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;bicubic interpolation;trilinear interpolation;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	66.17385386531414	-53.38347130580414	11852

Generating 3D models from a sequence of raw HSI datacubes, where each image pixel retains its spectral content of the scene, significantly expands the analysis currently possible with HSI. In addition to traditional HSI anomaly detection and spectral matching, a 3D spatial model of the scene allows for additional viewing from pre- viously undefined viewpoints, digital elevation map generation, and en- hanced object classification capabilities. State-of-the-art SFM techniques are utilized and enhanced by leveraging the spectral content recorded at each image pixel.

It includes regularized clustering that assigns soft memberships to each pixel at a fine scale followed by a kernel regression that computes the value of the desired variable at all pixels. Coarse-scale remotely sensed SM was disaggregated from 10 to 1 km using land cover (LC), precipitation, land surface temperature, leaf area index, and in situ observations of SM. This algorithm was evaluated using multiscale synthetic observations in NC Florida for heterogeneous agricultural LCs. It was found that the rmse for 96% of the pixels was less than 0.02 m 3/m3. The clusters generated represented the data well and reduced the rmse by up to 40% during periods of high heterogeneity in LC and meteorological conditions. The Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the true SM and the disaggregated estimates is close to zero, for both vegetated and bare-soil LCs. The disaggregated estimates were compared with those generated by the principle of relevant information (PRI) method. The rmse for the PRI disaggregated estimates is higher than the rmse for the SRRM on each day of the season. The KLD of the disaggregated estimates generated by the SRRM is at least four orders of magnitude lower than those for the PRI disaggregated estimates, whereas the computational time needed was reduced by three times. The results indicate that the SRRM can be used for disaggregating SM with complex nonlinear correlations on a grid with high accuracy.	algorithm;aqua;cluster analysis;computation;heart rate variability;holism;image resolution;kullback–leibler divergence;machine learning;nonlinear system;peres–horodecki criterion;pixel;run time (program lifecycle phase);synthetic intelligence;time complexity;viz: the computer game	Subit Chakrabarti;Jasmeet Judge;Anand Rangarajan;Sanjay Ranka	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2547389	meteorology;data modeling;kernel;water content;hydrology;cluster analysis;remote sensing	ML	86.28135913068829	-60.97588154707452	11942

One of the principal goals of this network of radars, known as NetRad, is to improve the detection of tornadoes and locate accurately their centroid position. This paper presents data from the University of Massachusetts XPol radar, an X-Band, mobile unit with very similar characteristics to those of a NetRad unit, obtained from two tornadoes probed at close range on 12 May 2004 in Kansas, and a third tornado probed at further range on 29 May 2004. Reflectivity, differential reflectivity, Doppler velocity, Doppler spectrum width, differential phase and cross correlation coefficient magnitude are obtained, with the polarimetric fields showing evidence of a distinct tornado signature, dependent on the tornado strength, associated with the post-touchdown debris field. The high temporal and spatial resolution data from the tornadoes are used to simulate the radar echo characteristics at various ranges, to explore the characteristic features that will be used to detect and locate a tornado or track it.

Our algorithm first converts an input light field into a set of perspective-sheared focal stacks. It then applies 3D deconvolution to convert the focal stacks into z-stacks, and seam-carves the z-stack of the center perspective. The computed seams of the center perspective are sheared and applied to the z-stacks of all off-center perspectives. Finally, the carved z-stacks are converted back into the perspective images of the output light field. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to light-field retargeting. Unlike existing stereo-pair retargeting or 3D retargeting techniques, it does not require depth information.	algorithm;angularjs;deconvolution;focal (programming language);light field;retargeting;seam carving	Clemens Birklbauer;Oliver Bimber	2012	Comput.

The main limitation has been the lack of field samplings over space and time needed to calibrate and convert remote sensing measurements into aboveground biomass (AGB). As an alternative to costly field inventories, we examine the reliability of state-of-the-art lidar methods to provide direct retrieval of many forest metrics that are commonly collected through field sampling techniques (e.g., tree density, individual tree height, crown cover). AGB is estimated using existing allometric equations that are fed by lidar-derived metrics at either the individual treeor forest layer-level (for the overstory or underneath layers, respectively). Results over 40 plots of a multilayered forest located in northwest Portugal show that the lidar method provides AGB estimates with a relatively small random error (RMSE = of 17.1%) and bias (of 4.6%). It provides local AGB baselines that meet the requirements in terms of accuracy to calibrate satellite remote sensing measurements (e.g., the upcoming lidar GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation), and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions NISAR (National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Indian Space Research Organization SAR) and BIOMASS from the European Space Agency, ESA) for AGB mapping purposes. The development of similar techniques over a variety of forest types would be a significant improvement in quantifying CO2 stocks and changes to comply with the UN-REDD policies.	airborne ranger;crown group;esa;inventory;requirement;sampling (signal processing);spatial variability;tree (data structure);un-go episode:0 inga chapter	Antonio Ferraz;Sassan Saatchi;Clément Mallet;Stéphane Jacquemoud;Gil Rito Gonçalves;Carlos Alberto Silva;Paula Soares;Margarida Tomé;Luísa Gomes Pereira	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8080653	carbon;lidar;biomass;ecology;remote sensing	SE	83.50743220592159	-59.529505219223736	12090

For the materials we chose mutually very different materials, which we assume to represent canonical modes. The appearance of 3D objects consisting of any material can be described as linear superposition of 3D objects of different canonical materials, as in “painterly mixes”. In this paper we studied mixtures of matte, glossy and velvety objects, representing diffuse, forward and asperity scattering modes. Observers rated optical mixtures on four scales: matte-glossy, hard-soft, cold-warm, light-heavy. The ratings were done for the three combinations of glossy, matte, and velvety green birds. For each combination we tested 7 weightings. Matte-glossy ratings varied most over the stimuli and showed highest (most glossy) scores for the rather glossy bird and lowest (most matte) for the rather velvety bird. Hard-soft and cold-warm were rated highest (most soft and warm) for rather velvety and lowest (most hard and cold) for rather glossy birds. Light-heavy was rated only somewhat higher (heavier) for rather glossy birds. The ratings varied systematically with the weights of the contributions, corresponding to gradually changing mixtures of material modes. We discuss a range of possibilities for our novel setup.	matte display;optical fiber;superposition principle	Sylvia C. Pont;Jan J. Koenderink;Andrea J. van Doorn;Maarten W. A.

In particular, image fusion techniques were used to assess and monitor forests based on moderate resolution images of MODIS and TM data. The result showed that satellite image fusion could provide more spatial details and better spectral information compared with the original image and thus prove to be an excellent tool for monitoring carbon storage change for REDD.	elegant degradation;image fusion	Heli Lu;Guifang Liu;Zhong Huang;Wenlong Jin	2013	2013 21st International Conference on Geoinformatics	10.1109/Geoinformatics.2013.6626185	environmental science;hydrology;forestry;remote sensing	Robotics	81.13087728376362	-57.84612716165021	12146
3c30839686e9357dec913ea8497720f10fec96c6	a novel modified omega-k algorithm for circular trajectory scanning sar imaging using series reversion	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	This article presents a modified Omega-K algorithm for circular trajectory scanning synthetic aperture radar (CTSSAR) imaging. Due to the curvature of circular trajectory, it is difficult to have access to the two-dimensional frequency spectrum for CTSSAR via the principle of stationary phase (POSP), as conventional SAR imaging methods RD and CS. Herein, the analytic point target spectrum is first derived by series reversion and the POSP, based on which a modified Omega-K algorithm is developed to focus data accurately. The accuracy can be controlled by keeping enough terms in the two series expansions so that a well-focused image can be achieved with a proper range approximation. After detailed analyses and experiments, the fourth-order approximation is proved to be the best choice. Furthermore, the computational efficiency is evaluated by comparing the given method with the back projection algorithm and other methods with different approximated orders. The proposed algorithm is verified to be the best one in terms of computational burden. A well-focused image is obtained by simulations, validating the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.	approximation algorithm;computation;experiment;omega;reversion (software development);ruby document format;simulation;spectral density;stationary process;synthetic data	Yi Liao;Meng-dao Xing;Lei Zhang;Zheng Bao	2013	EURASIP J.

Joint simulation is one way to find the sensitive optical wavelength or microwave frequency of the unified canopy scene. Due to the inputs of the optical and microwave model are different, in the paper, three intermediate models were used to achieve the integration of critical inputs for joint simulation. They were leaf radiative transfer model PROSPECT, exponential soil reflectance model, and a transforming model. The simulation results indicated that BRFλ680 and BRFλ660 were sensitive to LAI when it is lesser than 3.5, while Sigma0X-band, VV and Sigma0C-band, HH were sensitive to LAI when it is between 3.5 and 6. Besides, Sigma0X-band, HH can reflect LWC variation independent on structural parameters.	backscatter (email);bidirectional reflectance distribution function;coefficient;jaccard index;microwave;mike lesser;motorola canopy;simulation;time complexity;verification and validation	Hejuan Du;Le Yang;Qinhuo Liu	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049500	crop;radiative transfer;water content;hydrology;sensor;mathematical model;leaf area index;reflectivity;light scattering;optics;scattering;atmospheric radiative transfer codes;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Robotics	85.1315859587244	-61.96997924658069	12176

As the human visual system (HVS) is critical to visual perception, modeling of the HVS is regarded as the most suitable way to achieve perceptual quality predictions. Sparse coding that is equivalent to independent component analysis (ICA) can provide a very good description of the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex, which is the most important part of the HVS. With this inspiration, a quality metric called sparse feature fidelity (SFF) is proposed for full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) on the basis of transformation of images into sparse representations in the primary visual cortex. The proposed method is based on the sparse features that are acquired by a feature detector, which is trained on samples of natural images by an ICA algorithm. In addition, two strategies are designed to simulate the properties of the visual perception: 1) visual attention and 2) visual threshold. The computation of SFF has two stages: training and fidelity computation, in addition, the fidelity computation consists of two components: feature similarity and luminance correlation. The feature similarity measures the structure differences between the two images, whereas the luminance correlation evaluates brightness distortions. SFF also reflects the chromatic properties of the HVS, and it is very effective for color IQA. The experimental results on five image databases show that SFF has a better performance in matching subjective ratings compared with the leading IQMs.	area striata structure;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;body dysmorphic disorders;cns disorder;computation (action);detectors;dictionary [publication type];distortion;evaluation;fastica;feature model;glomerulonephritis sparse hair telangiectases;grayscale;human visual system model;image quality;image quality:type:point in time:cardiac echo imaging device:narrative:ultrasound;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;lepista saeva;matching;mav protocol;machine learning;mental orientation;neural coding;published database;simulation;sparse matrix;vision;visual cortex;algorithm;brightness;negative regulation of translational fidelity;vetispiradiene synthase activity	Hua-wen Chang;Hua Yang;Yong Gan;Ming-hui Wang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2266579	independent component analysis;computer vision;feature detection;visual perception;feature extraction;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;feature;brightness	Vision	62.092622738936356	-65.38842101733184	12294

In this paper we investigate the capabilities of Sentinel-1 to soil moisture states. Aspects of modeling the map of soil moisture by the radar scene from Sentinel-1 on the example of a territory having undergone intensive precipitation have been considered. Representations of the territory with the radar and multispectral imaging are compared. Besides the meteorological satellite images and data of weather stations, additional verifying multispectral space images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A were used. With the use of the obtained empirical model it became possible to build maps of soil moisture of the research territory for different times.	map;multispectral image;radar	Igor N.

Time series of dual-pol TerraSAR-X images have been acquired during the whole cultivation period over a rice site in Spain. Among different observations, the backscattering coefficients at HH and VV channels and the HH/VV ratio have confirmed to show a temporal variation that has a significant correlation with the development of the plants during the vegetative and reproductive phenological phases. In addition, the information content of the HHVV complex coherence and a dual polarimetric target decomposition is investigated and discussed. All the information layers investigated are contributing to the discrimination of rice fields from other crop types. Finally, interferograms computed with pairs of successive images (11 days separation) have been preliminary tested.	coefficient;coherence (physics);persistent vegetative state;polarimetry;self-information;time series;verification and validation	Juan M.

This results in filters suitable for nonlinear problems whose solutions exhibit moving coherent features, such as thin interfaces in wildfire modeling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common state with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a residual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only gridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified by the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of the registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses intermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the states.	coherence (physics);ensemble kalman filter;image processing;morphing;nonlinear system;wildfire modeling	Jonathan D.

However, because of the complicated appearance of the nature, it is difficult to find a spatial regularity that only relates to landslides, thus landslides detection based on only spatial information or artificial features usually performs poorly. In this paper, an automated landslides detection approach that is aiming at mountain cities has been proposed based on pre- and post-event remote sensing images, it mainly utilizes the knowledge of landslide-related surface covering changes, and makes full use of the temporal and spatial information. A change detection method using Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) was introduced to extract the areas where drastic alterations have taken place; then, focusing on the changed areas, the Spatial Temporal Context Learning (STCL) was conducted to identify the landslides areas; finally, we use slope degree which is derived from digital elevation model (DEM) to make the result more reliable, and the change of DEM is used for making the detected areas more complete. The approach was applied to detecting the landslides in Shenzhen, Zhouqu County and Beichuan County in China, and a quantitative accuracy assessment has been taken. The assessment indicates that this approach can guarantee less commission error of landslide areal extent which is below 17.6% and achieves a quality percentage above 61.1%, and for landslide areas, the detection percentage is also competitive, the experimental results proves the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach for the detection landslides in mountain cities.	artificial neural network;convolution;digital elevation model;extraction;guided imagery;landslides;large;learning disorders;neural network simulation;numerous;occur (action);sensor	Zhong Chen;Yifei Zhang;Chao Ouyang;Feng Zhang;Jie Ma	2018		10.3390/s18030821	temporal context;convolutional neural network;engineering;remote sensing;spatial analysis;landslide;change detection;digital elevation model	Vision	81.64788651851859	-55.160912706378014	12369

OCO-2 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 2 July 2014, and joined the 705 km Afternoon Constellation a month later. Its primary instrument, a 3-channel imaging grating spectrometer, was then cooled to its operating temperatures and began collecting about one million soundings over the sunlit hemisphere each day. As expected, about 13% of these measurements are sufficiently cloud free to yield full-column estimates of the columnaveraged atmospheric CO2 dry air mole fraction, XCO2. After almost a full year in orbit, the XCO2 product is beginning to reveal some of the most robust features of the atmospheric carbon cycle, including the northern hemisphere spring drawdown, and enhanced values co-located with intense fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions.

However, the TGV regularization model tends to blur edges as the existence of high-order derivative. In order to avoid the staircase effect while alleviating the edge blurring, an iterative reweighted TGV based Poisson noise removal model is presented under the assumption that each pixel of noisy image follows a Poisson distribution. The weight function incorporated in the TGV regularization term is derived from the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We design a new iterative weighted primal-dual algorithm, which is an improvement of the classic iterative reweighted algorithm. Numerical experimental results show the better performance of our model in removing noise effectively while preserving edges and eliminating staircase effect.	algorithm;convex optimization;iterative method;iteratively reweighted least squares;map	Xu-Dong Wang;Xiangchu Feng;Weiwei Wang;Wen-Juan Zhang	2013	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2013.07.090	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;expectation–maximization algorithm;shot noise;mathematics;quantum mechanics;statistics	Robotics	56.27605383377141	-71.09440901976329	12498
2dc45c0e920dda748c6500da9bfdc8e185704ce3	impacts of dem geolocation bias on downward surface shortwave radiation estimation over clear-sky rugged terrain: a case study in dayekou basin, china		Accurately estimating the spatial–temporal distribution of downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) is essential for terrestrial ecological modeling and climate change research. The accurate georegistration of digital elevation model (DEM) has become one of the significant bottlenecks for improving the DSSR accuracy over rugged terrain. To clearly understand and quantitatively evaluate the impact of geolocation bias on the DSSR estimation under clear sky, this letter conducts a systematical simulation research in Dayekou Basin of China based on a developed remote sensing satellite-based DSSR estimation scheme over rugged terrain. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately capture the high temporal and spatial heterogeneities of DSSR, and the DSSR estimations are sensitive to geolocation bias. When the horizontal bias is lower than half a pixel, the deviations of the direct radiation could lead to above 600 W/m2 due to the illumination angle effects and shadow effects. The consequence of the bias on the diffuse and reflected radiation from adjacent terrains is little because of their relatively small values and low-spatial heterogeneities under clear sky in general except for the deep valley areas. The trends of the total radiation errors with the geolocation bias are identical in different days (scenes), and the error is related to the solar zenith angle. In addition, the more rugged the terrain, the greater the influence of geolocation bias on the radiation accuracy.

42acf8b82b286330d3aa42c6de574e0a7597f045	desertification susceptibility mapping using logistic regression analysis in the djelfa area, algeria		The main goal of this work was to identify the areas that are most susceptible to desertification in a part of the Algerian steppe, and to quantitatively assess the key factors that contribute to this desertification. In total, 139 desertified zones were mapped using field surveys and photo-interpretation. We selected 16 spectral and geomorphic predictive factors, which a priori play a significant role in desertification. They were mainly derived from Landsat 8 imagery and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM). Some factors, such as the topographic position index (TPI) and curvature, were used for the first time in this kind of study. For this purpose, we adapted the logistic regression algorithm for desertification susceptibility mapping, which has been widely used for landslide susceptibility mapping. The logistic model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The model accuracy was 87.8%. We estimated the model uncertainties using a bootstrap method. Our analysis suggests that the predictive model is robust and stable. Our results indicate that land cover factors, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rangeland classes, play a major role in determining desertification occurrence, while geomorphological factors have a limited impact. The predictive map shows that 44.57% of the area is classified as highly to very highly susceptible to desertification. The developed approach can be used to assess desertification in areas with similar characteristics and to guide possible actions to combat desertification.	logistic regression	Farid Djeddaoui;Mohammed Chadli;Richard Gloaguen	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9101031	remote sensing;normalized difference vegetation index;geology;logistic regression;shuttle radar topography mission;land cover;receiver operating characteristic;topographic map;desertification;digital elevation model	HCI	81.90009321577249	-56.056662436803514	12603

That d ata-set is currently being used to develop multivariate regression models which link the inter -y ar GPP variations of five forest types (white fir, beech, chestnut, deciduous and evergree n oaks) to seasonal values of temperature and precipitation. The five models obtained, which explain from 52% to 88% of the interyear GPP variability, are then applied to predict t he effects of expected environmental changes (+2 °C and increased CO 2 concentration). The results show a variable respon e of forest GPP to the simulated climate change, dependi ng on the main ecosystem features. In contrast, the effects of increasing CO 2 concentration are always positive and similar to th ose given by a combination of the two environmental fac tors. These findings are analyzed with reference to previous studies on the subject, parti cularly concerning Mediterranean environments. The analysis confirms the plausibilit y of the scenarios obtained, which can cast light on the important issue of forest carbon pool variations under expected global changes.

2009bc3eefd1e858f6f801a87334038ab26221b1	"""implementation of the """"non-local bayes"""" (nl-bayes) image denoising algorithm"""		This article presents a detailed implementation of the Non-Local Bayes (NL-Bayes) image denoising algorithm. In a nutshell, NL-Bayes is an improved variant of NL-means. In the NLmeans algorithm, each patch is replaced by a weighted mean of the most similar patches present in a neighborhood. Images being mostly self-similar, such instances of similar patches are generally found, and averaging them increases the SNR. The NL-Bayes strategy improves on NL-means by evaluating for each group of similar patches a Gaussian vector model. To each patch is therefore associated a mean (which would be the result of NL-means), but also a covariance matrix estimating the variability of the patch group. This permits to compute an optimal (in the sense of Bayesian minimal mean square error) estimate of each noisy patch in the group, by a simple matrix inversion. The implementation proceeds in two identical iterations, but the second iteration uses the denoised image of the first iteration to estimate better the mean and covariance of the patch Gaussian models. A discussion of the algorithm shows that it is close in spirit to several state of the art algorithms (TSID, BM3D, BM3D-SAPCA), and that its structure is actually close to BM3D. Thorough experimental comparison made in this paper also shows that the algorithm achieves the best state of the art on color images in terms of PSNR and image quality. On grey level images, it reaches a performance similar to the more complex BM3D-SAPCA (no color version is available for this last algorithm). Source Code The ANSI C implementation of NL-Bayes image denoising algorithm has been peer reviewed and accepted by IPOL. The source code, the code documentation, and the online demo are accessible at the IPOL web page of this article1.	ansi c;algorithm;grayscale;image quality;iteration;mean squared error;nl (complexity);noise reduction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;self-similarity;software documentation;spatial variability;web page	Marc Lebrun;Antoni Buades;Jean-Michel Morel	2013	IPOL Journal	10.5201/ipol.2013.16	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;data mining	ML	60.87703585734642	-73.88496552056029	12635
ede3362ebb5c77113df04623113e14eedb1702c2	thin cloud detection using spectral similarity in coastal and blue bands of landsat-8 data		With the assumption that spectral characteristics of coastal band (Band 1) and blue band (Band 2) of Landsat-8 were similar in a cloud-free area, an algorithm to detect thin clouds was derived. The assumption and algorithm was evaluated using Landsat-8 data of p14/r36 acquired on 1 April 2014. First, the assumed spectral similarity of Bands 1 and 2 was validated in the cloud-free area. The similarity was adversely affected once there was cloud (over the area). Second, the algorithm was applied to detect thin clouds in a full scene of Landsat-8 image. Visual comparison with the true color composite, the detected and observed clouds were very similar spatially. Next, the spatial correlation coefficient of the detected could image and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data of Band 9 of Landsat-8 was computed. The coefficient was 0.9604. Finally, with the least-squared-fit analysis, R2 value of 0.9223 was obtained. Since the interrupt of the least-squared-fit equation was −0.0003 or close to 0, there was the simple ratio relationship of the detected cloud and reflectance value of Band 9. Thus, the algorithm was not only able to detect thin clouds, but also to assess them quantitatively.	algorithm;cloud computing;coefficient;color depth;tag cloud;time of arrival;visual comparison	Haitao Lv;Yong Wang;Yuanyuan Yang	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128045	artificial intelligence;computer vision;remote sensing;computer science;spatial correlation;reflectivity;visual comparison;cloud computing	Vision	83.14264458523726	-61.390593507879295	12637

Inspired by the binocular rivalry mechanism, the observation annoyance perception is explained as a bargain process. Game theory is exploited to model the rivalry of the left eye and right eye. The relation between annoyance perception with binocular disparity is further demonstrated and an annoyance map is calculated to simulate the observer perception. Then, with the consideration of the properties of HVS, the edge map and a saliency map are used to adjust the annoyance map. Finally, Minkowski pooling and multi-scale strategy are applied to compute the final score. We use the EPFL database to validate the proposed metric. The experimental results show that the final objective scores have a high degree of consistency with the subjective scores.	bargain buddy;binocular disparity;binocular vision;distortion;game theory;human visual system model;image quality;minkowski addition;noise reduction;pixel;rapid refresh;simulation;stereoscopy	Feng Jiang;K.

We made reconstructed texture model patterns from the analyzed data of color patches in landscape images. Each reconstructed patterns were evaluated by subjects to find out good methods to reproduce atmosphere of the landscape. The results suggest that global texture of whole image create an atmosphere or a global impression of the landscape images and the patterns made by the methods which consider both position and shape of color patches got relatively high score.

In our approach, by introducing the notion of the global slope, block slope and local slope, a novel linear projection operator is induced. The operator makes the block slopes of two adjacent blocks be equal to the global slope, to alleviate the blocking artifact, while maintaining the local slopes inside the blocks, to preserve most original high frequency components. Computer simulation results on still and moving images show that in the viewpoint of the objective and the subjective quality, the proposed algorithm makes decoded images converge without iteration to the post-processed images, in which the blocking artifact is alleviated effectively, while the conventional algorithms based on the POCS converge with a number of iterations.	iterative method;video post-processing	Hoon Paek;Jong Wook Park;Sang Uk Lee	1995		10.1109/ICIP.1995.537617	computer simulation;computer vision;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;transform coding;degradation;low-pass filter;projection;computer science;cutoff frequency;high frequency;mathematics	Vision	57.508450226335896	-63.30145524262403	12730

Precise loss assessment is an effective method to alleviate the loss. The inundated area, on which loss evaluation is based, is the most fundamental element to evaluate the loss caused by floods, and is a critical step to control the precision of the loss evaluation. This study focuses on several factors which are crucial to the automatic extraction of inundated areas in the process of disaster monitoring, and performs the test and precision appraisal of the remote sensing monitoring process aiming at the same study area and the same disaster event, and promotes the precision and credibility of remote sensing monitoring. It has been concluded that spatial resolution, ground scale, and boundary complexity of inundated area are three important factors that cause the uncertainty of the flood loss assessment using remotely sensed data.	effective method	Cong Du;Fuli Yan;Jing Liu	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/IGARSS.2006.276	disaster;uncertainty analysis;resolution;image resolution;uncertainty;feature extraction;natural disaster;hydrology;computer science;specific absorption rate;statistics;remote sensing	Arch	81.36657131112096	-55.73308075480372	12838
bf2c3a558c5ee0e48b445008d25d32b345df95a6	cross-track stereovision using aster		Advanced spaceborne thermal emission radiometer (ASTER) has been used to obtain global digital elevation models (DEMs) that cover all over the world using along-track stereovision; however, the coupling of nadir- and backward-observation is not free from some occlusion areas. Moreover, DEMs derived from optical stereovision suffer from voids due to clouds and shadows. Therefore, stereo pairs obtained from different cross-track pointing angles are investigated to obtain DEMs, which is called cross-track stereovision. Although DEMs by cross-track stereovision is produced by images acquired on different dates, the quantitative agreement is obtained, which shows that the cross-track stereovision is promising for DEM generation to fill the voids in global DEMs. Furthermore, DEMs obtained by cross-track thermal stereovision of ASTER are compared with that by along-track stereovision. Thermal infrared radiometer has an advantage of radiation measurement, which enables nighttime observation. These results show that further improvement in DEMs derived from ASTER is possible by increasing the number of possible stereo pairs.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;data acquisition;digital elevation model;stereopsis	Akira Iwasaki;Mario Rodriguez	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128384	radiometer;computer vision;radiometry;artificial intelligence;remote sensing;infrared;computer science;nadir;synthetic aperture radar;aster (genus);radiation;digital elevation model	Robotics	79.63637112038084	-64.82377421747339	12868

The overall procedure flow of our unified framework contains superpixel pre-segmentation, color contrast and color distribution computation, combination, final refinement and then object segmentation. During color contrast saliency computation, we combine two color systems and then introduce the using of distribution prior before saliency smoothing. It works to select correct color components. In addition, we propose a novel saliency smoothing procedure that is based on superpixel regions and is realized in color space. This processing step leads to total object being highlighted evenly, contributing to high quality color contrast saliency maps. Finally, a new refinement approach is utilized to eliminate artifacts and recover unconnected parts in the combined saliency maps. In visual comparison, our method produces higher quality saliency maps which stress out the total object meanwhile suppress background clutters. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show our approach outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest precision rate 96% (3% improvement from the current highest), when evaluated via one of the most popular data sets [1]. Excellent content-aware image resizing also can be achieved with our saliency maps.	object detection	Keren Fu;Chen Gong;Jie Yang;Yue Zhou	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37331-2_9	color histogram;computer vision;machine learning;mathematics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.2347979368944	-60.623507583223464	12895

Measured parameters include topography, temperature, water vapour, electron temperature and density, and the strength of the gravity and magnetic fields, to mention just a few. Directional derivatives and sunshading are powerful tools for enhancing linear features in raster datasets. This paper demonstrates modified directional derivative and sunshading algorithms that take into account the curved geometry on the surface of the sphere, and hence are able to be used with global datasets (assuming the Earth or other body to be a sphere). The algorithms can either be used to enhance any linear features (i.e. great circles) than pass through a chosen point, or to attenuate them. They can also be used to enhance small circles of any radii centred on a given point, or to attenuate them.

Our feature extraction can be done directly to JPEG compressed images. We extract two features, DC feature and AC feature, from a JPEG compressed image. Then we measure the distances between the query image and the images in a database in terms of these two features. Our image retrieval system will give each retrieved image a rank to define its similarity to the query image. Furthermore, instead of fully decompressing JPEG images, our system only needs to do partial entropy decoding. Therefore, our proposed scheme can accelerate the work of retrieving images. According to our experimental results, our system is not only highly efficient but is also capable of performing satisfactorily. q 2003 Elsevier B.V.

For this, we introduce two constant luminance HDR video coding pipelines, which convert the source video to linear  $Y u^\prime v^\prime $ . A content dependent scaling of the chromaticity components serves as color quality parameter. This reduces perceivable color artifacts while remaining fully compatible with core High Efficiency Video Coding or other video coding standards. One of the pipelines further combines the scaling with a dedicated chromaticity transform to optimize the representation of the chromaticity components for encoding. We validate both pipelines with subjective user studies in addition to an objective comparison to the other state-of-the-art methods. The user studies show a significant improvement in perceived color quality at medium to high compression rates without sacrificing luminance quality compared with current standard coding pipelines. The objective evaluation suggests that both pipelines perform at least comparable to the current state-of-the-art methods.

Current image mosaicing techniques tend to fail when there is extreme parallax caused by nearby objects or moving objects at the boundary between images. This parallax causes ghosting or unnatural discontinuities in the image. To address this problem, we present an image mosaicing algorithm that is robust to parallax and misalignment, and is also able to preserve the important human-centric content, specifically faces. In particular, we find an optimal path between the boundary of two images that preserves color continuity and peoples' faces in the scene. Preliminary results show promising results of preserving close-up faces with parallax while also being able to generate a perceptually plausible 360° panoramic image.	algorithm;image stitching;parallax;rollover (key);scott continuity	Tomohiro Ozawa;Kris Makoto Kitani;Hideki Koike	2012		10.1145/2160125.2160145	corner detection;computer vision;geography;image processing;image stitching;optics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.518752089778815	-56.28325042330115	13136
7f2da96fd2a462b53f9f24a0d7947dbf1fe41390	assessment of multi-scale drought datasets to quantify drought severity and impacts in agriculture: a case study for slovenia		Real-time information on the development of the drought conditions is one of the fundamental requisites for reinforcing the drought mitigation and preparedness. The EuroGEOSS interoperability approach promotes the development of monitoring and early warning systems based on real-time information. Different climatic databases, which are based on publicly available meteorological information, are available on real time by climatic research institutions. Commonly, publicly available information has much lower spatial resolution than the existing available national datasets. The capability of low resolution climatic datasets to quantify drought severity and drought impacts is limited and has therefore been analysed in the framework of the EuroGEOSS project. Initial operating capacity, which was built during the project, provided the framework for the analysis. The Standardized Precipitation Index, obtained from the lowresolution precipitation datasets, has been compared to the national highresolution datasets in Slovenia. The areas of low spatial agreement between different drought datasets were determined.

Remotely-sensed Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) are promising predictors for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) by offering an early and integrative response of vegetation performance to environmental drivers. Species of high conservation concern would benefit the most from a better ability to anticipate changes in habitat suitability. Here we illustrate how yearly projections from SDMs based on EFAs could reveal short-term changes in potential habitat suitability, anticipating mid-term shifts predicted by climate-change-scenario models. We fitted two sets of SDMs for 41 plant species of conservation concern in the Iberian Peninsula: one calibrated with climate variables for baseline conditions and projected under two climate-change-scenarios (future conditions); and the other calibrated with EFAs for 2001 and projected annually from 2001 to 2013. Range shifts predicted by climate-based models for future conditions were compared to the 2001–2013 trends from EFAs-based models. Projections of EFAs-based models estimated changes (mostly contractions) in habitat suitability that anticipated, for the majority (up to 64%) of species, the mid-term shifts projected by traditional climate-change-scenario forecasting, and showed greater agreement with the business-as-usual scenario than with the sustainable-development one. This study shows how satellite-derived EFAs can be used as meaningful essential biodiversity variables in SDMs to provide early-warnings of range shifts and predictions of short-term fluctuations in suitable conditions for multiple species.	ecosystem	Domingo Alcaraz-Segura;Ângela Lomba;Rita Sousa-Silva;Diego Nieto Lugilde;Paulo Alves;Damien Georges;Joana Vicente;João P.

470f3645b33412b9251e755fab2b9f91b7a3e638	stratified radiometric means for the evaluation of airs and cris		There are now five hyperspectral infrared sounders in orbit (AIRS, two CrIS instruments, two IASI instruments). A long-term record spanning these instruments and continuing forward with future instruments holds great promise for the study of weather and climate. This long-term record must separate the effects of instrument artifacts and weather variability. We introduce the “StratRad” stratified radiance means product, containing means of groups of spectra for AIRS on Aqua and CrIS on SNPP. We show how this product can be used both to illuminate instrument artifacts and to study common observations of weather patterns at an accuracy of better than 0.1 K. Radiances are stratified by latitude, longitude, day/night, land/sea, and observation angle.	stratified sampling	Evan M. Manning;Hartmut H. Aumann;Brian H.

7e55850104a873be97b751db7b2b7ef928d007dc	accommodation response for visually equivalent light field 3d display		Visually Equivalent Light Field 3D (VELF3D) is an autostereoscopic flat-panel 3D display. Though it has a very simple structure, it can reproduce not only binocular parallax and convergence but also smooth motion parallax. It displays multiple viewing zones and uses oblong pixels and a parallax barrier to enable adjacent zones to be linearly blended well and provide continuous reproduction of motion parallax. However, the potential for accommodation reproducibility has yet to be clarified. In this paper, we demonstrate accommodation responses of monocular vision induced by changes in displayed depth as determined by an autorefractor / keratometer. We calculate point spread functions and retinal images when an observer is watching a linear blending display, and analyze mechanisms to induce accommodation.	alpha compositing;autostereoscopy;binocular vision;flat panel display;light field;oblong industries;parallax barrier;pixel;stereo display	Munekazu Date;Hiroshi Fujii;Hideaki Kimata;Takehito Kojima;Kohei Iwata;Ryota Kimura;Akihiro Sugiura;Masaru Miyao	2017	2017 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2017.8101803	autostereoscopy;parallax;stereoscopy;computer vision;accommodation;parallax mapping;parallax barrier;monocular vision;physics;stereo display;artificial intelligence;optics	Visualization	61.206667598607574	-53.43388640595498	13322

The restoration of these distortions require more sophisticated image models that consider the underlying image acquisition process. In this work, a broad class of spatially varying distortions is de ned. The observed image is modeled as the physically meaningful superposition of K partially degraded images. In areas where the degradation is due to the partialresponse of the sensor to multiple object (regions), the distortion is said to be clustered or sporadic. The sporadic distortions under consideration here are spatially varying, object dependent and di cult to estimate from the observed data. A regularized iterative restoration of sporadically degraded images resulting inK restored images is proposed. The algorithm demonstrates a promising (object based) image restoration approach for video editing applications.	algorithm;circuit restoration;distortion;elegant degradation;heisenbug;image restoration;iterative method;object-based language	Damon L.

It is a two-phase noise detector: in the first phase, we use the adaptive vector median filter detection method to identify pixels that are likely to have been corrupted by noise (as noise candidates); in the second phase, these noise candidates are judged by using four onedimensional Laplacian operators, which allow edge pixels to be preserved. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms many existing vector filters in terms of filtering performance. In particular, the proposed approach can effectively preserve thin lines, fine details, and image edges. & 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A Stochastic Expectation Maximization (SEM) implementation of the criterion is considered. The problem of ARMA models with long impulse response is addressed as well as the SEM initialization problem. The model estimation is performed in two steps: First, a truncated estimate of the wavelet is obtained from a SEM algorithm. Then improved wavelet estimation is achieved by fitting an ARMA model to the initial MA wavelet using the Prony algorithm. Simulation results show the significant improvement brought by this approach in situations corresponding to seismic data deconvolution.	convolution;deconvolution;expectation–maximization algorithm;prony's method;simulation;wavelet	Benayad Nsiri;Thierry Chonavel;Jean-Marc Boucher	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;blind deconvolution;statistics	Robotics	60.738770445993076	-71.9029873399527	13453

Despite its simplicity, PSO can be integrated with existing program effortlessly and improves the performance and accuracy of the resulting analysis. In this study, a real landslide site was selected as an example. The problem slope was represented as a digital elevation model using laser scanning, and the model was cut in parallel lines 45 degrees to the North by a custom program. The resulting 19 profiles were inputted to the STABL program for stability analysis using a PSO scripting program. The results showed that the computed factor of safety varied from profile to profile, but PSO improved the results consistently for all profiles. A comparison was made with the previous study in which the slope was cut in the South-North direction. Both studies showed that the directional analysis of slope stability is an important topic for future research.	numerical stability	Zhe-Ping Shen;Walter W.

From a global viewpoint, such a video sequence contains three parts: temporal-spatially correlated video content, uncorrelated dense Gaussian noise, and uncorrelated sparse impulse noise. This fact motivates us to formulate the mixed Gaussian-impulse noise removal task as a temporal-spatial decomposition problem, which amounts to a convex program. A two-stage algorithm is developed to solve this problem efficiently. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on mixed Gaussian-impulse noise removal is validated through experiments. The results are satisfactory in both visual quality and PSNR values, while very few prior knowledge of noise statistic is required compared to most state-of-the-art methods.	algorithm;convex optimization;digital video;experiment;impulse noise (audio);mathematical optimization;noise reduction;optimization problem;peak signal-to-noise ratio;quantum decoherence;sparse matrix;video denoising	Zhangyang Wang;Houqiang Li;Qing Ling;Weiping Li	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271630	gradient noise;gaussian noise;image noise;computer vision;estimation;electronic engineering;speech recognition;peak signal-to-noise ratio;value noise;computer science;noise measurement;noise;noise reduction;mathematics;video denoising;noise;statistics;salt-and-pepper noise	Vision	57.52398409189828	-71.08439023047283	13486

This study applied remote sensing (RS) based input data in a hydrological model for the 19012 km2 Kaidu River basin in Northwest China. Based on the geography information system (GIS) technique, the digital elevation model (DEM) of the study basin was successfully used to delineate the stream network and extract information of catchment characteristics. Landsat TM data from 1990 to 2001 have been utilized for various scale depended maps of land use and vegetation, and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS data is used as input data to the distributed hydrological modeling. Further, root depths of annual vegetation are related to the temporal and spatial variation of LAI.The distributed hydrological model MIKE SHE was calibrated and validated against observed discharge for tow individual gauges during the period from 1998 to 2001. The model generally performed well for effective coefficient (R2), water balance error (RE) and correlation coefficient (r). It is shown that a well-calibrated MIKE SHE model with five “free” parameters is able to produce consistent results with correlation coefficients greater than 0.75. The potential for driving large scale hydrological models using remote sensing data was clearly demonstrated and further emphasized by the presence of long time records and near real time accessibility of the satellite data sources.	accessibility;coefficient of determination;digital elevation model;discharger;geographic information system;map;real-time computing;subsurface (software)	Huang Yue;Chen Xi;Bao Anming;Feng Xianwei	2009	2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering	10.1109/CSIE.2009.870	geomatics;digital elevation model	HCI	85.31614954557132	-60.68238571378967	13503

Compared to the general 3-D Douglas-Peucker algorithm put forward by the authors in the previous publication, further improvements and expansion of the algorithm have been included in this article, namely, (1) for randomly distributed points, 'loneliness index' of the current point has been taken as the dynamic weight factor of the point-plane distance, so as to improve the selection of the feature points; (2) aiming at the mass volume of the regular square grids, which forms the majority of the DEM data; three measures have been suggested in this article for the improvement of the efficiency of the automated generalization. Experiments have proven that these measures can greatly heighten the efficiency of the DEM generalization with satisfactory results and have offered us the practical possibility of on-the-fly global generalization of DEM with a huge volume of data.

This paper shows that the fusion system is also effective for disambiguating time-of-flight depth measurements caused by phase wrapping, which records depth values that are much less than their actual values if the scene points are farther than a certain maximum range. To recover the unwrapped depth map, we build a Markov random field based on a constraint that an accurately unwrapped depth value should minimize the dissimilarity between its projections on the stereo images. The unwrapped depth map is then adapted to stereo matching, reducing the matching ambiguity and enhancing the depth quality in textureless regions. Through experiments we show that the proposed method extends the range use of the time-of-flight camera, delivering unambiguous depth maps of real scenes.	computer stereo vision;depth map;display resolution;experiment;glossary of computer graphics;instantaneous phase;markov chain;markov random field;noise (electronics);pixel;texture mapping;time-of-flight camera;word-sense disambiguation;wrapping (graphics)	Ouk Choi;Seungkyu Lee	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-37447-0_49	computer vision;depth map;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.22149448615708	-57.08168103600434	13587

Recent applications of this approach have introduced new decision rules for target detection in Pareto and Weibull distributed clutter. These transformed detectors tended to lose the constant false alarm rate property with respect to one of the clutter parameters. A closer examination of this transformation process yields conditions under which the constant false alarm rate property can be retained. Based upon this, a new model for X-band maritime radar returns is investigated, and corresponding detectors are developed. The relative merits of this new development are investigated with synthetic and real X-band data.	clutter;constant false alarm rate;image scaling;interference (communication);operating system;pareto efficiency;sensor;synthetic data	Graham Victor Weinberg	2016	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2016.01.005	transformation;speech recognition;telecommunications;constant false alarm rate;mathematics	Embedded	73.22949216204262	-64.45345843056592	13612

Random projections from each of the color channels are acquired separately. The problem is to reconstruct the original color image from the randomly projected (sub-sampled) data. Since each of the color channels are sparse in some domain (DCT, Wavelet, etc.) one way to approach the reconstruction problem is to apply sparse optimization algorithms. We note that the color channels are highly correlated and propose an alternative reconstruction method based on group sparse optimization.

The first part of the contribution presents basic methods of two-dimensional interpolation allowing for the estimation of the observed variables over the whole region of interest. The whole paper is focused on satellite images and their processing. Owing to simultaneous observations at different frequencies, it is possible to detect image differences and to compare them to surface measurements. The paper is devoted to the design and verification of algorithms of image denoising including wavelet use and their correlation.

In this paper, a coherent technique for solving scattering from discrete random media in layered rough surfaces is presented. The significance of the development of a full-wave solution to this problem stems from the fact that both co-polarized phase difference and polarized scattering coefficients can only be accurately determined using a coherent approach. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to formulate a full-wave solution for scattering from discrete random media in layered rough surfaces as well as to demonstrate the potential in the retrieval of subsurface parameters pertaining to the physical properties of rough surfaces and discrete random media using polarized scattering coefficients and co- polarized phase difference. The core of our technique lies in the use of plane wave decomposition. Plane wave solution for the scattered field due to a rough surface is obtained using extended boundary condition method (EBCM). The recursive T-matrix algorithm together with cylindrical-waves-to-plane-waves transformation matrices is employed to deal with scattering from discrete random media. Subsequently, plane wave solutions for the scattered fields due to rough surfaces and discrete random media are then cast into reflection and transmission matrices. These reflection and transmission matrices facilitate the application of scattering matrix technique which coherently accounts for electromagnetic interactions between layered rough surfaces and discrete random media. Various numerical results are examined and it is shown that the subsurface parameters may significantly impact backscattering coefficients and co-polarized phase difference even when the subsurface ground is covered by a rough layer of discrete random media.	algorithm;coefficient;coherence (physics);embedded system;interaction;motorola canopy;numerical analysis;randomness;recursion;transformation matrix	Chih-Hao Kuo;Mahta Moghaddam	2007	2007 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423368	s-matrix;transformation matrix;plane wave;surface roughness;polarization;surface wave;scattering parameters;optics;physical property;physics;vegetation;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Vision	84.08801114923246	-67.63888360991423	13667

The proposed algorithm uses natural scene statistics in spatial domain for generating Wakeby distribution statistical model to extract quality aware features. The features are fed to an SVM (support vector machine) regression model to predict quality score of input image without any information about the distortions type or reference image. Experimental results show that the image quality score obtained by the proposed method has higher correlation with respect to human perceptual opinions and it’s superior in some distortions comparing to some full-reference and other blind image quality methods.	algorithm;distortion;feature vector;image quality;peak signal-to-noise ratio;scene statistics;statistical model;structural similarity;support vector machine	Mohsen Jenadeleh;Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20801-5_2	computer vision;artificial intelligence;support vector machine;computer science;pattern recognition;regression analysis;image quality;quality score;statistical model;scene statistics	AI	62.29278492894094	-64.97066655406687	13747

The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that “classical” flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. Moreover, we find that while median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization is a key to recent performance gains, it leads to higher energy solutions. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective includes a nonlocal term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that ranks at the top of the Middlebury benchmark.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);heuristic;loss function;mathematical optimization;median filter;nonlocal lagrangian;optical flow;optimization problem	Deqing Sun;Stefan Roth;Michael J.

A series of field experiments under varying illumination showed that shadow-lines, which hypothetically pass through the dark endmember, never pass directly through the origin of the spectral feature space. The dark endmember so-defined is termed the ‘dark point virtual endmember’ (DPVE) and its location is assumed to be sensitive to the state of atmosphere. A conceptual radiative transfer model was derived and this demonstrated the susceptibility of the DPVE to the proportion of scattered light from the sky. Further analysis also revealed that the DPVE plays an important role in defining the lower boundary of the data distribution in spectral feature space. The results suggest that, as a signature of atmospheric effects of a scene, estimating the DPVE has potential to reduce some of the uncertainties associated with conventional dark point atmospheric correction methods.	converge;dark web;diagram;experiment;feature vector;multispectral image;spatial variability	Kyu-Young Choi;Ted Milton	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

8ec802e26f83338fb6d5e59282b8d96ee9409479	describing the spatio-temporal variability of vines and soil by satellite-based spectral indices: a case study in apulia (south italy)		Abstract A time series of Landsat 8 OLI (L8 OLI) multispectral images acquired between May 2013 and February 2016 were used to investigate vigour, vine and soil water content in a vineyard of Moscato Reale (syn. Moscato Bianco) sited in the Castel del Monte DOCG area. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were calculated and compared with vine midday stem water potential (Ψ MDstem ) and soil volume water content (VWC), to calibrate estimation models. Estimation models were calibrated using already existing ground observation datasets from previous ordinary vineyard management operations: Ψ MDstem was measured at two different locations in vineyard at 6 different dates in summer 2014; VWC was continuously measured from June to October 2014 and from January to September 2015. Results showed that: a) vine stem water potential can be locally estimated with an accuracy ranging from ±0.046 (high vigour vines) to ±0.127 (low vigour vines) MPa; b) soil volume water content can be locally estimated with an accuracy of about ±1.7%. Medium resolution satellite imagery proved, therefore, to be effective, at vineyard level, to describe vigour, vine and soil water status and their seasonality. This is an important issue to focus on since, as Landsat 8 images are free, the entire process is economic enough to be consistent with cost and incoming of the farming system.	spatial variability;stellar classification	Isabel Caballero;Gabriel Navarro;Javier Ruiz	2018	Int.

Piecewise convex function estimation seeks to reliably estimate the geometric shape of the unknown function. We outline how piecewise convex tting may be applied to signal recovery , instantaneous frequency estimation, surface reconstruction , image segmentation, spectral estimation and multivari-ate adaptive regression. Two distinct methodologies for shape-correct estimation are given. First, we propose a piecewise convex information criterion that strongly penalizes additional innection points and \eeciently"""" penalizes additional degrees of freedom. Second, a two-stage adap-tive (pilot) estimator is described. In the rst stage, the number and location of the change points are estimated using strong smoothing. In the second stage, a constrained smoothing spline t is performed with the smoothing level chosen to minimize the MSE. The imposed constraint is that a single second-stage change point occurs in a region about each empirical change point of the rst-stage estimate. This constraint is equivalent to requiring that the third derivative of the second-stage estimate has a single sign in a small neighborhood about each rst-stage change point. 1.

78a85785150b2b80eca826ba9afc05005184a7c3	optical flow super-resolution based on image guidence using convolutional neural network		The convolutional neural network model for optical flow estimation usually outputs a low-resolution(LR) optical flow field. To obtain the corresponding full image resolution, interpolation and variational approach are the most common options, which do not effectively improve the results. With the motivation of various convolutional neural network(CNN) structures succeeded in singleimage super-resolution(SISR) task, an end-to-end convolutional neural network is proposed to reconstruct the high resolution(HR) optical flow field from initial LR optical flow with the guidence of the first frame used in optical flow estimation. Our optical flow super-resolution(OFSR) problem differs from the general SISR problem in two main aspects. Firstly, the optical flow includes less texture information than image so that the SISR CNN structures can’t be directly used in our OFSR problem. Secondly, the initial LR optical flow data contains estimation error, while the LR image data for SISR is generally a bicubic downsampled, blurred, and noisy version of HR ground truth. We evaluate the proposed approach on two different optical flow estimation mehods and show that it can not only obtain the full image resolution, but generate more accurate optical flow field (Accuracy improve 15% on FlyingChairs, 13% on MPI Sintel) with sharper edges than the estimation result of original method.	artificial neural network;autostereogram;bicubic interpolation;calculus of variations;convolution;convolutional neural network;decimation (signal processing);end-to-end principle;feature extraction;ground truth;image resolution;lr parser;network model;optical flow;super-resolution imaging	Liping Zhang;Zongqing Lu;Qingmin Liao	2018	CoRR		convolutional neural network;pattern recognition;interpolation;artificial intelligence;computer science;superresolution;bicubic interpolation;ground truth;image resolution;optical flow	Vision	56.60734965622933	-69.42848071751571	13825

This can be a major obstacle when, for instance, measuring precise lengths with a metal ruler. If the ruler was calibrated by one laboratory at a reference temperature— say 15°C—but then used at a different temperature in another laboratory, then the calibration certificate might include the value of the ruler's coefficient of thermal expansion, so that a correction could be made for the thermal expansion between the lower and higher temperatures. But what if the second “laboratory” was not a laboratory at all? What if it was an open field and the length to be measured was a 10 km geodesic baseline needed for surveying? This was a serious problem from the late 19th century to the late 20th century.	baseline (configuration management);coefficient;quantum metrology;what if	Richard Davis	2017	IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine	10.1109/MIM.2017.8036694	calibration;engineering;geodesic;ruler;temperature measurement;length measurement;invar;thermal expansion;metrology;optics	Vision	87.41498607451751	-66.60557053420285	13897

Rather than identifying individual bees directly images of active ground nests are collected, processed and counted. The number of nests is a good estimate of population since the number of bees in each nest is constant for most native species; described as solitary because a single female constructs a single nest. When the numbers of insects in flight around the trees located next to nest sites are combined with these data they can give a good quantitative indication of the population of native bees within a community. Open source software FIJI was used to pre-process and classify images. Accuracies and classifier performance were verified using the data mining software WEKA. To date, the random forest classifier has returned fast effective results, classifying nests which are otherwise impossible to identify or count with the naked eye. The number of active nests also compares well to the number of insects in flight and when data of active nests across two seasons are compared a fluctuation in population is evident. It is therefore anticipated that this method could provide another practical alternative to traditional ecological surveys.	image processing;population	Ngaire H.

Accurate paddy rice maps are therefore important inputs for improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration in the agricultural landscape. The main objective of this study was to obtain flooded paddy rice maps using multi-temporal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Krishna River Basin, India. First, ground-based spectral samples collected by a field spectroradiometer, CROPSCAN, were used to demonstrate unique contrasts between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) observed during the transplanting season of rice. The contrast between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) from MODIS time series data was then used to generate classification decision rules to map flooded rice paddies, for the transplanting seasons of Kharif and Rabi rice crops in the Krishna River Basin. Consistent with ground spectral observations, the relationship of the MODIS EVI vs. LSWI of paddy rice fields showed distinct features from other crops during the transplanting seasons. The MODIS-derived maps were validated against extensive reference data collected from multiple land use field surveys. The accuracy of the paddy rice maps, when determined using field plot data, was approximately 78%. The MODIS-derived rice crop areas were also OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 8859 compared with the areas reported by Department of Agriculture (DOA), Government of India (Government Statistics). The estimated root mean square difference (RMSD) of rice area estimated using MODIS and those reported by the Department of Agriculture over 10 districts varied between 3.4% and 6.6% during 10 years of our study period. Some of the major factors responsible for this difference include high noise of the MODIS images during the prolonged monsoon seasons (typically June–October) and the coarse spatial resolution (500 m) of the MODIS images compared to the small crop fields in the basin. However, this study demonstrates, based on multi-year analysis, that MODIS images can still provide robust and consistent flooded paddy rice extent and areas over a highly heterogeneous large river basin.	algorithm;denial-of-service attack;direction of arrival;evaporation;iso/iec 8859;map;mean squared error;pixel;rice's theorem;time series	Pardhasaradhi Teluguntla;Dongryeol Ryu;Biju George;Jeffrey P.

Based on the pixel-correlation, we define a formula to gather the statistics for impulse noise intensity estimation. Because the image corrupted by impulse noise would degrade the pixel-correlation, a simple rule is introduced for different median-based filters which are developed with adaptive working window to reduce impulse noise. The reported multi-state median (MSM) filter and switching median (SM) filter are simulated with the simple rule. The experimental results show that our method would improve the reliability of MSM filter and SM filter for impulse noise reduction.	effective method;impulse noise (audio);markov switching multifractal;noise reduction;pixel	Chao-Ho Chen;Shi-Feng Huang;Chao-Yu Chen;Zhi-Hong Lin	2006	2006 International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2006.46	gradient noise;adaptive filter;gaussian noise;median filter;image restoration;image noise;computer vision;digital filter;dark-frame subtraction;value noise;image processing;impulse noise;computer science;noise;linear filter;noise reduction;image sensor;samarium;control theory;mathematics;matched filter;pixel;grayscale;salt-and-pepper noise	Robotics	56.43730725268224	-65.29511424499732	14008

In addition, an efficient post-processing method is also proposed to further suppress the coding artifacts on the depth video and utilized as an in-loop filter.

(1994). Experimental and theoretical results indicate that this class of models is quite rich, and moreover these models lead to extremely efficient algorithms for optimal estimation based on noisy observations. This motivates further algorithmic development, and in particular, in this paper we present a likelihood calculation algorithm for this class of multiscale models. That is, we consider the problem of computing the log of the conditional probability of a set of data assuming that they correspond to a particular multiscale model. We exploit the structure of the multiscale models to develop an efficient, scale recursive algorithm that allows for multiresolution data and parameters which vary in both space and scale. We illustrate one possible application of the algorithm to a texture classification problem in which one must choose from a given set of models that model which best represents or most likely corresponds to a given set of random field measurements. Texture modeling with Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models is well documented. One difficulty in using GMRF models, however, is that the calculation of likelihoods may be prohibitively complex computationally if there is an irregular sampling pattern. It is shown here that GMRF models can be represented within our multiscale model class which allows us to approximately compute likelihoods for GMRF models based on measurements over arbitrarily sampled regions. As we demonstrate in the context of texture discrimination problems, the multiscale approach not only leads to computationally efficient implementations, but also to virtually the same performance as the optimal GMRF-based likelihood ratio test. We discuss further applications in the area of synthetic aperture radar imagery processing. >	stochastic process	Mark R. Luettgen;Thomas G. Allen;Robert R.

In the last two decades several DInSAR data analysis procedures have been proposed. The objective of this paper is to describe the DInSAR data processing and analysis tools developed at the Institute of Geomatics in almost ten years of research activities. Four main DInSAR analysis procedures are described, which range from the standard DInSAR analysis based on a single interferogram to more advanced Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) approaches. These different procedures guarantee a sufficient flexibility in DInSAR data processing. In order to provide a technical insight into these analysis procedures, a whole section discusses their main data processing and analysis steps, especially those needed in PSI analyses. A specific section is devoted to the core of our PSI analysis tools: the so-called 2+1D phase unwrapping procedure, which couples a 2D phase unwrapping, performed interferogram-wise, with a kind of 1D phase unwrapping along time, performed pixel-wise. In the last part of the paper, some examples of DInSAR results are discussed, which were derived by standard DInSAR or PSI analyses. Most of these results were derived from X-band SAR data coming from the TerraSAR-X and CosmoSkyMed sensors.	geomatics;holographic interferometry;instantaneous phase;pixel;sensor	Michele Crosetto;Oriol Monserrat;María Cuevas-González;Bruno Crippa	2011	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs3020305	geodesy;hydrology;x band;data analysis;statistics;remote sensing	SE	79.39832729153183	-62.70863629040504	14221

Specific objectives include the following: 1) locating and mapping areas of forest regeneration and other vegetation recovery and distinguishing among them; 2) distinguishing between Pinus brutia regeneration and Pinus nigra regeneration within the area of forest regeneration; and 3) examining whether it is possible to distinguish between areas of forest regeneration (Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra) and mature forest. The data used in this study consist of satellite images, field-spectroradiometry measurements, and field observations of the homogenous revegetated areas. The methodology comprised four consecutive steps. The first step involved preprocessing of the Hyperion image and field data. Subsequently, an object-oriented model was developed, which involved three steps, namely, image segmentation, object training, and object classification. The process resulted in the separation of five classes (¿brutia mature,¿ ¿ nigra mature,¿ ¿brutia regeneration,¿ ¿nigra regeneration,¿ and ¿other vegetation¿). The accuracy assessment revealed very promising results (approximately 75.81% overall accuracy, with a Kappa Index of Agreement of 0.689). Some classification confusion involving the classes of Pinus brutia regeneration and Pinus nigra regeneration was recorded. This could be attributed to the absence of large homogenous areas of regenerated pine trees. The main conclusion drawn in this paper was that object-based classification can be used to accurately map postfire vegetation recovery using EO-1 Hyperion imagery.	hyperion;image segmentation;object-based language;preprocessor	George H.

To validate the model, ground-based measurements of backscattering coefficients over an entire rice-growth stage is used. Then, the bistatic scattering response of rice canopy is analyzed in respect of canopy components, including plant height, structure, soil moisture, and surface roughness, as well as their interactions with sensor configurations, such as frequency, polarization, and incident angle. The sensitivity analysis was carried out to demonstrate how the model reacts to changes of each input. The results show that bistatic scattering coefficient varies greatly over different stages, and is strongly dependent on rice plants' structure, including the size, shape, and orientation, especially stems.	coefficient;coherence (physics);interaction;iterative method;microwave;motorola canopy;multitier architecture;polarization (waves);subsurface scattering	Yu Liu;Kunshan Chen;Yuan Liu;Zhao-Liang Li;Peng Xu;Jiangyuan Zeng;Ming Jin	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729485	surface roughness;hydrology;mathematical model;optics;scattering;backscatter;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Robotics	83.60336558451613	-66.91447278615802	14340

Our model constitutes a straightforward higher-order extension of the well known ROF functional (total variation minimisation) to which we add a non-smooth second order regulariser. It combines convex functions of the total variation and the total variation of the first derivatives. In what follows, we prove existence and uniqueness of minimisers of the combined model and present the numerical solution of the corresponding discretised problem by employing the split Bregman method. The paper is furnished with applications of our model to image denoising, deblurring as well as image inpainting. The obtained numerical results are compared with results obtained from total generalised variation (TGV), infimal convolution and Euler’s elastica, three other state of the art higher-order models. The numerical discussion confirms that the proposed higher-order model competes with models of its kind in avoiding the creation of undesirable artifacts and blocky-like structures in the reconstructed images—a known disadvantage of the ROF model—while being simple and efficiently numerically solvable.	bregman method;calculus of variations;carrier-to-noise ratio;compressed sensing;continuation;convex conjugate;convex function;convolution;deblurring;decision problem;discretization;emoticon;euler;expanded memory;expectation propagation;experiment;farkas' lemma;feedback arc set;hessian;higher-order function;image resolution;image restoration;inpainting;iteration;iterative reconstruction;linear function;linear programming relaxation;medical imaging;newton;noise reduction;numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;radio over fiber;semi-continuity;social inequality;sparse;structural similarity;subderivative;total variation denoising;triune continuum paradigm;variational principle;whole earth 'lectronic link	Konstantinos Papafitsoros;Carola-Bibiane Schoenlieb	2013	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1007/s10851-013-0445-4	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;topology;computer science;noise reduction;mathematics;geometry;total variation denoising;inpainting	ML	54.99467777942585	-71.23927513469266	14344

In this paper, we propose a generalized probability density function based on the nth power of a cosine-squared function. This distribution is completely characterized by two parameters; a mean orientation angle and the power of the cosine-squared function. We show that the underlying randomness of the distribution is only a function of the power of the cosine-squared function. We then derive the average covariance matrix for various different elementary scatterers showing that the result has a very simple analytical form suitable for use in model-based decomposition schemes.	polarimetry;randomness	Motofumi Arii;Jakob J. van Zyl;Yunjin Kim	2010	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2010.2046331	covariance matrix;probability density function;polarimetry;covariance;square;component object model;mathematics;orientation;canopy;optics;decomposition;radar;vegetation;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	84.07852822449601	-65.82382009246494	14347
902d6e744d85c904e5312087697e3a319d50396a	progression of performance assessment modeling for the yucca mountain disposal system for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste		This paper summarizes the evolution of consequence modeling for a repository for spent nuclear fuel and highlevel radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada. The discussion includes four early performance assessments (PAs) conducted between 1982 and 1995 to support selection and to evaluate feasibility and three major PAs conducted between 1998 and 2008 to evaluate viability, recommend the site, and assess compliance. Modeling efforts in 1982 estimated dose to individuals 18 km from the site caused by volcanic eruption through the repository. Modeling in 1984 estimated releases via the groundwater pathway because of container corrosion. In combination, this early analysis supported the first environmental assessment. Analysts in 1991 evaluated cumulative release, as specified in the 1985 US radiation protection standards, via the groundwater pathway over 10 yr at a 5-km boundary by modeling waste degradation and flow/transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones. By 1992, however, the US Congress mandated a change to a dose measure. Thus, the 1993 and 1995 performance assessments improved modeling of waste container degradation to provide better estimates of radionuclide release rates out to 10 yr. The 1998 viability assessment was a major step in modeling complexity. Dose at a 20-km boundary from the repository was evaluated through 10 yr for undisturbed conditions using more elaborate modeling of flow and the addition of modules for modeling infiltration, drift seepage, the chemical environment, and biosphere transport. The 2000 assessment for the site recommendation refined the analysis. Seepage modeling was greatly improved and waste form degradation modeling included more chemical dependence. The 2008 compliance assessment for the license application incorporated the influence of the seismicity on waste package performance to evaluate dose at an ~18-km boundary. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ceaa0651aa4d14313c766f79aadb1dce466ee2c8	time-varying sar interference suppression based on delay-doppler iterative decomposition algorithm		Narrow-band interference (NBI) and Wide-band interference (WBI) are critical issues for synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which degrades the imaging quality severely. Since some complex signals can be modeled as linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals within a short time, LFM-WBI and NBI are mainly discussed in this paper. Due to its excellent energy concentration and useful properties (i.e., auto-terms pass through the origin of Delay-Doppler plane while cross-terms are away from it), a novel nonparametric interference suppression method using Delay-Doppler iterative decomposition algorithm is proposed. This algorithm consists of three stages. First, we present signal synthesis method (SSM) from ambiguity function (AF) and cross ambiguity function (CAF) based on the matrix rearrangement and eigenvalue decomposition. Compared with traditional SSM from Wigner distribution (WD), the proposed SSM can synthesize a signal faster and more accurately. Then, based on unique properties in Delay-Doppler domain, a mask algorithm is applied for interference identification and extraction using Radon and its inverse transformation. Finally, a signal iterative decomposition algorithm (IDA) is utilized to subtract the largest interference from the received signal one by one. After that, a well-focused SAR imagery is obtained by conventional imaging methods. The simulation and measured data results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only suppresses interference efficiently but also preserves the useful information as much as possible.	algorithm;ambiguity function;anisotropic filtering;collaborative filtering;conceptualization (information science);etsi satellite digital radio;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);iteration;iterative method;modulation;sap composite application framework;short-time fourier transform;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;synthetic data;the matrix;wigner distribution function;zero suppression	Jia Su;Haihong Tao;Mingliang Tao;Jian Xie;Yuexian Wang;Ling Wang	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10091491	computer vision;geology;doppler effect;artificial intelligence;interference (wave propagation)	EDA	75.46938016865855	-67.75355350503882	14662

Next, crack points are grouped into crack-lines using a Euclidean distance clustering method. Finally, crack skeletons are extracted based on an L1-medial skeleton extraction method. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a set of mobile LiDAR point clouds acquired by a state-of-the-art RIEGL VMX-450 mobile LiDAR system. The results demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the proposed algorithm in extracting 3D crack skeletons.	algorithm;cloud computing;cluster analysis;euclidean distance;otsu's method;point cloud;straight skeleton;thresholding (image processing)	Yongtao Yu;Jonathan Li;Haiyan Guan;Cheng Wang	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946574	computer vision;remote sensing	Vision	75.45859737575435	-58.67841839718435	14717
9e346cc748ddeb387c68ab22e658f78168eff146	contrast enhancement using feature-preserving bi-histogram equalization		A new contrast enhancement algorithm is proposed, which is based on the fact that, for conventional histogram equalization, a uniform input histogram produces an equalized output histogram. Hence before applying histogram equalization, we modify the input histogram in such a way that it is close to a uniform histogram as well as the original one. Thus, the proposed method can improve the contrast while preserving original image features. The main steps of the new algorithm are adaptive gamma transform, exposure-based histogram splitting, and histogram addition. The object of gamma transform is to restrain histogram spikes to avoid over-enhancement and noise artifacts effect. Histogram splitting is for preserving mean brightness, and histogram addition is used to control histogram pits. Extensive experiments are conducted on 300 test images. The results are evaluated subjectively as well as by DE, PSNR EBCM, GMSD, and MCSD metrics, on which, except for the PSNR, the proposed algorithm has some improvements of 2.89, 9.83, 28.32, and 26.38% over the second best ESIHE algorithm, respectively. That is to say, the overall image quality is better.	histogram equalization	Xuewen Wang;Lixia Chen	2018	Signal, Image and Video Processing	10.1007/s11760-017-1208-2	feature (computer vision);computer vision;artificial intelligence;mathematics;pattern recognition;image quality;histogram;brightness;histogram equalization	Vision	58.004758215936285	-63.77648701508849	14741

Four years in the late 1980s (1985-1988) and in the late 1990s (1997-2000) were chosen, as these are distinctively marked as episodes of very high and lower air pollution (sulphates and particulate matter). During the late 1980s, low- and medium-level clouds were colder by more than 2 K and convective clouds even by 4 K. Cloud-tops over and around polluted regions are higher, and their temperatures showed stronger variability, suggesting an indirect aerosol effect in the thermal spectral range as well.	cloud computing;heart rate variability;spatial variability	Abhay Devasthale;Olaf Krüger;Hartmut Grassl	2005	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2005.851736	meteorology;atmospheric temperature;particulates;radiometry;atmospheric sciences;pollution;geology;physics;remote sensing;air pollution	Visualization	83.18161993523269	-57.772063036716496	14769

Stochastically the surface length should be infinite to simulate random rough surface scattering which is possible for analytical method but not for numerical method. Generally there are two approximations to simulate real life: the tapered wave method and periodic boundary condition. Both are valid for random rough surface scattering if convergence is shown with increase of surface length for the tapered wave and if the period is large enough for periodic boundary condition. In this paper we compare the results for the four Stokes parameters between periodic boundary conditions and the tapered wave approach.	approximation;microwave;numerical method;periodic boundary conditions;real life;simulation;stokes parameters	Peng Xu;Leung Tsang;Kunshan Chen	2008	IGARSS 2008 - 2008 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4780147	stochastic process;boundary value problem;hydrology;optics;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.34223002717404	-67.56029850138029	14774

Based on the observation that illumination varies smoother than reflectance, we propose a convex variational model which can effectively decompose the gradient field of images into salient edges and relatively smoother illumination field through the first- and second-order total variation regularizations. The proposed model can be efficiently solved by a primal–dual splitting method. Numerical experiments on both grayscale and color images show the strength of the proposed model with applications to Retinex illusions, medical image bias field removal, and color image shadow correction.	color image;convex conjugate;convolution;experiment;global illumination;gradient;grayscale;human visual system model;numerical method;piecewise linear continuation;variational principle	Jingwei Liang;Xiaoqun Zhang	2015	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1007/s10851-015-0568-x	computer vision;mathematical optimization;color constancy	Vision	55.319349372853075	-70.20627340954283	14802

This activity can collect, in particular, information necessary for executing an important concept of operations: wide-area autonomous change detection over long time intervals. Here we describe the remarkable potential of hyperspectral remote sensing systems for enabling such missions, using either visible or thermal infrared wavelengths. First we describe blind change detection, in which no target knowledge is assumed. Targets that have moved can nevertheless be distinguished from naturally occurring background radiometric changes through the use of multivariate statistics informed by simple physics. Detection relies on the ability of hyperspectral algorithms to predict certain conserved properties of background spectral patterns over long time intervals. We also describe a method of mitigating the most worrisome practical engineering difficulty in pixel-level change detection, image misregistration. This has led, in turn, to a method of estimating spectral signature evolution using multiple-scene statistics. Finally, we present a signature-based detection technique that fuses two discrimination mechanisms: use of some prior knowledge of target spectra, and the fact that a change has occurred.	algorithm;autonomous robot;digital signature;information systems research;metric;pixel;scene statistics	Alan P.

79fac7af56f0a3bfb06fd1d48fd4d19cdcf6a79c	a unified method of cloud detection and removal robust to spectral variability		This paper proposes a unified method to detect a cloud cover and to remove thin clouds from multispectral satellite images. Unlike conventional methods, the variability of a cloud spectrum is taken into account. To estimate multiple spectra of a cloud, the method first identifies probable cloud pixels and then forms their clusters each of which has a representative spectrum, both based on spatial-spectral properties of a cloud. A spectral unmixing technique is employed to determine the extent of spectral contamination by clouds. A cloud cover consisting of thick and thin clouds is thereby detected and then thin clouds are removed based on a physical model of radiative transfer. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method detects a cloud cover most appropriately among well-known conventional methods, and that radiometric accuracy of thin cloud removal is improved by on average 22% compared to one of the state-of-the-art methods.	cloud computing;heart rate variability;metric;multispectral image;norm (social);pixel;spatial variability;stellar classification;tag cloud;thin client	Madhuri Nagare;Hirofumi Aoki;Eiji Kaneko	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128229	radiative transfer;remote sensing;artificial intelligence;computer vision;multispectral image;reflectivity;cloud cover;computer science;spectral line;cloud computing;pixel;histogram	Arch	75.5504921070227	-62.11592699213548	14873

A novel classification method, integrating polarimetric target decomposition, object-oriented image analysis, and decision tree algorithms, is proposed for the classification of polarimetric SAR data (PolSAR). The polarimetric target decomposition is aimed at extracting physical information related to the scattering mechanism of targets for the classification of scattering data. The main purposes of the object-oriented image analysis are delineating objects and extracting various spatial and textural features. The decision tree algorithm provides an efficient way to select features and create a decision tree for the classification. A comparison between the proposed method and the Wishart supervised classification was made. The overall accuracies of these two methods were 89.34% and 79.36%, respectively. The results show that the proposed method is an effective method for the classification of PolSAR data.	algorithm;backscatter (email);coefficient;decision tree learning;decision tree model;effective method;image analysis;list of algorithms;machine learning;physical information;pixel;polarimetry;supervised learning	Zhixin Qi;Anthony Gar-On Yeh;Xia Li;Zheng Lin	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5654051	computer vision;image analysis;computer science;machine learning;decision tree;pattern recognition;remote sensing	ML	73.0908734194856	-62.14523555940489	14879

The proposed methodology constitutes a unifying and powerful framework for multichannel image processing. The new filters use fuzzy membership functions based on different distance measures among the image vectors to adapt to local data in the image. The principle behind the new nonlinear filters is explained in detail. Using the proposed methodology multichannel nonlinear problems are treated from a global viewpoint that readily yields and unifies previous, seemingly unrelated results. The new approach provides insight into the nature of the filtering process and the structure of the underlying nonlinear operator. The special case of color image processing is studied as an important example of multichannel image processing. Simulation results indicate that the new filters are computationally attractive and have excellent performance.	color image;image processing;nonlinear system;simulation	Konstantinos N.

This is accomplished through the development of an extended model for sand ripple characterization and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler to estimate sand ripple frequency, amplitude, and orientation characteristics for multiaspect high-frequency side-look sonar data. Results are presented on synthetic and measured SAS imagery that indicate the ability of the proposed method to estimate desired sand ripple characteristics.	central processing unit;estimation theory;experiment;gibbs sampling;hough transform;information;markov chain monte carlo;metropolis;numerical aperture;parallel computing;pixel;ripple effect;run time (program lifecycle phase);sas;sonar (symantec);sampling (signal processing);spectral density estimation;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;time complexity	Chao Chen;Alina Zare;James Tory Cobb	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2424837	computer vision;synthetic aperture sonar;acoustics;geology;remote sensing	Vision	74.41089961470179	-66.41146600238238	14981

Constrained Delaunay triangulation is used to create a mesh that keeps triangulation edges aligned with object edges in the scene. Node displacements are estimated and several interpolated frames may be synthesized between each pair of original frames without the need for fitting a new mesh to the reference frame. Each of the interpolated frames is synthesized by warping the mesh. We present experimental results that demonstrate the performance and applicability of the proposed method.	computer performance;constrained delaunay triangulation;interpolation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;reference frame (video)	Fernando C.

cc9f25931b69caf325ae010158c4f2f80918b395	learning change from synthetic aperture radar images: performance evaluation of a support vector machine to detect earthquake and tsunami-induced changes	earthquake;change detection;tsunami;machine learning;synthetic aperture radar	This study evaluates the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to learn and detect changes in singleand multi-temporal Xand L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images under varying conditions. The purpose is to provide guidance on how to train a powerful learning machine for change detection in SAR images and to contribute to a better understanding of potentials and limitations of supervised change detection approaches. This becomes particularly important on the background of a rapidly growing demand for SAR change detection to support rapid situation awareness in case of natural disasters. The application environment of this study thus focuses on detecting changes caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, where single polarized TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR intensity images are used as input. An unprecedented reference dataset of more than 18,000 buildings that have been visually inspected by local authorities for damages after the disaster forms a solid statistical population for the performance experiments. Several critical choices commonly made during the training stage of a learning machine are being assessed for their influence on the change detection performance, including sampling approach, location and number of training samples, classification scheme, change feature space and the acquisition dates of the satellite images. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning approach is compared with the widely used change image thresholding. The study concludes that a well-trained and tuned SVM can provide highly accurate change detections that outperform change image thresholding. While good performance is achieved in the binary change detection case, a distinction between multiple change classes in terms of damage grades leads to poor performance in the tested experimental setting. The major drawback of a machine learning approach is related to the high costs of training. The outcomes of this study, however, indicate that given dynamic parameter tuning, feature selection and an appropriate sampling approach, already small training samples (100 samples per class) are sufficient to produce high change detection rates. Moreover, the experiments show a good generalization ability of SVM which allows transfer and reuse of trained learning machines.	aperture (software);approximation;baseline (configuration management);binary classification;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;computation;curvelet;data acquisition;decision boundary;entropy (information theory);experiment;f1 score;feature selection;feature vector;image resolution;iterative method;l band;machine learning;map;monte carlo method;performance evaluation;prototype;refinement (computing);region of interest;sampling (signal processing);sensor;shannon (unit);support vector machine;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;texture mapping;thresholding (image processing);visual inspection	Marc Wieland;Wen Liu;Fumio Yamazaki	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8100792	computer vision;simulation;synthetic aperture radar;machine learning;change detection;statistics;remote sensing	AI	75.00372639269573	-60.60533172639658	15025
7f040dc707995877ec99f11c842940323061eddb	a new image re-coloring method		In this paper, we propose a new method to transform colors in the image according to the user’s emotion. First, we labeled the images into four basic emotions such as happy, sad, fear and anger from the users’ evaluation. After that, we compute color histograms using 36 quantized HSV scheme. After that, we intersect color histograms and finally construct color templates for basic emotions. To reflect the user’s preferences in color perception for specific emotion, we designed interactive genetic algorithm. First, we generate first stage individuals using color templates from the input image. From them, we extract chromosomes for HSV color space and then generate next stage individuals using crossover and mutation operations. After a few number of iterations, we stop the process and extract personalized color templates from the finalized image. Using personalized color templates, the user can generate an affection-based color transformed image according to his own preference. Survey results show that desirable results are obtained from our proposed personalized color templates.	color space;color vision;crossover (genetic algorithm);genetic algorithm;graph coloring;interactive evolutionary computation;iteration;personalization	Hyeyoon Woo;Hang-Bong Kang	2010			image warping;image texture;image restoration;feature detection;color image;image gradient;binary image;u-matrix;image processing;digital image processing;automatic image annotation;digital image;image histogram	AI	56.09713674880311	-62.380164226827105	15073

Two universal correlation measures comprising normalized cross correlation coefficient (NCCC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) are adopted respectively for registration between Radarsat-2 and ASTER images. In order to testify the visual circle's robustness to rotation, the visual squares and circles were constructed meanwhile and used to register the rotated sensed images with different angles respectively. The results proved that the total RMS error of the proposed algorithm was less than one pixel and the circle had higher robustness to angle differences and better performance than that of the square.	algorithm;coefficient;computation;cross-correlation;image registration;mutual information;non-maskable interrupt;pixel;sensor;the circle (file system)	Wei Shi;Fenzhen Su;Ruirui Wang;Junfu Fan	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351089	computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;feature extraction;geology;image registration;pattern recognition;radar imaging;remote sensing	Vision	74.54959347095675	-63.19208802540337	15153

We compared Bangladesh yield of aus rice, one of the main varieties grown, from official agricultural statistics with Vegetation Health (VH) Indices [Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VHI)] computed from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data covering a period of 15 years (1991-2005). A strong correlation was found between aus rice yield and VCI and VHI during the critical period of aus rice development that occurs during March-April (weeks 8-13 of the year), several months in advance of the rice harvest. Stepwise principal component regression (PCR) was used to construct a model to predict yield as a function of critical-period VHI. The model reduced the yield prediction error variance by 62% compared with a prediction of average yield for each year. Remote sensing is a valuable tool for estimating rice yields well in advance of harvest and at a low cost.	estimated;principal component analysis;principal component regression;sample variance;staple device component;stepwise regression;voice handicap index;remote sensing	Atiqur Rahman;Leonid M.

We have good agreement between the extended (single+multiple scattering) IEM model and previous results obtained using a single-scattering IEM model combined with finite-difference time-domain simulations. We show that the multiple scattering not only significantly influences the copolarized phase difference but can also be related to the soil moisture content. In order to assess the validity of our extended model, we performed radar measurements on a natural outdoor site and showed that they could be fairly well fitted to the extended model. A parametric analysis presents the dependence of the copolarized phase difference on roughness parameters (rms height and correlation length) and radar parameters (frequency and incidence angle). Our study also shows that the phase signature should allow detection of buried wet structures down to a larger depth for C-band (3.8 m) than for L-band (2.6 m). This signature could then be used to map subsurface moisture in arid regions using polarimetric SAR systems.	arid;aperture (software);coefficient;finite-difference time-domain method;incidence matrix;integrated enterprise modeling;l band;polarimetry;radar;simulation;subsurface scattering;synthetic data	Yannick Lasne;Philippe Paillou;Gilles Ruffié;Marc Crapeau	2005	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2005.851180	moisture;synthetic aperture radar;polarimetry;hydrology;frequency;phase;optics;correlation;physics;remote sensing;technology	Vision	84.0415811050929	-65.3008182577087	15212

da5475785d0fa1bd8f69c051b0ff3d075d96186b	nonnegative matrix factorization with data-guided constraints for hyperspectral unmixing		Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims to estimate a set of endmembers and corresponding abundances in pixels. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its extensions with various constraints have been widely applied to hyperspectral unmixing. L1/2 and L2 regularizers can be added to NMF to enforce sparseness and evenness, respectively. In practice, a region in a hyperspectral image may possess different sparsity levels across locations. The problem remains as to how to impose constraints accordingly when the level of sparsity varies. We propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization with data-guided constraints (DGC-NMF). The DGC-NMF imposes on the unknown abundance vector of each pixel with either an L1/2 constraint or an L2 constraint according to its estimated mixture level. Experiments on the synthetic data and real hyperspectral data validate the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;experiment;neural coding;non-negative matrix factorization;pixel;sparse matrix;synthetic data;monotone	Risheng Huang;Xiaorun Li;Liaoying Zhao	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9101074	pixel;mathematical optimization;hyperspectral imaging;artificial intelligence;synthetic data;mathematics;pattern recognition;species evenness;non-negative matrix factorization	AI	69.10162012191736	-66.14670895110872	15380

In the hybrid structure, the objects in the scene are organized into a hierarchical bounding volume structure by surface area heuristic (SAH) cost model with each object group node including only one object, and a local accelerating structure is constructed for each object. For a hybrid structure, a scene is divided into static part and dynamic part by the movement, and only dynamic part is updated in each frame. In addition, we design an efficient storage format according to the graphics processing unit (GPU) storage characteristics, which makes it easy to realize the parallel ray tracing on GPU. Experimental results show that the hybrid structure is efficient to deal with the dynamic scene including different kinds of objects, and it can be easily integrated into parallel application systems.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;birefringence;bounding volume;bounding volume hierarchy;cuda;central processing unit;computer graphics;filter design;graphics processing unit;heuristic;parallel computing;pixel;ray tracing (graphics);sampling (signal processing)	Yuanlong Wang;Ping Guo;Fuqing Duan	2014	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-014-2378-3	ray tracing;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;computer graphics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	68.4760604307594	-53.03696958893792	15382

However, these methods have problems of edge blur and jaggy noise. The resolution conversion by adaptive interpolation kernels was proposed to solve these problems. However, jaggy noise and edge blur still arise, because the parameters that determine the shape of interpolation kernels are empirically set. In this work, we obtain the optimal parameters for interpolation kernel adaptation using Particle Swarm Optimization. The results show our approach is promising for high quality resolution conversion.	image resolution;interpolation	Atsushi Fujii;Keisuke Kameyama;Tetsuo Kamina;Yasuhiro Ohmiya;Kazuo Toraichi	2006			computer vision;mathematical optimization;bilinear interpolation;stairstep interpolation;machine learning;mathematics;nearest-neighbor interpolation;multivariate interpolation	NLP	58.45081098964155	-65.32983628386538	15412

Firstly, the spectral characteristics between normal and aphid-infested wheat leaves were compared in spectral reflectance. Concerning the serious aphid damage level, it is obvious that its spectral curve is badly flattened such as green peak (centered around 550 nm), red valley (centered around 680 nm), due to the influence of aphid. Specifically, in the visible spectrum (500-701 nm), the maximum delta (the maximum value minus the minimum value) is 3.3 and it is 7.5 in the nearinfrared spectrum (701-900 nm). Then, the spectral difference and change rate were further analyzed. It seems that both curves show the mirror symmetry and their maximum values are 55.8% and 17.4%, respectively. For the difference curve, the value is negative in the visible spectrum (400-700 nm), which shows that the reflectance of normal wheat leaf is less than that of the serious level. Conversely, it is greater in the near-infrared spectrum (700-900 nm). Finally, based on the high spatial resolution PIS image, ENvironment for Visualizing Images (ENVI-EX) was utilized to extract aphids and the overall accuracy reaches 97%. The result indicates that the PIS is sufficient to identify the wheat aphids and this study can lay a foundation for further applications in precision agriculture using such a hyperspectral imaging system.	academy;motorola canopy;pixel	Jinling Zhao;Dongyan Zhang;Juhua Luo;Dacheng Wang;Wenjiang Huang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-27278-3_29	geography;analytical chemistry;optics;remote sensing	HCI	81.5791494605474	-59.07275901784791	15433

It amounts to identifying a set of pure spectral signatures, which are called endmembers, and their corresponding fractional, draftrulesabun-dances in each pixel of the hyperspectral image. Over the last years, different algorithms have been developed for each of the three main steps of the spectral unmixing chain: 1) estimation of the number of endmembers in a scene; 2) identification of the spectral signatures of the endmembers; and 3) estimation of the fractional abundance of each endmember in each pixel of the scene. However, few algorithms can perform all the stages involved in the hyperspectral unmixing process. Such algorithms are highly desirable to avoid the propagation of errors within the chain. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, which is termed robust collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization (R-CoNMF), that can perform the three steps of the hyperspectral unmixing chain. In comparison with other conventional methods, R-CoNMF starts with an overestimated number of endmembers and removes the redundant endmembers by means of collaborative regularization. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides better or competitive performance when compared with other widely used methods.	algorithm;electronic signature;foremost;lithosphere;non-negative matrix factorization;pixel;software propagation;stellar classification;type signature;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jun Li;Jos&#x00E9; M.

However, it was tested only on grayscale images. To study its performance on color images, we have to reconstruct regular color images from Penrose raw images, i.e., images with only one color component at each Penrose pixel, resulting in the problem of demosaicking from Penrose pixels. Penrose demosaicking is more difficult than regular demosaicking, because none of the color components of the reconstructed regular color images are available. Therefore, most of the traditional demosaicking methods do not apply. We develop a sparse representation-based method for Penrose demosaicking. Extensive experiments show that Penrose pixel layout outperforms regular pixel layouts in terms of both perceptual evaluation and S-CIELAB. The Penrose pixel layout is unique among all irregular layouts because it is uniformly three-colorable and it has only two pixel shapes, thick and thin rhombi, making its manufacturing relatively easy.	algorithm;bayer filter;crest syndrome;cell fusing agent virus;color image;color space;complement system proteins;demosaicing;dictionaries as topic;dictionary;experiment;fifty nine;grayscale color map;pixel aspect ratio;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;standard test image;super-resolution imaging;tiling window manager	Chen-Yan Bai;Jia Li;Zhouchen Lin;Jian Yu;Yen-Wei Chen	2015	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2015.2409569	iterative reconstruction;layout;computer vision;computer science;sensor;mathematics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	60.80051642299711	-58.21022569804756	15503

The contribution of this paper also includes adaptation of the objective function to handle outliers and development of a new optimization procedure. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated using the Middlebury optical flow benchmark and by experiments on challenging examples that involve large-displacement motion.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);displacement mapping;experiment;loss function;mathematical optimization;optical flow;optimization problem;refinement (computing);variational principle	Li Xu;Jiaya Jia;Yasuyuki Matsushita	2012	IEEE Trans.

We present two probabilistic formulations of the problem and carry out optimization using the RAST algorithm, a geometric matching method novel to motion estimation in video. RAST uses an exhaustive and adaptive search of transformation space and thus gives – in contrast to local sampling optimization techniques used in the past – a globally optimal solution. Among other applications, our framework can thus be used as a source of ground truth for benchmarking motion estimation algorithms. Our main contributions are: first, the novel combination of a state-ofthe-art MAP criterion for dominant motion estimation with a search procedure that guarantees global optimality. Second, experimental results that illustrate the superior performance of our approach on synthetic flow fields as well as real-world video streams. Third, a significant speedup of the search achieved by extending the model with an additional smoothness prior.	algorithm;ground truth;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;motion estimation;motion field;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing);speedup;streaming media;synthetic data;video processing	Adrian Ulges;Christoph H.

Our method is based on the cross-channel correlation which assures the co-occurrence of image discontinuities and correlation of color distributions across different color channels of an image. Using blind source separation, we find the transformation of color space which separates the structures of identigram and that of the original image into two different individual color channels. To repair the image contents in the corrupted channel, we formulate the problem using Bayes' rule where the prior and the likelihood probabilities are defined based on the cross-channel correlation assumption. We compare our results with results from inpainting and texture synthesis-based hole filling techniques.

The plugin has been developed purposely to ease the process of LST extraction from Landsat Visible, Near Infrared (VNIR) and TIR imagery. It has the ability to estimate Land Surface Emissivity (LSE), calculating at-sensor radiance, calculating brightness temperature and performing correction of brightness temperature against atmospheric interference though the Plank function, Mono Window Algorithm (MWA), Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) and the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). Using the plugin, LST maps of Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada have been produced for Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 TIRS. The study put much more emphasis on the examination of LST derived from the different algorithms of LST extraction from VNIR and TIR satellite imagery. In this study, the best LST values derived from Landsat 5 TM were obtained from the RTE and the Planck function with RMSE of 2.64  ̋C and 1.58  ̋C, respectively. While the RTE and the Planck function produced the best results for Landsat 7 ETM+ with RMSE of 3.75  ̋C and 3.58  ̋C respectively and for Landsat 8 TIRS LST retrieval, the best results were obtained from the Planck function and the SCA with RMSE of 2.07  ̋C and 3.06  ̋C, respectively.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;algorithm;data compression;geographic information system;interference (communication);modtran;map;open-source software;plug-in (computing);programming language;python;qgis;window function	Milton Isaya Ndossi;Ugur Avdan	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8050413	meteorology;planck's law;hydrology;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Visualization	85.72854847325598	-63.399921029479785	15614
ec9c2c468a09eb5a188e2d218124556d9e60871e	a modified joint trilateral filter for depth image super resolution		Depth image can be easily obtained by RGB-D sensors such as Microsoft Kinect, but the low resolution and poor quality of the obtained results pose a notable challenge on practical applications. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm of modified joint trilateral filter for depth image super resolution. In the proposed method, considering less texture contained in depth image, the high resolution (HR) edge is first extracted from its corresponding HR color image and then introduced to guide the modified joint trilateral filter primarily. Meanwhile, the intensity information is taken into account to avoid the fake edges in the HR edge map. With the guidance of HR edge and intensity information, the HR depth image could be simply interpolated via the modified joint trilateral filter. The experimental results manifest that our approach could not only save the running time but also obtain better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.	super-resolution imaging	Shengqian Zhang;Wei Zhong;Long Ye;Qin Zhang	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-4211-9_6	interpolation;computer vision;superresolution;color image;rgb color model;artificial intelligence;computer science	Vision	57.61325064469119	-60.515808182732655	15675

The incident of interest was the Polish Air Force One TU-154M plane destruction on April 10, 2010. We analyzed the image changes on a micro-detail level, tracked over time and considered with respect to the patterns of destruction and the plane debris size distribution in space, and compared these against information from the broader engineering literature describing destruction patterns of thin walled structures, such as planes and cars. Then, we compared the spatial distribution of the debris between the pictures taken on different dates.

Classification analyses used in thematic mapping can, for example, be sensitive to a range of sampling and data quality concerns. With particular focus on the latter, the effects of reference data quality on land cover classifications from airborne thematic mapper data are explored. Variations in sampling intensity and effort are highlighted in a dataset that is widely used in mapping and modelling studies; these may need accounting for in analyses. The quality of the labelling in the reference dataset was also a key variable influencing mapping accuracy. Accuracy varied with the amount and nature of mislabelled training cases with the nature of the effects varying between classifiers. The largest impacts on accuracy occurred when mislabelling involved confusion between similar classes. Accuracy was also typically negatively related to the magnitude of mislabelled cases and the support vector machine (SVM), which has been claimed to be relatively insensitive to training data error, was the most sensitive of the set of classifiers investigated, with overall classification accuracy declining by 8% (significant at 95% level of confidence) with the use of a training set containing 20% mislabelled cases.

Spatially asymmetric averaging along an edge is hence introduced in this study, where less intensity variation is assumed to be of stronger significance in the sense of stable restoration for details. Also, we restrict ourselves to use short-kernel filters for sharpness recovery. Spatially-adaptive filtering is involved with color demosaicing and an optical system for image acquisition and color filter array (CFA) sampling are subjected to the spatio-temporal aperture effect. Hence it is unavoidable to produce a blurred restoration to some extent. In order to overcome these difficulties and to restore a sharp image, an iterative procedure is introduced. Experimental results have shown a favorable performance in terms of objective measures such as PSNR and CIELAB color difference and subjective visual appearances, especially in sharpness recovery.	demosaicing;digital camera;interpolation	Yoshihisa Takahashi;Hisakazu Kikuchi;Shogo Muramatsu;Naoki Mizutani	2006		10.1117/12.650446	demosaicing;adaptive filter;computer vision;optics;computer graphics (images)	HCI	58.98019224769937	-60.44130215584397	15776
4dfc9a04e17b2f9c7554115b7477e67e1c6d105f	remote sensing of impervious surface growth: a framework for quantifying urban expansion and re-densification mechanisms	getis_ord;impervious surface;isf;re densification;regression residuals;mesma;institutional repository research archive oaister;expansion	A substantial body of literature has accumulated on the topic of using remotely sensed data to map impervious surfaces which are widely recognized as an important indicator of urbanization. However, the remote sensing of impervious surface growth has not been successfully addressed. This study proposes a new framework for deriving and summarizing urban expansion and re-densification using time series of impervious surface fractions (ISFs) derived from remotely sensed imagery. This approach integrates multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), analysis of regression residuals, spatial statistics (Getis_Ord) and urban growth theories; hence, the framework is abbreviated as MRGU. The performance of MRGU was compared with commonly used change detection techniques in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The results suggested that the ISF regression residuals were optimal for detecting impervious surface changes while Getis_Ord was effective for mapping hotspot regions in the regression residuals image. Moreover, the MRGU outputs agreed with the mechanisms proposed in several existing urban growth theories, but importantly the outputs enable the refinement of such models by explicitly accounting for the spatial distribution of both expansion and re-densification mechanisms. Based on Landsat data, the MRGU is somewhat restricted in its ability to measure re-densification in the urban core but this may be improved through the use of higher spatial resolution satellite imagery. The paper ends with an assessment of the present gaps in remote sensing of impervious surface growth and suggests some solutions. The application of impervious surface fractions in urban change detection is a stimulating new research idea which is driving future research with new models and algorithms.	algorithm;image resolution;ink serialized format;java hotspot virtual machine;refinement (computing);sensor;spatial analysis;theory;time series	Amir Reza Shahtahmassebi;Jie Song;Qing Zheng;George Alan Blackburn;Ke Wang;Ling Yan Huang;Yi Pan;Nathan P Moore;Golnaz Shahtahmassebi;Reza Sadrabadi Haghighi;Jingsong Deng	2016	Int.

Filtering algorithms and triangular irregular network (TIN) densification are the most common approaches. Most filter-based techniques focus on image-smoothing. We propose a new approach which makes use of integrated object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques. An initial land cover classification is followed by stratified land cover ground point sample detection, using object-specific features to enhance the sampling quality. The detected ground point samples serve as the basis for the interpolation of the DEM. A regional uncertainty index (RUI) is calculated to express the quality of the generated DEM in regard to the DSM, based on the number of samples per land cover object. The results of our approach are compared to a high resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-DEM, and a high level of agreement is observed—especially for non-vegetated and scarcely-vegetated areas. Results show that the accuracy of the DEM is highly dependent on the quality of the initial DSM and—in accordance with the RUI—differs between the different land cover classes.	algorithm;digital elevation model;digital geometry;filter (signal processing);high-level programming language;image analysis;image resolution;interpolation;object-based language;sampling (signal processing);smoothing;terrain rendering;triangulated irregular network	Fritjof Luethje;Dirk Tiede;Clemens Eisank	2017	ISPRS Int.

The three procedures are cascaded in the conventional processing flow of InSAR. Unlike the conventional processing flow, in this paper we propose a joint processing idea to carry out image coregistration, interferometric phase noise filtering, and phase unwrapping simultaneously based on subspace projection for multibaseline InSAR systems. The joint processing method can perform the fine coregistration of all SAR images implicitly by extracting the correlation information in the neighboring pixel sets, suppress the phase noise by utilizing the orthogonality of the signal subspace and the corresponding noise subspace, and optimally estimate the unwrapped interferometric phases (or the terrain heights) by combining the pixel coherence and the baseline diversity of a multibaseline InSAR system.

71d560dd5b5043e0ab7ee74079ab117dae8f7ad3	an efficient parallel implementation of the marching-cubes algorithm	marching cube	Abstract This paper presents a parallel implementation for fast isosurface generation on an SIMD machine. It is based on a well known sequential version [1] of the marching-cubes algorithm. The marching-cubes algorithm consists of two steps: construct triangles for the isosurface, and calculate the normals at their vertices for rendering. This paper focuses on the construction, which involves 256 cases and is the most time-consuming part of parallel implementation. We have found a better means of parallelizing the marching-cubes algorithm on the data-parallel paradigm that reduces the construction of triangles to 63 cases. Our algorithm was implemented on a Wavetracer Zephyr machine for performance comparison with the one implemented on the CM-2 in [2]. As examples, we give the performance results from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images.	algorithm;marching cubes;olap cube	Meiyun Zheng;Huy Toan Nguyen	1994			parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;computer graphics (images)	EDA	69.62589213798498	-53.02951154574179	15919

The basic idea is to first create a graph with known and unknown pixels as vertices and with edge weights encoding the similarity between vertices, then the problem of interpolation converts to how to effectively propagate the label information from known points to unknown ones. This process can be posed as a Bayesian inference, in which we try to combine the principles of local adaptation and global consistency to obtain accurate and robust estimation. Specially, our algorithm first constructs a set of local interpolation models, which predict the intensity labels of all image samples, and a loss term will be minimized to keep the predicted labels of the available low-resolution (LR) samples sufficiently close to the original ones. Then, all of the losses evaluated in local neighborhoods are accumulated together to measure the global consistency on all samples. Moreover, a graph-Laplacian-based manifold regularization term is incorporated to penalize the global smoothness of intensity labels, such smoothing can alleviate the insufficient training of the local models and make them more robust. Finally, we construct a unified objective function to combine together the global loss of the locally linear regression, square error of prediction bias on the available LR samples, and the manifold regularization term. It can be solved with a closed-form solution as a convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art image interpolation algorithms.	acclimatization;algorithm;appendix;bayesian approaches to brain function;benchmark (computing);computation;computational complexity theory;convex optimization;global optimization;graph - visual representation;inference;interpolation imputation technique;kerrison predictor;lr parser;laplacian matrix;manifold regularization;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;optimization problem;pixel;smoothing (statistical technique);software propagation;tracer;vertex (geometry);endopeptidase clp	Xianming Liu;Debin Zhao;Jiantao Zhou;Wen Gao;Huifang Sun	2014	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2294543	mathematical optimization;image resolution;interpolation;graph theory;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;regression analysis;statistics	Vision	55.06079955394248	-74.03174718767326	16108

Furthermore, the capturing process introduces additive noise and the point spread function of the lens and the effects of the finite size of the photo-detectors further degrade the acquired video frames. The goal of resolution enhancement is to estimate a high-resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution images while also compensating for the degradations. We propose a technique for image resolution enhancement with adaptively weighted low-resolution images (channels) and simultaneous estimation of the regularization parameter. The weight coefficients work as the cross-channel fidelity to each low-resolution image, while the regularization parameter acts as the within-channel balance between data and prior model for each channel.

Accurate knowledge of the solar spectral radiance scattered from the SD is available. The sensor aperture spectral radiance is assumed to be a quadratic polynomial function of a VIIRS detector's background-subtracted response in digital number. The coefficients of the polynomial were initially determined prelaunch. Once on orbit, we assume that these coefficients change uniformly by a common calibration factor, which is referred to as the F-factor. The known solar spectral radiance scattered from a fully illuminated SD allows for the determination of these F-factors. We describe the methodology and the associated algorithms used in the calculation of the RSB F-factors. Our results show that the F-factors change over time, with the largest change occurring at a wavelength of 862 nm (with a value of about 1.55 on day 950 after the satellite launch, relative to its value at the beginning of the launch) . In addition, we estimate the relative error standard deviations of the computed top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance at the detector pixel level. On day 950 of the mission, the relative error standard deviations are all less or equal to 0.016, except for the M11 band (band central wavelength of 2257 nm) , which has a relative error standard deviation of about 0.049 due to a very low signal-to-noise ratio.	algorithm;approximation error;coefficient;pixel;polynomial;quadratic function;signal-to-noise ratio	Ning Lei;Zhipeng Wang;Xiaoxiong Xiong	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2430814	meteorology;detector;calibration;radiometry;earth;optics;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Vision	82.52087027971034	-63.682031525870975	16298
cce528ad6a73faa07b0172b2c47f3a9bd2cea1cf	is webcam performance sufficient for the inventory control of industrial wholesale items with no customer inventory balance records? - case: technical wholesale items	inventory control	This research considers the technical performance of modern webcams for the remote monitoring of the inventory balance of industrial wholesale items. In this case study suppliers were technical wholesalers and the customers were from machinery industry. Paper presents a study on the suitability of webcams for the remote monitoring. In order to establish a remote monitoring system, the images must meet certain quality criteria, thus enabling the assessment of inventory levels. Paper presents image quality tests performed on a webcams in varied conditions, and compares the results to the Finnish Illuminating Engineering Society’s lighting regulations for industrial work. The quality tests aimed to ascertain whether the image quality was sufficient in typical industrial conditions. The results indicate that the image quality of modern webcams is sufficient for remote monitoring within the limits set by the distance of the camera from the objects and by lighting conditions. However, according to the tests, the technical performance of surveillance cameras on the market five years ago, taking budget constraints into consideration, was not adequate for monitoring. 1 RESEARCH MOTIVATION The studied cases utilize the VMI (Vendor-Managed Inventory) model, which is inventory replenishment carried out by the wholesaler delivering items to customer in accordance with the agreed management models. For customer items could play a critical role because their absence may stop entire production lines. Shortages must be avoided and usually this is achieved by using large stock buffers and frequent visual assessment based inventory checks for customer’s replenishment needs. To reduce customer site visits a reachearch on camera based remote monitoring was started for at least visual inspections level of inventtory balance information. Wholesalers have recently promoted VMI research on the use of technology in remote monitoring of items (Happonen and Salmela, 2007). But still there are many items which cannot be monitored easily (cost and space efficiently). Typical reason for limited use of technology in inventory management services is that tehcnology is concidered to be too expencive compared to manual work. The objective of this research is to ascertain whether it is possible to produce images that reveal the inventory levels of items (order point data) in Finnish industrial facilities. As the research of VMI concentrates on collaboration and forecasting (Vigtil, 2006; Salmela and Happonen, 2007; Holweg et al. 2005) as a way to improce order-delivery process of the supply chain and as the information exchange is not as easily arranged between different supply chain parthners as it should be, this research study considered the capabilities of the modern day web cameras as a information source of the item balance information on the VMI relationship. 507 Happonen A., Salmela E. and Nousiainen J. (2008). IS WEBCAM PERFORMANCE SUFFICIENT FOR THE INVENTORY CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WHOLESALE ITEMS WITH NO CUSTOMER INVENTORY BALANCE RECORDS? Case: Technical Wholesale Items. In Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies, pages 507-511 DOI: 10.5220/0001530305070511 Copyright c © SciTePress 2 INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS AND CAMERAS Industrial facilities do not offer optimal environment for the technical equipment. Dust, humidity and temperature in the facilities could cause problems, but usually these may be prevented by a casing etc. In the industrial facilities in this study, the storage facilities adjacent to the production area were quite clean. In addition, storage areas were mostly relatively clean too. The camera usability problems lie more on illumination and focal length areas. 2.1 Illumination in Storage Spaces With regard to the quality of the images, one of the most important factors is illumination. The Finnish legislation does not defined any minimum values for industrial illumination levels, but the adequacy of illumination in work spaces may be evaluated e.g. based on publication 9 of the Illuminating Engineering Society of Finland in 1986: Valaistussuositukset, sisävalaistus (Lighting recommendations, indoor lighting). The illumination levels recommended for storage conditions are presented in Table 1. Levels which exceed 50% of the recommendation are considered sufficient. Based on field research general lighting in modern production plants, exceeds the recommended limits. However, the lighting in warehouses varied more. 2.2 Technical Features of the Camera/ Camera Technology If the lighting conditions are poor, the picture is taken with a long exposure and/or increased exposure sensitivity. A long exposure and increased sensitivity create a random noise in the image. This noise may be technically removed to some extent, but due to such filtration, the sharpness of the image will suffer (McClelland and Eismann, 2003). If the image quality is not sufficient for assessment of inventory levels and the quality cannot be enhanced through post-processing an efficient monitoring system is not possible. The factors of the image quality are optics, the camera’s imaging sensors, and physical imaging conditions (e.g. illumination). Optics focal length may become a problem since webcams are typically designed for access monitoring, where as wide an angle as possible is needed (Hedgecoe, 1992). So the interrelationship of the camera angle and image quality may be unfavourable to remote monitoring. 2.3 Capturing an Image and the Importance of the Time of Day Capturing images during the day is usually difficult due to “disturbances” caused by people and machines. Therefore, images should be captured outside the customer’s regular working hours. For instance, if the image is captured at night, no disruptions are caused by people or machines except when people work in three shifts. On another hand, the amount of lighting may be insufficient to take the pictures at the night time. Fortunately at least some modern cameras enable the remote control of external equipment (such as light fixtures), which helps to avoid such problems. 2.4 Analysing the Image Classifying items inventory balance category level from images and placing orders compose an essential part of a camera monitoring system. The label or mark that indicates the item “count” and order point must be identified either manually or automatically. Analysing the image on a computer and marking the appropriate order point would allow the implementation of a system in which the computer places orders independently.

The particularity of the hyperspectral images that we are interested in is the high dynamics between object intensities. Detection of the smallest and faintest objects is challenging, because their signal-to-noise ratio is low, and if the brightest objects are not well reconstructed, their residuals can be more energetic than faint objects. This paper proposes a marked point process within a nonparametric Bayesian framework for the detection of galaxies in hyperspectral data. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on synthetic images, and it provides good results for very faint objects in quasi-real astrophysical hyperspectral data.	point process;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic intelligence	Celine Meillier;Florent Chatelain;Olivier J.

The algorithm takes into account specular reflection of laser light, laser scattering by wind-generated foam as well as sun glint and solar scattering from the foam Analyses show that the estimated subaqueous integrated backscatter is most sensitive to the estimate of transmittance used in the atmospheric correction, and is very insensitive to the estimate of wind speed used. As a case study, CALIOP data over Tampa Bay were compared to MODIS 645 nm remote sensing reflectance, which previously has been shown to be nearly linearly related to turbidity. The results indicate good correlation on nearly all CALIOP clear-free dates during the period 2006 through 2007, particularly those with relatively high atmospheric transmittance. When data are composited over the entire period the correlation is reduced but still statistically significant, an indication of variability in the biogeochemical composition in the water. Overall, the favorable results show promise for the application of satellite lidar integrated backscatter in providing information about subsurface backscatter properties, which can be extracted using appropriate models.	algorithm;atmospheric chemistry;biogeochemistry;spatial variability;subsurface scattering	Jonathan S.

The improvement of the processing speed in global interferometry missions while maintaining the accuracy is becoming an important issue. DEM reconstruction is the most time-consuming step in the data processing required for spaceborne InSAR. Based on a DEM reconstruction principle analysis, we exploited two basic characteristics of the mapping relation between the interferometric phase and 3-D position of target point. First, the relation between the 3-D position of the target point and the interferometric phase can be approximated using polynomials. Second, the corresponding polynomials change slowly in the local SAR images. Also, we verified the foundations of the two mentioned characteristics theoretically. Then, we proposed a fast method of DEM reconstruction based on this analysis. Detailed descriptions of the step and key parameters of the fast algorithm are provided. Finally, the repeat-pass interferometric data obtained using TerraSAR-X was used to test the presented method. The experimental results showed that a significant reduction in computation time is achieved with only a small loss in accuracy. The effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method were also validated.	aperture (software);approximation algorithm;computation;correctness (computer science);digital elevation model;dynamic language runtime;polynomial;synthetic data;time complexity	Qingsong Wang;Haifeng Huang;Zhen Dong;Anxi Yu;Diannong Liang	2011	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-011-4375-8	computer vision;digital elevation model;geodesy;computer science;geolocation	Robotics	76.25488765579503	-67.57770408440561	16400

For continuous signals a scaling argument directly gives that a natural unit for measuring scale-space lifetime is in terms of the logarithm of the ordinary scale parameter. That approach is, however, not appropriate for discrete signals, since then an innnite lifetime would be assigned to structures existing in the original signal. Here we show how such an eeective scale parameter can be deened as to give consistent results for both discrete and continuous signals. The treatment is based upon the assumption that the probability that a local extremum disappears during a short scale interval should not vary with scale. As a tool for the analysis we give estimates of how the density of local extrema can be expected to vary with scale in the scale-space representation of diierent random noise signals, both in the continuous and discrete cases.	image scaling;maxima and minima;noise (electronics);scale space	Tony Lindeberg	1993	IEEE Trans.

Measurement data is modelled assuming a Rayleigh sea clutter model with embedded Swerling 0, 1, or 3 target signal models. The results are examined to obtain a qualitative understanding of the effects of using the different target models. The Swerling 0 model is observed to exhibit a heightened sensitivity to changes in measured signal strength and provides enhanced detection of the maritime target examined at the cost of more peaked or multimodal posterior density in comparison with Swerling 1 and 3 targets.	algorithm;clutter;embedded system;finite difference;image resolution;multimodal interaction;nonlinear system;rayleigh–ritz method;terminate (software);track-before-detect;velocity (software development)	Michael McDonald;Bhashyam Balaji	2008	EURASIP J.

3ed69368ec6887da8920a9dc4f97d9cfccf02abc	ensemble adjustment kalman filter data assimilation for a global atmospheric model		This work describes the implementation and evaluation of an Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) with a global atmospheric zoom model (version 5) of the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMDZ5, Z stands for zoom). An interface has been developed to use Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), a community EAKF system, with LMDZ5 model. The NCEP PREBUFR real observation data have been assimilated to evaluate the performance of newly developed LMDZ5-DART system. It has been demonstrated with the help of a numerical experiment that LMDZ5-DART system successfully assimilates real observations. A one month LMDZ5-DART analysis has been created using assimilation of NCEP PREBUFR observation data, and the assimilated fields are compared with NCEP CDAS reanalysis. Results show that LMDZ5-DART produces remarkably similar reanalysis to NCEP products. This is therefore a very encouraging result towards a long-term goal of creating a high quality analysis over the Indian subcontinent from the assimilation of local satellite products.	atmospheric model;data assimilation;kalman filter	Tarkeshwar Singh;Rashmi Mittal;H.

The Tucker decomposition has already confirmed higherorder tensor approximation (TA) as a viable technique for compressed volume representation; however, alternative decomposition approaches exist. In this work, we review the main TA models proposed in the literature on multiway data analysis and study their application in a visualization context, where reconstruction performance is emphasized along with reduced data representation costs. Progressive and selective detail reconstruction is a main goal for such representations and can efficiently be achieved by truncating an existing decomposition. To this end, we explore alternative incremental variations of the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC and Tucker models. We give theoretical time and space complexity estimates for every discussed approach and variant. Additionally, their empirical decomposition and reconstruction times and approximation quality are tested in both C++ and MATLAB implementations. Several scanned real-life exemplar volumes are used varying data sizes, initialization methods, degree of compression and truncation. As a result of this, we demonstrate the superiority of the Tucker model for most visualization purposes, while canonical-based models offer benefits only in limited situations.	approximation;c++;dspace;data (computing);image resolution;matlab;real life;scientific visualization;truncation;tucker decomposition	Rafael Ballester-Ripoll;Susanne K.

Assessment of light availability and within-canopy light variability enables a more detailed understanding of these biophysical processes. The changing light-vegetation interaction in a homogeneous oak (Quercus robur L.) stand was studied at different moments during the growth season using terrestrial laser scanning datasets and ray tracing technology. Three field campaigns were organized at regular time intervals (24 April 2008; 07 May 2008; 23 May 2008) to monitor the increase of foliage material. The laser scanning data was used to generate 3D representations of the forest stands, enabling structure feature extraction and light interception modeling, using the Voxel-Based Light Interception Model (VLIM). The VLIM is capable of estimating the relative light intensity or Percentage of Above Canopy Light (PACL) at any arbitrary point in the modeled crown space. This resulted in a detailed description of the dynamic light environments inside the canopy. Mean vertical light extinction profiles were calculated for the three time frames, showing significant differences in light attenuation by the canopy between April 24 on the one hand, and May 7 and May 23 on the other hand. The proposed methodology created the opportunity to link these within-canopy light distributions to the OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2010, 2 1565 increasing amount of photosynthetically active leaf material and its distribution in the considered 3D space.	computer graphics lighting;crown group;ecosystem;feature extraction;heart rate variability;motorola canopy;ray tracing (graphics);terrestrial television;the forest;voxel	Dimitry Van der Zande;Jan Stuckens;Willem W.

However, due to the data intensive nature of 3D visual content, a number of research challenges have emerged. In order to optimise the end-to-end content life-cycle, from capture to processing and delivery, Quality of Experience (QoE) has become a major driving factor. This paper presents a human-centric approach to quality estimation of 3D visual content. A fullreference quality assessment method for stereoscopic images is proposed. It is based on a Human Visual System (HVS) model to estimate subjective scores of registered stereoscopic images subjected to compression losses. The model has been trained with four publicly available registered stereoscopic image databases and a fixed relationship between subjective scores and the model has been determined. The high correlation of the relationship over a large number of stimuli has proven its consistency over the state-of-the-art.	3d television;binocular vision;cinema 4d;data-intensive computing;database;end-to-end principle;human visual system model;image quality;stereoscopy	Chathura Galkandage;Janko Calic;Varuna De Silva;Safak Dogan	2015	2015 3DTV-Conference: The True Vision - Capture, Transmission and Display of 3D Video (3DTV-CON)	10.1109/3DTV.2015.7169375	image quality;computer vision;geography;multimedia;human visual system model;computer graphics (images)	Vision	63.641236899555324	-63.79078798464453	16815

In this scheme, the independent components (ICs) are obtained by offline training high-resolution face images. Given a low-resolution image, the high-resolution image is reconstructed by the linear combination of the ICs where the weight coefficients are obtained by the method of maximum a posteriori (MAP). The prior of ICA coefficients are estimated by performing PCA on training images. Meanwhile, a structure-tensor based filter is proposed to refine the intermediate SR result which is estimated by inverse ICA. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust to various pose, expressions and lighting conditions. The hallucination results preserve both the global structure and the high spatial-frequency information better such as sharp edges and high contrast.	algorithm;coefficient;face hallucination;image resolution;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;online and offline;pose (computer vision);principal component analysis;structure tensor;super-resolution imaging	Ju Liu;Jianping Qiao;Xiaoling Wang;Yujun Li	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4542149	facial recognition system;computer vision;speech recognition;image resolution;computer science;pattern recognition	Vision	59.00835328264821	-69.07508993617685	16941

Their effectiveness often play crucial roles in the success of subsequent image operations such as feature segmentation or object recognition. In order to obtain high quality images, the bilateral filer (BF) and the unsharp masking filter (UMF) have often been used as attractive candidates for their proven performances in noise removal and contrast enhancement. The BF is able to remove noises while preserving edge sharpness. On the other hand, the UMF is capable of increasing image contrast. Since the BF is not designed for contrast enhancement and the UMF is not developed for noise reduction, their strengths may not be fully utilized for image quality improvement. In this work, the two filters are integrated in a pipelined process such that the resultant image noise is reduced while the contrast is increased. Experimental results on public-domain and real-life test images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	bilateral filter;brainfuck;display resolution;feature vector;image noise;image processing;image quality;netapp filer;noise reduction;outline of object recognition;performance;pipeline (computing);real life;resultant;unsharp masking	Haiyan Shi;Ngai Ming Kwok	2013	2013 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890412	median filter;image restoration;image noise;unsharp masking;computer vision;speech recognition;pattern recognition;edge enhancement;salt-and-pepper noise	Robotics	56.43477006495228	-64.42272735115662	16956

We first summarize the compact-pol decomposition theory we developed for retrieving useful geophysical parameters from compact-pol data. We then demonstrate a combination of time series filtering and spatial filtering to reduce speckle noise in the geophysical parameters. Next we describe a rule-based classifier and show an application example based on a time series of simulated compact-pol data from Radarsat-2 Fine Quad-pol (FQ) mode to detect a 10-year old fire scar in our study site. Our study results showed that even though there was a loss of polarimetric information through projection of a complex scattering matrix of quad-pol data on a single-pixel level, the compact-pol mode was capable of maintaining important polarimetric information and detecting the test forest fire scar. Finally we look at the effect of non-circular transmit polarization on key decomposition parameters and discuss the effects of imperfect transmit polarization on classification performance.	logic programming;pixel;polarimetry;polarization (waves);reliability-centered maintenance;scar (physics);sensor;time series	Hao Chen;David G.

Unlike the typical image enhancement techniques which perform transformations in the image domain, we take the volume data into account and enhance the presentation of the volume in the rendered image by adjusting the rendering parameters. Our objective is not only to deliver a pleasing image with better color contrast or enhanced features, but also generate a faithful image with the information in the volume presented in the image. An image quality measurement is proposed to quantitatively evaluate image quality based on the information obtained from the image as well as the volumetric data. The parameter adjustment process is driven by the evaluation result using a genetic algorithm. More informative and comprehensible results are therefore delivered, compared with the typical image-based approaches.	color;computation;eurographics;genetic algorithm;graphics pipeline;graphics processing unit;image editing;image quality;information;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;original chip set;software release life cycle;volume rendering	Ming-Yuen Chan;Yingcai Wu;Huamin Qu	2007		10.2312/VG/VG07/025-032	image quality;image warping;image texture;computer vision;feature detection;image-based modeling and rendering;binary image;image processing;computer science;digital image processing;real-time computer graphics;multimedia;automatic image annotation;digital image;image-based lighting;computer graphics (images)	Vision	59.837364447749884	-61.54921571940584	17049

Through an adaptive process and from large-size samples of these parameters, several normal-distributed moments are calculated, which allow assigning each resolution cell of the searching region to the background or anomaly classes. Following the Neyman–Pearson criterion two optimal detection algorithms are proposed, one for statistically independent moments and other for correlated moments. Finally, three background-anomaly pairs are simulated, taking the amplitude of the video signal as parameter and two of its moments for decision making. As result, the detection curves for two sizes of the sample are presented, showing the possibilities of the proposed method.	radar	N.

We applied multi-parameter SAR data (dual-frequency, multi-polarization, and multi-incidence angle) to monitoring the wetland forest. To find the optimum incidence angle and polarization for monitoring the wetland biomass, a simple backscattering model of wetland vegetation was developed and applied to estimate backscattering coefficients for different biomass and surface conditions.	airborne ranger;aperture (software);coefficient;incidence matrix;polarimetry;polarization (waves);the forest	Kazuki Nakamura;Hiroyuki Wakabayashi;Hisashi Shinsho;Hideo Maeno;Seiho Uratsuka;Akitsugu Nadai;Toshihiko Umehara;Toshifumi Moriyama	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369753	meteorology;synthetic aperture radar;hydrology;backscatter;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	82.97248414785068	-61.982379813764844	17156

A display of a SAR (intensity) image has two axes: range and cross-range. Elevated scatterers appear closer in range; this phenomenon is called radar image layover. How the height of each scatterer can be computed from the difference in its layover between two images is investigated. This is analogous to computing height from disparity distance (triangulation) in optical stereo. The same procedure can be applied on pixel by pixel basis for terrain elevation mapping. A general expression is derived for the accuracy of the height estimate as a function of the range resolution and the angular difference between the image planes. Accuracy increases as the angle between the image planes increases, but the bright scatterers in one image tend to fade in the other image. This limited angular persistence of radar scatterers is also discussed. Trajectories for data collection are examined that provide near-optimal height estimates while eliminating the scatterer persistency problem.	angularjs;aperture (software);binocular disparity;computation (action);dbpedia;data collection;estimated;image resolution;persistence (computer science);pixel;radar;synthetic data;topography;triangulation	Mita D.

This study was conducted to test the feasibility of the band combination of hyperspectral sensing for inland turbid water monitoring in Taiwan. The field spectral reflectance in the Wu river basin of Taiwan was measured with a spectroradiometer; the water samples were collected from the different sites of the Wu river basin and some water quality parameters were analyzed on the sites (in situ) as well as brought to the laboratory for further analysis. To obtain the data set for this study, 160 in situ sample observations were carried out during campaigns from August to December, 2005. The water quality results were correlated with the reflectivity to determine the spectral characteristics and their relationship with turbidity and TSS. Furthermore, multiple-regression (MR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to model the transformation function between TSS concentration and turbidity levels of stream water, and the radiance measured by the spectroradiometer. The value of the turbidity and TSS correlation coefficient was 0.766, which implies that turbidity is significantly related to TSS in the Wu river basin. The results indicated that TSS and turbidity are positively correlated in a significant way across the entire spectrum, when TSS concentration and turbidity levels were under 800 mg·L(-1) and 600 NTU, respectively. Optimal wavelengths for the measurements of TSS and turbidity are found in the 700 and 900 nm range, respectively. Based on the results, better accuracy was obtained only when the ranges of turbidity and TSS concentration were less than 800 mg·L(-1) and less than 600 NTU, respectively and used rather than using whole dataset (R(2) = 0.93 versus 0.88 for turbidity and R(2) = 0.83 versus 0.58 for TSS). On the other hand, the ANN approach can improve the TSS retrieval using MR. The accuracy of TSS estimation applying ANN (R(2) = 0.66) was better than with the MR approach (R(2) = 0.58), as expected due to the nonlinear nature of the transformation model.	aleurites (plant);artificial neural network;coefficient;conflict (psychology);ephedra sinica;experiment;holmium:yag laser device;ibm spectrum protect (tivoli storage manager);jing;lobular neoplasia;multiple myeloma;network interface device;nonlinear system;population parameter;reagents;salvia hispanica seed;sampling (signal processing);silo (dataset);toxic shock syndrome;transfer function;turbidity measurement;water;wu-ling-san;yao graph;solid substance;wavelength	Jiunn-Lin Wu;Chung-Ru Ho;Chia-Ching Huang;Arun Lal Srivastav;Jing-Hua Tzeng;Yao-Tung Lin	2014		10.3390/s141222670	text mining;turbidity;telecommunications;computer science;linear regression;total dissolved solids;remote sensing	HCI	87.08891768458979	-54.40897464365566	17174

Each projector displays patterns over a scene viewed by a camera, thereby allowing automatic computation of camera-projector pixel correspondences. This paper introduces a new algorithm to establish this correspondence in difficult cases of image acquisition. A probabilistic model formulated as a Markov random field uses the stripe images to find the most likely correspondences in the presence of noise. Our model is specially tailored to handle the unfavorable projector-camera pixel ratios that occur in multiple-projector single-camera setups. For the case where more than one camera is used, we propose a robust approach to establish correspondences between the cameras and compute an accurate disparity map. To conduct experiments, a ground truth was first reconstructed from a high quality acquisition. Various degradations were applied to the pattern images which were then solved using our method. The results were compared to the ground truth for error analysis and showed very good performances, even near depth discontinuities.	3d reconstruction;algorithm;binocular disparity;computation;display resolution;error analysis (mathematics);experiment;ground truth;markov chain;markov random field;movie projector;performance;pixel;statistical model;stripes;structured light;uncontrolled format string;video projector	Jean-Philippe Tardif;Sébastien Roy	2005	Fifth International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM'05)	10.1109/3DIM.2005.11	3d reconstruction;iterative reconstruction;layout;statistical model;computer vision;calibration;camera resectioning;degradation;structured light;ground truth;computer science;markov process;computer graphics;pixel;robustness;computer graphics (images)	Vision	55.20667758538871	-54.22275973922645	17177

A method for computing the reliability at each point of any linear functional of a surface reconstructed using regularization is presented. The proposed method is to define a probability structure on the class of possible objects and compute the variance of the corresponding random variable. This variance is a natural measure for uncertainty, and experiments have shown it to correlate well with reality. The probability distribution used is based on the Boltzmann distribution. The theoretical part of the work utilizes tools from classical analysis, functional analysis, and measure theory on function spaces. The theory was tested and applied to real depth images. It was also applied to formalize a paradigm of optimal sampling, which was successfully tested on real depth images. >	matrix regularization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms	Daniel Keren;Michael Werman	1993	IEEE Trans.

The imaging system contains two radar stations, which are separated by a certain bistatic angle and configured in a transmitter/receiver-receiver (T/R-R) manner. Consequently, two synthetic apertures are obtained at the same time from different aspect angles. By coherently fusing the echoes of the two radars, a virtual aperture spanned by these two sub-apertures can be constructed, which is larger than either of the sub-apertures; thus, the cross-range resolution of the image is enhanced. Moreover, the fusion of the echoes is realized by exploiting the sparse scattering property of the target. Then, based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, the T/R-R fusion imaging problem is converted into a sparse signal recovery problem with unknown parameters. Finally, it is solved in an iterative manner, which contains two steps, i.e., sparse imaging and parameter estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed sparse fusion imaging method can improve the cross-range resolution significantly compared to inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) within the same coherent processing interval (CPI).	algorithm;aperture (software);coherence (physics);converge;convergence (action);detection theory;estimation theory;image fusion;image resolution;iteration;iterative method;large;population parameter;radar;simulation;sparse matrix;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;transmitter device component	Shougang Chai;Weidong Chen;Chang Chen	2014		10.3390/s140610664	computer vision;speech recognition;bioinformatics;image fusion;inverse synthetic aperture radar;physics	Robotics	69.75477882246354	-68.37443406015456	17249

The closed-form solution for the optimal parameters is based on a continuous-discrete-continuous system model that accounts for the scene ensemble, acquisition blurring, sampling, noise, and processing.

However, few studies focus on the scaling effect on both the spatial and the temporal scale. By calculating the maximum joint entropy of hourly typhoon events, monthly, six dry and wet months and annual rainfall between 1992 and 2012 for 1-, 3-, and 5-km grids, the relocated candidate rain gauges in the National Taiwan University Experimental Forest of Central Taiwan are prioritized. The results show: (1) the network exhibits different locations for first prioritized candidate rain gauges for different spatiotemporal scales; (2) the effect of spatial scales is insignificant compared to temporal scales; and (3) a smaller number and a lower percentage of required stations (PRS) reach stable joint entropy for a long duration at finer spatial scale. Prioritized candidate rain gauges provide key reference points for adjusting the network to capture more accurate information and minimize redundancy.	entropy (information theory);image scaling;joint entropy;kriging;network planning and design;procedural reasoning system;spatial scale;typhoon	Chiang Wei;Hui-Chung Yeh;Yen-Chang Chen	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16084626	meteorology;entropy;thermodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	ML	85.32589355483418	-58.65770400213575	17347

The numerical calculations are carried out for one and two wedges, which are composed by various inner angles and different materials. We also discuss about the diffracted fields close to the wedge surface. The numerical results show that for one or two wedges, wedge shapes, materials and incident polarization don't give significant effect to diffracted fields, but the waves incident close to the wedge surfaces are affected by them.	concrete mathematics: a foundation for computer science;experiment;incidence matrix;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);radio wave;software propagation	Saki Kameyama;Jiro Iwashige;Motohiko Iwaida;Yuki Isayama	2013	2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2013.41	crystallography;mathematics;geometry;optics	Robotics	84.02360265440473	-68.3180793781705	17384

We discuss the physical generation process of natural images as a combination of occlusions, transparencies and contrast changes. This description fits to the phenomenological description of Gaetano Kanizsa according to which visual perception tends to remain stable with respect to these basic operations. We define a contrast invariant presentation of the digital image, the topographic map, where the subjacent occlusion-transparency structure is put into evidence by the interplay of level lines. We prove that each topographic map represents a class of images invariant with respect to local contrast changes. Several visualization strategies of the topographic map are proposed and implemented and mathematical arguments are developed to establish stability properties of the topographic map under digitization.	digital image;fits;topography;transparency (projection)	Vicent Caselles;Bartomeu Coll;Jean-Michel Morel	1999	International Journal of Computer Vision	10.1023/A:1008144113494	computer vision;topographic map;mathematical morphology;visual perception;computer science;level set;mathematics;multimedia;digital image;computer graphics (images)	Vision	56.34942533133501	-53.34515917168534	17433

These routines offer users flexible choices of integration path functions to take advantage of improved Radon-domain identification and isolation of seismic phases. Least-squares inversion of frequency components and judicious choices of regularization techniques enables additional noise suppression and signal enhancement in the Radon domain. The forward Radon transform routine has the added benefit of spatial interpolation for irregularly sampled data. The accuracy and applicability of these two new routines are demonstrated using data sets containing longperiod SS precursors and high-frequency receiver functions. With minimal modifications these two highly portable, carefully documented Radon-transform routines could be easily adapted for a broad range of applications. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The reconstruction of the unknown parts is automatically obtained by a variational method that uses the predicted gradient information imposing smoothing constraints on luminance and color level. Experiments on a number of images show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in smooth areas, as well as in areas with edges and/or textured.	algorithm;calculus of variations;experiment;extrapolation;gradient descent;inpainting;smoothing	Emiliano Pallotti;Licia Capodiferro;Federica Mangiatordi;Paolo Sità	2012		10.1117/12.908297	computer vision;mathematical optimization;physics;smoothing;computer graphics (images)	Vision	55.802516951653494	-59.883188863345595	17527

Many studies have attempted to extract urban impervious surface using multispectral images of medium and high resolution, especially images acquired in summer, as they achieved higher accuracy. However, the use of summer images may underestimate impervious surface area, since some impervious surfaces are obscured by deciduous tree crowns in summer. This paper compared the results of impervious surface extracted using two-temporal Worldview-2 multispectral images acquired in summer and winter by linear spectral mixture analysis and analyzed the differences between the results. The results indicated that impervious surface extraction from winter image produced a similar accuracy with summer image. However, the area of impervious surface extracted from winter image was much higher than that from summer image by nearly 20% in study area.	image resolution;multispectral image	Peijun Li	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325974	meteorology;radiometry;hydrology;accuracy and precision;physics;vegetation;remote sensing	Visualization	79.60361246464124	-58.708277726024185	17533

Radar backscattering and InSAR coherence suggest that the dominant radar backscattering mechanism for swamp forest and saline marsh is double-bounce backscattering, implying that InSAR images can be used to estimate water-level changes with unprecedented spatial details. On the one hand, InSAR images suggest that water-level changes over the study site can be dynamic and spatially heterogeneous and cannot be represented by readings from sparsely distributed gauge stations. On the other hand, InSAR phase measurements are disconnected by structures and other barriers and require absolute water-level measurements from gauge stations or other sources to convert InSAR phase values to absolute water-level changes.	aperture (software);radar;salineos;synthetic data	Zhong Lu;Oh-Ig Kwoun	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2008.917271	meteorology;hydrology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.55915871391343	-63.87397202579686	17624

The discussion concentrates on the formulation of a standard procedure that, using the concept of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, can define the likelihood of changes detected from remotely sensed data. The fuzzy visualization of areas undergoing changes can be incorporated into a decision support system for prioritization of areas requiring environmental monitoring. We propose an automatic technique for the analysis of the difference image. Such technique allows the automatic selection of the decision threshold. We used a thresholding approach by performing fuzzy partition on an n-dimensional histogram, which included contextual information, based on fuzzy relation and maximum fuzzy entropy principle. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of proposed technique.	database;decision support system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;high-level programming language;image noise;thresholding (image processing);unsupervised learning	Maria Luiza F.

The algorithm is composed of 2 parts: Background depth map generation and moving object detection & filling. The proposed algorithm has been implemented both in software as well as in VLSI.	2d to 3d conversion;algorithm;depth map;field-programmable gate array;glossary of computer graphics;image;nvidia 3d vision;object detection;pixel;very-large-scale integration	Yeong-Kang Lai;Chu-Yin Ho;Benjamin Freiling;Thomas Schumann	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7527317	computer vision;estimation;computer science;mathematics;multimedia;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	57.634407991173894	-54.92740036368482	17682

The proposed algorithm is devoid of certain disadvantages inherent in a conventional immersion-based algorithm originally proposed by Vincent and Soille. Flooding of catchment basins from pre-determined regional minima and conditional neighborhood comparisons while processing the eight neighboring pixels of a labeled center pixel ensures thin continuous watershed lines. Reduced computational complexity and increased throughput compared to the conventional algorithm occurs from simultaneous determination of labels of various neighboring pixels. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. The results of running both the proposed and the conventional algorithm on different test images clearly establish the superiority of the proposed algorithm. A prototype architecture designed to implement the proposed watershed algorithm has been modelled in VHDL and synthesized for Virtex FPGA. The FPGA implementation results show acceptable performance of the proposed architecture.	immersion (virtual reality);prototype;watershed (image processing)	Ch. Rambabu;I.

The reason is that noises or fluctuations always strongly affect the measured results. To resolve this problem, a novel approach of using leastsquares support vector machine (LS-SVM) to reconstruct the Lidar signal is proposed in this paper. LS-SVM has been proven as robust to noisy data; the Lidar signal, which is strongly corrupted by noises or fluctuations, can be thought as a function of distance. So detecting Lidar signals from high noisy regime can be regarded as a robust regression procedure which involves estimating the underlying relationship from detected signal data set. To apply the LS-SVM on Lidar signal regression, firstly the noises in Lidar signal is analyzed and then the traditional LS-SVM algorithm is modified to incorporate the a priori knowledge of the Lidar signal in the training of LS-SVM. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.	approximation algorithm;least squares support vector machine;nl (complexity);noise reduction;numerical aperture;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio	Bing-Yu Sun;De-shuang Huang;Hai-Tao Fang;Xing-Ming Yang	2005	IJPRAI	10.1142/S021800140500423X	lidar;support vector machine;least squares support vector machine;a priori and a posteriori;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;least squares;robust regression;statistics	ML	71.86862532851174	-65.77595799052503	17753

To estimate the shape, reflection properties, and lighting conditions, we employ a nonlinear minimization that searches for parameters that can synthesize images that best fit the input images. A similar approach has been reported previously, but it suffers from slow convergence due to specular reflection parameters. In this paper, we introduce specular-free residual minimization that avoids the negative effects of specular reflection components by projecting the residual onto the complementary space of the light color. The minimization process simultaneously searches for the optimal light color and other parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using several real and synthetic image sets.	photometric stereo	Tsuyoshi Migita;Kazuhiro Sogawa;Takeshi Shakunaga	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25367-6_16	computer vision	Vision	56.121671697286594	-57.85010535771381	17815

The algorithm uses unsymmetrical trimmed variants for the noise removal. The corrupted pixel is replaced based on the number of non-noisy pixel in the current processing window. The proposed algorithm was applied on various grayscale, and videos that gave excellent peak signal-to-noise ratio, high image enhancement factor, low mean square error, and very good SSIM with excellent edge preservation even at high noise densities. If all the pixels of the current processing window are noisy, then instead of unsymmetrical midpoint, global trimmed mean of the image is replaced as output. The proposed algorithm shows excellent noise suppression capability, when compared to standard and existing filters in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures at highly noisy environment.	ca gen;grayscale;image editing;knuth–morris–pratt algorithm;mean squared error;microsoft windows;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pixel;salt-and-pepper noise;structural similarity;time complexity;zero suppression	Kishorebabu Vasanth;V.

1cf1269926088e39f68c0324b3011a0df3f737c5	application of coupled-wave wentzel-kramers-brillouin approximation to ground penetrating radar		This paper deals with bistatic subsurface probing of a horizontally layered dielectric half-space by means of ultra-wideband electromagnetic waves. In particular, the main objective of this work is to present a new method for the solution of the two-dimensional back-scattering problem arising when a pulsed electromagnetic signal impinges on a non-uniform dielectric half-space; this scenario is of interest for ground penetrating radar (GPR) applications. For the analytical description of the signal generated by the interaction of the emitted pulse with the environment, we developed and implemented a novel time-domain version of the coupled-wave Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We compared our solution with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) results, achieving a very good agreement. We then applied the proposed technique to two case studies: in particular, our method was employed for the post-processing of experimental radargrams collected on Lake Chebarkul, in Russia, and for the simulation of GPR probing of the Moon surface, to detect smooth gradients of the dielectric permittivity in lunar regolith. The main conclusions resulting from our study are that our semi-analytical method is accurate, radically accelerates calculations compared to simpler mathematical formulations with a mostly numerical nature (such as the FDTD technique), and can be effectively used to aid the interpretation of GPR data. The method is capable to correctly predict the protracted return signals originated by smooth transition layers of the subsurface dielectric medium. The accuracy and numerical efficiency of our computational approach make promising its further development.	approximation;approximation algorithm;automatic sounding;brillouin scattering;computation;dispersive partial differential equation;embedded system;finite difference method;finite-difference time-domain method;gradient;kaby lake;kriging;level of detail;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical weather prediction;parabolic antenna;reflection (computer graphics);semiconductor industry;simulation;subsurface scattering;transmitter;ultra-wideband;video post-processing	Igor Prokopovich;Alexei Popov;Lara Pajewski;Marian Marciniak	2018	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs10010022	permittivity;electromagnetic radiation;computer vision;ground-penetrating radar;brillouin zone;bistatic radar;artificial intelligence;geology;finite-difference time-domain method;dielectric;optics;pulse (signal processing)	Robotics	83.4215688526563	-68.24734441603704	17879

2a56eae923e9f8c2cdcf02d8b9ce9a50f17ddd7b	sparse millimeter-wave insar imaging approach based on mc		Millimeter-wave interferometric synthetic aperture radiometer (InSAR) imaging has received considerable attention owing to its pure radiation receiving scheme and high resolution. In recent years, compressive sensing (CS) has been applied to InSAR on the assumption that InSAR image could be formulated to a sparse vector. However, the CS-based InSAR ignores the 2-D sparsity of images and its performance degrades while processing large-scale images. Further using the sparsity of InSAR image, a novel InSAR imaging approach referred to as InSAR-matrix completion (MC) is proposed in this letter by adopting the MC techniques, which can recover a low-rank matrix from a small subset of its corrupted entries. Directly representing the target image as a matrix, InSAR-MC formulates the estimation of the visibility function as a 2-D linear transformation and inversely obtains the target image by convex optimization as sparsity of millimeter-wave image and interferometric operation satisfy the low-rank property. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach’s validity and better performance of the recovered images with comparison against CS-based InSAR and other traditional approaches.	compressed sensing;convex optimization;dataspaces;image resolution;mathematical optimization;numerical aperture;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence;undersampling	Yilong Zhang;Yuehua Li;Jianfei Chen;Shahed Shahir;Safieddin Safavi-Naeini	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2810234	interferometric synthetic aperture radar;compressed sensing;computer vision;mathematics;artificial intelligence;synthetic aperture radar;sparse matrix;convex optimization;radiation;matrix (mathematics);interferometry	Vision	68.2716634287813	-66.21349806637888	17928

One is the adaptive mean median filter for preserving the details of images when restored from additive Gaussian noise. Another is the minimum-maximum method for moving outlier noise. The third method, the robust adaptive mean p-median filter, is based on a combination of the previous two methods. In the past, proposed restoration methods have generally proven to be inadequate for both detail preservation and noise suppression, but the new adaptive mean p-median filter is shown to be good at both of these tasks, while the robust adaptive mean p-median filter can give good performance even in the presence of outliers. Degraded images are processed by the proposed algorithms, with the results compared with a selection of other median-based algorithms that have been proposed in the literature.		Xu You;Gregory A.

The bare plot of 14/spl times/20 m was instrumented with two ground-based radiometers (1.4 and 11.4 GHz, respectively) and in situ time domain reflectometer (TDR) and temperature probes installed at five depths in three soil profiles. All data were recorded every 30 min from May to July 2002. The measured brightness temperature dynamics is a superposition of three patterns. The largest variations were caused by the changes in water content due to precipitation and the subsequent drying process. During dry periods, we observed daily oscillations of brightness temperature. Calculating effective soil temperatures based on the in situ measured temperature profiles revealed that these oscillations were partially due to changes in water content in the very topsoil. This effect was especially pronounced for the 11.4-GHz measurements, indicating that the very surface experienced the strongest changes in water content. At 1.4 GHz and horizontal polarization, the brightness temperature measurements turned out to be very sensitive to sun reflection at the ground. This reflection was visible through exceptionally high brightness temperature values at distinct times of the day. We observed pronounced hysteresis loops when comparing the emissivities of the two radiometers or the radiometric signals with the water content measured in situ at 2-cm depth. Such loops could be seen for the daily wetting and drying cycles as well as in the longer term drying and wetting behavior. This demonstrates that the gradient of the water content in the topsoil is a dynamic property depending on various time scales. These gradients affected the measurements of radiometers and TDR probes to different degrees and at different times. Despite an almost smooth surface, slight changes in the surface structure during the experiment caused a substantial variability with respect to the relationships between water content and emissivity for both radiometers. This is an indication that surface structures smaller than the wavelength may exert important effects on the emissivity of a bare soil.	gradient;hysteresis;maxima and minima;microwave;optical time-domain reflectometer;polarization (waves);quantum superposition;spatial variability;the daily wtf	Katrin Schneeberger;Christian Stamm;Christian Mätzler;Hannes Flühler	2004	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2003.821058	meteorology;water content;hysteresis;polarization;hydrology;oscillation;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing;field research	Visualization	83.47243099187266	-63.898299692244635	17983

To understand a state of the system during a given period of time so called ‘the linear gradient frame’ technique was developed to search the stable characteristics for subareas. The search is based on analysis of geographic components, least-squares inversion and statistical estimators of seismic data. The stable subarea includes hypocenters of earthquakes, the space-time trajectories of which are restricted by a certain domain (seismic attractor). Fractal structures obtained in south of Iceland are in an agreement with geological history. The results are promising for the geothermal exploration.		Tatyana A. Smaglichenko;Alexander V.

Although many reflection models have bee n proposed, few take into account the wave nature of light. In t his paper, we derive a new class of reflection models for metallic surfaces that handle the effects of diffraction. Diffraction i s a purely wave-like phenomenon and cannot be properly modeled using t he ray theory of light alone. A common example of a surface which exhibits diffraction is the compact disk. A characteristic of such surfaces is that they reflect light in a very colorful manner. Our model is also a generalization of most reflection models encounter ed in computer graphics. In particular, we extend the He-Torranc e model to handle anisotropic reflections. This is achieved by reder iving, in a more general setting, results from surface wave physics which were taken for granted by other researchers. Specifically, o ur use of Fourier analysis has enabled us to tackle the difficult tas k of analytically computing the Kirchhoff integral of surface sca ttering.

We used the GOSAT and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) collocated data from different regions over the globe to analyze the relationship between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in the shortwave infrared (1.6 μm) band and the surface reflectance in the red (0.67 μm) band. Our results confirmed that the relationships between the surface reflectance at 0.67 μm and TOA reflectance at 1.6 μm are not constant for different surface conditions. Under low AOD conditions (AOD at 0.55 μm < 0.1), a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based regression function for estimating the surface reflectance of 0.67 μm band from the 1.6 μm band was summarized, and it achieved good performance, proving that the reflectance relations of the 0.67 μm and 1.6 μm bands are typically vegetation dependent. Since the NDVI itself is easily affected by aerosols, we combined the advantages of the Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI), which is aerosol resistant and highly correlated with regular NDVI, with our regression function, which can preserve the various correlations of 0.67 μm and 1.6 μm bands for different surface types, and developed a new surface reflectance and aerosol-free NDVI estimation algorithm, which we named the Modified AFRI1.6 algorithm. This algorithm was applied to AOD retrieval, and the validation results for our algorithm show that the retrieved AOD has a consistent relationship with AERONET measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.912, and approximately 67.7% of the AOD retrieved data were within the expected error range (± 0.1 ± 0.15AOD(AERONET)).	algorithm;coefficient;collocation;interference (communication);köppen climate classification;lambertian reflectance;lookup table;one-to-one (data model);sensor;time of arrival	Guosheng Zhong;Xiufeng Wang;Hiroshi Tani;Meng Guo;Anthony R.

The algorithm is based on an efficient scan-line algorithm for volume rendering of irregular meshes. This algorithm computes images by intersecting the mesh with successive planes defined through each scan line and perpendicular to the screen. These planes are called scan planes. Image coherency from one scan plane to the next, and within each scan plane, speeds up image computation. The proposed algorithm is a modified version of the scan-line algorithm, suitable for parallelization and for handling large data sets efficiently. Based on an efficiency analysis of this version, it is concluded that minimal additional computing and communication are required if each processor is given the task of computing sequences of successive lines in the image. Ways of achieving good load balancing on a group of heterogeneous workstations that have arbitrary loads by other users are suggested.<<ETX>>	algorithm;ct scan;central processing unit;computation;computer cluster;distributed computing;general-purpose markup language;load balancing (computing);network packet;parallel computing;rendering (computer graphics);scan line;scanline rendering;volume rendering;workstation	Christopher Giertsen;Johnny Petersen	1993	IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications	10.1109/38.252548	local area network;parallel processing;parallel computing;rendering;image processing;computer science;load balancing;theoretical computer science;operating system;parallel algorithm;volume rendering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	69.04546575506265	-53.22856681119285	18357

The importance of remote sensing in understanding the damage caused by natural disasters is quite significant, and many data sets were acquired after the events. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance and the potential of full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for damage assessment. Full polarimetric SAR images acquired by the spaceborne ALOS/PALSAR system from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on November 21, 2010 and April 8, 2011 and acquired by the airborne Pi-SAR2 system from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) on March 12 and 18, 2011 are used for this analysis. Model-based decomposition is applied and clearly shows the scattering mechanism changes at the seriously damaged downtown of Ishinomaki city and the flooded areas near the main stream of the Kitakami River. Polarization orientation angle is estimated to provide additional information to understand the damage effect in the built-up areas. Eigenvalue-eigenvector-based decomposition analysis is also employed to further confirm the scattering mechanism changes of the flooded areas. ALOS/PALSAR does not have fine enough resolution; however, the difference of the scattering mechanisms is sufficient to identify the damaged and flooded areas. In addition, the Pi-SAR2 data sets are used to analyze the flooded paddy fields in Natori city. The relative backscattering values are compared with the multitemporal images and the cross-polarization component (HV) is observed to be more sensitive to the flooded boundary. The automatically detected flooding maps using the cross-polarization component were found to provide relatively accurate results.	airborne ranger;aperture (software);map;polarimetry;polarization (waves);synthetic intelligence	Motoyuki Sato;Si-Wei Chen;Makoto Satake	2012	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2012.2200649	meteorology;synthetic aperture radar;physics;remote sensing	Vision	81.23441811595771	-60.518647035096635	18391

The method estimates the blur kernel by an alternative algorithm at scales from coarse to fine. After the blur kernel is estimated in the finest scale, the blurred image is restored via image deconvolution. To remove the ringing artifacts, we propose a smooth regions constraint. Combining with the noise prior, image statistical prior and image sparse representation, the smooth region constraints can be used to suppress the ringings in the image deconvolution. The proposed method can estimate the accurate blur kernel and restore the high quality image with ringing removing. Various comparative results demonstrate the efficiency of our method.	algorithm;blind deconvolution;box blur;deblurring;display resolution;gaussian blur;kernel (operating system);ringing (signal);ringing artifacts;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Jiangyong Duan;Gaofeng Meng;Shiming Xiang;Chunhong Pan	2013	2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ACPR.2013.127	image restoration;computer vision;mathematical optimization;gaussian blur;pattern recognition;mathematics	Vision	57.374140691980145	-69.75817121272966	18509

One of the most important requirements for an objective method for video quality measurement is that it should provide consistent performances over a wide range of video sequences that are not used in the designing stage. By analyzing subjective scores of various video sequences, we found that the human visual system is sensitive to degradation around edges. In other words, when edge areas of a video are blurred, evaluators tend to give low scores to the video even though the overall mean squared error is not so large. Based on this observation, we propose an objective video quality measurement method that measures degradation around edges. In the proposed method, we first apply an edge detection algorithm to videos and find edge areas. Then, we measure degradation of those edge areas by computing mean squared error. From this mean squared error, we compute the PSNR and use it as video quality metric. Experimental results show that the proposed method compares favorably with the current objective methods for video quality measurement. Furthermore, when the proposed method is applied to test video sequences that are not used in the designing stage, it still consistently provides satisfactory performances.© (2004) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

An acoustic tomography experiment, supported by European MAST contracts, has been carried out in the all occidental Mediterranean sea. During 10 months in 1994, acoustic phase shift keying signals have been emitted at a pulse rate of 1 per 4 hours and received by seven sources-receivers localized in the all basin and spaced by several hundred kilometers. In addition, signals from two of these sources localized near Corse and Sardinia were received on a vertical array moored at 800 m depth near Nice. So, it means a joint assessment of arrival angles and times of acoustic signals and a useful improvement in the general problem of identification of acoustic paths. Signals received on 16 hydrophones of this 40 meters long array were recorded and processed to extract the propagation time and arrival angle of each ray path. This paper reports the results of the analysis of these last data records and discusses the observation of wave fronts at each hydrophone depth, tractability, and study of arrival peaks as a function of time and angle.	acoustic cryptanalysis;ct scan;tomography	Claire Noël;Christophe Viala;François Evennou;Yann Stéphan;François Regis Martin-Lauzer	1995		10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479421	telecommunications;computer science;acoustic emission;phase-shift keying;signal processing;tomography	NLP	82.01507876584287	-66.72840826939067	18515
39ec66caa4cfeb744b5f60a032a3fa2ace3e4ab2	combined landsat and l-band sar data improves land cover classification and change detection in dynamic tropical landscapes		Robust quantitative estimates of land use and land cover change are necessary to develop policy solutions and interventions aimed towards sustainable land management. Here, we evaluated the combination of Landsat and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate land use/cover change in the dynamic tropical landscape of Tanintharyi, southern Myanmar. We classified Landsat and L-band SAR data, specifically Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), using Random Forests classifier to map and quantify land use/cover change transitions between 1995 and 2015 in the Tanintharyi Region. We compared the classification accuracies of single versus combined sensor data, and assessed contributions of optical and radar layers to classification accuracy. Combined Landsat and L-band SAR data produced the best overall classification accuracies (92.96% to 93.83%), outperforming individual sensor data (91.20% to 91.93% for Landsat-only; 56.01% to 71.43% for SAR-only). Radar layers, particularly SAR-derived textures, were influential predictors for land cover classification, together with optical layers. Landscape change was extensive (16,490 km2; 39% of total area), as well as total forest conversion into agricultural plantations (3214 km2). Gross forest loss (5133 km2) in 1995 was largely from conversion to shrubs/orchards and tree (oil palm, rubber) plantations, and gross gains in oil palm (5471 km2) and rubber (4025 km2) plantations by 2015 were mainly from conversion of shrubs/orchards and forests. Analysis of combined Landsat and L-band SAR data provides an improved understanding of the associated drivers of agricultural plantation expansion and the dynamics of land use/cover change in tropical forest landscapes.	aperture (software);compositing;decision tree;l band;phased array;preprocessor;radar;random forest;region of interest;sensor;synergy;synthetic data;tree (data structure)	Jose Don T.

Firstly, the source images are decomposed into low-frequency coefficients and high-frequency coefficients by the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). Then, the high-frequency coefficients are fused by the maximum selection fusion rule. The low-frequency coefficients are fused by weighted average method based on regions, and the weights are estimated by the PSO to gain optimal fused images. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by the inverse DTCWT. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed image fusion method can illustrate better performance than the methods based on the DTCWT, the support value transform (SVT), and the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT).	algorithm;coefficient;complex wavelet transform;contourlet;experiment;image fusion;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator	Junli Tao;Shutao Li;Bin Yang	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14831-6_40	computer vision;mathematical optimization;continuous wavelet transform;pattern recognition;mathematics;stationary wavelet transform;image fusion	Vision	59.05009953075872	-67.1518327565879	18559

This work extends the previous observations of the much stronger 2011 Japan tsunami. The distance offshore at which the tsunami can be detected, and hence the warning time provided, depends primarily on the bathymetry: the wider the shallow continental shelf, the greater this time. The weak Indonesia tsunamis were detected successfully in spite of the narrow shallow-water shelf offshore from the radar systems. Larger tsunamis could obviously be detected further from the coast. This paper provides further confirmation that radar is an important tool to aid in tsunami observation and warning.

By exploring the said priors of natural image statistics in 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, we reveal the limitations of these statistics for images with highly directional edges or large smooth areas. Then, we derive a novel two-step estimation scheme for noise variance: 1) in preliminary estimation, an integration of wavelet and nondirectional DCT transform is used to alleviate the influence of image's structures and 2) a noise-injection rectification is further devised to deal with the noise-free image contents. A simulation and comparative study demonstrates that this algorithm reliably infers noise variance and its robustness over wide ranges of visual content and noise levels, while outperforming some relevant methods. This paper can significantly improve the performance of existing denoising techniques that require the noise variance as a critical parameter.	algorithm;chou's invariance theorem;database;discrete cosine transform;image rectification;noise (electronics);noise reduction;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;rectifier;scene statistics;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet;wavelet transform	Chongwu Tang;Xiaokang Yang;Guangtao Zhai	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2380196	gradient noise;wavelet noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;computer vision;estimation;speech recognition;value noise;noise measurement;noise;discrete cosine transform;mathematics;statistics;wavelet transform	Vision	56.342750958922785	-67.15814097341222	18590

This algorithm is inspired by recent progress in the matrix completion field. Firstly, corresponding to the RGB channels, an input incomplete image is treated as three incomplete matrices. Then each matrix is recovered by solving a convex relaxation problem using the nuclear norm. In this process, an alternating direction method (ADM) is employed, which is quite easily implementable and able to achieve an optimal solution for the problem efficiently. The experiments show that our methodology is fast and effective and the proposed algorithm is able to handle various applications, such as image restoration, object removal and image denoising.	algorithm;circuit restoration;clone tool;experiment;image restoration;linear programming relaxation;noise reduction;the matrix	Wei Li;Lei Zhao;Duanqing Xu;Dongming Lu	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738144	image warping;image restoration;computer vision;mathematical optimization;feature detection;discrete mathematics;computer science;mathematics;non-local means	Vision	56.734657877748425	-71.96895725155046	18602

However, because it usually imitates corresponding adjusting knobs of a Color TV, and thus, corresponds to mid 20th century scope of engineering, adjusting one of the parameters affects all three parameters, and modification of Brightness or Contrast does not preserve chromatic coordinates. A person should be very experienced with the sequential control operations in order to get a result equivalent to a simple expocorrection. A set of new generation algorithms described in this paper is free from the above-mentioned defects and includes: Brightness and Contrast editing which does not affect chromatic coordinates; Local Contrast editing that causes only minor modification of Global Dynamic Range; Global Dynamic Range modification which affects neither chromatic coordinates, nor Local Dynamic Range; and Saturation modification which affects neither Brightness, nor Hue. The efficiency of color image editing software depends on the choice of a basic CCS (Color Coordinate System). A CCS that is effective for one editing procedure might be less effective for another. This paper presents a set of correlated CCSs with a specification of their preferable area of application.	algorithm;image editing	Sergey N.

In this paper, we propose a novel scaling watermarking scheme in which the watermark is embedded in the low-frequency wavelet coefficients to achieve improved robustness. We demonstrate that these coefficients have significantly non-Gaussian statistics that are efficiently described by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). By modeling the coefficients using the GMM, we calculate the distribution of watermarked noisy coefficients analytically and we design a Maximum Likelihood (ML) watermark detector using channel side information. Also, we extend the proposed watermarking scheme to a blind version. Consequently, since the efficiency of the proposed method is dependent on the good selection of the scaling factor, we propose L-curve method to find the tradeoff between the imperceptibility and robustness of the watermarked data. Experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed scheme and the performance improvement in utilizing the new strategy in comparison with the some recently proposed techniques.	digital watermarking;image scaling;mixture model	Maryam Amirmazlaghani;Mansoor Rezghi;Hamidreza Amindavar	2015	Expert Syst.

The Regression and Elevation-based Flood Information eXtraction (REFIX) model is based on regression analysis and uses a remotely sensed flood extent and a high-resolution floodplain digital elevation model to compute flood depths for a given flood event. The root mean squared error of the REFIX, compared to ground-surveyed high water marks, is 18 cm for the January 2003 flood event on the River Alzette floodplain (G.D. of Luxembourg), on which the model is developed. Applying the same methodology on a reach of the River Mosel, France, shows that for some more complex river configurations (in this case, a meandering river reach that contains a number of hydraulic structures), piecewise regression is required to yield more accurate flood water-line estimations. A comparison with a simulation from the Hydrologic Engineering Centers River Analysis System hydraulic flood model, calibrated on the same events, shows that, for both events, the REFIX model approximates the water line reliably	digital elevation model;flood fill;image resolution;information extraction;mean squared error;mosel vitelic corporation;segmented regression;simulation;steady state	Guy J.-P.

4ad76a88a3d8dfef9bcefcd353d5603e01fe4fcc	quality improvement of tone mapped images by tmqi-ii based optimization for the jpeg xt standard	high dynamic range image;jpeg xt;tmqi ii	This paper proposes a quality improvement method of tone mapped images including compression distortion for the JPEG XT standard, which is a new compression standard for high dynamic range (HDR) images. HDR images are generally required to be mapped to low dynamic range (LDR) ones due to the limitation of display devices. Furthermore, the HDR ones include some compression distortion to be efficiently stored, in most cases. However, conventional tone mapping operations have not considered the effect of the distortion. We apply an iterative gradient ascend algorithm for improving the structural fidelity, which is based on the improved tone mapped image quality index (TMQI-II), under the use of the JPEG XT standard. Decompressed algorithm and the results are compared with those of original HDR ones. The experiment confirms that the images with better quality than images without optimization are provided by the proposed method and the quality is close to that of ones generated from the original HDR image without compression distortion.	ascend;algorithm;compression artifact;data compression;distortion;gradient;high dynamic range;high-dynamic-range imaging;high-dynamic-range rendering;image quality;iterative method;jpeg;ldraw;mathematical optimization;tone mapping	Artit Visavakitcharoen;Yuma Kinoshita;Hiroyuki Kobayashi;Hitoshi Kiya	2016	2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)	10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824749	computer vision;computer science;engineering drawing;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	60.41210355855946	-61.97917135343615	19161

The inconsistency in light source direction resulted from image forgery is used to identify image authenticity. According to the error function of the actual light intensity and calculated light intensity and the constraint function of infinite light source to light beam, Hestenes-Powell multiplier method is used to calculate the light source direction of different objects and their background in infinite light source images. The image authenticity is determined based on the consistency between the light source direction of the object and its background. Experimental results showed that the authenticity of infinite light source images could be identified by the inconsistency in light source direction and the detection rate can reach 83.7%. The performance in terms of detection rate and time complexity of the proposed blind identification is superior to that of the existed method.	constraint (mathematics);powell's method;time complexity	Haipeng Chen;Xuanjing Shen;Yingda Lv	2010	2010 Fifth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology	10.1109/FCST.2010.90	time complexity;algorithm design;computer vision;computer science;lighting;reflectivity;light beam;computational complexity theory;algorithm;pixel;computer graphics (images)	Vision	54.8602806309396	-60.771001240108504	19162

The purpose is to recovery missing data of a damaged area. The key point is to decompose an image in its bit-planes, and to process bits rather than pixels. We propose two texture synthesis methods for restoration. The first one is a random generation process, based on the conditional probability of bits in the bit-planes. It is designed for images with stochastic textures. The second one is a best-matching method, running on each bit-plane, that is well suited to synthesize periodic patterns. Results are compared with a state-of-the-art restoration algorithm.	algorithm;bit plane;circuit restoration;grayscale;missing data;optical mesh network;pixel;procedural generation;texture synthesis	Edoardo Ardizzone;Haris Dindo;Giuseppe Mazzola	2007	2007 Third International IEEE Conference on Signal-Image Technologies and Internet-Based System	10.1109/SITIS.2007.84	iterative reconstruction;image texture;image restoration;stochastic process;algorithm design;computer vision;conditional probability;missing data;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;probability;mathematics;texture synthesis;pixel;statistics	Vision	54.55929386808475	-59.95622150418666	19194

By coordinating these tools, image system designers can visualize the consequences of altering lens parameters. We describe the critical computational issues we addressed in converting lens design calculations into a format that could be used to model image information as it flows through the imaging pipeline from capture to display. The lens design software calculates information about relative illumination, geometrical distortion, and the wavelength and field height dependent optical point spread functions (PSF). These data are read by the image systems simulation tool, and they are used to transform the multispectral input radiance into a multispectral irradiance image at the sensor. Because the optical characteristics of lenses frequently vary significantly across the image field, the process is not shift-invariant. Hence, the method is computationally intense and includes a number of parameters and methods designed to reduce artifacts that can arise in shift-variant filtering. The predicted sensor irradiance image includes the effects of geometric distortion, relative illumination, vignetting, pupil aberrations, as well as the blurring effects of monochromatic and chromatic aberrations, and diffraction.	artifact (software development);digital camera;digital image;distortion;image quality;monochrome;multispectral image;ray tracing (graphics);simulation software;systems simulation	Patrick Y.

The quality control of composite multilayered materials and structures using nondestructive tests is of high interest for numerous applications in the aerospace and aeronautics industry. One of the established nondestructive methods uses microwaves to reveal defects inside a three-dimensional (3-D) object. Recently, there has been a tendency to extrapolate this method to higher frequencies (going to the subterahertz spectrum) which could lead to higher resolutions in the obtained 3-D images. Working at higher frequencies reveals challenges to deal with the increased data rate and to efficiently and effectively process and evaluate the obtained 3-D imagery for defect detection and recognition. To deal with these two challenges, we combine compressive sensing (for data rate reduction) with a dedicated image processing methodology for a fast, accurate, and robust quality evaluation of the object under test. We describe in detail the used methodology and evaluate the obtained results using subterahertz data acquired of two calibration samples with a frequency modulated continuous wave system. The applicability of compressive sensing within this context is discussed as well as the quality of the image processing methodology dealing with the reconstructed images.	compressed sensing;image processing;semi-supervised learning;software bug	Anna Brook;Edison Cristofani;Mathias Becquaert;Ben Lauwens;Joachim Jonuscheit;Marijke Vandewal	2013	J.

From the results of the image analysis by utilizing fully or quad. polarimetric SAR data set, it is found that strong double-bounce scattering can be observed at the vicinity of the boundary region between water area and the surrounding emerged-plants area. This peculiar scattering feature is utilized as a useful marker for estimating the water area change. To verify the generating mechanism of the double-bounce scattering, the Finite-Difference TimeDomain (FDTD) polarimetric scattering analysis is also carried out for a simplified water-emergent boundary model. The dependency of the polarimetric scattering feature on the variation of the radar incident angle, the change of the biomass and material parameters of the surrounding emerged-plants is investigated. Resultantly, it is confirmed from the detailed FDTD analysis that by using the proposed technique, one can estimate the true water area change in wetland and its surrounding area in all seasons.	emergence;finite difference;finite-difference time-domain method;image analysis;polarimetry	Ryoichi Sato;Yoshio Yamaguchi;Hiroyoshi Yamada	2009	2009 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5417511	finite-difference time-domain method;image analysis;synthetic aperture radar;biomass;hydrology;finite difference method;optics;data analysis;radar imaging;physics;vegetation;seasonality;remote sensing	Robotics	80.90035860126126	-59.33324377403826	19292

In this letter, we exploited the minimum mean square error to establish a linear rule between the values of the filtered pixels and their variances. Then, the filtered pixel for infinite number of looks (INL) was predicted by linear regression of means and variances for various window sizes. The results show that the proposed INL-prediction filter improved the filtering performances of the original filters.

In this paper, we present an image restoration model by introducing a novel edge-continuous overlapping group sparsity regularizer (EC-OGS), based on our observation that the non-zero entries in an image gradient domain often distribute along its edges. The model is solved by the ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers), where a fast novel algorithm is proposed for computing the proximal operator in solving the subproblem with EC-OGS regularizer. The proposed model can be applied to various image restoration tasks including denoising, deblurring, and edge-detecting. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of PSNR, visual effect and edge preserving. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas the former utilizes partial differential equation (PDE) techniques to solve the image irradiance equation, the latter can be expressed as a linear system of equations in surface derivatives when 3 or more images are given. It therefore seems that current photometric stereo techniques do not extract all possible depth information from each image by itself. This paper utilizes PDE techniques for the solution of the combined Shape-from-Shading and photometric stereo problem when only 2 images are available. Extending our previous results on this problem, we consider the more realistic perspective projection of surfaces during the photographic process. Under these assumptions, there is a unique weak (Lipschitz continuous) solution to the problem at hand, solving the well known convex/concave ambiguity of the Shape-from-Shading problem. We propose two approximation schemes for the numerical solution of this problem, an up-wind finite difference scheme and a Semi-Lagrangian scheme, and analyze their properties. We show that both schemes converge linearly and accurately reconstruct the original surfaces. In comparison with a similar method for the orthographic 2-image photometric stereo, the proposed perspective one outperforms the orthographic one. We also demonstrate the method on real-life images. Our results thus show that using methodologies common in the field of Shape-from-Shading it is possible to recover more depth information for the photometric stereo problem under the more realistic perspective projection assumption.	photometric stereo;shading	Roberto Mecca;Ariel Tankus;Alfred M.

To do this, registration error is very important since it affects to final high resolution (HR) image quality. We took the threshold value from maximum motion compensation error (MMCE) to evaluate the suitability of the input image candidates. If the motion compensation error (MCE) between input low resolution (LR) image and reference input LR image is in range of 0<MCE<MMCE then that input LR image is selected and otherwise that input LR image are neglected. And we selected the reference input LR (SRILR) image by comparing the number of the selected input LR (SILR) images for each reference input LR (RILR) images. Finally, the HR image is generated from restoration and reconstruction block which based on the Hardie algorithm by using SRILR and SILR images. Our proposal algorithm is expected to improve the quality of super resolution (SR) without user participation and it will apply to moving picture.	super-resolution imaging	Hyo-Moon Cho;Dong-Kyun Park;Dong-Chul Kang;Il Sung;Sang-Bock Cho;Jong-Hwa Lee	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74282-1_142	computer vision;simulation;image resolution;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.728904529166634	-58.579442914945396	19648

However, care must be taken not to confuse other absorptions for those caused by the presence of pigments. Atmospheric correction, usually the first step to making products from hyperspectral data, may not completely remove Fraunhofer lines and atmospheric absorption bands and these absorptions may interfere with identification of phytoplankton accessory pigments. Furthermore, the ability to resolve absorption bands depends on the spectral resolution of the spectrometer, which for a fixed spectral range also determines the number of observed bands. Based on this information, a study was undertaken to determine under what circumstances a hyperspectral sensor may determine the presence of pigments. As part of the study a hyperspectral imager was used to take high spectral resolution data over two different water masses. In order to avoid the problems associated with atmospheric correction this data was analyzed as radiance data without atmospheric correction. Here, the purpose was to identify spectral regions that might be diagnostic for photosynthetic pigments. Two well proven techniques were used to aid in absorption band recognition, the continuum removal of the spectra and the fourth derivative. The findings in this study suggest that interpretation of absorption bands in remote sensing data, whether atmospherically corrected or not, have to be carefully reviewed when they are interpreted in terms of photosynthetic pigments.	airborne ranger;bands;image sensor;imager device component;phytoplankton;pigmentation;spectrometers;triune continuum paradigm;water	Karl H.

Thus, it is crucial to achieve brightness temperature (Tb) measurement consistency among the constellation as well as to maintain sustained calibration accuracy over the lifetime of each satellite sensor. In-orbit inter-satellite radiometric calibration techniques provide a long term, group-wise solution; however, since radiometers operate at different frequencies and viewing angles,Tb normalizations are made before making intermediate comparisons of their near-simultaneous measurements. In this paper, we investigate two approaches to perform these normalizations from one satellite's measurements to another. One approach is uses Taylor's series expansion around source frequency to predict Tb's of destination frequency. The relationship between Tb's and frequencies are derived from simulations using an oceanic radiative transfer model (RTM) over a wide variety of environmental conditions. The other approach uses a multi-variable linear regression built from RTMTb simulations among all frequency and V- and H-polarizations. These two approaches are applied in comparing external measurements between WindSat (on Coriolis),TMI (on TRMM) and AMSR (on ADEOS-II). Accuracy prediction and error source analysis are discussed along with calibration results.	metric;microwave;series expansion;simulation;terabyte	Liang Hong;W.

6cf5a39bf2885dec565a02f196a42a3213194bca	fast isar cross-range scaling using modified newton method		This paper proposes a fast and novel cross-range scaling algorithm for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging. The rotational motion of the target unavoidably results in high-order phase errors that blur the ISAR image. To achieve the cross-range scaling and compensate the quadratic phase error, the rotational velocity and rotational center of the target are jointly estimated by optimizing the ISAR image quality in terms of either entropy or contrast. Since it is a two-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem, the grid search is generally computationally inefficient and inaccurate. To improve the computational efficiency, a modified Newton method is introduced by adjusting the Hessian to be positively definite to ensure the iterative optimization process in a correct direction. The proposed algorithm offers the following desirable advantageous features. First, it automatically compensates the quadratic phase errors jointly with the scaling process to improve the image quality. Second, it is a data-driven, rather than image-driven, process that does not depend on the quality of ISAR image. It also performs satisfactorily for the sparse aperture data, while most other algorithms are invalid. The modified Newton method ensures fast convergence. For example, our numerical experiments achieve a precision of  $ \bf {10^{-6}}$ with less than ten iterations. Last but not least, the proposed algorithm is robust to noise because our experiments show that it is still effective when signal-to-noise ratio is as low as $-$10 dB.	algorithm;aperture (software);backtracking line search;computation;experiment;gaussian blur;hessian;image quality;image scaling;iteration;iterative method;mathematical optimization;newton's method;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;real-time clock;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development)	Shuanghui Zhang;Yongxiang Liu;Xiang Li;Guoan Bi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2017.2785560	control theory;inverse synthetic aperture radar;mathematics;nonlinear programming;hyperparameter optimization;radar imaging;image quality;aperture;scaling;newton's method	Vision	58.46221561130812	-74.1704073426008	19921
894ec99f496b0661ac4c5b43180cdeedca474d5b	anti-aliasing filters for deriving high-accuracy dems from tls data: a case study from freeport, texas	anti aliasing;regridding;downsampling;tls;dem;lidar	Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), also known as ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), has been frequently applied to build bare-earth digital elevation models (DEMs) for high-accuracy geomorphology studies. The point clouds acquired from TLS often achieve a spatial resolution at fingerprint (e.g., 3 cm×3 cm) to handprint (e.g., 10 cm×10 cm) level. A downsampling process has to be applied to decimate the massive point clouds and obtain manageable DEMs. It is well known that downsampling can result in aliasing that causes different signal components to become indistinguishable when the signal is reconstructed from the datasets with a lower sampling rate. Conventional DEMs are mainly the results of upsampling of sparse elevation measurements from land surveying, satellite remote sensing, and aerial photography. As a consequence, the effects of aliasing caused by downsampling have not been fully investigated in the open literature of DEMs. This study aims to investigate the spatial aliasing problem of regridding dense TLS data. The TLS data collected from the beach and dune area near Freeport, Texas in the summer of 2015 are used for this study. The core idea of the anti-aliasing procedure is to apply a low-pass spatial filter prior to conducting downsampling. This article describes the successful use of a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass spatial filter employed in the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software package as an anti-aliasing filter. The filter can be applied as an isotropic filter with a single cutoff wavelength or as an anisotropic filter with two different cutoff wavelengths in the X and Y directions. The cutoff wavelength for the isotropic filter is recommended to be three times the grid size of the target DEM.	aliasing;anti-aliasing filter;transport layer security	Lin Xiong;Guoquan Wang;Paul Wessel	2017	Computers & Geosciences	10.1016/j.cageo.2016.11.006	lidar;upsampling;digital elevation model;geology;computer science;transport layer security;remote sensing;computer graphics (images)	HCI	78.9159137935849	-62.74333988342364	19936

The solution minimizes the squared error between the original MS image and the fusion result obtained by spatially enhancing a degraded version of the MS image through a degraded version, by the same scale factor, of the Pan image. The fusion result is also optimal at full scale under the assumption of invariance of the fusion parameters across spatial scales. The following two versions of the algorithm are presented: a local mmse (lmmse) solution and a fast implementation which globally optimizes the fusion parameters with a moderate performance loss with respect to the lmmse version. We show that the proposed method is computationally practical, even in the case of local optimization, and it outperforms the best state-of-the-art Pan-sharpening algorithms, as resulted from the IEEE Data Fusion Contest 2006, on true Ikonos and QuickBird data and on simulated Pleiades data.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);full scale;image resolution;local search (optimization);mathematical optimization;multispectral image;pleiades (supercomputer);spatial scale;test set	Andrea Garzelli;Filippo Nencini;Luca Capobianco	2008	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.907604	computer vision;image resolution;statistics;remote sensing;global optimization	Vision	68.50445643612235	-64.86348519316145	20080

The method is based on the representation of a rough and nonuniform air-sea interface by multilayer transition dielectric structures with characteristic impedances. The impedance of the sea surface is defined as a function of electromagnetic and many geophysical parameters (statistical, deterministic) including surface wave spectrum, sea surface salinity, and temperature. It is assumed that an impedance approach is more robust, convenient, and easy to use for analysis of real world microwave radiometric data. In particular, impacts of sea surface roughness on emissivity can be described and illuminated much better than by using other microwave emission models or approximations. Some applications for the retrieval purposes are discussed as well.	approximation;characteristic impedance;l band;microwave;nominal impedance;spectral density;surface wave	Victor Y.

2d61d5e69ad150d67d3631598c117f398d8ce1c2	reduction of the ground reflection effect on an l-band polarimetic active radar calibrator for airborne and spaceborne calibration		This paper presents a technique to reduce the specular reflection effect from the ground surface to an L-band dual-polarized Single Antenna Polarimetric Active Radar Calibrator (SAPARC) with high and stable RCS (55 dBsm) by the means of using a dihedral centered at the specular point. The SAPARC uses a single antenna and a precision Ortho-Mode Transducer (OMT) to isolate between transmit and receive paths. The system is designed to achieve a 30 dB signal-to-clutter ratio while operating in free space. Degradation of such high signal-to-clutter ratio happens due to the side lobe absorption of the specular reflection from the ground. To reduce the effect of such strong reflection, it is proposed to use a dihedral positioned at the specular point on the ground covering the Fresnel zone of the SAPARC antenna. The received field is reduced by an average of 25 dB over most of angular range of interest.	acoustic lobing;airborne ranger;angularjs;clutter;decibel;elegant degradation;l band;orthomode transducer;polarimetry;revision control system	Mostafa Zaky;Mani Kashanianfard;Kamal Sarabandi	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519048	remote sensing;radar imaging;polarimetry;side lobe;fresnel zone;radar;computer science;specular reflection;transducer;l band;optics	Embedded	80.84535941086767	-66.04280132851467	20130

9022e2c0172377e2f615090d4205f97c96d0aeb5	reflectance reference target at järvselja, estonia for the calibration of optical remote sensing sensors and lessons learned		Abstract A calibration target for the support of airborne and satellite measurements was built at the Jarvselja site for ecological and remote sensing studies located in southeastern Estonia. The calibration target is a 10 × 10 m concrete panel which is protected by a removable roof. Optical properties of the panel are carefully studied in order to serve as a reference in spectroscopic remote sensing measurements. In this study we report the spectral distribution of reflectance in the wavelength range of 350–2500 nm, the angular distribution of directional reflectance and the linear polarization of the reflected radiation. The reflectance spectrum of the panel is smooth in the visible and NIR wavelengths but with steep decrease at wavelengths less than 400 nm. Variations of reflectance over the panel surface are less than 1%. The radiation is partly polarized in forward scattering direction. No temporal changes of optical properties have been observed. The calibration target improves the metrological quality of airborne spectral measurements at the Jarvselja test site and neighboring areas. It can also be used for ground truth to aid the validation of adjacency correction algorithms for data from high spatial resolution satellite images, as well as a reference for the registration of airborne and satellite images. It can also serve as an elevation reference for both lidar and radar altimeter measurements.	sensor	Andres Kuusk;Joel Kuusk;Mait Lang;Jouni Peltoniemi;Maria Gritsevich;Jan Pisek	2018	Int. J.

In this paper, we present three significant improvements to Gabor noise: 1) an isotropic kernel for Gabor noise, which speeds up isotropic Gabor noise with a factor of roughly two, 2) an error analysis of Gabor noise, which relates the kernel truncation radius to the relative error of the noise, and 3) spatially varying Gabor noise, which enables spatial variation of all noise parameters. These improvements make Gabor noise an even more attractive alternative for the existing noise functions.	approximation error;error analysis (mathematics);http 404;kernel (operating system);noise shaping;noise-induced hearing loss;protein truncation abnormality;quantum decoherence;signal-to-noise ratio;speed (motion)	Ares Lagae;Sylvain Lefebvre;Philip Dutré	2011	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2010.238	gradient noise;gaussian noise;gabor transform;spatial variability;computer vision;kernel;speech recognition;colors of noise;visualization;gabor–wigner transform;value noise;noise measurement;noise;harmonic analysis;pattern recognition;mathematics;hankel transform;convolution;computer graphics;gabor wavelet;frequency domain;salt-and-pepper noise;symmetric function	Visualization	62.74458342547199	-70.91842287813557	20203

Under some assumptions that are considered realistic for sparse or high-contrast signals, the criterion is that the true source signals can be perfectly recovered by finding the extreme points of some observation-constructed convex set. In our last work we also developed methods for fulfilling the CAMNS criterion, but only for two to three sources. In this paper we propose a systematic linear programming (LP) based method that is applicable to any number of sources. The proposed method has two advantages. First, its dependence on LP means that the method does not suffer from local minima. Second, the maturity of LP solvers enables efficient implementation of the proposed method in practice. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.	blind signal separation;capability maturity model;convex analysis;convex set;effective method;linear programming;maxima and minima;simulation;sparse matrix	Tsung-Han Chan;Wing-Kin Ma;Chong-Yung Chi;Yue Joseph Wang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518404	convex analysis;extreme point;mathematical optimization;index term;linear programming;machine learning;maxima and minima;pattern recognition;mathematics;blind signal separation;convex set	Robotics	57.42212282944032	-73.60625248357414	20212

The proposed technique exploits the polar change vector analysis method and assumes that the reference data for characterizing a specific change of interest are available only for a pair of images (source domain). Then, it exploits the knowledge learned from the source domain and adapts it to other pairs of images belonging to the time series (target domains) to be analyzed. The proposed technique is able to handle possible radiometric differences among images adapting in an unsupervised way the decision rule estimated on the source domain to the target domains through variables estimated directly on the target images. The proposed approach has been applied to two data sets made up of time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper images. In one case, the change of interest is related to evolution of deforestation, while in the other case, it is related to burned area detection. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.	change vector;domain adaptation;map;relevance;semi-supervised learning;sensor;stationary process;time series;unsupervised learning	Daniel C.

Moreover, by theoretical and experimental analyzing, we demonstrate the second is the best performance fractional differential mask of the proposed six ones. Finally, we discuss further the capability of multiscale fractional differential masks for texture enhancement. Experiments show that, for rich-grained digital image, the capability of nonlinearly enhancing complex texture details in smooth area by fractional differential-based approach appears obvious better than by traditional integral-based algorithms.	algorithm;bionics;digital data;digital image processing;experiment;fingerprint;mammography;masks;mathematics;medical image;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;real-time transcription;requirement;theory	Yi-Fei Pu;Jiliu Zhou;Xiao Yuan	2010	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2009.2035980	medical imaging;differential operator;computer vision;mathematical optimization;interpolation;computer science;calculus;mathematics;geometry;digital image	Vision	55.22629746608047	-67.08561392709058	20231

In the view synthesis techniques, depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) is an important method to generate virtual view from video-plus-depth sequence. However, some holes might be produced in the DIBR process. Many hole filling methods have been proposed to tackle this issue, but most of them cannot achieve globally coherent or acquire trusted contents. In this paper, a hole filling method with depth-guided global optimization is proposed for view synthesis. The global optimization is achieved by iterating the spatio-temporal approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and video reconstruction step. Directly applying global optimization might introduce some foreground artifacts to the synthesized video. To prevent this problem, some strategies have been developed in this paper. The depth information is applied to guide the spatio-temporal ANN searching and the initialization step is specified in the global optimization procedure. Our experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method has better performance compared with other methods in terms of visual quality, trusted textures, and temporal consistency in the synthesized video.	approximate computing;approximation algorithm;coherence (physics);data compression;global optimization;information theory;mathematical optimization;view synthesis;virtual reality	Guibo Luo;Yuesheng Zhu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847312	rendering (computer graphics);extrapolation;global optimization;view synthesis;computer vision;distributed computing;data compression;initialization;computer science;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;artificial intelligence;coherence (physics)	Vision	58.03651049245286	-56.166508720539426	20306

General properties of a desired morphological model are presented and special cases of the model are studied in detail. The presented approach is studied for modeling the morphology of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Specifically, three types of ECG modeling techniques, including polynomial spline models, sinusoidal model and a model previously presented by McSharry et al., are studied within this framework.

The technique is applied to aircraft synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of sea ice. In addition to finding the proportions of the classes, knowledge of the mixture components allows image displays tailored to a user's requirements.

The main conclusions are as follows: 1) The adjusted water indexes have a good correlation with VWC; 2) For a fixed spatial resolution and indices with same form, the longer wavelength remote sensing data were used, the better reversion performance would be achieved; 3) The trend of spatial variability of multiscale wheat moisture is consistent, which indicates that the adjusted vegetation water indexes have certain applicability in the North China Plain.	reversion (software development);spatial variability	Zhizhong Chen;Linna Chai;Wenxing Hu;Xiaojing Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128125	remote sensing;climatology;vegetation;reflectivity;computer science;moisture;inversion (meteorology);image resolution;water content;spatial variability	Embedded	83.98282403363488	-59.66649920783922	20405

Deconvolution algorithms, such as coherent CLEAN, do not perform well in these scenarios because of spurious peaks and peak mislocations. The problem is more serious when only a portion of the frequency spectrum is used for generating the range profile (i.e., 1-D imaging with thinned spectrum) because of high sidelobes. We propose a modification to the coherent CLEAN technique in which we use a point spread function (PSF) best suited for 1-D imaging. Upper bounds on the average location error have been derived for the proposed technique and extensive simulations have been carried out to corroborate the theory. The proposed technique has been found to work well even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.	algorithm;clean (algorithm);coherence (physics);deconvolution;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density	Ranjan Bose	2012	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2012.6178039	medical imaging;spectrum;frequency spectrum;electronic engineering;image resolution;computer science;deconvolution;point spread function;optical transfer function;mathematics;optics;upper and lower bounds;radar imaging;signal-to-noise ratio;bandwidth;physics;statistics	Visualization	75.77120269547585	-67.82299390768783	20414

The adaptive approach derives a noise signature from the noise order statistics and utilizes the signature to denoise the data. The novelty of this approach is in presenting a general-purpose denoising in the sense that it does not need to employ any particular assumption on the structure of the noise-free signal, such as data smoothness or sparsity of the coefficients. An advantage of the method is in denoising the corrupted data in any complete basis transformation (orthogonal or non-orthogonal). Experimental results show that the proposed method, called noise invalidation denoising (NIDe), outperforms existing denoising approaches in terms of mean square error (MSE).	coefficient;general-purpose modeling;mean squared error;noise reduction;sparse matrix	Soosan Beheshti;Masoud Hashemi;Xiao-Ping Zhang;Nima Nikvand	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2074199	order statistic;speech recognition;signal processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	Visualization	54.1040525785469	-67.28978177365079	20497

For the development, a large variety of HYPERION images including typical surface spectral signatures for Western, Central, South and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, as well as Northern Africa are used, also covering different seasonal and phenological conditions. This extensive database of hyperspectral imagery is then used to simulate the spectral responses of various multispectral sensors. Extending the approach from STEVEN et al. [1, 2], statistically robust models are developed in order to derive intercalibration factors for the specific sensor spectral responses. By applying these factors, differences caused by the spectral response functions of multispectral sensors can be reduced resulting in an increased consistency in multi-sensoral time series. This finding underpins the need for spaceborne imaging spectrometers such as HYPERION, the upcoming EnMAP and HISUI, and dedicated missions such as the proposed TRUTHS, which can be used as a direct reference for spectral and radiometric cross-calibration.	antivirus software;multispectral image;sensor;simulation;time series	Martin Bachmann;Tassilo Muller	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326399	full spectral imaging;meteorology;data modeling;calibration;hydrology;computer science;sensor;hyperspectral imaging;time series;multispectral pattern recognition;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	81.68649830045352	-60.48274717190936	20648

We also present some optimum methods including memory optimization, phase accumulator reduction and imaging scene segmentation to implement fast and large scene imaging. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the GPU-based method can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the original BP algorithm, about 80 times faster, while the imaging scene size same as the CPU-based BP algorithm.	accumulator (computing);algorithm;backpropagation;cuda;central processing unit;computation;computer graphics;experiment;graphics processing unit;mathematical optimization;numerically controlled oscillator;program optimization;scene graph	Xin Zhang;Xiaoling Zhang;Jun Shi;Zhe Liu	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049806	parallel processing;computer vision;kernel;synthetic aperture radar;index term;doppler effect;computer science;theoretical computer science;instruction set;image segmentation;processor register;coprocessor;computer graphics (images)	Vision	68.8754623641385	-57.7752531270399	20839

However, the conventional deformation models cannot be fully adapted to analysis of the complicated deformation process. Taking into account seasonal response and tectonic movement, this letter presents an integrated deformation model for separating deformation components through PSI time series, thus obtaining the linear deformation rate, the deformation acceleration and the seasonal deformation amplitude at each PS. An iterative solution method is proposed to estimate the parameters in the integrated model. The experiments are carried out for subsidence detection over the northwestern part of Tianjin (China) by using the 40 high-resolution TerraSAR-X SAR images acquired between 2009 and 2010 and the ground truth data collected by precise leveling at seven benchmarks and six man-made corner reflectors. The testing results indicate that the integrated model has better adaptability to the subsidence process in the study area than the conventional models. The further analysis shows that the deformation results derived from the iterative solution are in better agreement with the ground truth data. These demonstrate that the proposed methodology is effective for monitoring the surface deformation with remarkable nonlinear property.	experiment;ground truth;image resolution;iterative method;nonlinear system;synthetic data;time series	Rui Zhang;Guoxiang Liu;Tao Li;Lanxin Huang;Bing Yu;Qiang Chen;Zhilin Li	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2274474	acceleration;synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;hydrology;time series;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;physics;remote sensing	Vision	81.64673126626504	-60.54321135092555	20845

In this paper, we study and develop new methods to convert a general multichannel, multidimensional filter bank to a corresponding translation-invariant (TI) framework. In particular, we propose a generalized algorithme agrave trous, which is an extension of the algorithme agrave trous introduced for 1-D wavelet transforms. Using the proposed algorithm, as well as incorporating modified versions of directional filter banks, we construct the TI contourlet transform (TICT). To reduce the high redundancy and complexity of the TICT, we also introduce semi-translation-invariant contourlet transform (STICT). Then, we employ an adapted bivariate shrinkage scheme to the STICT to achieve an efficient image denoising approach. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits and potential of the proposed denoising approach.

Significant design changes over previous Landsat instruments have been made to these sensors to potentially enhance the quality of Landsat image data. TIRS, which is the focus of this study, is a dual-band instrument that uses a push-broom style architecture to collect data. To help understand the impact of design trades during instrument build, an effort was initiated to model TIRS imagery. The Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) tool was used to produce synthetic “on-orbit” TIRS data with detailed radiometric, geometric, and digital image characteristics. This work presents several studies that used DIRSIG simulated TIRS data to test the impact of engineering performance data on image quality in an effort to determine if the image data meet specifications or, in the event that they do not, to determine if the resulting image data are still acceptable.

This paper presents an extended error analysis of the retrieval of TQ ≡ Tv − Th by Yueh’s method. Analytical formulas are derived for the bias, standard deviation, and mean-squared error (MSE) of retrieved TQ, as functions of scene and radiometer parameters. These formulas are validated through independent calculation via Monte Carlo simulation. The formulas predict several interesting effects: (a) MSE is minimized by rotating the radiometer by 45◦ with respect to the natural polarization basis defined by the Earth’s surface, (b) TU from planetary surface radiation (of the magnitude expected on Earth) has a negligible effect on correction for polarization rotation, and (c) three-channel polarimetric radiometry (with the radiometer rotated by 45◦) has lower MSE than conventional two-channel radiometry that suffers no polarization rotation.	decibel;emoticon;error analysis (mathematics);leucaena pulverulenta;mean squared error;mental suffering;monte carlo method;navier–stokes equations;planetary scanner;polarimetry;polarization (waves);population parameter;radiometry;simulation;standard deviation;stokes parameters;tocopherylquinone	Derek L.

An important role of military oceanography (MILOC) is thus to provide a timely METOC characterization of denied littoral areas [1]. Environmental sampling procedures in MILOC must be easily relocatable, discreet, and secure. Until recently, marine sampling technologies meeting these requirements were scarce. Remote sensing is the technology mostly used by navies to assess environmental conditions in restricted areas [2]. Very-near-shore bathymetry, sea state, surface currents, ocean color, and sea surface temperature (SST) are among the pieces of environmental information that can be obtained by means of remote sensors. Although valuable, this information is not sufficient to fully assess the three-dimensional (3-D) variability of the environment. Numerical approaches that simulate the ocean dynamics may provide additional information on the environmental conditions. In the coastal regions, numerical ocean models of different spatiotemporal resolutions are generally nested to downscale METOC information to the region of interest [3]. Numerical procedures used to feed back dynamical information between the models with different resolutions inevitably introduce errors in this nesting process. In addition, at present, the uncertainties in physical parameterizations, forcing, and model initialization limit the accuracy of model forecasts.	bathymetry;downscaling;numerical analysis;numerical method;operating system;region of interest;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;spatial variability	Alberto Alvarez;Jacopo Chiggiato;Baptiste Mourre	2013	IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine	10.1109/MRA.2012.2220505	sampling;sea surface temperature;bathymetry	Robotics	78.47976664063788	-63.32155709170839	20950

Color differences, texture similarity, image complexity, etc. are taken into account to measure the distance between two images. Based on this distance, a dynamic programming algorithm is used to generate the best playing sequence which minimizes the sum of distances between successive images. The embedded image is naturally merged with the current one for smooth sequence through a graph-cut-guided blending strategy, and interframe coherence is maintained to avoid abrupt change. Experiments show that our approach is very effective on image collections of scenic spots.	algorithm;alpha compositing;cache coherence;cut (graph theory);database;display resolution;dynamic programming;embedded system;entity–relationship model;experiment;flickr;holographic principle;picasa;smoothing	Lin Cong;Ruofeng Tong;Jinxiang Dong	2010	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-010-9346-9	image texture;computer vision;mathematical optimization;cut;binary image;image processing;machine learning;dynamic programming;algorithm;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.83135043323338	-54.90290182383468	20954

To be specific, the visualization of sea oil spill is implemented with the adoption of texture projection method. The texture projection-induced jaggedly edge is displayed in the performance test results. Under the circumstance, Gauss smoothing filter is introduced to secure the smooth convergence of texture edge and thus bring forth satisfactory dynamic visualization effect.

The main algorithm is based on the theory of projections onto convex sets (POCS). The image and its wavelet transform are projected onto each other after applying suitable constraints in each domain. This technique exploits the frequency-spatial representation provided by wavelets and utilizes the correlation between the damaged area in the image and its neighborhood. The resulting restored area is homogeneous with its surrounding and preserves the aesthetics of the image. The same technique is used for simple video restoration problems. Video frames are stacked and treated as a 3-D volume, making a natural use of inter-frame correlation.	algorithm;circuit restoration;color image;convex set;frame (video);inpainting;wavelet transform	Kedar A.

Although a number of ecological studies have been conducted to realise this important objective, little information is available regarding the quantification of this land cover change. The role of mangroves as living barriers was under appreciated prior to the 2004 tsunami event. In this paper, we investigate the buffering functions of mangroves in the 2004 tsunami by employing the methodology developed in our companion paper. We focus more on mangrove distribution patterns in different buffer zones before and after the 2004 tsunami. The presence of mangroves before and after the event was statistically significant for the North ( x 154.08, p50.001) and Upper South ( x 62.25, p50.001). We observed positive linear relationships suggesting a loss of mangrove resulted into a gain of barren and sand land cover as a result of a devastating impact from the 2004 tsunami event. There are pockets of inland tsunami inundations and penetrations in the North and Upper-South in part owing to the river mouth profiles and dense mangrove trees. Although the North and Upper South Regions of the study area with large mangrove forest areas suffered slight damages, these regions put up a strong buffer against the tsunami suggesting that mangrove forests play a significant role in shoreline protection.	ecosystem	T.

Using previous investigations as a base, the Southern Great Plains Hydrology Experiment (SGP97) was designed and conducted to extend the algorithm to coarser resolutions, larger regions with more diverse conditions, and longer time periods. The L-band electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) was used for daily mappin of surface soil moisture over an area greater than 10000 km for a one month period. Results show that the soil moisture retrieval algorithm performed the same as in previous investigations, demonstrating consistency of both the retrieval and the instrument. Error levels were on the order of 3% for area integrated averages of sites used for validation. This result showed that for the coarser resolution used here that the theory and techniques employed in the algorithm apply at this scale. Spatial patterns observed in the Little Washita Watershed in previous investigations were also observed here. These results showed that soil texture dominated the spatial pattern at this scale. However, the regional soil moisture patterns were a reflection of the spatially variable rainfall and soil texture patterns were not as obvious.	algorithm;archive;compiler;experiment;kappa calculus;l band;microwave;molecular dynamics;numerical aperture;reflection (computer programming);sampling (signal processing);sensor;spatiotemporal pattern;topography;watershed (image processing);world wide web;xeon phi	Thomas J.

75ffb6dbd6f2fe70c84bf847ae9b0768c7730c7c	a new technique for phase-resolving ocean wave observations by spaceborne spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar		The retrieval of quantitative information on ocean waves from SAR images is a challenging problem because of the nonlinearities of the imaging mechanism, the presence of speckle noise, and the directional ambiguities associated with the interpretation of a SAR image as a single snapshot in time. We present a new methodology that overcomes some of these problems by utilizing spotlight-mode data from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed in combination with advanced subaperture processing. We are able to derive short time series of subaperture images, which show propagation directions and speeds of moving patterns. Then we can use Fourier analysis and a dispersion relation filter to separate actual ocean wave signatures from other contributions. This process is phase-preserving and lets us reconstruct short “videos” of the spatio-temporal evolution of the extracted wave signatures, which are easier to invert into surface slope and elevation fields than conventional SAR images.	cosmo-rs;dbpedia;fourier analysis;snapshot (computer storage);software propagation;synthetic data;time series;type signature	Roland Romeiser;Hans Graber	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517526	iterative reconstruction;elevation;computer vision;dispersion (optics);artificial intelligence;wind wave;dispersion relation;synthetic aperture radar;surface wave;computer science;speckle noise	Vision	76.0917606652066	-66.99542074884798	21190
c334b0c89a6ccc5f28c3c7553a6412524d2247c4	separating reflection and transmission images in the wild.		The reflections caused by common semi-reflectors, such as glass windows, can impact the performance of computer vision algorithms. State-of-the-art methods can remove reflections on synthetic data and in controlled scenarios. However, they are based on strong assumptions and do not generalize well to real-world images. Contrary to a common misconception, real-world images are challenging even when polarization information is used. We present a deep learning approach to separate the reflected and the transmitted components of the recorded irradiance, which explicitly uses the polarization properties of light. To train it, we introduce an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline, which simulates realistic reflections, including those generated by curved and non-ideal surfaces, non-static scenes, and high-dynamic-range scenes. Input Ours [1] [2] [3] T̂ T̂ T̂ T̂ R̂ R̂ R̂ R̂ Fig. 1: Glass surfaces are virtually unavoidable in real-world pictures. Our approach to separate the reflection and transmission layers, works even for general, curved surfaces, which break the assumptions of state-of-the-art methods.

However, there are also many algorithms in the image processing chain that can enhance the quality of an input image. These include procedures for contrast enhancement, deblurring, sharpening, up-sampling, denoising, transfer function compensation, and so on. In this paper, possible strategies for the QA of sharpened images are investigated. This task is not trivial, because the sharpening techniques can increase the perceived quality, as well as introduce artifacts leading to the quality drop (over-sharpening). Here, the framework specifically adapted for the QA of sharpened images and objective metrics comparison in this context is introduced. However, the framework can be adopted in other QA areas as well. The problem of selecting the correct procedure for subjective evaluation was addressed and a subjective test on blurred, sharpened, and over-sharpened images was performed in order to demonstrate the use of the framework. The obtained ground-truth data were used for testing the suitability of the state-of-the-art objective quality metrics for the assessment of sharpened images. The comparison was performed by novel procedure using rank order correlation analyses, which is found more appropriate for the task than standard methods. Furthermore, seven possible augmentations of the no-reference S3 metric adapted for sharpened images are proposed. The performance of the metric is significantly improved and also superior over the rest of the tested quality criteria with respect to the subjective data.	algorithm;deblurring;elegant degradation;entity name part qualifier - adopted;fda quality metrics terminology;ground state;ground truth;image processing;image quality;morphologic artifacts;noise reduction;quinolinic acid;sampling (signal processing);software quality assurance;transfer function	Lukas Krasula;Patrick Le Callet;Karel Fliegel;Milos Klima	2017	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2017.2651374	image quality;computer vision;mathematical optimization;pattern recognition;mathematics	Vision	62.615754111717095	-65.71922200391127	21213

Remote sensing systems based on UAS typically acquire massive hyper-spatial images in its short turnaround. This paper takes advantage of graphics processing unit (GPU) massive parallel computation in order to process the huge data timely and efficiently. More specifically, this paper presents an index array approach for lens distortion correction and geo-referencing. They are the two essential components in UAS hyper-spatial image processing. The index array approach is also capable of parallelizing image file I/O and the orthoimage generation. In addition, this paper presents the dual tiled similarity algorithm for the image co-registration. The index array approach and the dual tiled similarity algorithm were evaluated using two UAS remote sensing datasets of South Padre island shorelines. The results show that this index array approach was able to speed up at least 10 times the lens distortion correction and the geo-referencing relative to the central processing unit (CPU) computation. This dual tiled algorithm could provide 12 times speedup compared with the CPU similarity computation.	aerial photography;algorithm;big data;central processing unit;computation;computer graphics;distortion;experiment;geo (microformat);graphics processing unit;image file formats;image processing;input/output;padre;parallel computing;speedup;unmanned aerial vehicle	Lihong Su;Yuxia Huang;James C.

2576767e9f743211c889f04a50ef2b421570d2d0	a novel nsct fusion algorithm for images based on compressive sensing and dynamic wnmf		For the calculation complexity problem of image fusion based on traditional non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT), a novel NSCT fusion algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) and dynamic weighted non-negative matrix factorization (DWNMF) is proposed. Firstly, NSCT is employed to decompose source images, for band-pass directional sub-band coefficients which are featured with high calculation complexity, CS theory is applied to fuse them, meanwhile, the fusion approach based on DWNMF is employed to fuse low-pass sub-band coefficients. Secondly, the minimum total variation (min-TV) algorithm is adopted to reconstruct fused band-pass directional sub-band coefficients in CS domain, to get fused band-pass sub-band coefficients in NSCT domain. Finally, using the inverse NSCT transform to reconstruct fused low-pass and band-pass sub-images, to gain the final fused image. Simulation results show that, the proposed approach can not only improve the fusion effect, but also reduce the calculation complexity.	algorithm;compressed sensing	Yanyan Wu;Yajie Wang;Linlin Wang;Xiangbin Shi	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-21978-3_32	artificial intelligence;contourlet;compressed sensing;computer vision;pattern recognition;fusion;matrix decomposition;algorithm;computer science;image fusion	Robotics	59.08646898937731	-67.36366186341758	21272

The application of image interpolation is numerous, including animation of still images, view interpolation and temporal interpolation. In this paper, we achieve an improved path-based interpolation method based on the original path-based framework, by introducing two innovative improvements. On one hand, we use optical flow to decide the direction of path, to constraint the path length and to maintain the global path coherency, which improves the efficiency significantly. On the other hand, we introduce the pixel interlacing model to obtain more accurate optical flows so that the accuracy of path selection will be improved a lot. Our improved path-based method performs as well as the original method in various interpolation applications in image quality and surpass the original method by a large scale in efficiency.	interpolation	Bo Yan;Yue Chen	2013	J.

In order to solve the problem, a novel variational framework for single image dehazing based on restoration is proposed. Firstly, the initial atmospheric scattering model is transformed to meet the kimmel’s Retinex variational model. Then, the green light component of image is considered as an input of the variational framework, which is generated by the sensitivity of green wavelength. Finally, the atmospheric transmission map is achieved by multi-resolution pyramid reduction to improve the visual effect of the results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can remove haze effectively with less memory consumption.	circuit restoration;single sign-on;variational principle	Dong Nan;Duyan Bi;Lin-Yuan He;Shiping Ma;Zun-Lin Fan	2016	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2016.03.013	image restoration;computer vision;computer science;human visual system model	Vision	58.3543339045733	-61.87418341928444	21281

In our method, non-local total generalized variation (NL-TGV) is utilized to measure the smoothness of depth map, and the data-fidelity term is expressed by the Huber norm. To preserve the sharpness of depth discontinuities, the smoothing weights are decided by the combination of bilateral weight and separating probability between pixels, and the histogram distance between pixels in the raw depth map is used to adjust the combination weights for suppressing the texture-transfer. We have derived a numerical solution scheme for the optimization problem using the first order primal dual algorithm. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the synthesis datasets and the real datasets demonstrate that our method is as good as the state-of-the-art approaches.	bilateral filter;convex optimization;depth map;diffusing update algorithm;huber loss;mathematical optimization;minimum-weight triangulation;nl (complexity);numerical partial differential equations;optimization problem;pixel;smoothing;super-resolution imaging	Hai-Tao Zhang;Kai Kang;Zengfu Wang	2016	2016 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)	10.1109/VCIP.2016.7805496	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;geometry	Vision	56.232760282001685	-70.36791046530307	21294

This is usually formulated as an optimization problem. Optimizations based on variational lower bound and minorization-maximization have been widely used in machine learning research, signal processing, and statistics. In this paper, we study iterative algorithms based on the conjugate function lower bound (CFLB) and minorization-maximization (MM) for a class of objective functions. We propose a generalized version of these two algorithms and show that they are equivalent when the objective function is convex and differentiable. We then develop a CFLB/MM algorithm for solving the MAP estimation problems under a linear Gaussian observation model. We modify this algorithm for wavelet-domain image denoising. Experimental results show that using a single wavelet representation the performance of the proposed algorithms makes better than that of the bishrinkage algorithm which is arguably one of the best in recent publications. Using complex wavelet representations, the performance of the proposed algorithm is very competitive with that of the state-of-the-art algorithms.	calculus of variations;convex function;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;mm algorithm;machine learning;mathematical optimization;noise reduction;optimization problem;qm/mm;signal processing;wavelet;wiener filter	Dennis Deng;Wai-Yin Ng	2008	EURASIP J.

The approach has four main steps. First of all, the color and depth channel is preprocessed. Noise is eliminated by using a Directional Joint Bilateral Filter and holes are removed from the depth map. Secondly, color cues and depth cues are integrated to segment the image using a Hierarchical Level Set Framework. After this, the segmentation of the color and depth cues is used to generate a trimap. Finally, an extended alpha matting approach is used to obtain the final matting result, with the color image, depth image and trimap serving as input. Experiments using complex natural images demonstrate that the proposed RGBD matting approach is able to generate good matting results.

This paper proposes a new optimization method for estimating the blurring kernel by gradient enhancement, which can iteratively solve a uniform deblur model. In this model, the point-spread-function(PSF) can be accurately estimated and refined by gradually enhancing the image gradients. Our approach includes following steps: edge-preserving gradient enhancement, edge selection, kernel estimation and refinement, fast non-blind deconvolution. The edge-preserving gradient enhancement can restore sharp edges while have no effect in flat regions. Combined with the edge selection, it greatly helps to estimate the kernel. To improve its speed performance, the estimation and deconvolution steps are executed in frequency domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can efficiently produce an accurate blur kernel and a restored image with fine image details.	autostereogram;blind deconvolution;circuit restoration;deblurring;gaussian blur;image gradient;image restoration;kernel (operating system);mathematical optimization;refinement (computing)	Jiahua Chen;Zhifeng Xie;Bin Sheng;Lizhuang Ma	2011		10.1145/2087756.2087800	image restoration;computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;pattern recognition;point spread function;blind deconvolution;frequency domain	Vision	57.386863018461845	-69.30512819962273	21466

In order to get rid of the blur, many scholars make a lot of contributions. In order to elevate the effect of deblurring, we propose a non-blind restoration variational model for color image deblurring based on the variational method. The proposed method uses the nonlinear diffusion equation as a regular term in the variational energy equation. Besides, we process the image by extending the single channel to the multi-channel, which does well in smoothing the filter and preserving the edge information and furthermore improving the quality of the restored image. In order to accelerate the speed of calculation, the Split Bregman method is introduced. Multiple experiments verify the validity of the proposed method, and the proposed method is superior to traditional algorithms in both visual and objective evaluation.	algorithm;bregman method;calculus of variations;circuit restoration;color image;deblurring;display resolution;experiment;gaussian blur;image restoration;nonlinear system;peak signal-to-noise ratio;ringing (signal);ringing artifacts;smoothing;variational method (quantum mechanics);variational principle;visual effects	Nan Wu;Guodong Wang;Hong Zhang;Guojia Hou;Baoxiang Huang	2017	2017 10th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8301952	variational method;diffusion equation;image restoration;computer vision;artificial intelligence;deconvolution;bregman method;color image;smoothing;computer science;deblurring	Vision	56.33307809702158	-70.40439141345811	21517

Here, we discuss recent developments in imaging that aim at exploiting incoherent, noisy signals that are not associated with well-defined arrival times, as data. Indeed, signal constituents that in a classical setting may be regarded as noise may contain important information about the medium to be imaged. We show how it is possible to use the statistics of such noisy signals, specifically, the second-order statistics, for imaging. We consider two particular situations: First, the estimation of an (“empirical”) Green’s function from noisy signals which can subsequently be used in imaging; second, the localization of a cluster of random sources from noisy signals (passive imaging). The analysis presented here is based on assuming a remote sensing scaling and the paraxial approximation, and uses in part the results set forth in Papanicolaou, Ryzhik, Solna [34] that relate to time-reversal, statistical stability and super-resolution. Robustness with respect to modeling assumptions is illustrated by considering other scaling regimes also. We demonstrate how the estimation problem and its robustness can be considered as a dual to that of time-reversal and stable super-resolution. We obtain a novel analysis and foundation for the use of ambient seismic noise in body-wave (tomographic) imaging, motivated by the recent successes of surface-wave tomography using ambient seismic noise.	approximation;coherence (physics);estimation theory;image noise;image scaling;super-resolution imaging;t-symmetry;tomography;web search engine	Maarten V. de Hoop;Knut Sølna	2009	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/070701790	mathematical analysis;paraxial approximation;stability;mathematics;optics;physics;statistics	ML	65.47619204651055	-71.9680911468534	21536

The results show that imagery acquired at the jointing period is more suitable for rice identification during the early season for a nationwide operational rice monitoring system.	polarization (waves)	Lin Guo;Zhiyuan Pei;Shangjie Ma;Juanying Sun;Jiali Shang	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-54344-9_40	agricultural engineering;decision tree;geography;decision support system;agriculture	NLP	82.15072089553938	-56.75171819452751	21592
f737d17463a396fbbe6681c8323b50fa83306115	impact of rapid urbanization on urban heat island effect in a typical valley-city		Global warming and rapid urbanization have great impacts on local temperature and urban heat island (UHI) effects. However, most of the previous research paid very little attention to the impact of natural terrain on UHI effects. This work reported the effects of complex terrain on UHI characteristics. As the second largest city in Northwest China, Lanzhou was selected as the research region since it is a typical valley city with rapid urbanization processes. We analyzed the variation characteristics of UHI effects at annual, seasonal and daily scales, in order to explore the differences and similarities of UHI effects between plain cities, coastal cities and valley cities. Then we evaluated the contribution of urbanization effect to urban surface temperature change. Finally, we examined the link between urbanization and UHI effects. The results of this study will be useful to urban planners and environmentalists in ecological environment construction, urban architectural design and urban planning.

In conventional sampling theory, the signal is sampled at a uniform rate at a minimum of twice the signal bandwidth. Sampling with an aperture function requires a fixed-aperture function, which can be removed by deconvolution after signal reconstruction. However, in some cases, the signal samples are available only at irregular positions, and different samples use different aperture functions. In this paper, the theory of finite-length signal reconstruction with irregular samples and variable apertures in one and two dimensions is considered. In the 1-D case, a band-limited discrete signal can be exactly reconstructed from a finite number of arbitrarily spaced samples with few restrictions on the aperture functions. Exact reconstruction in the 2-D case requires the sampling matrix be invertable, and is not always possible. Variable aperture functions, while complicating the process, can enable reconstruction for a broader range of sample locations. Practical issues are discussed, and numerical examples are provided. Variable aperture reconstruction has application in a variety of remote sensing problems. In this paper, reconstruction from 2-D irregular sampling with variable apertures is illustrated using Special Sensor Microwave/Imager radiometer observations.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;aperture (software);approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;bandwidth (signal processing);deconvolution;discrete-time signal;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;hp 48 series;image sensor;kolmogorov complexity;linear system;matlab;microwave;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;signal reconstruction;simulation;smoothing;the matrix;vandermonde matrix;wiener filter	David G.

The first contribution is, rather than applying disparity distribution inside a segment as hard constraint to directly project the likelihood of corresponding candidates to each pixel individually, our method treat segmentation and corresponding disparity distribution as soft constraint, and further partition each segment to sub-over segments which effectively facilitate the assumption of the disparity consistency. The second contribution is we transform this assumption into higher-order-based potential, and it can be minimized effectively through graph cut. The third contribution is the successful combination of several known techniques as one holistic framework.

However, due to low signal to noise ratio, retrieving SSS from L-band radiometry is very challenging. In order to validate and improve L-band radiative transfer model and salinity retrieval method used in SMOS data processing, the Cooperative Airborne Radiometer for Ocean and Land Studies (CAROLS) was developed. We analyze here a coastal flight (20 May 2009), in the Gulf of Biscay, characterized by strong SSS gradients (28 to 35 pss-78). Extensive in-situ measurements were gathered along the plane track. Brightness temperature (Tb) integrated over 800 ms correlates well with simulated Tb (correlation coefficients between 0.80 and 0.96; standard deviations of the difference of 0.2 K). Over the whole flight, the standard deviation of the difference between CAROLS and in-situ SSS is about 0.3 pss-78 more accurate than SSS fields derived from coastal numerical model or objective analysis. In the northern part of the flight, CAROLS and in-situ SSS agree. In the southern part, the best agreement is found when using only V-polarization measured at 30° incidence angle or when using a multiparameter retrieval assuming large error on Tb (suggesting the presence of biases on H-polarization). When compared to high-resolution model SSS, the CAROLS SSS underlines the high SSS temporal variability in river plume and on continental shelf border, and the importance of using realistic river run-offs for modeling coastal SSS.	coefficient;gradient;gulf of evaluation;image resolution;incidence matrix;köppen climate classification;l band;mathematical model;photon polarization;plume (fluid dynamics);polarization (waves);signal-to-noise ratio;spatial variability	Adrien Martin;Jacqueline Boutin;Danièle Hauser;Gilles Reverdin;Mickaël Pardé;Mehrez Zribi;Pascal Fanise;Jérôme Chanut;Pascal Lazure;Joseph Tenerelli;Nicolas Reul	2012	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2012.2184766	wind speed;meteorology;continental shelf;radiative transfer;l band;image resolution;data processing;oceanography;antenna measurement;temperature measurement;brightness temperature;optics;standard deviation;atmospheric radiative transfer codes;signal-to-noise ratio;physics;quantum mechanics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	82.20952810319389	-63.22044423201827	21845

However, single-band watershed segmentation methods often fail to delineate broadleaf species, particularly in uneven-aged stands when a single-scale parameter is used to fit segments to reference crowns of different sizes. In this study, we present multispectral watershed segmentation and multiscale fitting method for ITC delineation, and the method involves two steps: 1) multispectral watershed segmentation to produce multiscale segmentation for subsequent fitting, which takes full advantage of boundary information contained in the spectral contrast of multiple bands; and 2) multiscale fitting to identify optimal parameters to best fit each ITC, rather than selecting a single parameter value based on its overall fit to the image as a whole. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using two multispectral images from a mixed broadleaf forest in Central Ontario, Canada. Our results show that multispectral watershed segmentation at multiple spatial scales produces ITC maps of higher quality than the commonly used multiresolution segmentation method. The automated multiscale fitting produces ITC maps of higher quality than the best single-scale segmentation.	bands;citrus aurantium;contain (action);curve fitting;map;multispectral image;population parameter;prostheses, dental, fixed, crown, total, temporary;spatial scale;watershed (image processing);biologic segmentation	Jian Yang;Yuhong He;John P.

Such holes are mainly caused by disocclusion, which occurs around the sharp depth discontinuities in the depth map. We propose a divide-and-conquer hole-filling method which refines the background depth pixels around the sharp depth discontinuities to address the disocclusion problem. Firstly, the disocclusion region is detected according to the degree of depth discontinuity, and the target area is marked as a binary mask. Then, the depth pixels located in the target area are modified by a linear interpolation process, whose pixel values decrease from the foreground depth value to the background depth value. Finally, in order to remove the isolated depth pixels, median filtering is adopted to refine the depth map. In these ways, disocclusion regions in the synthesized view are divided into several small holes after DIBR, and are easily filled by image inpainting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of the synthesized view subjectively and objectively.	color image;depth map;glossary of computer graphics;image processing;inpainting;linear interpolation;median filter;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pixel;reflections of signals on conducting lines;visual effects	Jianjun Lei;Cuicui Zhang;Min Wu;Lei You;Kefeng Fan;Chunping Hou	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-3413-3	computer vision;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	57.86864528331583	-60.65388241957459	21996
247323580e5169ca3308f729476598f64b5a48b0	saliency-based adaptive compressive sampling of images using measurement contrast		Compressive Sampling (CS) achieves the sub-Nyquist image acquisition, which bringing about a rapid development of compressive imaging devices. In CS framework, the adaptive sampling scheme is an efficient approach to improving the rate-distortion performance of imaging system. However, the sampling allocation depends on the original sample image, which increases the cost and complexity of imaging system, thereby making CS lose its superiority. In this paper, we propose a saliency-based adaptive CS scheme that allocates more sampling resources to salient regions but fewer to non-salient regions. Its key idea is to extract the saliency information by using the contrast between CS measurements, thus avoiding the original sample image in the imaging system. The scheme is realized in practice without any changes of the architecture of compressive imaging device. To match our adaptive sampling scheme, we also propose a weighted global recovery model based on saliency information. This model can effectively suppress the blocking artifacts while improving the visual qualities of salient regions. Experimental results on natural images show that the proposed adaptive CS scheme improves the visual quality of reconstructed image, and has better rate-distortion performance than the existing adaptive CS schemes.	adaptive sampling;artifact (software development);blocking (computing);compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;distortion;ruby document format;sampling (signal processing)	Ran Li;Wei He;Zhenghui Liu;Yanling Li;Zhangjie Fu	2017	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-017-4862-z	computer science;compressed sensing;artificial intelligence;computer vision;architecture;pattern recognition;salience (neuroscience);sampling (statistics);adaptive sampling	Vision	59.60084287812458	-68.00399389399243	22022

To mitigate this conflict, a range ambiguity resolution approach for HRWS SAR imaging using frequency diverse array (FDA) is proposed in this paper. The FDA employs a set of slightly different carrier frequencies, each of which is emitted by an individual array element. Frequency diversity introduces wave-path difference among the array elements, thus resulting in the range-angle-dependent property of transmit steering vector. Utilizing the extra degrees-of-freedom in range domain, FDA is capable of distinguishing the range ambiguous echoes in the spatial frequency domain. In our approach, the range ambiguous echoes are compensated by range dependence compensation (RDC) technique in the transmit spatial frequency domain. In the sequel, the range ambiguous echoes are separated by using a series of transmit beamformers as the echoes from different range regions are discriminable. Finally, traditional imaging processing is performed on the reconstructed unambiguous data to achieve HRWS imaging. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	aperture (software);array data structure;carrier wave;image processing;image resolution;simulation;synthetic data	Chenghao Wang;Jingwei Xu;Guisheng Liao;Xuefei Xu;Yuhong Zhang	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2605064	medical imaging;computer vision;synthetic aperture radar;image resolution;doppler effect;azimuth;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar	Visualization	76.4944726588667	-66.96189502652642	22041

In this paper, we propose a Partial Differential Equations, or PDE-based image enhancement technique, in order to remove these ringing artifacts, while keeping the image’s edges. Results are provided on grayscale and color images, showing a visible enhancement, confirmed by the PSNR increase.	algorithm;distortion;grayscale;image editing;jpeg 2000;peak signal-to-noise ratio;rate–distortion theory;ringing artifacts	Pascal Bourdon;Bertrand Augereau;Christian Olivier;Christian Chatellier	2003		10.1109/ICASSP.2003.1199578	computer vision;computer science;ringing artifacts;mathematics;grayscale;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.72412650691566	-63.072291244535464	22065

These include optimization of the Yule–Nielsen factor that accounts for light scattering in the paper, estimation of the dot area functions, and extension to a cellular model. A new technique is described for optimizing the Neugebauer primaries using weighted spectral regression. Experimental results are presented for xerographic printers using two halftone screens: the random or rotated dot, and the dot-on-dot screen.

We present a review of the LT and, in addition, we investigate the influence of the initialization and exemplify the effect of regularization on the convergence of the algorithm. In particular, we show that both are essential for high-quality imaging in strongly scattering scenarios.	algorithm;exemplification;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;tomographic reconstruction;tomography	Morteza Hasani Shoreh;Alexandre Goy;JooWon Lim;Ulugbek Kamilov;Michael Unser;Demetri Psaltis	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953352	nonlinear programming;mathematical optimization;optical tomography;computer science;tomographic reconstruction;tomography;initialization;light scattering;nonlinear system;scattering	Vision	56.76878691350487	-74.73423415733492	22194

However, due to the complex nature of fuel characteristic a fuel map is considered one of the most difficult thematic layers to build up. The advent of sensors with increased spatial resolution may improve the accuracy and reduce the cost of fuels mapping. The objective of this research is to evaluate the accuracy and utility of imagery from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery. In order to ascertain how well ASTER data can provide an exhaustive classification of fuel properties a sample area characterized by mixed vegetation covers was analysed. The selected sample areas has an extension at around 60 km and is located inside the Sila plateau in the Calabria Region (South of Italy). Fieldwork fuel type recognitions, performed before, after and during the acquisition of remote sensing ASTER data, were used as ground-truth dataset to assess the results obtained for the considered test area. The method comprised the following three steps: (I) adaptation of Prometheus fuel types for obtaining a standardization system useful for remotely sensed classification of fuel types and properties in the considered Mediterranean ecosystems; (II) model construction for the spectral characterization and mapping of fuel types based on a maximum likelihood (ML) classification algorithm; (III) accuracy assessment for the performance evaluation based on the comparison of ASTER-based results with ground-truth. Results from our analysis showed that the use ASTER data provided a valuable characterization and mapping of fuel types being that the achieved classification accuracy was higher than 90%. # 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Especially, Retinex algorithm tends to show outstanding results as compared with other approaches, and also shows advantages at night vision. However, the Retinex algorithm has problems such as the halo effect and the color distortion. In this paper, the proposed algorithm has a simple idea to remove above problems that combines a reflectance and a luminance image with some constant factors respectively. Since the result includes the luminance component, it works on diverse environment such as not only foggy image but also night vision image. Furthermore, this algorithm has proper structure for real time processing.

The minimum detectable signal can be increased, for a given radar and ash plume scenario, by decreasing the observation range and increasing the operational frequency and also by exploiting possible polarimetric capabilities. For short-range observations in proximity of the volcano vent, a compact portable system with relatively low power transmitter may be evaluated as a suitable compromise between observational and technological requirements. This paper, starting from the results of a previous study and from the aforementioned issues, is aimed at quantitatively assessing the optimal choices for a portable X-band system with a dual-polarization capability for real-time ash cloud remote sensing. The physical-electromagnetic model of ash particle distributions is systematically reviewed and extended to include nonspherical particle shapes, vesicular composition, silicate content, and orientation phenomena. The radar backscattering response at X-band is simulated and analyzed in terms of self-consistent polarimetric signatures for ash classification purposes and correlation with ash concentration for quantitative retrieval aims. An X-band radar system sensitivity analysis to ash concentration, as a function of radar specifications, range, and ash category, is carried out in trying to assess the expected system performances and limitations.	airborne ranger;algorithm;antivirus software;cloud computing;heart rate variability;logistics;mega man zx;particle filter;pattern matching;performance;plume (fluid dynamics);polarimetry;radar;radial (radio);real-time clock;red ash: the indelible legend;requirement;robertson–seymour theorem;robot;signature;simulation;synthetic data;time series;transmitter;volcano plot (statistics);x window system	Frank S.

Yet the loss of carbon from forest disturbance and the gain from post-disturbance recovery have not been well assessed. In this study, sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate: (1) influence of factors other than the change of AGB (i.e. distortion caused by incident angle, soil moisture) on SAR backscatter; (2) feasibility of cross-image calibration between multi-temporal and multi-sensor SAR data; and (3) possibility of applying normalized backscatter to detect the post-disturbance AGB recovery. A semi-automatic empirical model was proposed to reduce the incident angle effect. Then, a cross-image normalization procedure was performed in order to remove the radiometric distortions among multi-source SAR data. The results indicate that effect of incident angle and soil moisture on SAR backscatter could be reduced by the proposed procedure, and a detection of biomass changes is possible using multi-temporal and multi-sensor SAR data.	airborne ranger;backscatter (email);carbon cycle;distortion;image resolution;incidence matrix;l band;multi-source;semiconductor industry;synthetic data;terrestrial television;time complexity;type signature	Wenli Huang;Guoqing Sun;Wenjian Ni;Zhiyu Zhang;Ralph Dubayah	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.3390/rs70809587	soil science;optics;physics;angle of incidence;remote sensing	Robotics	83.34894921806206	-60.8577418538871	22360

In wavelet warping most of the warping operation is performed in the wavelet domain, by operating on the coefficients of the wavelet transforms of the images and other matrices defined by the mapping. Operating in this fashion is often more efficient than performing the 3D warp in the standard manner. Perhaps more importantly, operating in the wavelet domain allows one to perform the 3D warping operation progressively and to generate target views at multiple resolutions. We describe wavelet warping of planar, cylindrical, and spherical reference images and demonstrate that the resulting algorithms compare favorably to their standard counterparts. We also discuss and demonstrate utilization of temporal coherence when wavelet-warping image sequences.	academy;algorithm;alpha compositing;coefficient;coherence (physics);computation;convolution;experiment;image warping;overhead (computing);siggraph;wavelet transform;zcam	Iddo Drori;Dani Lischinski	2000		10.1007/978-3-7091-6303-0_11	wavelet;second-generation wavelet transform;wavelet packet decomposition;discrete wavelet transform	Graphics	65.77416043531083	-53.70158021941711	22419

The role of the fractional-order gradient is to better accommodate the texture details of an image, and the adaptive factor p can be used to diffuse adaptively according to local geometry features, which are fractional-order curvature and fractional-order gradient of an image. Besides removing noise and non-linearly keeping high-frequency edge of images efficiently, our proposed model can enhance the texture details of images and greatly eliminate the staircase effects and also the speckle effects. Fourier transform technique is also proposed to compute the fractional order derivative. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed model can deal with edge preserving and texture enhancing, more efficiently than the other four methods and outperform the other four methods by means of PSNR. Our average PSNR is closed to 1dB higher than the average PSNRs of the other four methods.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;anisotropic diffusion;circuit restoration;computation;experiment;fast fourier transform;gradient;image restoration;nonlinear system;peak signal-to-noise ratio;point process;ringing artifacts;visual effects	Xuehui Yin;Shangbo Zhou;Muhammad Abubakar Siddique	2015	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-015-2488-6	image restoration;computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;anisotropic diffusion	Vision	55.85793678602691	-69.18309394124691	22449

More specifically, we compared the performance of bagging, boosting and random forest to predict Sirex noctilio induced water stress in Pinus patula trees using nine spectral parameters derived from hyperspectral data. Results from the study show that the random forest ensemble achieved the best overall performance (R = 0.73) and that the predictive accuracy of the ensemble was statistically different (p < 0.001) from bagging and boosting. Additionally, by using random forest as a wrapper we simplified the modeling process and identified the minimum number (n = 2) of spectral parameters that offered the best overall predictive accuracy (R = 0.76). The water index and Ratio975 had the best ability to assay the water status of S. noctilio infested trees thus making it possible to remotely predict and quantify the severity of damage caused by the wasp. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we analyze the major drawback—that is, there may be completely different edges in the two images. Simply considering all patterns could introduce significant errors. To address this issue, we propose the concept of mutual-structure, which refers to the structural information that is contained in both images and thus can be safely enhanced by joint filtering. We also use an untraditional objective function that can be efficiently optimized to yield mutual structure. Our method results in important edge preserving property, which greatly benefits depth completion, optical flow estimation, image enhancement, stereo matching, to name a few.	algorithm;computer stereo vision;discrepancy function;image editing;loss function;optical flow;optimization problem;patch (computing);smoothing	Xiaoyong Shen;Chao Zhou;Li Xu;Jiaya Jia	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)	10.1007/s11263-017-1021-y	image texture;image restoration;computer vision;mathematical optimization;feature detection;template matching;image gradient;image processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;edge enhancement	Vision	56.88259139036187	-58.89945291010276	22522

Receiver sensitivities of less than –90 dBm have been demonstrated by applying heterodyne optical downconversion and RF pulse compression. With the improved sensitivity, the required transmit power is significantly reduced. This system approach also permits multikilohertz pulse-repetition frequencies that enable spatially dense range measurements. Compared to lidars like GLAS and MOLA, this sensor requires a lower peak transmit power while providing orders of magnitude more measurements per second. In the receiver design, we have evaluated two detection schemes: envelope detection and direct downconversion. Envelope detection provides the benefit of discarding the effects of optical phase variations on the detected signal consequently avoiding many temporal correlation issues, however it is less efficient in terms of the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Direct downconversion to baseband is more SNR efficient, however the baseband signal contains the effects optical phase variations, which include laser phase noise, effects of atmospheric turbulence, and frequency shifting due to Doppler effects. We have demonstrated the feasibility of using a linear array of optical fibers in the telescope’s focal plane to launch and receive the optical signals. Using separate fibers for transmit and receive while sharing telescope optics, we have achieved the required transmitter-receiver isolation of a bistatic system without the accompanying alignment difficulties. With our breadboard system ranging measurements from both manmade and natural extended targets have been made and the results are presented. These results support the feasibility of a satellite-based altimeter (600 km altitude), capable of making more than 4000 range measurements per second with 10 cm accuracy using less than 10 W peak transmit power. While the present breadboard operates at 1319 nm, the overall concept is wavelength independent. Benefits of this development may include increased system reliability, reduced power requirements, smaller sensor mass and volume, improved eye-safety, and lower probability of signal detection. INTRODUCTION Satellites carrying lidars for measuring ice sheet surface elevation and vegetation canopy heights are scheduled to be launched in the next few years. To achieve the necessary resolution and measurement accuracy, these lidars use shortduration, high-peak-power transmit pulses. Also, these systems typically operate with low pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs). The high-peak power operation results in limited laser lifetime and the low PRF provides sparse spatial samples along the satellite track. To overcome these limitations, at The University of Kansas we have developed a low peak-power laser radar that incorporates modern radar techniques and commercially available fiber optic technologies to enhance receiver sensitivity. Building on concepts reported previously by Mullen et al. [1], we use optical heterodyne downconversion, radio frequency (RF) pulse compression, and digital signal processing to achieve the receiver sensitivity needed for spaceborne applicatons when transmit powers of less than 10 W are used. Compared to high peak power lidars, our system also has a much higher PRF and can therefore provide more dense sampling. This paper summarizes the test results of our system. Previously published papers also describe the system [2,3,4,5,6].	baseband;breadboard;charge-coupled device;coherence (physics);detection theory;digital signal processing;envelope detector;focal (programming language);heterodyne;motorola canopy;optical fiber;phase noise;primitive recursive function;pulse compression;radar;radio frequency;requirement;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;transmitter;turbulence;weatherstar	Christopher Allen;Sekken Kenny Chong;Yanki Cobanoglu;Sivaprasad Gogineni	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1027258	lidar;pulse compression;doppler effect;computer science;optical fiber;pulse repetition frequency;computer performance;optics;signal-to-noise ratio;phase noise;physics;remote sensing;detection theory	Mobile	81.17257238800634	-65.08027063289477	22546

Using wavelets as basis and testing functions, the resulting moment matrix is generally sparse after applying a threshold truncation. This property makes wavelets particularly useful in simulating large-scale problems, in which reducing memory storage requirement and CPU time are crucial. In this paper, scattering from Gaussian conducting rough surfaces of a few hundred square wavelengths are studied numerically using Haar wavelets. A matrix sparsity less than 10% is achieved for a range of root mean square (RMS) height at eight sampling points per linear wavelength. Parallelization of the code is also performed. Simulation results of the bistatic scattering coefficients are presented for different surface RMS heights up to 1 wavelength. Comparsions with sparse-matrix/canonical-grid approach (SM/CG) and triangular discretized (RWG basis) results are made as well. Depolarization effects are examined for both TE and TM incident waves. The relative merits of the SM/CG method and the present method are discussed.	automatic parallelization;central processing unit;cg (programming language);coefficient;computer simulation;conjugate gradient method;discretization;haar wavelet;mean squared error;moment matrix;newton's method;numerical analysis;parallel computing;rough set;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;test engineer;truncation	M.

b2707006ddff17e405fac86a37caaa569ed54d7d	three-dimensional surface deformation related to the 2017 north korea nuclear test observed by sar offset-tracking approach		North Korea conducted the sixth nuclear test in Punggye-ri on 3 September 2017. An artificial earthquake of Mw 6.3 was reported near North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site. Several minutes later, a second smaller earthquake followed the initial event, and it was characterized as a collapse of the cavity. The large and complex deformations related to the earthquakes occurred in the ground surface. It is very important to measure the artificial earthquake-related deformations, because it enables us to estimate the location, depth and cavity radius of the nuclear test. We observed the three-dimensional surface deformations related to the sixth North Korea nuclear test using the ascending and descending ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar offset-tracking. We used the multi-kernel offset tracking method to improve the precision of the offset-tracking measurement. The maximum deformation of more than 3 m was observed in the horizontal direction. We estimated the location, depth and cavity radius using the Mogi model. The estimated depth and cavity radius are about 600 m and about 52 m, respectively. The satellite offset-tracking observation will contribute to the nuclear test monitoring and characterization.

890244e92c03f0c1f065903a0c4a63de25dd27eb	subinteger range-bin alignment method for isar imaging of noncooperative targets	signal image and speech processing;quantum information technology spintronics	Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) is a coherent radar technique capable of generating images of noncooperative targets. ISAR may have better performance in adverse meteorological conditions than traditional imaging sensors. Unfortunately, ISAR images are usually blurred because of the relative motion between radar and target. To improve the quality of ISAR products, motion compensation is necessary. In this context, range-bin alignment is the first step for translational motion compensation. In this paper, we propose a subinteger range-bin alignment method based on envelope correlation and reference profiles. The technique, which makes use of a carefully designed optimization stage, is robust against noise, clutter, target scintillation, and error accumulation. It provides us with very fine translational motion compensation. Comparisons with state-of-the-art rangebin alignment methods are included and advantages of the proposal are highlighted. Simulated and live data from a high-resolution linear-frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar are included to perform the pertinent comparisons.	algorithm;automatic target recognition;bundle adjustment;clutter;coherence (physics);image resolution;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;modulation;motion compensation;radar;radial (radio);refinement (computing);relevance;sensor;tree accumulation	José M.

134eef3dbd431ac2ba4f0e406a6b35fc795d4197	false color suppression in demosaiced color images	color image	In a single-chip digital color camera, a color filter array (CFA) is used to obtain sampled spectral components (red, green and blue) in an interleaved fashion. A color demosaicing operation is then carried out to determine the missing spectral components at every location. One of the problems in color demosaicing is that many of the interpolated images are affected by colored artifacts near the edges creating false colors. The problem is more severe if the edges are achromatic. In this paper we propose the use of median filtering for suppressing this phenomenon. We have considered a set of existing interpolation algorithms and presented their performances in interpolating mosaiced patterns. Next we have carried out median filtering of the chrominance components of the demosaiced images. In each case, the post-processing has remarkably improved the quality of the reconstructions. The observations are verified by both quantitative measures for expressing the quality of reconstruction as well as by visual examinations of the reconstructed images.	algorithm;color filter array;demosaicing;interpolation;median filter;performance;video post-processing;zero suppression	Jayanta Mukherjee;Manfred K.

The likelihood segment merging criteria are derived using the multivariate complex Gaussian, the Wishart distribution, and the K-distribution. In the presence of spatial texture, the Gaussian-Wishart segmentation is not appropriate. The K-distribution segmentation is more effective in textured forested areas. The validity of the product model is also assessed, and a field-adaptable segmentation strategy combining different criteria is examined.	approximation;gaussian blur;image segmentation;k-distribution;mathematical optimization;polarimetry;stepwise regression;synthetic data	Jean-Marie Beaulieu;Ridha Touzi	2004	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2004.835302	computer vision;segmentation-based object categorization;mathematics;region growing;maximum likelihood;image segmentation;scale-space segmentation;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	72.02978457178277	-62.61360925932046	22721
8b647752c3ac11ba707458406bda1ad91debe26c	jumpcut: non-successive mask transfer and interpolation for video cutout	video segmentation;object cutout;foreground extraction	We introduce JumpCut, a new mask transfer and interpolation method for interactive video cutout. Given a source frame for which a foreground mask is already available, we compute an estimate of the foreground mask at another, typically non-successive, target frame. Observing that the background and foreground regions typically exhibit different motions, we leverage these differences by computing two separate nearest-neighbor fields (split-NNF) from the target to the source frame. These NNFs are then used to jointly predict a coherent labeling of the pixels in the target frame. The same split-NNF is also used to aid a novel edge classifier in detecting silhouette edges (S-edges) that separate the foreground from the background. A modified level set method is then applied to produce a clean mask, based on the pixel labels and the S-edges computed by the previous two steps. The resulting mask transfer method may also be used for coherently interpolating the foreground masks between two distant source frames. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more accurate than the existing state-of-the-art on a wide variety of video sequences. Thus, it reduces the required amount of user effort, and provides a basis for an effective interactive video object cutout tool.	coherence (physics);interpolation;negation normal form;pixel;sensor	Qingnan Fan;Fan Zhong;Dani Lischinski;Daniel Cohen-Or;Baoquan Chen	2015	ACM Trans.

A scheme of seabed image classification is proposed to identify three types of seabed sediments. The texture features of images are stable and robust visual features in underwater environment comparing with general visual features, and which are described by using gray-level co-occurrence matrix and fractal dimension. Subsequently, for purpose of evaluation, a supervised non-parametric statistical learning technique, support vector machines (SVMs), is applied to verify the availability of extracted texture features on seabed sediments classification. The presented results of seabed type recognition justify the proposed features extracted method valid to seabed type recognition.

75d4bea972c2fe227f351e92216bb3f69215752f	quantifying forest spatial pattern trends at multiple extents: an approach to detect significant changes at different scales	central italy;stochastic simulations;statistical significance of change;forest regrowth;modified random cluster algorithm;pattern metrics;scalogram	We propose a procedure to detect significant changes in forest spatial patterns and relevant scales. Our approach consists of four sequential steps. First, based on a series of multi-temporal forest maps, a set of geographic windows of increasing extents are extracted. Second, for each extent and date, specific stochastic simulations that replicate real-world spatial pattern characteristics are run. Third, by computing pattern metrics on both simulated and real maps, their empirical distributions and confidence intervals are derived. Finally, multi-temporal scalograms are built for each metric. Based on cover maps (1954, 2011) with a resolution of 10 m we analyze forest pattern changes in a central Apennines (Italy) reserve at multiple spatial extents (128, 256 and 512 pixels). We identify three types of multi-temporal scalograms, depending on pattern metric behaviors, describing different dynamics of natural reforestation process. The statistical distribution and variability of pattern metrics at multiple extents offers a new and powerful tool to OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 9299 detect forest variations over time. Similar procedures can (i) help to identify significant changes in spatial patterns and provide the bases to relate them to landscape processes; (ii) minimize the bias when comparing pattern metrics at a single extent and (iii) be extended to other landscapes and scales.	map;microsoft windows;pixel;self-replicating machine;simulation;spatial variability;spatiotemporal pattern;stochastic optimization	Ludovico Frate;Santiago Saura;Michele Minotti;Paolo Di Martino;Carmen Giancola;Maria Laura Carranza	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6109298	data mining;ecology;statistics	ML	84.24300286153444	-54.70205401177293	22799

The algorithm has the same functional form as the NASA Team algorithm, but uses a wider range of frequencies (19-85 GHz). It accommodates ice temperature variability through the use of radiance ratios as in the original NASA Team algorithm, and has the added advantage of providing weather-corrected sea ice concentrations through the utilization of a forward atmospheric radiative transfer model. Retrievals of sea ice concentration with this new algorithm for both the Arctic and Antarctic do not reveal the deficiencies present in either the NASA Team or Bootstrap algorithms. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons with infrared AVHRR data show that the enhanced algorithm provides more accurate ice concentrations with much less bias than the other two algorithms.	algorithm	Thorsten Markus;Donald J.

A number of basic models to characterize performance of biometric systems are presented. All models compare performance of an automatic biometric recognition system against performance of an ideal biometric system that knows correct decisions. The correct decision can be visualized as an input to a new decision system, and the decision by an automatic recognition system is the output of this decision system. The problem of performance evaluation for a biometric recognition system is formulated as (1) the problem of finding the maximum information that the output of the system has about the input, and (2) the problem of finding the maximum distortion that the output can experience with respect to the input of the system to guarantee a bounded average probability of recognition error. The first formulation brings us to evaluation of capacity of a binary asymmetric and M-ary channels. The second formulation falls under the scope of rate-distortion theory. We further describe the problem of physical signature authentication used to authenticate a biometric acquisition device and state the problem of secured biometric authentication as the problem of joint biometric and physical signature authentication. One novelty of this work is in restating the problem of secured biometric authentication as the problem of finding capacity and rate-distortion curve for a secured biometric authentication system. Another novelty is in application of transductive methods from statistical learning theory to estimate the conditional error probabilities of the system. This set of parameters is used to optimize the system performance.	authentication;batman: arkham city;biometrics;decision support system;distortion;machine learning;performance evaluation;rate–distortion theory;statistical learning theory	Natalia A.

It is a challenging work to design an edge-preserving image denoising scheme. Extended discrete Shearlet transform (extended DST) is an effective multi-scale and multi-direction analysis method; it not only can exactly compute the Shearlet coefficients based on a multiresolution analysis, but also can provide nearly optimal approximation for a piecewise smooth function. In this paper, a new image denoising approach in extended Shearlet domain using hidden Markov tree (HMT) model is proposed. Firstly, the joint statistics and mutual information of the extended DST coefficients are studied. Then, the extended DST coefficients are modeled using an HMT model with Gaussian mixtures, which can effectively capture the intra-scale and inter-scale dependencies. Finally, the extended Shearlet HMT model is applied to image denoising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our extended Shearlet HMT denoising method can obtain better performances in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations than other state-of-the-art HMT denoising techniques. Especially, the proposed method can preserve edges very well while removing noise.	hidden markov model;markov chain;noise reduction;shearlet	Xiangyang Wang;Yang-Cheng Liu;Hong-Ying Yang	2014	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2014.03.005	statistical model;mathematical optimization;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	ML	57.36003305927362	-68.85729934302692	22896

Widely used unsharp masking filter-based approaches suffer from halo-artefacts and/or noise amplification, while noise- and halo-free adaptive bilateral filtering (ABF) is computationally intractable. In this study, the authors present an efficient sharpening algorithm inspired by guided image filtering (GF). The author's proposed adaptive GF (AGF) integrates the shift-variant technique, a part of ABF, into a guided filter to render crisp and sharpened outputs. Experiments showed the superiority of their proposed algorithm to existing algorithms. The proposed AGF sharply enhances edges and textures without causing halo-artefacts or noise amplification, and it is efficiently implemented using a fast linear-time algorithm.	noise reduction;unsharp masking	Cuong Cao Pham;Jae Wook Jeon	2015	IET Image Processing	10.1049/iet-ipr.2013.0563	median filter;computer vision;image processing;computer science;edge enhancement;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.976439175865906	-61.200845556353805	22922

Instead, determining first the set of EMs that actually reside in each pixel, leads to enhanced unmixing results. This important insight for achieving higher unmixing accuracy can be exploited efficiently by extracting relevant spatial information from a given image. In this work, we present a new method for spatially adaptive spectral unmixing, called the Gaussian based spatially adaptive unmixing (GBSAU) method. GBSAU takes advantage of the spatial arrangement of the image pixels and their spectral relations in order to determine an actual subset of EMs per pixel. It is based on spatial localization of the EMs by fitting, for each EM, the parameters of the series of spatial Gaussians whose sum represents the EM's fraction surface over the image.	pixel;stellar classification	Fadi Kizel;Maxim Shoshany;Nathan S.

Our approach is based on rewriting the minimal partition problem (also known as Potts model) in terms of a primal dual Total Variation functional. We show that the Potts prior can be incorporated by means of convex constraints on the dual variables. For minimization we propose an efficient primal dual projected gradient algorithm which also allows a fast implementation on parallel hardware. Although our approach does not guarantee to find global minimizers of the Potts model we can give a tight bound on the energy between the computed solution and the true minimizer. Furthermore we show that our relaxation approach dominates recently proposed relaxations. As a consequence, our approach allows to compute solutions closer to the true minimizer. For many practical problems we even find the global minimizer. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our approach on several multi-label image segmentation and stereo problems.	algorithm;correspondence problem;duality (optimization);gradient;image segmentation;linear programming relaxation;multi-label classification;partition problem;potts model;rewriting	Thomas Pock;Antonin Chambolle;Daniel Cremers;Horst Bischof	2009	2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5206604	computer vision;mathematical optimization;labeling theory;probability density function;combinatorics;potts model;discrete mathematics;computer science;stereopsis;mathematics;geometry;image segmentation;computational model;total variation;pixel	Vision	54.01372423060056	-72.6900244012005	23087

This study introduces airborne laser scanner (ALS) data and the k-NN classifier data analysis technique applicable to the site quality assessment of mature forests. Both the echo height and the intensity value percentiles of different echo types of ALS data were used in the analysis. The data are of 274 mature forest stands of different sizes, belonging to five forest site types, varying from very fertile to poor forests, in Koli National Park, eastern Finland. The k-NN classifier was applied with values of k varying from 1 to 5. The best overall classification accuracy achieved for all the forest site types and for a single type, were 58% and 73%, respectively. The conclusion is that when conducting large-scale forest inventories ALS-data based analysis would be a useful technology for the identification of mature boreal site types. However, the technique could still be improved and further studies are needed to ensure its applicability under different local conditions and with data representing earlier stages of stand development.	airborne ranger;echo (command);inventory;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;statistical classification;the forest	Mikko Vehmas;Kalle Eerikäinen;Jussi Peuhkurinen;Petteri Packalen;Matti Maltamo	2011	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs3010100	taiga;ecology;vegetation;remote sensing	HCI	80.8954414036852	-57.16753920062689	23130

Each energy measures a mismatch between corresponding signals in the images, which is appended with a weighted unevenness of the surface. To account for frequent in practice perceptive (contrast and offset) image deviations, the mismatch is evaluated in terms of mutual information (MI). However, to closely approximate the MI, the deviations have to be spatially uniform and relatively small. Moreover, this conventional two-term energy does not guarantee a unique minimiser; the weight is often hand-picked and may unpredictably affect the minimiser(s), and both the terms cannot be modified independently. Sequential and separate minimisation of these terms partially overcomes the above drawbacks, excludes the weighting, and allows to account for possible spatially variant and large perceptive deviations. For each conjugate pair of epipolar lines in the input images, the first stage employs a symmetric concurrent propagation stereo (SCPS) to build the space of all least-mismatch epipolar profiles of the goal surface. The CP fuses the BP and dynamic programming (DP) energy minimisation and allows for adapting directly to a wide range of perceptive image deviations. The second stage selects the approximately least-uneven surface in the union of the least-mismatch profile-wise spaces using semi-global smoothing (SGS). The latter follows the SGM framework, but to only find the least-uneven cross-sections of the united space in multiple directions and combine them into the final output surface. Experiments with the SCPS-SGS and MI-SGM confirmed efficiency of the proposed two-stage reconstruction under strong perceptive deviations.	approximation algorithm;belief propagation;computer stereo vision;dynamic programming;epipolar geometry;mutual information;second generation multiplex;semi-supervised learning;semiconductor industry;smoothing;software propagation;strong generating set	Rui Gong;Georgy L.

These works combine ultrafast imaging systems with computation, which back-projects the recorded space-time signal to build a probabilistic map of the hidden geometry. Unfortunately, this computation is slow, becoming a bottleneck as the imaging technology improves. In this work, we propose a new back-projection technique for NLOS reconstruction, which is up to a thousand times faster than previous work, with negligible quality loss.	bottleneck (engineering);computation;imaging technology	Victor Arellano;Diego Gutierrez;Adrian Jarabo	2017		10.1145/3102163.3102241	computer vision;sight;artificial intelligence;computer science;computational photography;imaging technology;computation;probabilistic logic;non-line-of-sight propagation;bottleneck;ultrashort pulse	Crypto	68.29683919238244	-57.13433795219003	23294

Most traditional noise reduction methods tend to over-suppress high-frequency details. For overcoming this problem we first decompose the input image into flat and edge regions, and remove noise using the alpha map computed from wavelet transform coefficients of LH, HL, and HH bands. After removing noise in the flat region, we further remove noise in edge regions by adaptively shrinking wavelet coefficients based on the entropy. Moreover, we present a new directional transform using wavelet basis and Gaussian low pass filters. The wavelet coefficients of edge regions are inverse transformed by using the filtered wavelet bases. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm can reduce noise without losing sharp details and is suitable for commercial low-cost imaging systems, such as digital cameras, CCTV, and surveillance system.	algorithm;camera phone;closed-circuit television;coefficient;color image;digital camera;digital image;horseland;image editing;lh (complexity);low-pass filter;mobile phone;noise reduction;real-time clock;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet transform	Sangjin Kim;Wonseok Kang;Eunsung Lee;Joonki Paik	2010	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2010.5506040	computer vision;electronic engineering;speech recognition;low-pass filter;computer science;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;wavelet transform	Robotics	57.41788743075687	-65.27415292065587	23390

The degraded image has some problems, such as color distortion, low-visibility, fuzz and non-uniform luminance, due to the light is absorbed and scattered by particles in sandstorm. The proposed approach based on fusion principles aims to overcome the aforementioned limitations. First, the degraded image is color corrected by adopting a statistical strategy. Then two inputs, which represent different brightness, are derived only from the color corrected image by applying Gamma correction. Three weighted maps (sharpness, chromaticity and prominence), which contain important features to increase the quality of the degraded image, are computed from the derived inputs. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by fusing the inputs with the weight maps. The proposed method is the first to adopt a fusion-based method for enhancing single sandstorm image. Experimental results show that enhanced results can be improved by color correction, well enhanced details and local contrast while promoted global brightness, increasing the visibility, naturalness preservation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is mostly calculated by per-pixel operation, which is appropriate for real-time applications.	algorithm;digital image processing;distortion;gamma correction;glossary of computer graphics;map;pixel;real-time clock	Xueyang Fu;Yue Huang;Delu Zeng;Xiao-Ping Zhang;Xinghao Ding	2014	2014 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP)	10.1109/MMSP.2014.6958791	image quality;color histogram;image texture;image restoration;computer vision;feature detection;color image;image gradient;binary image;image processing;color balance;image fusion;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.39638887663388	-61.949946694691356	23457

Many studies have reported that LMA is the most difficult to retrieve from PROSPECT primarily because the dry matter absorption features on the reflectance spectra of fresh leaves are largely masked by stronger water absorption. This study proposed a new inversion method by integrating the continuous wavelet analysis into the PROSPECT inversion process. Instead of using reflectance directly as for most studies, this method used the wavelet coefficient spectra from continuous wavelet transform for constructing the merit function for inversion. The performance of the new method was evaluated with a multi-species dataset (LOPEX) and a single-species dataset (Wheat). The results demonstrated that the wavelet-based inversion method yielded higher accuracies than traditional methods and better consistency between data sets. This inversion method has great potential for developing portable instruments to predict foliar biomass of crops without the need of calibration models.	coefficient;continuous wavelet;inverse transform sampling;oren–nayar reflectance model;thickness (graph theory);wavelet transform	Dong Li;Tao Cheng;Xia Yao;Zhaoying Zhang;Yongchao Tian;Yan Zhu;Weixing Cao	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730803	absorption;reflectivity;optics;remote sensing	Vision	85.41642253520475	-61.733573116822186	23486

Many problems in computer vision, such as segmentation, filtering, stereo, reconstruction, inpainting and optical flow seek solutions that match the data while satisfying an additional regularization, such as total variation or boundary length. A regularization which has received less attention is to minimize the curvature of the solution. One reason why this regularization has received less attention is due to the difficulty in finding an optimal solution to this image model, since many existing methods are complicated, slow and/or provide a suboptimal solution. Following the recent progress of Schoenemann et al. [28], we provide a simple formulation of curvature regularization which admits a fast optimization which gives globally optimal solutions in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying this curvature regularization to image segmentation.	combinatorial optimization;computation;computer vision;correspondence problem;discretization;global optimization;image segmentation;inpainting;manifold regularization;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;missing data;optical flow;pixel;programming paradigm;requirement;scott continuity;signal-to-noise ratio	Noha Youssry El-Zehiry;Leo Grady	2010	2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540057	iterative reconstruction;filter;regularization perspectives on support vector machines;backus–gilbert method;data modeling;computer vision;mathematical optimization;missing data;computer science;stereopsis;machine learning;optical flow;optical filter;mathematics;image segmentation;matched filter;computational model;total variation;integral equation;pixel;global optimization;satisfiability	Vision	56.35779387094818	-73.38460358208472	23611

Since ecological challenges resulting from high optimal N rates and a low N harvest index are approaching on WOSR cropping systems, optimizing N fertilization becomes crucial. Recent studies showed the importance of taking autumnal N uptake into account when estimating optimal N rates for WOSR, thus autumnal N is pivotal in the algorithm that is introduced in this study. The algorithm was parameterized by using data from site-specific N fertilization trials and optimized to reduce N fertilizer amounts. Afterwards it was tested on different commercial farms in northern Germany. The autumnal N uptake was estimated using hyperspectral reflection measurements gained from tractor-mounted devices, and the data was processed to N application maps used for the N application in spring. In addition, a uniform optimal fertilization and a uniform application of average N rates calculated by the algorithm were applied to provide control treatments. Yield, N balance and economic net-revenue were evaluated for each treatment. Yields from site-specific fertilization were slightly lower (0.06 t/ha) than from uniform optimal treatment but 0.22 t/ha higher than from the uniform application of the site-specific N amount (not significant in both cases). The N balance was significantly lower when fertilizing site-specifically instead of applying uniform optimal N rate, while the net-revenues were slightly higher.	algorithm	Ingo Pahlmann;Ulf Böttcher;Henning Kage	2017	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2016.12.005	botany;precision agriculture;agronomy;remote sensing	NLP	84.94634936144789	-57.49705135444544	23627

Surface temperature difference(STD) distribution diagrams were prepared and verified, based on the surface temperatures of wide and flat playgrounds of schools. The surface temperatures of the entire city were rearranged as an axis to enable temporal and spatial analysis of surface temperatures. STD distributions in relation to land-cover could be seen. The reason why the STD of rice paddies existed was the differences in water states before and after rice-planting. In addition, yearly changes in STD distributions in industrial regions and downtown regions could be seen. Diverse aspects of STD analysis methods were described to verify the methods.	diagram;optic axis of a crystal;std bus;spatial analysis;time series	Jin A.

So far, the application of the PS technique has been focused on the extraction of the motion field of the area of interest. However, it is also known that PS relative elevations can be estimated with sub-meter precision while smooth errors can be removed using a coarse resolution DEM or the data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). In this paper, we describe a new approach combining the PS Technique and standard interferometry to improve the quality of lnSAR DEM's. ERS Tandem interferograms are exploited to increase the number of coherent pixels, while atmospheric effects are estimated and subtracted by means of the sparse PS grid. Prior information and PS elevation are used to reduce the probability of phase-unwrapping errors. Preliminary results are reported and the key-factors for its successful application (e.g. the number of Tandem acquisitions available, PS density) are discussed.	baseline (configuration management);coherence (physics);instantaneous phase;molecular orbital;motion field;ps-algol;pixel;shuttle radar topography mission;sparse matrix;tandem computers	Alessandro Parizzi;Daniele Perissin;Claudio Prati;Fabio Rocca;Alessandro Ferretti	2006	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/IGARSS.2006.45	geodesy;geology;optics;shuttle radar topography mission;remote sensing	EDA	75.43541187892761	-65.0472948195919	23735

Ship navigation benefits from up-to-date sea ice analyses at both regional and local scales. This study presents a satellite-based sea ice navigation system (SatSINS) that integrates observations and scientific output from remote sensing and meteorological data to develop optimum marine navigational routes in sea ice-covered waters, especially in areas where operational ice information is usually scarce. The system and its applications are presented in the context of a decision-making process to optimize the routing of the RV Xuelong during her passage through Prydz Bay, East Antarctica during three trips in the austral spring of 2011–2013. The study assesses scientifically-generated remote sensing ice parameters for their operational use in marine navigation. Evaluation criteria involve identification of priority parameters, their spatio-temporal requirements in relation to navigational needs, and their level of accuracy in conjunction with the severity of ice conditions. Coarse-resolution ice concentration maps are sufficient to delineate ice edge and develop a safe route when ice concentration is less than 70%, provided that ice dynamics, estimated from examining the cyclonic pattern, is not severe. Otherwise, fine-resolution radar data should be used to identify and avoid deformed ice. Satellite data lagging one day behind the actual location of the ship was sufficient in most cases although the proposed route may have to be adjusted. To evaluate the utility of SatSINS, deviation of the actual route from the proposed route was calculated and found to range between 165 m to about 16.0 km with standard deviations of 2.8–6.1 km. Growth of land-fast ice has proven to be an essential component of the system as it was estimated using a thermodynamic model with input from a meteorological station.	dead sea scrolls;logistics;map;radar;requirement;routing	Fengming Hui;Tiancheng Zhao;Xinqing Li;Mohammed Shokr;Petra Heil;Jiechen Zhao;Lin Zhang;Xiao Cheng	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9060518	meteorology;sea ice thickness;navigation;oceanography;sea ice concentration;sea ice;physics;remote sensing	HCI	82.62073596847219	-58.93961363708174	23782

For each scene there are on average two low-noise and two high noise images that are aligned at the pixel level both spatially and in intensity. The dataset contains over 100 scenes and more than 400 images, including both RAW formatted images and 8 bit BMP pixel and intensity aligned images. We also introduce a method for estimating the true noise level in each of our images. We use our dataset to analyze three current state of the art denoising algorithms: Active Random Field, BM3D, and Multi-Layer Perceptron. We found that BM3D obtains the best denoising results, however it is the slowest of the three methods with Active Random Field taking only a few seconds and MultiLater Perceptron and BM3D taking a few minutes to half an hour to denoise a 10 to 18 mega-pixel image.	acoustic radiation force;algorithm;bmp file format;benchmark (computing);color depth;computation;digital camera;ground truth;noise (electronics);noise reduction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;perceptron;pixel;quad flat no-leads package;raw image format;structural similarity;time complexity	Josue Anaya;Adrian Barbu	2014	CoRR		computer vision;data mining;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.69302620912311	-57.8260381706822	23893

We proposed a novel method for estimating an optimal transmission map and recovering the real scene. Under HSI color model, saturation layer and intensity layer are mixed together for obtaining the rough transmission. To avoid halos and artifacts, proposed approach employs edge preserving constraint of shrinkage neighborhood on the color line model, which can maintain maximum smoothness and sharp edges in the refined transmission map.

d98e06fba6172f6e66c263ba9165e9196511adc1	exploitation of copernicus sentinels data for sensing fire-disturbed vegetated areas		This paper aims at investigating the use of microwave and optical images for the detection and characterization of fire scars in vegetated areas. To cope with this issue, Sentinel-l (S-1) C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and multispectral Sentinel-2 (S-2) multispectral data are used. First, a consolidated fuzzy-based methodology, specifically designed for retrieving burned areas, is considered. Then, an investigation based on the analysis of the maps of backscattering coefficients, as obtained by processing stacks of SAR images, is performed. The outcomes obtained with SAR data are validated by comparison with the results obtained with the optical multispectral data. Presented experiments are related to the Soberanes fires, California, which ignited on July 22,2016, and affected more than 400 square kilometers. In addition, we explore the potential use of stacks of spatial coherence maps generated from pairs of complex-valued SAR images that encompass a fire event to recover new, additional information on the vegetation state and extent of the fire scars.

The spectral bands utilized span visible, near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and mid-wave infrared (MWIR). The primary detection band is in the SWIR, centered at 1.6 μm. Without solar input, the SWIR spectral band records sensor noise, punctuated by high radiant emissions associated with gas flares, biomass burning, volcanoes, and industrial sites such as steel mills. Planck curve fitting of the hot source radiances yields temperature (K) and emission scaling factor (ESF). Additional calculations are done to estimate source size (m), radiant heat intensity (W/m), and radiant heat (MW). Use of the sensor noise limited M7, M8, and M10 spectral bands at night reduce scene background effects, which are widely reported for fire algorithms based on MWIR and long-wave infrared. High atmospheric transmissivity in the M10 spectral band reduces atmospheric effects on temperature and radiant heat retrievals. Nightfire retrieved temperature estimates for sub-pixel hot sources ranging from 600 to 6,000 K. An intercomparison study of biomass burning in Sumatra from June 2013 found Nightfire radiant heat (MW) to be highly correlated to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Fire Radiative Power (MW).	algorithm;beneath a steel sky;curve fitting;image noise;image scaling;integrated circuit layout design protection;microwave;multispectral image;pixel;radiant ai	Christopher D.

The UW-SCAT post-processing procedure allowed for the observation of σ° at the surface (snow/ice interface, ice types) and the ice volume. Observations indicated that: (1) σ° associated with the development of tubular bubbles within the ice volume causes double-bounce of the signal and high returns at X- and Ku-bands; (2) ice types at the surface (grey ice) composed of high density spherical micro-bubbles result in σ° increases at both X- and Ku-bands; and (3) the removal of snow overlying ice results in a drop in Ku-band σ° up to 5.5 dB, exhibiting sensitivity to snow water equivalent.	ku band;l band;snow;video post-processing	Grant E.

The TOR consists of a high-precision dual-frequency GPS receiver, called integrated GPS occultation receiver (IGOR), for precise orbit determination and atmospheric sounding and a laser retro-reflector (LRR) serving as target for the global satellite laser ranging (SLR) ground station network. The TOR is supplied by the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ) Germany, and the Center for Space Research (CSR), Austin, Texas. The objective of the German/US collaboration is twofold: provision of atmospheric profiles for use in numerical weather predictions and climate studies from the occultation data and precision SAR data processing based on precise orbits and atmospheric products. GFZ also supplies the TOR instrumentation for the follow-on mission TanDEM-X. For the scientific objectives of the TanDEM- X mission, i.e. bi-static SAR together with TerraSAR-X, the dual- frequency GPS receiver is of vital importance for the millimeter level determination of the baseline between the two spacecrafts. In the following, the TOR instrumentation is characterized by the features of and accuracies achievable with the GPS receiver and the LRR. The data flow is shown, as GFZ operates a high latitude data receiving station for fast data access, and runs a data system for preprocessing, archiving and retrieval. With this data system, higher level products are generated for TerraSAR- X, including near real-time orbits by GFZ and post-processed precise science orbits by GFZ and CSR. In the case of TanDEM- X, GFZ operationally determines the inter-satellite baseline on the millimeter level. CSR produces calibration orbits to support the GFZ operational activity. Orbit results in terms of latency and accuracy from current missions are given and achievable results for TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X are discussed.	archive;automatic sounding;baseline (configuration management);data access;data system;dataflow;gps navigation device;global positioning system;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;preprocessor;real-time clock;real-time computing;toshiba satellite	Markus Rothacher;Byron D.

03a6127d5b97f9f71ab7086e16c218ce1026e1c2	stochastic parameterization to represent variability and extremes in climate modeling		Unresolved sub-grid processes, those which are too small or dissipate too quickly to be captured within a model’s spatial resolution, are not adequately parameterized by conventional numerical climate models. Sub-grid heterogeneity is lost in parameterizations that quantify only the ‘bulk effect’ of sub-grid dynamics on the resolved scales. A unique solution, one unreliant on increased grid resolution, is the employment of stochastic parameterization of the sub-grid to reintroduce variability. We administer this approach in a coupled land-atmosphere model, one that combines the single-column Community Atmosphere Model (CAM-SC) and the single-point Community Land Model (CLM-SP), by incorporating a stochastic representation of sub-grid latent heat flux to force the distribution of precipitation. Sub-grid differences in surface latent heat flux arise from the mosaic of Plant Functional Types (PFT) that describe terrestrial land cover. With the introduction of a stochastic parameterization framework to affect the distribution of sub-grid PFT’s, we alter the distribution of convective precipitation over regions with high PFT variability. The stochastically forced precipitation probability density functions (pdf) show lengthened tails, demonstrating the retrieval of rare events. Through model data analysis we show that the stochastic model increases both the frequency and intensity of rare events in comparison to conventional deterministic parameterization.	channel length modulation;climate model;deterministic algorithm;heart rate variability;numerical analysis;portable document format;rare events;spatial variability;tails;terrestrial television	Roisin Langan;Rick Archibald;Matthew Plumlee;Salil Mahajan;Daniel M.

We show how to transform the problem of recovering surface normals that satisfy Lambert's law into that of solving the steady state heat equation for a scalar potential. According to this picture, the smoothed field of surface normals is found by taking the gradient of the scalar field. The heat equation for the scalar field can be solved using simple finite difference methods, and leads to an iterative procedure for vector estimation. We illustrate the utility of the new method on real world imagery and compare our results with those delivered by an alternative.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;experiment;finite difference method;finite element method;gradient;iterative method;normal (geometry);photometric stereo;shading;smoothing;steady state;synthetic intelligence	Antonio Robles-Kelly;Edwin R.

d2abad562cd4b02617a2c518bd74186f8410c3d9	deep spectral reflectance and illuminant estimation from self-interreflections		In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network based approach to estimate the spectral reflectance of a surface and spectral power distribution of light from a single RGB image of a V-shaped surface. Interreflections happening in a concave surface lead to gradients of RGB values over its area. These gradients carry a lot of information concerning the physical properties of the surface and the illuminant. Our network is trained with only simulated data constructed using a physics-based interreflection model. Coupling interreflection effects with deep learning helps to retrieve the spectral reflectance under an unknown light and to estimate spectral power distribution of this light as well. In addition, it is more robust to the presence of image noise than classical approaches. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based approaches on simulated data. In addition, it gives better results on real data compared to other interreflection-based approaches.

The amount of spaceborne data acquired within the TanDEM-X mission allows for the characterization of X-band backscatter on a global scale. The objective of this paper is to present a method for the characterization of radar backscatter behavior using a global statistical approach. The worldwide data set of images acquired within the TanDEM-X mission is taken into account, having the chance to exploit the unique high-quality topography information associated to it. The input measurements are differently assessed, by using a quality-based approach. A series of models can be derived, focusing on the backscatter dependence on polarization, incidence angle, ground classification, and seasonal time. The developed approach for the algorithm's verification is presented as well, together with some preliminary results obtained from TanDEM-X mission data. The generation of up-to-date backscatter models for X-band will provide a useful database for the development of a large number of scientific applications and for the optimization of future radar systems.	algorithm;aperture (software);backscatter (email);incidence matrix;mathematical optimization;polarization (waves);radar;synthetic data;topography	Paola Rizzoli;Benjamin Bräutigam	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2294352	meteorology;man-portable radar;contextual image classification;synthetic aperture radar;digital elevation model;geodesy;data acquisition;radar imaging;backscatter;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	79.1273349441084	-63.410093346662684	24255

The mathematical theory behind this assertion is based on the fact that Toeplitz and circulant random matrices generated from independent identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian random sequences satisfy the restricted isometry property. In real systems, waveforms have smooth, nonideal autocorrelation functions, thereby degrading the performance of compressive sensing algorithms. Compressive sensing requires the system matrix to have particular properties. Incorporating prior information into the target scene either to enhance imaging or to mitigate nonidealities can result in system matrices that are not suitable for compressive sensing. We can overcome this problem by designing appropriate transmit waveforms. We extend the existing theory to incorporate such nonidealities into the analysis of compressive recovery. As an example we consider the problem of tailoring waveforms to image extended targets. Extended targets make the target scene denser, causing random transmit waveforms to be suboptimal for recovery. We propose to incorporate extended targets by considering them to be sparsely representable in redundant dictionaries. We demonstrate that a low complexity algorithm to optimize the transmit waveform leads to improved performance.	radar;ultra-wideband;waveform	Mahesh C. Shastry;Ram M.

083e3b7b814c67dbe05fba74beccac65dc09603b	temporal upscaling of remote sensing instantaneous evapotranspiration estimated at two satellite overpass times		Quantification of land surface evapotranspiration (ET) at daily or longer time scales is of great significance in agricultural ecosystem and hydrologic cycle. Temporal upscaling of instantaneous remote sensing-based ET to daily or longer time scales is generally only based on a single instantaneous estimate. A test is made to use two instantaneous ET estimates for the daily upscaling. The results show that the temporal upscaling using two instantaneous ET estimates is superior to that using only single instantaneous ET estimate for the constant extraterrestrial solar radiation ratio (Rp) method, the constant global solar radiation ratio (Rg) method, and the constant evaporative fraction (EF) method. The largest improvement of daily ET estimation occurs when instantaneous ET in the morning is combined with that in the afternoon for the Rp and Rg methods, while the for EF method the optimal combination comprises of two moments in the afternoon.	cloud fraction;ecosystem;entity framework	Tong Wang;Ronglin Tang;Zhao-Liang Li;Bo-Hui Tang;Hua Wu	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127276	evapotranspiration;remote sensing;radiation;computer science;satellite;water cycle	Robotics	84.14848870679315	-58.845460724868296	24346

It can adaptively confirm the quantity of the carving seams in both horizontal and vertical directions according to the homogeneous region distribution obtained from the significance map. The significance map is a weighted average of the gradient magnitude and saliency measure which is calculated by our multi-resolution saliency model. Comparing the previous unidirectional seam carving methods of backward and forward, our method fully utilizes the available homogeneous information in arbitrary position of the original image. Therefore, it will avoid to delete or insert seams passing through the prominent features and structure objects so as to decrease or even eliminate the artifacts of staircase effects.	seam carving	Meiling Shi;Guoqin Peng;Lei Yang;Dan Xu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14533-9_47	seam carving;computer vision;computer graphics (images)	Vision	56.84608757519324	-60.9631070188321	24369

Recently, it has been suggested that GNSS-R can also be used for ship detection applications. To this purpose, an accurate electromagnetic modeling of the bistatic radar cross section of a ship lying over the sea surface would be very helpful. However, existing models are typically limited to monostatic configurations, thus restricting their applicability in multistatic scenarios, such as GNSS-R systems. In this work, we show a procedure to determine the bistatic radar cross section of a ship target, under the geometrical optics approximation. Numerical results show the impact of the geometry of acquisition and polarization on the bistatic radar cross section.	approximation;computational electromagnetics;cross section (geometry);global positioning system;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);reflectometry;satellite navigation	Walter Fuscaldo;Alessio Di Simone;Leonardo M.

In most cases, the notion of g od strongly depends on the concrete application. Moreover, when an intuitive definition of good view is available, it is often difficult to establish a measure that brings it to the practice. Commonly, two kinds of viewing parameters must be set: camera parameters (position and orientation) and lighting parameters (number of light sources, its position and eventually the orientation of the spot). The first ones will determine how much of the geometry can be captured and the latter will influence on how much of it is revealed (i. e. illuminated) to the user. Unfortunately, ensuring that certain parts of a scene are lit does not make sure that the details will be communicated to the user, as the amount of illumination might be too small or too high. In this paper we define a metric to calculate the amount of information relative to an object that is effectively communicated to the user given a fixed camera position. This measure is based on an information-based concept, the Shannon entropy, and will be applied to the problem of automatic selection of light positions in order to adequately illuminate an object. In order to validate the results, we have carried out an experiment on users, this experiment helped us to explore other related measures.	algorithm;color;computability in europe;computer;emoticon;entropy (information theory);gaussian blur;haar wavelet;horseland;pose (computer vision);shannon (unit);wavelet transform	Pere-Pau Vázquez	2007	Comput.

The data set used is composed of images from ASTER, visible and thermal, and ENVISAT SAR sensors. The processing and the analysis of data from different sources were performed in order to obtain the tsunami inundation map of the Sendai coastal area, to analyze inland factors driving the tsunami inundation, and to detect the liquefaction effects in the Chiba bay area as well. The obtained inundation line, with a maximum value of about 6 km, has been jointly analyzed with digital elevation model providing the run-up values, which are generally below 21 m in the ca. 60-km-long study area of Sendai. Moreover, from SAR coherence and intensity correlation, a wide area of subsidence is mapped at Chiba bay, which is reasonably related to strong ground shaking and pervasive liquefaction.	circa;digital elevation model;flood;map;pervasive informatics;sensor;stunt island;topography	Marco Chini;Alessandro Piscini;Francesca Romana Cinti;Stefania Amici;Rosa Nappi;Paolo Marco DeMartini	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2012.2205661	seismology;synthetic aperture radar;coherence;digital elevation model;geology;specific absorption rate;geotechnical engineering;backscatter;liquefaction;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	82.05440050241587	-60.80660228793377	24506

2c2f32845bdaf05478204c90aada91af132c56d6	assessing the altimetric measurement from cygnss data		The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission was designed to study hurricane intensification by measuring wind speeds in tropical cyclones. However, the delay-Doppler maps (DDM) that are produced can be used to estimate the sea surface height (SSH) at the specular reflection point on the ocean surface. Proof-of-concept studies that DDMs are suitable to solve for SSH have been recently reported (Clarizia et al., 2016; Mashburn et al., 2018), based on data acquired by the demonstration satellite experiment Tech Demo Sat −1 (TDS-1) carrying a GNSS-R receiver similar to the ones onboard CYGNSS. Although the precision of each 1-sec averaged SSH is considerably lower than that of the existing satellite altimeters, by virtue of the dense coverage and frequent revisit time exhibited by the constellation of 8 microsats, the error may be smoothed down considerably by optimal interpolation (Li et al., 2016). Hence the CYGNSS dataset presents a potential opportunity to sample the tropical oceans, and investigate the sensitivity of the SSH measurements to mesoscale eddies.	cyclone;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;interpolation;satellite navigation;smoothing	Cinzia Zuffada;Bruce J.

We make use of an efficient statistical model to evaluate the occlusion factor in screen-space using a single sample. Overestimations and halos are reduced by an adaptive layering of the visible geometry. Bias at tilted surfaces is avoided by projecting and evaluating the volumetric obscurance in tangent space of each surface point. We compare our approach to several traditional screen-space ambient obscurance techniques and show its competitive qualitative and quantitative performance. Our algorithm maps well to graphics hardware, does not require the traditional bilateral blur step of previous approaches, and avoids typical screen-space related artifacts such as temporal instability due to undersampling.	algorithm;ambient intelligence;ambient occlusion;bilateral filter;colour banding;gaussian blur;glossary of computer graphics;graphics hardware;instability;map;statistical model;undersampling;volumetric display	Quintjin Hendrickx;Leonardo Scandolo;Martin Eisemann;Elmar Eisemann	2015		10.1145/2790060.2790070	computer vision;computer science;optics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	64.54715126027827	-52.492189480213256	24582

Simulation results show that in red-NIR reflectance space, variations in red and NIR channels to aerosol optical depth (AOD) follow a specific pattern. Based on this rational, the apparent reflectance in these two bands of neighboring pixels were used to reduce aerosol effects on NDVI values of the central pixel. We call this method the neighboring pixels (NP) algorithm. Validation was performed over vegetated regions in the border area between China and Russia using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Results reveal good agreement between the aerosol corrected NDVI using our algorithm and that derived from the Landsat 8 surface reflectance products. The accuracy is related to the gradient of NDVI variation. This algorithm can achieve high accuracy in homogeneous forest or cropland with the root mean square error (RMSE) being equal to 0.046 and 0.049, respectively. This algorithm can also be applied to atmospheric correction and does not require any information about atmospheric conditions. The use of the moving window analysis technique reduces errors caused by the spatial heterogeneity of aerosols. Detections of regions with homogeneous NDVI are the primary sources of biases. This new method is operational and can prove useful at different aerosol concentration levels. In the future, this approach may also be used to examine other indexes composed of bands attenuated by noises in remote sensing.	pixel	Dandan Wang;Yunhao Chen;Mengjie Wang;Jingling Quan;Tao Jiang	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8060489	meteorology;hydrology;remote sensing	HCI	84.18278444217901	-59.729493650360034	24725

Signal sparsity is an essential condition for compressed sensing. In this work, a multi-scale sparsifying transform based on the Fresnel transform (FREBAS) is adopted in order to improve the quality of CS images. The experimental results demonstrate that by increasing the sparsity of the image in the FREBAS transform domain, curved features in MR images can be more faithfully reconstructed than is possible using the traditional wavelet transform or curvelet transform particularly for low sampling rates in k-space. In addition, proposed method is robust to the selection of sampling trajectory of NMR signal. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

396a330ccda12af5773c336ccca2bc17d2b70c11	image denoising using new adaptive based median filters		Noise is a major issue while transferring images through all kinds of electronic communication. One of the most common noise in electronic communication is an impulse noise which is caused by unstable voltage. In this paper, the comparison of known image denoising techniques is discussed and a new technique using the decision based approach has been used for the removal of impulse noise. All these methods can primarily preserve image details while suppressing impulsive noise. The principle of these techniques is at first introduced and then analysed with various simulation results using MATLAB. Most of the previously known techniques are applicable for the denoising of images corrupted with less noise density. Here a new decision based technique has been presented which shows better performances than those already being used. The comparisons are made based on visual appreciation and further quantitatively by Mean Square error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of different filtered images..	algorithm;computation;control theory;image noise;impulse noise (audio);infinite impulse response;matlab;mean squared error;median filter;noise reduction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;performance;simulation;time complexity	Suman Shrestha	2014	CoRR		gradient noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;computer vision;speech recognition;dark-frame subtraction;value noise;noise measurement;noise;mathematics;video denoising;salt-and-pepper noise	EDA	57.027612878598646	-65.95320206010256	24884

The generation of the multi-scale data set is based on fractal net evolution approach. The set of scales used are selected optimally from the scale domain to ensure good enough representation of the scale domain. The change detection is performed on each scale image independently then the information extracted from all the scales is fused to construct the final change map. A scale-driven method is proposed to fuse the multi-scale information. The method detects for each object the preferred scale to model it and hence can get the change information for this object to form the final change map. The proposed system is compared against different multi-scale systems and proved to perform better.	fractal;principle of good enough	Eid Emary;Khaled Mostafa;Hoda Onsi	2009	2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414400	database index;computer vision;computer science;pattern recognition;data mining;accuracy and precision;image segmentation;change detection;information extraction;pixel;statistics;principal component analysis	Robotics	72.4031085108062	-61.67385170286114	24927
737a516659cd8af3cf9411311a1b48f53627e645	shape from multi-view images based on image generation consistency		There are various and a lot of depth recovery methods have been studied, but a discussion about an unification of individual methods is expected not to be enough yet. In this study, we argue that the importance and the necessity of an image generation consistency. Various clues including binocular disparity, motion parallax, texture, shading and so on can be effectively used for depth recovery for the case where each or some of those are completely performed. However, in general, those clues without shading cause ideal and simplified constraints, and for several cases those clues without shading are suitable for obtaining initial depth values for the unification algorithm based on an image generation consistency. On the other hand, shading indicates a strict characteristics for image generation and should be used for the key principle for the unification. Based on the above strategy, as a first step of our scheme, through a simple problem with two-views, the unification of binocular disparity and shading without explicit disparity detection is examined based on an image generation consistency, and simple evaluation results are shown by simulations.	algorithm;binocular disparity;binocular vision;computation;glossary of computer graphics;kalman filter;loss function;optimization problem;parallax;shading;simulation;unification (computer science);vagueness	Kousuke Wakabayashi;Norio Tagawa;Kan Okubo	2013			computer vision;image formation	Vision	57.45878864078399	-52.883078022278255	24941

(contributions to determination of optical flow using the calculus of variations techniques: modeling the spatial and the temporal information)		This work investigates a novel approach for cloud motion wind (CMW) estimation of Meteosat infrared images. It is motivated by the fact that variational techniques, such as those employed for computing the optical flow, are successfully applied to many computer vision applications but fail in this particular applicative context, mainly because optical flow techniques are adapted to rigid objects on visible data. The objective of this work is not to propose a full operational process for CMW estimation, but rather to improve optical flow techniques by applying constraints adapted to the specificity of meteorological infrared imagery.  2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When interferometric measurements originate from both point-like and distributed targets, the coherence has to be correctly estimated by adaptively grouping and averaging pixels sharing similar scattering properties. In this paper, we present a method to estimate coherence for DInSAR stack by exploiting the multi-temporal phase statistics. The key point of the proposed solution relies on the capability of averaging each pixel with its statistical homogeneous neighborhood, thus allowing a more accurate coherence estimation. Experimental results on real SAR data acquired by ENVISAT satellite, over Shanghai City, China demonstrate the validity of proposed method.	pixel;signal-to-noise ratio	J.

Furthermore, the source function is usually not known or is known only approximately. This article presents an efficient multichannel blind deconvolution for addressing these problems and restoring three-dimensional (3D) seismic data based on a variational approach. To overcome the ill-posedness of the deconvolution problem, appropriate regularizers are used for the reflectivity and source. A new sparsity and continuity-promoting regularizer is introduced which is able to promote temporal sparsity and at the same time continuity along 3D singularities in reflectivity space. Sparsity in a wavelet domain is used as source prior. To find a solution for the overall problem, we alternate between two subproblems: 3D reflectivity estimation and updating the source. Each subproblem consists of solving a convex constrained optimization which is carried out very fast and efficiently via the alternating split Bregman iteration. We use the generalized cross validation criterion for determining the optimum number of Bregman iterations. We illustrate the performance and optimality of our blind deconvolution with simulated and field seismic data.	algorithm;authorization;blind deconvolution;bregman divergence;calculus of variations;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;constrained optimization;data cube;dual ec drbg;emoticon;iteration;mathematical optimization;numerical aperture;scott continuity;smoothing;sparse matrix;synthetic data;ut-vpn;variational principle;wavelet transform;well-posed problem	Ali Gholami;Mauricio D.

An analysis of their performances has shown that the best performance is always achieved by the sensors resulting from the minimization process over Lam's data set. Some of these performances are statistically equivalent to and even better than those obtained using the CMCCAT2000 and the nonlinear Bradford transforms. This result reinforces both the use of Lam's set as a good representation for the other CCP data sets, and the e orts mentioned in the literature towards the removal of the nonlinearity of the CAT of the CIECAM97 model.	lam/mpi;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;performance;sensor	Roberto Costantini;Michael Ansorge;Javier Bracamonte;Fausto Pellandini	2002			artificial intelligence;mathematics;computer vision;perception;chromatic adaptation	Vision	63.27137711043984	-69.3602570652672	25074
1a558ba8d2868f13e2f0fbd8c0d1e96bdfb3b78f	analysis of settlement expansion and urban growth modelling using geoinformation for assessing potential impacts of urbanization on climate in abuja city, nigeria	settlement expansion;urban growth modelling;support vector machines;deutsches fernerkundungsdatenzentrum;climate impact;land cover change	This study analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of settlement expansion in Abuja, Nigeria, one of West Africa’s fastest developing cities, using geoinformation and ancillary datasets. Three epochs of Land-use Land-cover (LULC) maps for 1986, 2001 and 2014 were derived from Landsat images using support vector machines (SVM). Accuracy assessment (AA) of the LULC maps based on the pixel count resulted in overall accuracy of 82%, 92% and 92%, while the AA derived from the error adjusted area (EAA) method stood at 69%, 91% and 91% for 1986, 2001 and 2014, respectively. Two major techniques for detecting changes in the LULC epochs involved the use of binary maps as well as a post-classification comparison approach. Quantitative spatiotemporal analysis was conducted to detect LULC changes with specific focus on the settlement development pattern of Abuja, the federal capital city (FCC) of Nigeria. Logical transitions to the urban category were modelled for predicting future scenarios for the year 2050 using the embedded land change modeler (LCM) in the IDRISI package. Based on the EAA, the result showed that urban areas increased by more than 11% between 1986 and 2001. In contrast, this value rose to 17% between 2001 and 2014. The LCM model projected LULC changes that showed a growing trend in settlement expansion, which might take over allotted spaces for green areas and agricultural land if stringent development policies and enforcement measures are not implemented. In conclusion, integrating geospatial technologies with ancillary datasets offered improved understanding of how urbanization processes such as increased imperviousness of such a magnitude could influence the urban microclimate through the alteration of natural land surface temperature. Urban expansion could also lead to increased surface runoff as well as changes in drainage geography leading to urban floods.	algorithm;climate model;computer vision;embedded system;epoch (reference date);error detection and correction;fastest;geographic information system;image analysis;image resolution;information extraction;latent class model;map;pixel;preprocessor;propagation of uncertainty;random forest;sensor;software propagation;spatiotemporal pattern;support vector machine;typset and runoff;terrset geospatial monitoring and modeling software;topography	Mahmoud Ibrahim Mahmoud;Alfred Duker;Christopher Conrad;Michael Thiel;Halilu Shaba Ahmad	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8030220	support vector machine;machine learning;ecology;remote sensing	HCI	81.90918133312341	-56.422670557444754	25127
d64efffe9ac94329c17f600a3b39c02ddf227c69	using machine learning to discern eruption in noisy environments: a case study using co2-driven cold-water geyser in chimayo, new mexico		We present an approach based on machine learning (ML) to distinguish eruption and precursory signals of Chimayó geyser (New Mexico, USA) under noisy environments. This geyser can be considered as a natural analog of CO2 intrusion into shallow water aquifers. By studying this geyser, we can understand upwelling of CO2-rich fluids from depth, which has relevance to leak monitoring in a CO2 sequestration project. ML methods such as Random Forests (RF) are known to be robust multi-class classifiers and perform well under unfavorable noisy conditions. However, the extent of the RF method’s accuracy is poorly understood for this CO2-driven geysering application. The current study aims to quantify the performance of RF-classifiers to discern the geyser state. Towards this goal, we first present the data collected from the seismometer that is installed near the Chimayó geyser. The seismic signals collected at this site contain different types of noises such as daily temperature variations, seasonal trends, animal movement near the geyser, and human activity. First, we filter the signals from these noises by combining the Butterworth-Highpass filter and an Autoregressive method in a multi-level fashion. We show that by combining these filtering techniques, in a hierarchical fashion, leads to reduction in the noise in the seismic data without removing the precursors and eruption event signals. We then use RF on the filtered data to classify the state of geyser into three classes – remnant noise, precursor, and eruption states. We show that the classification accuracy using RF on the filtered data is greater than 90%. We also evaluate the accuracy of other classical time-series methods such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) on filtered data along with RF on partially-filtered data where we remove the seasonal trends. Classification accuracy shows that DTW performs poorly (44%) and RF on partially-filtered data performs decently (87%). Denoising seismic signals from both seasonal trends and human activity enhances RF classifier performance by 7%.

The aim of MOUSE campaign was to establish the brightness temperature dependence on the soil type and moisture content [1]. For this study and for the retrieval of the soil moisture content from radiometric measurements, it is necessary to use accurate models for the soil complex dielectric constant. This paper presents a technique to measure the complex dielectric constant using a microwave stripline setup, and its application to the soil samples measured during MOUSE 2004 campaign. The measured dielectric constants of each soil type versus volumetric soil moisture (0% to 40%) are compared with the values obtained using models already appeared in the literature.

The task of measuring and analyzing appropriate colors from colored images, which matches human sensitivity for perceiving colors has been a challenge to the research community. In this paper we propose a novel approach, which involves the use of fuzzy logic and reasoning to analyze the RGB color intensities extracted from sensory inputs to understand human sensitivity for various colors. Based on this approach, an intelligent system has been built to predict the subject's personality. The results of experiments conducted with this system are discussed in the paper.

The Titan multiwave lidar is manufactured by Teledyne Optech Inc. (Toronto, ON, Canada) and emits laser pulses in the 1550, 1064 and 532 nm wavelengths simultaneously through a single oscillating mirror scanner at pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) that range from 50 to 300 kHz per wavelength (max combined PRF of 900 kHz). The Titan system can perform simultaneous mapping in terrestrial and very shallow water environments and its multispectral capability enables new applications, such as the production of false color active imagery derived from the lidar return intensities and the automated classification of target and land covers. Field tests and mapping projects performed over the past two years demonstrate capabilities to classify five land covers in urban environments with an accuracy of 90%, map bathymetry under more than 15 m of water, and map thick vegetation canopies at sub-meter vertical resolutions. In addition to its multispectral and performance characteristics, the Titan system is designed with several redundancies and diversity schemes that have proven to be beneficial for both operations and the improvement of data quality.	multispectral image;titan	Juan Carlos Fernandez Diaz;William E.

The results showed that both NDVI and EVI could discern the seasonal variation of the evergreen forests. Attributed to the sufficient precipitation in the study area, the growth of vegetation is mainly controlled by energy; as a result, NDVI, and especially EVI, is more correlated with temperature and PAR than precipitation. Compared with NDVI, EVI is more sensitive to climate condition and is a better indicator to study vegetation variations in the study region	coefficient;inverted index;seasonality;time series	Fangping Deng;Gaoli Su;Chuang Liu	2007	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2006.888844	meteorology;enhanced vegetation index;photosynthetically active radiation;climatology;physics;remote sensing	HCI	83.63612706430519	-57.41453525283149	25216

With the utilization of the presented method, the SNR of the target range profiles is improved, the conventional ISAR motion compensation methods perform much better, and the ISAR image result is much better focused under a low SNR condition.

364220f5f4dd762631ff6fbc0aea9c54266bfaa9	video stitching based on iterative hashing and dynamic seam-line with local context		Video stitching fuses multi-camera videos with differing centers of projection into a single panoramic video. Image registration and video fusion is the key of video stitching. In this paper, a robust and real-time video stitching method based on iterative hashing and best dynamic seam-line with local context model is proposed, which can eliminate ghosting and ensure real-time in video stitching. Firstly, the iterative hashing algorithm is proposed to improve the speed and precision of image registration. Image feature points are matched by constructing a multi-table, extracting candidates and refining candidates with iteration, which enhances the local sensitivity of hashing and speeds up the process of feature points matching. Secondly, the method of finding the best seam-line dynamically and blending with local context is proposed to improve the quality of video fusion. The proposed video fusion method is able to eliminate ghosting and illumination variation during video stitching. In addition, the speed of video stitching can be enhanced. Experimental results on several scenes show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed video stitching method.	algorithm;alpha compositing;digital video;feature (computer vision);hash function;image fusion;image registration;iteration;real-time clock;real-time locating system;rollover (key)	Rui Yao;Jinliang Sun;Yong Zhou;Dai Chen	2016	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-016-3738-y	video compression picture types;computer vision;image stitching;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;video denoising;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.193821048244935	-54.64951276005463	25315

In particular, changes in the temporal patterns of precipitation were shown to alter critical aspects of the carbon cycle. To understand the impact of rainfall variability in grasslands, an understanding of the dynamics of surface moisture is critical. Here we characterize spatio-temporal patterns of two standard data products from AMSR-E: vegetation water content and surficial soil moisture. In addition, we explore the sensitivity of these products to an extreme precipitation event as modulated by land cover type. The sensitivities of vegetation water content and soil moisture retrievals were found to be dependent on the NDVI value, with an apparent loss of sensitivity at higher NDVI values. Despite the coarse spatial resolution of the data, the difference in between predawn and afternoon vegetation water content was found to be a potentially source of information about canopy water stress.	carbon cycle;ecosystem;heart rate variability;information source;modulation;motorola canopy;spatial variability;synergy	Marcela Doubkova;Geoffrey M.

The visual importance map is computed automatically with a saliency detection algorithm based on global color contrast. Our technique allows to treat pixels in an image differently based on their content, such that the perceptually important features and photograph's subjective intention can be reflected in the result.

The direct-detection architecture of the radiometer reduces its power consumption and eliminates the need for a local oscillator and mixer, reducing complexity. The instrument includes an ambient blackbody calibration target and a scanning reflector. The reflector rotates to scan the antenna beams in the cross-track direction so that the TEMPEST-D feed horn and receiver view first the blackbody calibration target, then the Earth over a range of nadir angles from −45° to +45°, and finally the cosmic microwave background radiation at 2.73 K. This enables precision end-to-end calibration of the millimeter-wave receivers every scan period. The TEMPEST-D millimeter-wave radiometers are based on 35-nm InP HEMT MMIC low-noise amplifiers and related technology developed under extensive investment by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO).	amplifier;cosmic;end-to-end principle;feed horn;local oscillator;monolithic microwave integrated circuit;raster scan;tempest	Sharmila Padmanabhan;Todd Gaier;Steven C.

They use this map as a reference for the proposed occlusion-aware filter. The proposed filter and hybrid scheme are integrated to correct the flow field iteratively, thus significantly improving the estimation results. The filter also enhances the flow field in occlusion areas.

We demonstrate the potentialities of the device for target tracking on three challenging setup showing the advantages of using acoustic images against baseline algorithms on image tracking. In particular, the proposed approach is able to overcome, often dramatically, visual tracking with state-of-art algorithms, dealing efficiently with occlusions, abrupt variations in visual appearence and camouflage.

Image degradation processes include both linear and nonlinear phenomena. A neural network model combining an adaptive auto-associative network with a random Gaussian process is proposed to restore the blurred image and blur function simultaneously. The noisy and blurred images are modeled as continuous associative networks, whereas auto-associative part determines the image model coefficients and the hetero-associative part determines the blur function of the system. The self-organization like structure provides the potential solution of the blind image restoration problem. The estimation and restoration are implemented by using an iterative gradient based algorithm to minimize the error function.

208d39f23ad1bc01bd2ddcde728d166a556ba8eb	extraction of high-precision urban impervious surfaces from sentinel-2 multispectral imagery via modified linear spectral mixture analysis	sentinel-2;modified linear spectral mixture analysis;normalized difference built-up index;normalized difference vegetation index;urban impervious surface	This study explores the performance of Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery for extracting urban impervious surface using a modified linear spectral mixture analysis (MLSMA) method. Sentinel-2A MSI provided 10 m red, green, blue, and near-infrared spectral bands, and 20 m shortwave infrared spectral bands, which were used to extract impervious surfaces. We aimed to extract urban impervious surfaces at a spatial resolution of 10 m in the main urban area of Guangzhou, China. In MLSMA, a built-up image was first extracted from the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) using the Otsu's method; the high-albedo, low-albedo, vegetation, and soil fractions were then estimated using conventional linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). The LSMA results were post-processed to extract high-precision impervious surface, vegetation, and soil fractions by integrating the built-up image and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The performance of MLSMA was evaluated using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Experimental results revealed that MLSMA can extract the high-precision impervious surface fraction at 10 m with Sentinel-2A imagery. The 10 m impervious surface map of Sentinel-2A is capable of recovering more detail than the 30 m map of Landsat 8. In the Sentinel-2A impervious surface map, continuous roads and the boundaries of buildings in urban environments were clearly identified.	academy;approximation algorithm;bands;coefficient;extraction;guided imagery;image sensor;imager device component;large;least squares;least-squares analysis;less than;machine learning;manuscripts;multispectral image;n-methylsuccinimide;natural science disciplines;otsu's method;silo (dataset);state or province of birth:location:point in time:^patient:nominal;operational definition	Rudong Xu;Jin Liu;Jianhui Xu	2018		10.3390/s18092873	analytical chemistry;remote sensing;multispectral image;impervious surface;engineering	Vision	81.17338348850654	-58.81133655800346	25737

In this paper, it will be revealed that sub-Nyquist sampling intrinsically paves a method to generate multiple false-target images combined with SWJ. Radar pulses are under-sampled and retransmitted to the moving target which needs to be protected. It is demonstrated that deceptive false-target images will be induced after the target scatters the jamming signal back to the radar under the principles of bistatic ISAR configuration. A simulated telecommunication satellite model is adopted as the target which needs protection to verify the effectiveness of the jamming idea.	communications satellite;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;radar;radio frequency;radio jamming;sampling (signal processing)	Xiaoyi Pan;Qi-xiang Fu;Wei Wang;Dejun Feng;Guoyu Wang	2013	2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723905	early-warning radar;radar lock-on;geography;telecommunications;bistatic radar;pulse-doppler radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;radar jamming and deception;remote sensing	Robotics	78.59314342959499	-67.52775609371031	25827

The test image is firstly pre-processed through a multiresolution analysis employing the discrete wavelet transform. Then, we apply a fast and robust total variation technique, incorporating a statistical representation in the style of maximum likelihood estimation.

The high-resolution interferograms over vegetation or urban areas are heterogeneous, which will violate the local stationarity assumption and make it difficult to obtain a large number of independent and identically distributed samples for interferometric noise suppression. To overcome this problem, a refined nonlocal filter is proposed in this letter. Given coherence, topography phase, and expected SAR intensity of the pixel to be filtered, the similarity distance between the central pixel and other pixels in the searching window is measured by the normalized probability density function of the interferogram. Then, the outliers whose normalized probability density is smaller than the given threshold are removed from the filtering process. Finally, both simulated and real high-resolution interferograms are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	aharonov–bohm effect;aperture (software);image resolution;interlaced video;motorola canopy;nonlocal lagrangian;pixel;stationary process;synthetic data;topography;zero suppression	Jin-wei Li;Zhenfang Li;Zheng Bao;Ying-long Hou;Zhiyong Suo	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2326462	speckle noise;hydrology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	Vision	73.9403221572406	-65.8513798489816	25931

It was developed according to an empirical method for modelling macroscopic phenomena and was applied to the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines Islands. The model is very simple, but it is able to capture the three-dimensional evolution of the phenomenon in so far as it spreads.

Here we conduct comprehensive studies on the subjective and objective quality assessment of the compressed SCIs. Firstly, we build a database that contains the distorted SCIs generated by the high efficiency video coding standard as well as its extension on screen content compression. Subsequently, subjective experiments are conducted to evaluate the perceived quality of these SCIs with compression artifacts. To automatically predict the subjective quality, a reduced-reference quality assessment model is further learnt by a set of wavelet domain features concerning the generalized spectral behavior, the fluctuations of the energy, and the information content with relatively large scale training samples. Our experimental results show that the learnt model is able to achieve better prediction on the SCI quality with a few extracted meaningful features.	compression artifact;data compression;distortion;end-to-end encryption;experiment;high efficiency video coding;self-information;video coding format;wavelet	Shiqi Wang;Ke Gu;Xiang Zhang;Weisi Lin;Li Zhang;Siwei Ma;Wen Gao	2016	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2016.2598756	image quality;subjective video quality;computer vision;distortion;telecommunications;feature extraction;computer science;data mining;multimedia	AI	63.03385886326291	-64.35841766784574	25982

To reduce the damage and protect people's lives, it is becoming increasingly important to predict the movement or track of a typhoon. Although there are several methods of predicting a typhoon track, the results are not sufficiently accurate to utilize when a typhoon is threatening a country or area. To reduce the prediction error, in this paper a multi-dimensional time series similarity method called Modified A-LTK, Approximation with use of Local features at Thinned-out Keypoints, is applied to the prediction. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the error between the original data and the predicted data was reduced using Modified A-LTK compared with other existing methods such as DTW and AMSS.	amplitude modulation signalling system;approximation;cyclone;time series;typhoon	Yu Fang;Kosuke Sugano;Kenta Oku;Kyoji Kawagoe	2015	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on e-Science	10.1109/eScience.2015.36	meteorology;geography;hydrology;climatology	Visualization	83.23685313836603	-57.978304127761895	25983

This PI separates the radiance effects of the canopy-soil moisture and interference from surface roughness and atmosphere, and are suitable to detect change of terrain surface moisture, especially for extreme drought or floods conditions. As example, the statistics of the monthly average > < PI from 6 years data of the DMSP SSM/I observations at lowest 19.35 GHz channel as available are applied to demonstration of the terrain surface status over large and heterogeneous territory such as China. The deviation of the PI data at the same month from the > < PI , i.e. PI n ∆ ) / ) ( ( > < > < − ≡ PI PI PI , gives prominence to focusing moisture variation of terrain surface and its anomaly shows possible drought or floods occurrence in extreme conditions. The PI n ∆ mapping is validated by the examples of the drought in China’s Shanxi area in May 2001 and the flood around China’s Yangtze River in August 1998, respectively. Our approach is recommended to lower frequency channels to minimize the influence from vegetation canopy for future application (such as the channels of the AMSR-E launched in May 2002 and microwave imaging radiometer of China’s Fengyun satellite series). When the monthly > < PI and the ground truth of average volumetric moisture > < v m of the region are correctly evaluated, it is tractable to retrieve the soil land surface moisture by using the PI data at the same month and the same region without much knowledge of surface roughness, vegetation canopy and others. As an example, the retrieval of v m is favorably tested by using the TRMM TMI data.	anomaly detection;cobham's thesis;ground truth;interference (communication);microwave;motorola canopy;polarization (waves)	Ya-Qiu Jin;Fenghua Yan	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

Previous blind separation approaches for such problems assume motions to be uniform translations, and hence are limited for real world applications. In this paper, we develop a sparse blind separation algorithm to estimate both parameterized motions and mixing coefficients. Then, a novel reconstruction approach is presented to recover all layers, by utilizing not only the mixing model but also the statistical properties of natural images. The whole method can handle more general motions than translations, including scalings, rotations and other transformations. In addition, the number of layers is automatically identified, and all layers can be recovered even in the under-determined case where mixtures are fewer than layers. The effectiveness of this technology is shown in the experiments on two simulated mixtures of four layers, real photos containing transparency and reflections, and real crossfade images from videos.	algorithm;blind signal separation;coefficient;degeneracy (graph theory);experiment;reflection (computer graphics);simulation;sparse matrix	Kun Gai;Zhenwei Shi;Changshui Zhang	2009	2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPRW.2009.5206825	iterative reconstruction;mixed model;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;motion estimation;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics	Vision	54.35693378595863	-54.25595545232781	25997

Considering the fact that the observations in mid-IR at satellite altitude during daytime consist of a combination of both reflected radiance due to sun irradiance and emitted radiance from both the surface and the atmosphere, a brief description of estimating the land surface bi-directional reflectivity in mid-IR channels from MODIS data was given. Sensitivity analysis of the vegetation index with regard to the variations of horizontal visibility was performed. The results showed that the proposed vegetation index is much less sensitive to haze in the atmosphere than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In addition, in order to compare the traditional NDVI with the new VI, NDVI and VI were calculated using MODIS data acquired over a region of Western Europe (Spain), for cloud-free days, covering a period of one month, July, 2006. The result of this comparison indicated that the proposed new vegetation index is feasible to descript the properties of vegetation and to determine the classification of vegetation, especially in the areas covered by dense smoke or industrial pollution.

With the considerable merits of spatial diversity, bistatic systems supplement the retrieval of ocean physical parameters with conventional monostatic systems. For instance, an emerging bistatic radar technique, global navigation satellite signal reflectometry (GNSS-R), has been developed and utilized in retrieval of high wind speed. Moreover, bistatic phenomena such as the Brewster effect can reveal target properties that are not revealed clearly in monostatic scattering [1]. Therefore, for better application of ocean microwave remote sensing, understanding of bistatic scattering from the ocean surface is crucial and meaningful.	brewster's angle;microwave;reflectometry;satellite navigation	Xiaofeng Yang;Yanlei Du;Ziwei Li;Kunshan Chen	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127253	breaking wave;remote sensing;bistatic radar;wind speed;computer science;antenna diversity;reflectometry;scattering;microwave	Embedded	81.90719792785075	-67.02701845570925	26158

We study the distribution of the horizontal distance that a corrosion path will travel in the metal and fit the model to an actual corrosion dataset using the method of moments. The distribution of the horizontal distance of a corrosion path along a given grain is assumed to be uniformly distributed given the length of the grain, which is itself modeled by a gamma distribution. A modified brick wall model is proposed that also imposes a distribution on the vertical distance traveled by the corrosion path. Computer simulation is used to evaluate the fit of these models.	cyclic corrosion testing;kinetics internet protocol;norm (social);shortest path problem;software propagation;statistical model	Shiling Ruan;Douglas A.

Effective volume rate of pesticide application on a site-specific basis can reduce the amount of agrochemicals used in precision horticulture. The prototype sprayer used in this study provided volume application rate adapted to the canopy volume in pistachio orchards on a real-time and continuous basis. An electronic control system for the detection and estimation of tree canopy dimensions was designed for application rate adjustment. Three ultrasonic ranging USS3 sensors were utilized to estimate the distance to the target at three different heights. A MLP neural network with gradient-descent back-propagation algorithm, tangent-sigmoid transfer function, and 3-7-6 topology was used for volume estimation of tree sections. Training and validation errors as well as R2 values indicated the reliability of the network for volume prediction. Results of T-test for comparing the number of spray droplet impacts, coverage of (artificial) target, spray quality parameter and relative span factor between variable-rate and conventional spraying were not significant which indicates the consistency of spray distribution in selective application. Experiments showed a reduction in pesticide usage of about 34.5% by means of variable-rate technology (41.3, 25.6 and 36.5, respectively for the top, middle, and bottom sections of tree canopy). Precise application of agrochemicals reduces both costs and environmental pollution by supporting a decrease in the amount of delivered spray.	motorola canopy	Hossein Maghsoudi;Saeid Minaei;Barat Ghobadian;Hassan Masoudi	2015	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2014.12.015	simulation;environmental engineering;computer science;engineering;machine learning;ultrasonic sensor;artificial neural network	HCI	85.05662538954422	-52.19798241326596	26519

Major land policies have recently resulted in remarkable landscape modifications throughout the basin. The availability of precise regional land cover change information is crucial to better understand the prevailing dynamics and underlying factors influencing the current processes in such a complex system and can additionally serve as a valuable component for modeling and decision making. Such comprehensive and detailed information is lacking for the Yellow River Basin so far. In this study, we derived land cover characteristics and dynamics from the complete last decade based on optical high-temporal MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for the whole Yellow River Basin. After filtering and smoothing for noise reduction with the use of the adaptive Savitzky–Golay filter, the processed time series was used to derive a large variety of phenological and annual metrics. The final classifications for the basin (2003 and 2013) were based on a random forest classifier, trained by reference samples from very high-resolution imagery. The accuracy assessment for all 18 thematic classes, which was based on a 30% reference data split, yielded an overall accuracy of 87% and 84% for 2003 and 2013, respectively. Major land cover and land use changes during the last decade have occurred on the Loess Plateau, where land and conservation reforms triggered large-scale recovery of grassland and shrubland habitat that had been previously covered by agriculture or sparse vegetation. Agricultural encroachment and urban area expansion are other processes influencing the dynamics in the basin. The necessity for regionally-adapted land cover maps becomes obvious when our land cover products are compared to existing global products, where thematic accuracy remains low, particularly in a heterogeneous landscape, such as the Yellow River Basin. The basin-wide novel land cover and land use products of the Yellow River Basin hold a large potential for climate, hydrology and biodiversity modelers, as well as river basin and regional governmental authorities and will be shared upon request.	climate model;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;complex system;entity;fastest;habitat;image resolution;map;noise reduction;population;random forest;smoothing;sparse matrix;spatial scale;time series	Christian Wohlfart;Gaohuan Liu;Chong Huang;Claudia Kuenzer	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8030186	phenology;random forest;hydrology;machine learning;time series;ecology;remote sensing	ML	82.42940030801506	-56.76121423827866	26557

Finer details in images captured using such low-end equipment are lost due to blurring and under-sampling. Compounding this problem is missing data due to the presence of an intervening occlusion between the scene and the camera such as a fence. To recover a fence-free high-resolution image, we use videos of the scene captured by panning a hand-held camera and model the effects of various degradations. Initially, we obtain the spatial locations of the fence/occlusions and the global shifts of the degraded background image. The underlying high-resolution fence-free image is modeled as a discontinuity-adaptive Markov random field and its maximum a-posteriori estimate is obtained using an optimization approach. The advantage of using this prior is that high-frequency information is preserved during the reconstruction of the super-resolved image. Specifically, we use the fast graduated non-convexity algorithm to minimize a non-convex energy function. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;box blur;experiment;image resolution;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization;missing data;mobile device;reflections of signals on conducting lines;sampling (signal processing);smartphone;super-resolution imaging;synthetic intelligence	Chetan S.

Additional scattering from rain causes estimated wind speeds to appear higher than expected. Selected directions of the rain-corrupted wind vectors are biased toward along-track directions under conditions of heavy rain, which is regardless of the true wind direction. Rain becomes more significant for data acquired at a high incidence angle. To compensate for rain-induced backscatter, a simultaneous wind/rain retrieval (SWRR) method, which simultaneously retrieves wind velocity and surface rain rate from ESCAT measurements with an incidence angle >40deg, is developed by using a C-band wind/rain backscatter model. The performance of SWRR under typical wind/rain conditions is evaluated through simulation and validation with collocated TRMM PR and ECMWF data sets. SWRR is shown to significantly improve wind velocity estimates, and the SWRR estimated surface rain rate has relatively high accuracy in moderate to heavy rain cases. Although SWRR-retrieved rain is somewhat biased, it can be corrected. We note that for ESCAT, about 1.5% of all the collocated measurements is affected by significant rain.	backscatter (email);incidence matrix;simulation;velocity (software development)	Congling Nie;David G.

Its main feature is its ability to account for a lack of knowledge of the so called Point Spread Function (PSF) of the imager. This ability is based on representing the ill-known PSF by mean of a maxitive kernel, i.e. an imprecise PSF. It also uses the nice properties of a fuzzy partition of the image plane for defining projection and back-projection operators whose particularity is to output interval-valued images instead of precise valued ones. Those operators transfer the imprecise knowledge on the PSF to the output imprecision. We propose some experiments illustrating the robustness of our approach with respect to the registration errors and its performance compared to very competitive earlier approaches.	experiment;image plane;image sensor;iterative method;super-resolution imaging;utility functions on indivisible goods	Fares Graba;Frédéric Comby;Olivier Strauss	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025788	mathematical optimization;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	Vision	59.260574251964286	-71.85022111284665	26762

Because of the implicit assumption of spherical symmetry for the electron density distribution in the ionosphere, the standard Onion-peeling algorithm could give erroneous concentration values in the retrieved electron density profile. In particular, this happens when strong horizontal ionospheric electron density gradients are present, like for example in the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region during high solar activity periods. In this work, using simulated RO TEC data computed by means of the NeQuick2 and IRI2012 ionospheric electron density models and ideal RO geometries, we tried to formulate and evaluate an asymmetry level indicator for quasi-horizontal radio occultation observations. This asymmetry index is based on the electron density variation that a ray may experience along its propagation path (satellite to satellite link) in a RO event. This index is dependent on the occultation geometry and on the azimuth of the occultation plane. Our qualitative assessment shows a good correlation between our asymmetry index and Onion-peeling retrieval errors; i.e. errors produced by Onion-peeling in the retrieval of NmF2 and VTEC are larger at the geographical locations where our asymmetry index indicates high asymmetry in the ionosphere.	algorithm;anomaly detection;electron;gradient;radio occultation;satellite navigation;software propagation	M.

623c623252a3a87cb31b703feb61980423d06f79	iris image quality assessment based on saliency detection		There are few restrictions in the image capture of mobile iris recognition, so the iris texture is easily interfered and the images may fail to meet the requirements of the identification. If the quality of captured iris images can be pre-evaluated, the unrecognizable iris images could be removed, which can reduce the operational burden and be more efficient. Therefore, an approach for iris image quality assessment based on saliency detection is proposed in this paper. First, Frequency-tuned (FT) method is used to detect image salient regions, then the binary image is obtained by segmenting saliency maps with threshold, and finally the image quality is evaluated according to the shape characteristics of the connected regions in binary images. As the results shown, the proposed method is capable of evaluating the image quality under the ideal and disturbing conditions, and removing the unrecognizable iris images because of the interference.	image quality	Xiaonan Liu;Yuwen Luo;Silu Yin;Shan Gao	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46654-5_38	computer vision	Vision	57.62283777951989	-61.790974694630826	26792

The decomposition procedure considered here is a determined nonlinear equation system that can be solved numerically. The accurate topographical phase is first estimated and then used as the initial input parameter to our numerical method. This approach avoids large errors generated by the constant topographical phase in fluctuating forested areas. Additionally, the modified volume scattering model introduced by Yamaguchi et al. is applied to the polarimetric SAR interferometric target decomposition data of forested areas, rather than the purely random volume scattering of Freeman and Durden, to produce the best fit to the measured data. This method retrieves the magnitude associated with each mechanism and their heights. The quality of the decomposition is demonstrated using L-band simulated data created with PolSARproSim software and L-band airborne data (BioSAR 2008) acquired by the DLR E-SAR in the Vindeln Municipality in northern Sweden.	airborne ranger;curve fitting;dynamic language runtime;l band;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical method;parameter (computer programming);polarimetry;synthetic data;system of polynomial equations;topography;tree (data structure)	Shenglong Guo;Yang Li;Jingjing Zhang;Qiang Yin;Wen Hong	2015	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2015.2409311	synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	Vision	86.19533999970777	-62.36944980714594	26888

The comparison of long-term datasets is based on two recently available datasets both derived from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) time series. The LAI3g dataset is developed from the new improved third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI3g) from AVHRR sensors and best-quality MODIS LAI data. The second long-term LAI dataset is based on the 8-km spatial resolution GIMMS-AVHRR data (Goettingen GIS & Remote Sensing, GGRS dataset). The GGRS-LAI product uses a satellite-based LAI. This algorithm uses a three-dimensional physical radiative transfer model, which establishes the relationship between LAI, vegetation fractional cover and given patterns of surface reflectance, viewillumination conditions and optical properties of vegetation. The model incorporates a number of site-/region-specific parameters, including the vegetation architecture variables, such as leaf angle distribution, clumping index and light extinction coefficient. For the application of the model to Kazakhstan, the vegetation architecture variables were computed at the local (pixel) level based on extensive field surveys of the biophysical properties of vegetation in representative grassland areas of Kazakhstan. As a main result of our study, OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 3761 we could summarize that the differences between both products are most pronounced at the start and the end of the growing season. During the spring and autumn months, the LAI difference maps showed a considerable difference of LAI GGRS and LAI3g. LAI3g is characterized by a considerably earlier start and a later finish to the growing season than LAI GGRS. Moreover, LAI3g showed LAI > 0 during the winter months when any green vegetation is absent in all land covers of Kazakhstan. A direct cause for this could be a too high base level of the LAI3g during the leafless phase.	algorithm;bus bunching;coefficient;earth system science;geographic information system;ibm 2780/3780;map;pixel;requirement;semiconductor industry;sensor;spatial variability;the forest;time series	Martin Kappas;Pavel Propastin;Jan Degener;Renchin Tsolmon	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70403760	meteorology;enhanced vegetation index;remote sensing	ML	84.43653850027731	-59.03103322707218	26903

Moreover, in general, the solution is enhanced via introduction of the quantum state machine in and of itself, which provides random fuzzy membership input to the Fuzzy C-Means soft partitioning algorithm, while the addition of quantum operators provide additional contributions to solution diversity. Typically, when evaluated for cluster validity, the algorithm has shown to produce effective solutions.	algorithm;cluster analysis;image segmentation;quantum state	Chih-Cheng Hung;Ellis Casper;Bor-Chen Kuo;Wenping Liu;Xiaoyi Yu;Edward Jung;Ming Yang	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723329	stochastic process;computer vision;contextual image classification;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy classification;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;segmentation-based object categorization;mathematics;fuzzy set;image segmentation;finite-state machine;scale-space segmentation;quantum computer;remote sensing	Vision	71.36459706250136	-61.72211157833352	27013

To date, such displays have conventionally employed heuristically-determined parallax barriers, containing a fixed array of slits or pinholes, to provide view-dependent imagery. While recent methods adapt barriers to one or more viewers, we show that both layers can be adapted to the multi-view content as well. The resulting content-adaptive parallax barriers increase display brightness and frame rate. We prove that any 4D light field created by dual-stacked LCDs is the tensor product of two 2D mask functions. Thus, a pair of 1D masks only achieves a rank-1 approximation of a 2D light field. We demonstrate higher-rank approximations using temporal multiplexing.	approximation;heuristic;light field;multiplexing;multiscopy;parallax barrier;stacking;stereo display	Douglas Lanman;Matthew Hirsch;Yunhee Kim;Ramesh Raskar	2010		10.1145/1837026.1837097	tensor product;computer vision;real-time computing;stereo display;computer science;light field;multimedia;social network;computer graphics (images)	HCI	59.57167987817216	-54.30657713000177	27017
53699ce4ab56fcf1c9a3f5a38ff025e625efc3ac	photographic color reproduction based on color variation characteristics of digital camera	color image enhancement;computational photography;photographic color reproduction	In this paper, a new technique for color reproduction based on color variation characteristics of digital camera under a dim light condition is proposed. Generally, photographers should adjust a camera exposure properly for obtaining an image with real color tone of subjects. Thus, in case of taking a picture under a dim light condition, the exposure time of a camera has to be relatively longer than the one under a bright light condition. Although images with real color tone of the subject are obtained, the images may get blurred due to the shaky hands of photographer holding the camera. In order to avoid the blur effect, an input image is captured from a camera set as a short exposure time under a dim light condition. Then we propose a method to reproduce color tone of the dim input image. To this end, color variation characteristics which represent color variations of a digital camera are first extracted by analyzing the Macbeth color checker images taken under various exposure values. Then, a color reproduction is performed by an estimation based on the color variation characteristics. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method has achieved better performance of color reproduction, compared with existing methods.	algorithm;built-in self-test;color depth;digital camera;extended validation certificate;gaussian blur;movie projector;online and offline;pixel;real-time clock	Ui Seong Kim;Jong Min Lee;Yong Min Kim;Ki Tae Park;Young Shik Moon	2011	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2011.11.016	color histogram;false color;rgb color model;computer vision;computational photography;color model;color quantization;lightness;color normalization;color depth;color image;computer science;color balance;color space;computer graphics (images)	Vision	60.055064625322856	-60.60444314657737	27029

In this paper, we consider the X-SAR antenna beam alignment in azimuth. For a single-pass cross-track SAR interferometer, we establish the relation between yaw and pitch misalignment of the antenna beams and the resulting relative shift of the Doppler frequency bands. This relation is used to provide solutions for the mechanical adjustments of the outboard antenna and electronic beam steering to correct for azimuth misalignment. Furthermore, the effects of the X-SAR effective outboard antenna pattern on the azimuth beam alignment are analyzed. As a result, a so-called “relaxing” factor is derived, which increases the limit for the difference in antenna azimuth angle with respect to the requirement on spectral overlap, and hence spatial interferogram resolution. However, we also show that the alignment requirement is driven by the constraint on decreasing the azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio (AASR) for the effective outboard antenna pattern to reduce the resulting additional height error. The strategy for misalignment determination and correction is presented, and results of the analysis of the in-flight X-SAR antenna beam alignment are discussed.	frequency band;radiation pattern;shuttle radar topography mission;synthetic data;yaws	Dirk Geudtner;Manfred Zink;Christoph H.

Eulerian video processing allows to show small color changes and motions invisibles to the naked eye. Eulerian motion magnification, was modify using the phase and the Riesz pyramid in order to reduce the noise amplification. In this work we introduced a novel phase magnification approach based on a infinitely differentiable unique compact supported window, an atomic function. Another contribution of our work was apply our quaternion phase and Eulerian magnification to 3D motion, which has not been reported so far, we propose to use simple projections of conformal algebra in order to do the magnification at any plane of the 3D space. We compare the phase (Riesz Pyramids), with the atomic Riesz pyramid, in our comparation our atomic pyramid Riesz preserves more information than the phase Riesz approximation, besides our approach is slower by 2.5 times. Finally, we compare method and the linear magnification (Laplace Pyramid) in terms of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We found that the phase magnifications has better response to noise than the linear method.	approximation;computation;image analysis;image noise;image processing;signal-to-noise ratio;video processing	Eduardo Ulises Moya-Sánchez;Marcela Bonell;Gustavo Torres;Eduardo Vázquez-Santacruz	2016	Research in Computing Science		classical mechanics;computer vision	Vision	63.840155312048005	-54.652390224664316	27224
6101c56fde00b42f2e2c660aa4ad39b8952f6ff5	analysis of landsat-8 oli imagery for estimating exposed bedrock fractions in typical karst regions of southwest china using a karst bare-rock index		Karst rocky desertification (KRD) has become the primary ecoenvironmental problem in the karst regions of southwest China. The rapid and efficient acquisition of exposed bedrock fractions (EBF) is crucial for the monitoring and assessment of KRD degree and distribution within the highly heterogeneous landscapes. Remote-sensing indices provide a useful method for the quick mapping of the EBF at large scales. The currently available rock indices, however, are faced with insensitivity to bedrock change characteristics, which greatly limits their performances and suitability. To address this problem, we proposed a novel karst bare-rock index (KBRI) that applies shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) bands from Landsat-8 OLI imagery to maximally distinguish between exposed bedrock and other land cover types in southwest China. A linear regression model was thus established between KBRI and the EBF derived from in situ measurements. The model developed here was then validated with an independent experiment and applied over a large geographic area to produce regional maps of EBF in southwest China. Experimental results showed good performance on root mean square error (5.59%), mean absolute error (4.63%), root mean absolute percentage error (13.59%), and coefficient of determination (0.72), respectively. The advantages of the proposed method are reflected in its simplicity and minimal requirements for auxiliary data while still achieving comparatively better accuracy than existing related indices. Thus, the KBRI has the great potential for the application in other regions around the world with the similar geological backgrounds, thereby helping to address the similar or other related environmental issues. Results of this study provide baseline data for the KRD assessment and karst-ecosystem management in southwest China.

First, the noise variance is stabilized by applying the Anscombe root transformation to the data, producing a signal in which the noise can be treated as additive Gaussian with unitary variance. Second, the noise is removed using a conventional denoising algorithm for additive white Gaussian noise. Third, an inverse transformation is applied to the denoised signal, obtaining the estimate of the signal of interest. The choice of the proper inverse transformation is crucial in order to minimize the bias error which arises when the nonlinear forward transformation is applied. We introduce optimal inverses for the Anscombe transformation, in particular the exact unbiased inverse, a maximum likelihood (ML) inverse, and a more sophisticated minimum mean square error (MMSE) inverse. We then present an experimental analysis using a few state-of-the-art denoising algorithms and show that the estimation can be consistently improved by applying the exact unbiased inverse, particularly at the low-count regime. This results in a very efficient filtering solution that is competitive with some of the best existing methods for Poisson image denoising.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;mean squared error;noise reduction;noise-induced hearing loss;nonlinear system;normal statistical distribution;phenylephrine hydrochloride 10 mg oral tablet;sample variance;shot noise;utility functions on indivisible goods	Markku Mäkitalo;Alessandro Foi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2010.2056693	additive white gaussian noise;computer vision;econometrics;mathematical optimization;variance-stabilizing transformation;computer science;noise reduction;mathematics;data transformation;anscombe transform;statistics	ML	53.81822048793757	-76.12063503496412	27347

However, when one moves to larger datasets the use of parallelism becomes a necessity, and in that context, exploiting occlusion to speed up volume rendering is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose and detail a new scheme in which the processors exchange occlusion information so as to speed up the rendering by discarding invisible areas. Our pipeline uses full floating point accuracy for all the intermediate stages, allowing the production of high quality pictures. We further show comprehensive performance results using this pipeline with multiple datasets and demonstrate that cross-processor occlusion can improve the performance of parallel volume rendering.	algorithm;central processing unit;display resolution;graphics pipeline;hidden surface determination;image;information exchange;interconnection;level of detail;load balancing (computing);parallel computing;scalability;volume rendering	Stéphane Marchesin;Kwan-Liu Ma	2010		10.2312/EGPGV/EGPGV10/011-018	computer vision;tiled rendering;rendering;computer science;parallel rendering;real-time rendering;texture memory;alternate frame rendering;volume rendering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	68.52459063535838	-52.379829489483065	27372

These defects have negative impacts on practical applications. In order to enhance the depth maps, this paper proposes a new inpainting algorithm that extends the original fast marching method (FMM) to reconstruct unknown regions. The extended FMM incorporates an aligned color image as the guidance for inpainting. An edge-preserving guided filter is further applied for noise reduction. To validate our algorithm and compare it with other existing methods, we perform experiments on both the Kinect data and the Middlebury dataset which, respectively, provide qualitative and quantitative results. The results show that our method is efficient and superior to others.	algorithm;color image;experiment;fast marching method;fast multipole method;inpainting;kalman filter;kinect;map;noise reduction	Junyi Liu;Xiaojin Gong;Jilin Liu	2012	Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012)		iterative reconstruction;image restoration;computer vision;color image;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	57.171352840590124	-58.05085077983369	27544
89d94cd3540e123ab101fd3ff2f904ba4548d7df	irsel - an approach to enhance continuity and accuracy of remotely sensed land cover data	landsat;land use change;space time interpolation;remote sensing;crop rotations	Land cover data gives the opportunity to study interactions between land cover status and environmental issues such as hydrologic processes, soil properties, or biodiversity. Land cover data often are based on classification of remote sensing data that seldom provides the requisite accuracy, spatial availability and temporal observational frequency for environmental studies. Thus, there is a high demand for accurate and spatio-temporal complete time series of land cover. In the past considerable research was undertaken to increase land cover classification accuracy, while less effort was spent on interpolation techniques. The purpose of this article is to present a space–time interpolation and revision approach for remotely sensed land cover data. The approach leverages special properties known for agricultural areas such as crop rotations or temporally static land cover classes. The newly developed IRSeL-tool (Interpolation and improvement of Remotely Sensed Land cover) corrects classification errors and interpolates missing land cover pixels. The easy-to-use tool solely requires an initial land cover data set. The IRSeL specific interpolation and revision technique, the data input requirements and data output structure are described in detail. A case study in an area around the city of Neumunster in Northern Germany from 2006 to 2012 was performed for IRSeL validation with initial land cover data sets (Landsat TM image classifications) for the years 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The results of the case study showed that IRSeL performs well; including years with no classification data overall accuracy values for IRSeL interpolated pixels range from 0.63 to 0.81. IRSeL application significantly increases the accuracy of the land cover data; overall accuracy values rise 0.08 in average resulting in overall accuracy values of at least 0.86. Considering estimated reliabilities, the IRSeL tool provides a temporally and spatially completed and revised land cover data set that allows drawing conclusions for land cover related studies.	scott continuity	H.

However, its rendering velocity is very slow because of huge amounts of rays and repeated resample of the data. An improved fast algorithm of ray casting volume rendering is presented which can figure out composition segment fleetly and reduce interpolation calculation by intersection point computation of the ray and a family of planes. The re-sampling speed is improved by taking advantage of segment composition method. And the efficiency of ray casting is increased greatly by utilizing boundary box technique which avoids intersection point computation with useless planes. The experiment results show that the improved acceleration algorithm can produce the required quality images, at the same time reduce the total operations remarkably, and speed up the volume rendering.	algorithm;birefringence;ray casting;volume rendering	Ling Tao;Zhi-Yu Qian	2011		10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098239	medical imaging;three-dimensional space;algorithm design;computer vision;radiology;computer science;ray casting;optical imaging;mathematical model;image segmentation;volume rendering;data visualization;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	69.00288205400525	-53.68143568203589	27565

That is why high density QR codes are commonly encountered in daily life. Unfortunately, high density versions of QR codes are not very well readable by most smartphone QR code readers. The main reading problems are QR code tilt correction, binarization and module recognition. Quite often the applications cannot determine the QR code version due to tilt correction problems. Binarization algorithms use global threshold methods, that are sensitive to print-and-scan distortion and luminosity. Here we propose to use the centrality bias of each module to improve the recognition of black and white modules in high density QR codes. The proposed method increases the recognition rate of high density QR codes, as confirmed by the experimental results.	algorithm;binary image;centrality;distortion;image histogram;otsu's method;pixel;qr code;smartphone;thresholding (image processing)	Iuliia Tkachenko;William Puech;Olivier Strauss;Jean-Marc Gaudin;Christophe Destruel;Christian Guichard	2014	2014 4th International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)	10.1109/IPTA.2014.7001950	arithmetic;image restoration;luminosity;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;mathematics	Robotics	55.158541686306066	-60.69564823050945	27604

Many methods for radial distortion estimation have been proposed, but they all have limitations. Robust automatic radial distortion estimation from a single natural image would be extremely useful for some applications. We propose a new method for radial distortion estimation based on the plumb-line approach. The method works from a single image and does not require a special calibration pattern. It is based on Fitzgibbon’s division model, robust estimation of circular arcs, and robust estimation of distortion parameters. In a series of experiments on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the method’s ability to accurately identify distortion parameters and remove radial distortion from images.	algorithm;autostereogram;canny edge detector;computer vision;distortion;experiment;monte carlo method;pinhole camera model;radial (radio);sampling (signal processing);synthetic intelligence	Faisal Bukhari;Matthew N.

One third of the plateau area is grassland, which covers transition from the southeast monsoon region to the arid, semi-arid region of Northwest China. With visual interpretation and automatic classification method, the grassland distribution of two years based on analysis of 1987 and 2000 TM images was obtained. In order to improve the ecological environment of China's western region, significant areas of the dry land must be reforested and regrassed. GIS has been identified as a useful tool to find the areas where dessicated land on the Loess Plateau region can be reforested or regressed. The result of overlay analysis and area statistical analysis by GIS has shown how the grassland has been transformed on the Loess Plateau over the past 20 years. The existing grassland resources on the Loess Plateau region covered with the vast grassland have already lost their primary feature, the soil erosion area now occupying 54.3% of the total plateau area. The southeast of the plateau has been torn to pieces, and severe soil erosion has occurred on the central plateau. Even more significantly, the northwestern region is experiencing a significant devastation by windy activity and desertification. In order to protect and rehabilitate the ecological environment of the Loess Plateau, seven recommendations are made.

Fusion has been posed as an estimation problem where the observed hyperspectral bands have been related to the fused image through a first order model of image formation. The parameters of the model indicate the quality of the pixel captured locally. As visualization is our primary aim of fusion, we expect higher contribution of the ''visually important'' pixels towards the final fused image. We propose a two-step framework for fusion of hyperspectral image, where the first step identifies the quality of each pixel of the data based on some of the local quality measures of the hyperspectral data. Subsequently, we formulate the problem of the estimation of the fused image in a MAP framework. We incorporate the total variation (TV) norm-based prior which preserves the sharp discontinuities in the fused image. The fused images, thus, appear sharp and natural where the edges and boundaries have been retained. We have provided visual as well as quantitative results to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.	image fusion	Ketan Kotwal;Subhasis Chaudhuri	2013	Information Fusion	10.1016/j.inffus.2013.02.007	computer vision;pattern recognition;total variation	Vision	67.33402663762176	-66.49439371622283	27733

Thus, the objective is to quantify in the context of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) the synergistic benefit of simultaneous observation of the Earth’s surface with atmospheric attributes. The analysis is illustrative of the type of examination that should inform remote sensing policy and system configuration decisions.

This paper presents an improved anisotropic diffusion method using region adaptive smoothing strength. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method uses an adaptive classifier to find a good estimate of the optimal smoothing strength for each iteration to consider the varying noise characteristics. Further, when training the classifiers, the usefulness of the training data is verified and less useful data are excluded to avoid degraded training results, thereby generating robust and improved denoising performance. For reduction of the computational complexity, this paper also proposes a simple region analysis technique. Consequently, the proposed method is appropriate for the devices that have relatively small computing power. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms AD-based benchmark methods by increased peak signal-to-noise ratio up to 2.37dB and structural similarity up to 0.0557 for 10% noise level.	anisotropic diffusion;smoothing	Sanghun Kim;Suk-Ju Kang;Young Hwan Kim	2016	J.

The MODIS standard products will provide new and improved tools for moderate resolution land surface monitoring. These higher order data products have been designed to remove the burden of certain common types of data processing from the user community and meet the more general needs of global-to-regional monitoring, modeling, and assessment. The near-daily coverage of moderate resolution data from MODIS, coupled with the planned increase in high-resolution sampling from Landsat 7, will provide a powerful combination of observations. The full potential of MODIS will be realized once a stable and well-calibrated time-series of multispectral data has been established. In this paper the proposed MODIS standard products for land applications are described along with the current plans for data quality assessment and product validation.	data quality;global change;image resolution;multispectral image;sampling (signal processing);terrestrial television;time series;virtual community	Christopher Justice;Eric F.

7994aeceb86a88cf63d88654e6962fdc3c27061c	the generalized difference vegetation index (gdvi) for dryland characterization	land characterization;dryland environment;vegetation indices;sensitivity;dynamic range;lai;gdvi	A large number of vegetation indices have been developed and widely applied in terrestrial ecosystem research in the recent decades. However, a certain limitation was observed while applying these indices in research in dry areas due to their low sensitivity to low vegetation cover. In this context, the objectives of this study are to develop a new vegetation index, namely, the Generalized Difference Vegetation Index (GDVI), and to examine its applicability to the assessment of dryland environment. Based on the field investigation and crop Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurement, five spring and summer Landsat TM and ETM+ images in the frame with Path/Row number of 174/35, and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LAI and vegetation indices (VIs) data (MOD15A2 and MOD13Q1), of the same acquisition dates as the Landsat images, were acquired and employed in this study. The results reveal that, despite the same level of correlation with the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as other VIs, GDVI shows a better correlation with LAI and has higher sensitivity and dynamic range in the low vegetal land cover than other vegetation indices, e.g., the range of GDVI is higher than Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), and Soil-Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI), by 164%–326% in woodland, 185%–720% in olive plantation, and 190%–867% in rangeland. It is, hence, concluded that GDVI is relevant for, and has great potential in, land characterization, as well as land degradation/desertification assessment in dryland environment.

a5a2be90d12663567512ee2b61831a8e66e8b66c	daily retrieval of ndvi and lai at 3 m resolution via the fusion of cubesat, landsat, and modis data		Constellations of CubeSats are emerging as a novel observational resource with the potential to overcome the spatiotemporal constraints of conventional single-sensor satellite missions. With a constellation of more than 170 active CubeSats, Planet has realized daily global imaging in the RGB and near-infrared (NIR) at ~3 m resolution. While superior in terms of spatiotemporal resolution, the radiometric quality is not equivalent to that of larger conventional satellites. Variations in orbital configuration and sensor-specific spectral response functions represent an additional limitation. Here, we exploit a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) to optimize the utility and quality of very high-resolution CubeSat imaging. CESTEM represents a multipurpose data-driven scheme for radiometric normalization, phenology reconstruction, and spatiotemporal enhancement of biophysical properties via synergistic use of CubeSat, Landsat 8, and MODIS observations. Phenological reconstruction, based on original CubeSat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from top of atmosphere or surface reflectances, is shown to be susceptible to large uncertainties. In comparison, a CESTEM-corrected NDVI time series is able to clearly resolve several consecutive multicut alfalfa growing seasons over a six-month period, in addition to providing precise timing of key phenological transitions. CESTEM adopts a random forest machine-learning approach for producing Landsat-consistent leaf area index (LAI) at the CubeSat scale with a relative mean absolute difference on the order of 4–6%. The CubeSat-based LAI estimates highlight the spatial resolution advantage and capability to provide temporally consistent and time-critical insights into within-field vegetation dynamics, the rate of vegetation green-up, and the timing of harvesting events that are otherwise missed by 8to 16-day Landsat imagery.	algorithm;cloud computing;database normalization;ecosystem;image resolution;machine learning;molecular orbital;programming paradigm;random forest;smoothing;synergy;time of arrival;time series;window of opportunity	Rasmus Houborg;Matthew F.

For this, we resort to the rich, spacefrequency diverse, and easy-to-search library of transforms provided by the family of wavelet packet (WP) bases and their adaptive extensions. We use ratedistortion criteria to find the best basis jointly with the statistical model-based best adaptive quantization and entropy coding strategy of [7] based on an efficient and fast tree pruning algorithm. A key underlying attribute of our paradigm is that the spatially-varying Generalized Gaussian mixture model for wavelet coefficients introduced in [7] is also applicable to the more arbitrary framework of (adaptive) wavelet packet transform coefficients as well. Our WP-EQ framework produces excellent results on standard test images. The most attractive property of our paradigm is its “universality” and robustness: based on an overall performance criterion that considers diverse classes of input test images that have varying space-frequency characteristics, it is more powerful than most of the existing image coding algorithms, using reasonable complexity, and a generic, integrated, non-training based framework.	algorithm;coefficient;entropy encoding;mixture model;network packet;packet analyzer;programming paradigm;quantization (signal processing);relational operator;standard test image;statistical model;universality probability;wavelet packet decomposition	Mehmet Kivanç Mihçak;Kannan Ramchandran;Pierre Moulin	1998		10.1109/ICIP.1998.723430	data compression;statistical model;mathematical optimization;complexity;transform coding;rate–distortion theory;quantization;computer science;entropy encoding;theoretical computer science;pattern recognition;mixture model;gaussian process;cascade algorithm;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;software testing;stationary wavelet transform;estimation theory;statistics;robustness;wavelet transform	Vision	60.893454123724226	-69.9723626340918	27952

In binary tomography the goal is to reconstruct the inner structure of homogeneous objects from their projections. This is usually required from a low number of projections, which are also likely to be affected by noise and measurement errors. In general, the distorted and incomplete projection data holds insufficient information for the correct reconstruction of the original object.In this paper, we describe two methods for approximating the local uncertainty of the reconstructions, i.e., identifying how the information stored in the projections determine each part of the reconstructed image. These methods can measure the uncertainty of the reconstruction without any knowledge from the original object itself. Moreover, we provide a global uncertainty measure that can assess the information content of a projection set and predict the error to be expected in the reconstruction of a homogeneous object. We also give an experimental evaluation of our proposed methods, mention some of their possible applications, and describe how the uncertainty measure can be used to improve the performance of the DART reconstruction algorithm.	tomographic reconstruction	László Varga;László G.

The major assumption is that, locally, the PS phase model is decomposed into the separable product of the intrinsic target phase times the optical path, that is common to all the targets in the estimation window. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is exploited to get at one time a fast estimate of the local phase and the detection of stable targets. The estimated phases are then exploited to measure the PS-coherence over the whole image or in image blocks. Being sensible to acquisition and processing artifacts, the PS coherence is a valuable tool for automatic image quality assessment. Results are shown with real datasets in both single and full polarization.	cache coherence;image quality;polarization (waves);quantum phase estimation algorithm;singular value decomposition	Pietro Guccione;Andrea Monti Guarnieri;Stefano Tebaldini	2011	2011 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049314	database index;computer vision;estimation;dispersion;synthetic aperture radar;coherence;sensor;optical imaging;optics;radar imaging;singular value decomposition;adaptive optics;physics;remote sensing	Vision	74.8463808542384	-65.73060160468653	27967

The presence of haze and smoke during the campaign provided a case study to evaluate the effect of atmospheric correction on MISR surface products. Two surface types were considered in the analyses: the bright desert-like surface of the Pan and the dark grassland that surrounds it. The results show that for the dark surface the BRF values retrieved from MISR are in good agreement, within 5%, with those obtained from field data. For the bright desert-like pan surface, better agreement, within ~10%, was found in all channels on the clear day but only in the forward scattering on the hazy day. A comparison of MISR aerosol retrievals to those obtained from three independent ground measurements suggests that, in the presence of a highly reflective surface, small uncertainties in the MISR aerosol retrievals become magnified at larger optical depths, causing errors in the surface BRF retrievals	bidirectional reflectance distribution function;oren–nayar reflectance model;safari (web browser)	Wedad A.

The novelty of the filter lies in its unique three-stage adaptive estimation. The local image structure is first estimated by a series of center-weighted reference filters. Then the distances between the observed central pixel and estimated references are utilized to classify the local inputs into one of preset structure partition cells. Finally, a weighted filtering operation, indexed by the partition cell, is applied to the estimated references in order to restore the central pixel value. The weighted filtering operation is optimized off-line for each partition cell to achieve the best tradeoff between noise suppression and structure preservation. Recursive filtering operation and recursive weight training are also investigated to further boost the restoration performance. The proposed filter has demonstrated satisfactory results in suppressing many distinct types of noise in natural color images. Noticeable performance gains are demonstrated over other prior-art methods in terms of standard objective measurements, the visual image quality and the computational complexity.	algorithm;appendix;bibliographic reference;biologic preservation;cns disorder;ct scan;cell (microprocessor);circuit restoration;computational complexity theory;disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders;distance;distance-vector routing protocol;image noise;image quality;impulse noise (audio);index;lexicographical order;mental suffering;normal statistical distribution;online and offline;particle filter;pixel;recursion (computer science);vii;weight lifting;while;zero suppression	Zhonghua Ma;Hong Ren Wu;David Dagan Feng	2006	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2006.877066	computer vision;least mean squares filter;image processing;computer science;signal processing;control theory;mathematics	Vision	54.838893735605716	-66.33631708103705	28001
198e31bb936533a95efcc472c4c9dcc591bf7d33	graph coloring based surveillance video synopsis	video synopsis;tube rearrangement;graph coloring	Video synopsis is an intelligent condensation approach to solve fast video browsing and retrieval for surveillance cameras. However, collision caused by unsatisfied tube rearrangement in traditional methods brings uncomfortable visual effect to users and how to mitigate the collision still remains an attracting topic. Unlike conventional methods that deal with tube rearrangement by minimizing a global energy function, we propose a novel approach by formulating it as a graph coloring problem. In our approach, all the tubes are firstly mapped into the spatial domain for analyzing their potential collision relationship. The input tube set is then represented by a graph structure, where each node stands for a tube and the edge between two nodes represents the potential collision relationship. To mitigate the collision artifacts, our method finds the mapping of tubes from original video to synopsis video by L(q)-coloring the graph, which separates tubes from their collision points. The parameter q is left tunable to make a compromise between collision artifacts and synopsis length, which can better meet users’ demand of freely adjusting the compactness of synopsis video. The shifted objects are finally composited with the background image to obtain the high-quality video synopsis. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can generate more compact video synopsis with less collision artifacts than the existing methods.	closed-circuit television;compositing;computational complexity theory;graph (discrete mathematics);graph coloring;mathematical optimization;video synopsis;visual effects;williams tube	Yi He;Changxin Gao;Nong Sang;Zhiguo Qu;Jun Han	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.11.011	computer vision;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;graph coloring	Vision	58.93690268512456	-55.207165818914795	28016

There are two challenges to overcome by a demosaicing method: 1) it needs to model and respect the statistics of natural images in order to reconstruct natural looking images and 2) it should be able to perform well in the presence of noise. To facilitate an objective assessment of current methods, we introduce a public ground truth data set of natural images suitable for research in image demosaicing and denoising. We then use this large data set to develop a machine learning approach to demosaicing. Our proposed method addresses both demosaicing challenges by learning a statistical model of images and noise from hundreds of natural images. The resulting model performs simultaneous demosaicing and denoising. We show that the machine learning approach has a number of benefits: 1) the model is trained to directly optimize a user-specified performance measure such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or structural similarity; 2) we can handle novel color filter array layouts by retraining the model on such layouts; and 3) it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, in some setups by 0.7-dB PSNR, faithfully reconstructing edges, textures, and smooth areas. Our results demonstrate that in demosaicing and related imaging applications, discriminatively trained machine learning models have the potential for peak performance at comparatively low engineering effort.	addresses (publication format);color filter array;demosaicing;discriminative model;ground truth;machine learning;noise reduction;partial;peak signal-to-noise ratio;statistical model;structural similarity;benefit	Daniel Khashabi;Sebastian Nowozin;Jeremy Jancsary;Andrew W.

f5db9fe45c53589661e5029e78e06761f00cb9df	cloud remote sensing using midwave ir co2 and n2o slicing channels near 4.5 μm	spectroscopy;sensors;cirrus clouds;remote sensing;infrared	Narrow channels located in the longwave IR CO2 absorption region between approximately 13.2 and 14.5 μm, the well known CO2 slicing channels, have been proven to be quite effective for the estimates of cloud heights and effective cloud amounts as well as atmospheric temperature profiles. The designs of some of the near-future multi-channel earth observing satellite sensors cannot accommodate these longwave IR channels. Based on the analysis of the multi-channel imaging data collected with the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) instrument and on theoretical cloud radiative transfer modeling, we have found that narrow channels located at the midwave IR region between approximately 4.2 and 4.55 μm, where the combined CO2 and N2O absorption effects decrease rapidly with increasing wavelength, have similar properties as the longwave IR CO2 slicing channels. The scattering of solar radiation by clouds on the long wavelength side of the 4.3 μm CO2 absorption makes only a small contribution to the upwelling radiances. In order to retain the crucial cloud and temperature sensing capabilities, future satellite sensors should consider including midwave IR CO2 and N2O slicing channels if the longwave IR channels cannot be implemented on the sensors. The hyperspectral data covering the 3.715.5 m wavelength range and measured with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) can be used to further assess the utility of midwave IR channels for satellite remote sensing.

By using the Carrier un-Suppressed Amplitude Modulator (CuSAM), the new system can get measurements of two frequency points in one probe. Hence higher resolution can be achieved with the same number of transmitted sinusoids. By exploiting the sparsity of tumors, the sparse recovery algorithm is introduced to reconstruct the image. Simulations with a 2-D model are conducted, and the results demonstrate the performances of the new method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;compressed sensing;computer simulation;image resolution;imaging technology;microwave;modulation;performance;rf modulator;sparse matrix;systems design;tomography	Xiangtuan Wang;Yimin Liu	2016	2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493366	acoustics	Arch	73.31897598667548	-71.79098573792989	28110

Image-coders, such as JPEG-2000,traditionally aspire to allocate the available bits to maximize the perceptual resemblance of the compressedimage when compared to a reference unc ompressed natural image. Specically, this can be accomplished byallocating the available bits to minimize the overall distortion, as computed by a given quality estimator. Thispaper applies ve image quality and utility estimator s, SSIM, VIF, MSE, NICE and GMSE, within a JPEG-2000encoder for rate-distortion optimization to obtain new insights on how to improve JPEG-2000 image coding forquality and utility applications, as well as to improve the understanding about the quality and utility estimatorsused in this work.This work develops a rate-allocation algorithm for arbitrary quality and utility estimators within the Post-Compression Rate-Distortion Optimization (PCRD-opt) framework in JPEG-2000 image coding. Performanceof the JPEG-2000 image coder when used with a variety o f utility and quality estimators is then assessed.The estimators fall into two broad classes, magnitude-dependent (MSE, GMSE and NICE) and magnitude-independent (SSIM and VIF). They further dier on their use of the low-frequency image content in computingtheir estimates. The impact of these computational dieren ces is analyzed across a range of images and bit rates.Ingeneral, performanceofthe JPEG-2000coderbelow 1.6bits/pixel withanyofthese estimatorsis highlycontentdependent, with the most relevant content being the amount of texture in an image and whether the strongestgradients in an image correspond to the main contours of the scene. Above 1.6 bits/pixel, all estimators producevisually equivalent images.

Soil C modelling is the only reasonable approach available for predicting soil C dynamics under future conditions of environmental changes, and soil C models are usually constrained by the average of observations. However, model constraining is sensitive to the observed data, and the consequence of using observed averages on C predictions has rarely been studied. Using long-term soil organic C datasets from an agricultural field experiment, we constrained a processbased model using the average of observations or by taking into account the variation in observations to predict soil C dynamics. We found that uncertainties in soil C predictions were masked if ignoring the uncertainties in observations (i.e., using the average of observations to constrain model), if uncertainties in model parameterisation were not explicitly quantified. However, if uncertainties in model parameterisation had been considered, further considering uncertainties in observations had negligible effect on uncertainties in SOC predictions. The results suggest that uncertainties induced by model parameterisation are larger than that induced by observations. Precise observations representing the real spatial pattern of SOC at the studied domain, and model structure improvement and constrained space of parameters will benefit reducing uncertainties in soil C predictions. The results also highlight some areas on which future C model development and software implementations should focus to reliably infer soil C	feedback;mathematical model;spatiotemporal pattern	Zhongkui Luo;Enli Wang;Quanxi Shao;Mark K.

We use ~92-s datasets of proton plasma moments (speed, density, and temperature), measured from the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard Wind spacecraft, to estimate the moving averages of the polytropic index, as well as their weighted means and standard errors as a function of the solar wind speed and the year of measurements. The derived long-term behavior of the polytropic index agrees with the results of other previous methods. In particular, we find that the polytropic index remains quasi-constant with respect to the plasma flow speed, in agreement with earlier analyses of solar wind plasma. It is shown that most of the fluctuations of the polytropic index appear in the fast solar wind. The polytropic index remains quasi-constant, despite the frequent entropic variations. Therefore, on an annual basis, the polytropic index of the solar wind proton plasma near ~1 AU can be considered independent of the plasma flow speed. The estimated all-year weighted mean and its standard error is γ = 1.86 ± 0.09.

However, it is undeniable that the distortion reflects the intrinsic property of the lens, especially, the extreme wide-angle lens, which has a significant distortion. In this paper, we discuss how explicitly employing the distortion cues can detect the forgery object in distortion image and make the following contributions: 1) a radial distortion projection model is adopted to simplify the traditional captured ray-based models, where the straight world line is projected into a great circle on the viewing sphere; 2) two bottom-up cues based on distortion constraint are provided to discriminate the authentication of the line in the image; 3) a fake saliency map is used to maximum fake detection density, and based on the fake saliency map, an energy function is provided to achieve the pixel-level forgery object via graph cut.

a1cf4cd8849ad0b4de3e184c4830dc48a9f4a93b	multisource remote sensing imagery fusion scheme based on bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (bemd) and its application to the extraction of bamboo forest	multisource remote sensing;texture;bemd;bamboo extraction;extraction	Most bamboo forests grow in humid climates in low-latitude tropical or subtropical monsoon areas, and they are generally located in hilly areas. Bamboo trunks are very straight and smooth, which means that bamboo forests have low structural diversity. These features are beneficial to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) microwave penetration and they provide special information in SAR imagery. However, some factors (e.g., foreshortening) can compromise the interpretation of SAR imagery. The fusion of SAR and optical imagery is considered an effective method with which to obtain information on ground objects. However, most relevant research has been based on two types of remote sensing image. This paper proposes a new fusion scheme, which combines three types of image simultaneously, based on two fusion methods: bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and the Gram-Schmidt transform. The fusion of panchromatic and multispectral images based on the Gram-Schmidt transform can enhance spatial resolution while retaining multispectral information. BEMD is an adaptive decomposition method that has been applied widely in the analysis of nonlinear signals and to the nonstable signal of SAR. The fusion of SAR imagery with fused panchromatic and multispectral imagery using BEMD is based on the frequency information of the images. It was established that the proposed fusion scheme is an effective remote sensing image interpretation method, and that the value of entropy and the spatial frequency of the fused images were improved in comparison with other techniques such as the discrete wavelet, à-trous, and non-subsampled contourlet transform methods. Compared with the original image, information entropy of the fusion image based on BEMD improves about 0.13–0.38. Compared with the other three methods it improves about 0.06–0.12. The average gradient of BEMD is 4%–6% greater than for other methods. BEMD maintains spatial frequency 3.2–4.0 higher than other methods. The experimental results showed the proposed fusion scheme could improve the accuracy of bamboo forest classification. Accuracy increased by 12.1%, and inaccuracy was reduced by 11.0%.	algorithm;aperture (software);bamboo;contourlet;effective method;entropy (information theory);gradient;hilbert–huang transform;microwave;multispectral image;nonlinear system;schmidt decomposition;synthetic intelligence;wavelet	Guang Liu;Lei Li;Hui Gong;Qingwen Jin;Xinwu Li;Rui Song;Yun Chen;Yu Chen;Chengxin He;Yuqing Huang;Yuefeng Yao	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9010019	computer vision;extraction;texture;remote sensing	Vision	77.12816333838823	-60.105531768391515	28521

But it is not certain by conventional color imaging systems especially when the illumination of observing site is different from that of the image capturing site. We present a natural color reproduction system for telemedicine. In this system, the color of a patient under observing illumination is calculated from multispectral image. For accurate color reproduction, the spectral reflectance is calculated using principal components of human skin in the process. The color image is displayed on a calibrated display device. In the experiment, it is confirmed that the system realizes good accuracy in the color reproduction of human skin from 10 band multispectral image. And for simplification of the system we also adapted this process to commercial digital RGB camera.	digital camera	Yasuhiro Komiya;Kenro Ohsawa;Yuri Ohya;Takashi Obi;Masahiro Yamaguchi;Nagaaki Ohyama	1999			color histogram;multispectral image;false color;rgb color model;computer vision;hsl and hsv;image resolution;color normalization;color image;binary image;computer science;reproductive system;reflectivity;principal component analysis;computer graphics (images)	HCI	62.67212134508837	-58.83616066061792	28522

Various methods employed in DCT-domain downsizing simply reuse the frequency component of DCT, which shows a severe aliasing effect. The proposed approach extends the downsizing method for alleviating or reducing the aliasing effect with a windowing operation, which adjusts the magnitude of the DCT coefficient. Visual inspection showed satisfactory results, with no complexity overhead and performance degradation regarding the peak-signal-to noise ratio (PSNR) after upsampling. © 2007 SPIE and IS&T.

5694c8c4f06f8ffc9159f4990a1e91663b474b73	temporally-coherent novel video synthesis using texture-based priors	temporal coherence	In this paper we propose a method to construct a virtual sequence for a camera moving through a static environment, given an input sequence from a different camera trajectory. Existing image-based rendering techniques can generate photorealistic images given a set of input views, though the output images almost unavoidably contain small regions where the colour has been incorrectly chosen. In a single image these artifacts are often hard to spot, but become more obvious when viewing a real image with its virtual stereo pair, and even more so when a sequence of novel views is generated, since the artifacts are rarely temporally consistent. To address this problem of consistency, we propose a new spatio-temporal approach to novel video synthesis. Our method exploits epipolar geometry to impose constraints on temporal coherence of the rendered views. The pixels in the output video sequence are modelled as nodes of a 3-D graph. We define an MRF on the graph which encodes photoconsistency of pixels as well as texture priors in both space and time. Unlike methods based on scene geometry, which yield highly connected graphs, our approach results in a graph whose degree is independent of scene structure. The MRF energy is therefore tractable and we solve it for the whole sequence using a state-of-the-art message passing optimisation algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing temporal artifacts.	coherence (physics)	Ali Shahrokni;Oliver J. Woodford;Ian D. Reid	2009	IPSJ Trans.

8e456ac425272ab220b745b264b7367c432ba7b3	multiscale comparison of eight satellite soil moisture data sets over two calibration sites		This paper examines the quality of eight satellite soil moisture products at two typical spatial resolutions, including an intercomparison of SMAP passive, SMOS, JAXA AMSR2, LPRM AMSR2, ESA CCI and the Chinese FY3B soil moisture products at a coarse resolution of ∼0.25°, and the newly released SMAP enhanced passive and JAXA AMSR2 soil moisture products at a medium resolution of ∼0.1°. Insitu measurements from two representative dense networks, i.e., the Little Washita Watershed (LWW) in the United States and the REMEDHUS networks in Spain are used to compare and validate the eight soil moisture products. The results show that the SMAP passive and FY3B products outperform the other products with the lowest unbiased root mean square (ubRMSE) values of 0.027 m3 m−3 and 0.025 m3 m−3 in the LWW and REMEDHUS network regions respectively. SMOS slightly underestimates soil moisture with a dry bias, but it correlates well with insitu data with an average correlation value of 0.77. The JAXA product performs much better at 0.25° than at 0.1º, but both of them underestimate soil moisture (bias>-0.05 m3 m−3) at most time. The SMAP enhanced passive soil moisture well captures the temporal variation of ground measurements with a correlation coefficient larger than 0.8, and is generally superior to the JAXA product. The LPRM shows much larger amplitude and temporal variation than the ground soil moisture with a wet bias larger than 0.09 m3 m−3. The ESA CCI product shows satisfactory performance with acceptable error metrics (ubRMSE<0.045 m3 m−3), revealing the effectiveness of merging active and passive soil moisture products. The good performance of SMAP and FY3B demonstrates the potential in integrating them into the existing long-term ESA CCI product to form a more complete product.	coefficient;esa;mean squared error;watershed (image processing)	Jiangyuan Zeng;Kunshan Chen;Chenyang Cui;Haiyun Bi	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518973	calibration;remote sensing;correlation coefficient;merge (version control);hydrology;water content;data set;computer science	Arch	84.19464149113595	-60.245986173392104	28545

Anisotropic diffusion has been proposed as a remedy for removing such undesirable blocking effects. The main disadvantage of that approach is that artifacts near high-contrast image features are not adequately reduced. We propose an alternative non-linear method that reduces artifacts by minimizing the total variation of the reconstructed image in the vicinity of DCT block boundaries. This minimization is achieved via a level set formulation. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method removes the blocking artifact effectively, producing an image with smooth level sets in the region interiors as well as near the true edges of the image.

The reconstructed image quality is then impacted by the estimation accuracy of the features. In this letter, through discussing the correlation between the system parameters and the estimation performance of the curvilinear SAR, a conclusion can be drawn on how the overall location accuracy of a target is determined by the correlation between the azimuth and elevation coordinates of the flight path, compactly characterizing the curvilinear aperture. Consequently, a new index, determined only with the aperture parameters, is proposed as an aperture evaluator, which is referred to as the feature-independent aperture evaluator (FAE).

Although these proposed sparse-reconstruction-based methods lead to promising results, three issues remained unsolved: 1) high computational cost; 2) no consideration given to the possibility of mutually correlated information in different multispectral channels; and 3) requirement that the spectral responses of the panchromatic (Pan) image and the multispectral image cover the same wavelength range, which is not necessarily valid for most sensors. In this paper, we propose a sophisticated sparse image fusion algorithm, which is named “jointly sparse fusion of images” (J-SparseFI). It is based on the earlier proposed sparse fusion of images (SparseFI) algorithm and overcomes the aforementioned three drawbacks of the existing sparse image fusion algorithms. The computational problem is handled by reducing the problem size and by proposing a fully parallelizable scheme. Moreover, J-SparseFI exploits the possible signal structure correlations between multispectral channels by introducing the joint sparsity model (JSM) and sharpening the highly correlated adjacent multispectral channels together. This is done by exploiting the distributed compressive sensing theory that restricts the solution of an underdetermined system by considering an ensemble of signals being jointly sparse. J-SparseFI also offers a practical solution to overcome spectral range mismatch between the Pan and multispectral images. By means of sensor spectral response and channel mutual correlation analysis, the multispectral channels are assigned to primary groups of joint channels, secondary groups of joint channels, and individual channels. Primary groups of joint channels, individual channels, and secondary groups of joint channels are then reconstructed sequentially, by the JSM or by modified SparseFI, using a dictionary trained from the Pan image or previously reconstructed high-resolution multispectral channels. A recipe of how to choose appropriate algorithm parameters, including the most crucial regularization parameter, is provided. The algorithm is evaluated and validated using WorldView-2-like images that are simulated using very high resolution airborne HySpex hyperspectral imagery and further practically demonstrated using real WorldView-2 images. The algorithm's performance is compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Visual and quantitative analyses demonstrate the high quality of the proposed method. In particular, the analysis of the difference images suggests that J-SparseFI is superior in image resolution recovery.	airborne ranger;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;compressed sensing;computation;computational problem;dictionary;display resolution;futures studies;image fusion;image resolution;image sensor;multispectral image;sparse matrix;traction substation	Xiaoxiang Zhu;Claas Grohnfeldt;Richard Bamler	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2504261	computer vision;pattern recognition;image fusion;remote sensing	Vision	68.05606056573336	-66.54251629755316	28609

The fusion scheme consists of two parallel processes which are linearly combined on a spatially adaptive basis: lowpass fusion to exploit the inherent target-background discrimination capability of infrared sensors and highpass fusion to capture texture and shape details leveraging the visible band imagery. The weighting coefficients for each process are determined by maximizing a no-reference fusion quality metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against a variety of practical infrared fusion tasks where it delivers tangible performance gains relative to several well-known state of the art fusion techniques.	algorithm;coefficient;distortion;image fusion;look and feel;low-pass filter;sensor;structural similarity	Chuong T.

669051d1384977b94f36690742a27ca5ee9d8a7b	comparison of four models on forest above ground biomass estimation based on remote sensing		The estimating of forest biomass can help us to find out the carbon storage of our country, gradually raise the level of carbon emissions constraints, reduce the concentration of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, slow down the global warming process and will be conducive to the formation of resource saving, environment friendly modes of production, lifestyles and consumption patterns, and realize sustainable development. Here, several common estimation methods of forest above ground biomass with remote sensing were used respectively, and were compared. 150 sample data which received by CASA model and 45 variables achieved by remote sensing and meteorological data in Mount Tai scenic area are applied in these models. The results showed that the fittings, estimating precisions and root mean square errors of multi-stepwise regression model, traditional BP neutral network model, RBF neutral network model and K-NN method were 72.1%, 79.2%, 22.805 t·m− 2; 79.3%, 84.7%, 20.854 t·m− 2; 81.6%, 87.1%, 19.195 t·m− 2 and73.2%, 79.6%, 24.092 t·m− 2 respectively. Above all, this paper provides the reference for forest above ground biomass estimation with high precision of the further research.

While being a generic framework to handle statistics properly, it is also known to be sensitive to noise and outliers, and is not suitable for direct application to images without additional postprocessing regularization to remove artifacts. To tackle these issues, we propose to directly deal with the regularity of the transport map and the spatial consistency of the reconstruction. Our approach is based on the relaxed and regularized discrete optimal transport method of [1]. We extend this work by (i) modeling the spatial distribution of colors within the image domain and (ii) tuning automatically the relaxation parameters. Experiments on real images demonstrate the capacity of our model to adapt itself to the considered data.	case preservation;color mapping;convex optimization;experiment;image noise;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;transportation theory (mathematics);video post-processing	Julien Rabin;Sira Ferradans;Nicolas Papadakis	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025983	filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;image processing;computer science;mathematics	Vision	55.08106656348118	-71.93395265292783	28908

This work introduces a radically novel approach for achieving this goal by exploiting the proliferation of remote sensing satellite imagery, allowing for the up-to-date generation of global-scale land cover maps. We propose the application of multilabel classification, a powerful framework in machine learning, for inferring the complex relationships between the acquired satellite images and the spectral profiles of different types of surface materials. Introducing a drastically different approach compared to unsupervised spectral unmixing, we employ contemporary ground-collected data from the European Environment Agency to generate the label set and multispectral images from the MODIS sensor to generate the spectral features, under a supervised classification framework. To validate the merits of our approach, we present results using several state-of-the-art multilabel learning classifiers and evaluate their predictive performance with respect to the number of annotated training examples, as well as their capability to exploit examples from neighboring regions or different time instances. We also demonstrate the application of our method on hyperspectral data from the Hyperion sensor for the urban land cover estimation of New York City. Experimental results suggest that the proposed framework can achieve excellent prediction accuracy, even from a limited number of diverse training examples, surpassing state-of-the-art spectral unmixing methods.	algorithm;experiment;ground truth;hyperion;image resolution;machine learning;map;multispectral image;statistical classification;stellar classification	Konstantinos Karalas;Grigorios Tsagkatakis;Michael Zervakis;Panagiotis Tsakalides	2016	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2016.2520203	computer vision;image resolution;hyperspectral imaging;physics;satellite;remote sensing	ML	77.86979955274828	-58.61512759259415	29017

3551fa81736b33bfd628a277dbe4224a24233f75	non-linear diffusion of image noise with minimal iterativity		Non-linear diffusion (ND) is an iterative difference equation used in several image processing applications such as denoising, segmentation, or compression. The number of iterations required to achieve optimal processing can be very high, making ND not suitable for real-time requirements. In this paper, we study how to reduce complexity of ND so as to achieve minimal number of iterations for real-time image denoising. To do this, we first study the relations between parameters of the iterative equation: the number of iterations, the time step, and the edge strength. We then proceed by estimating the minimally required number of iterations to achieve effective denoising. Then, we relate the edge strength to the number of iterations, to noise, and to the image structure. The resulted minimal iterativity ND is very fast, while still achieves similar or better noise reduction compared to related ND work. This paper also shows how the proposed spatial filter is suitable for structure-sensitive object segmentation and temporal noise reduction.	data compression;image noise;image processing;iteration;iterative and incremental development;noise reduction;norsk data;real-time clock;recurrence relation;requirement	Eva Rifkah;Aishy Amer	2013	Journal of Real-Time Image Processing	10.1007/s11554-013-0340-7	mathematical optimization	Vision	56.45437872614101	-70.04448152757038	29275

An onboard Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor (SDSM) tracks the SDs degradation. The SDSM views the sun through a 1.44% attenuation screen during SD calibration. The observed SDSM sun view response has shown serious unexpected ripples that are as large as 10% of the averaged response and consequently disable the originally designed SD degradation tracking algorithms. In this report, a model based on geometric factors and design parameters is developed to simulate the SDSM sun view response. It is shown that the ripples are induced by erroneous design parameters and incorrect installation of the involved optical elements. The model could be used to improve the MODIS SD calibration and to provide helpful information for the design of future remote sensing systems.	algorithm;aqua;elegant degradation;issue tracking system;sds 940;simulation;yaws	Junqiang Sun;Xiaoxiong Xiong;William Barnes	2005	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2005.852710	attenuation;meteorology;calibration;degradation;optics;physics;remote sensing;technology	Robotics	86.72555416186862	-65.51000713710098	29399

The first method is used to minimize the total color differences between the actual and predicted color samples. The second one, which is a generalization of the existing cubic-root preprocessing technique, derives the mapping between the p’th root of scanner responses and Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage L a b (CIELAB) values. The experiment results indicate that the color accuracies of the proposed methods, especially the second one, are better than those of the traditional CIE XYZ (CIEXYZ)space-based characterization methods. © 2006 SPIE and IS&T.

Most of the existing fingerprint enhancement methods are contextual filter-based methods and they often suffer from two shortcomings: (1) there is block effect on the enhanced images; and (2) they blur or destroy ridge structures around singular points. In order to well preserve the ridge structures in singular regions and avoid block effect, we develop a new method for fingerprint enhancement combining nontensor product wavelet filter banks and anisotropic filter. We first decompose the fingerprint image using the nontensor product wavelet filter banks. Then we modify the approximation subimage using anisotropic filtering and adjust the high frequency coefficients of the three other subimages by applying the adaptive approach to reduce the noises according to the geometry feature of images. Finally, the inverse transform is applied to map the result and a final contrast enhancement is done subsequently. Experiments have been conducted on the fingerprint database FVC2004 in our study. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of overcoming block effect and enhancing low quality fingerprint while preserving the ridge structures around singular points.	anisotropic filtering;fingerprint;wavelet	Jiajia Lei;Qinmu Peng;Xinge You;Hiyam Hatem Jabbar;Patrick Shen-Pei Wang	2012	IJPRAI	10.1142/S0218001412560010	computer vision;speech recognition;machine learning;biometrics;anisotropic filtering	EDA	57.767260669811385	-66.9322688918029	29479

When one point spread function acts on the whole image, estimation of the true image is easier. However, for spatial variant degradations, i.e., when number of point spread functions act on the image, it is very difficult to estimate the true image from the degraded observation. In this paper, we have addressed rotational motion blur problem which may be either circular or elliptical. Spatial variant degradation is converted to number of spatial invariant degradations and the principle of spatial variant restoration is applied. The restoration results indicate the efficiency of the proposed method.	acronis true image;box blur;circuit restoration;deblurring;elegant degradation;gaussian blur;image restoration;wiener filter	Ratnakar Dash;Pankaj Kumar Sa;Banshidhar Majhi	2011	IJCVR	10.1504/IJCVR.2011.039358	image restoration;computer vision;computer science;point spread function;motion field;computer graphics (images)	Vision	56.00333735390537	-58.000695548952066	29632

The idf relationships for traditional method are based on an at-site frequency analysis of rainfall data separately for different durations. So the researchers are focus on the distribution selection for each duration and the empirical formula to evaluate the rainfall intensity. In this study, an improved Sherman formula is proposed to fit the observed data better. And in recent years, a simple scaling model with scale-invariant concept is commonly used to derive the extreme rainfall intensity for short durations (always less than 1h) from the longer durations (such as rainfall data for 1day is available easily). Results show that rainfall follows a simple scaling process with two different scaling regimes, and the broke point of the scaling model is same to the improved Sherman formula. With less parameters and high feasibility to derived extreme rainfall of short durations from that of the longer duration, the scaling model is proposed for the stations un-gauged or lacking of data. Results show that the scaling model can provide extreme rainfall data that are comparable with the empirical ones.	frequency analysis;image scaling;ising model	Qin Huang;Yuanfang Chen;Sui Xu;Yong Liu;Xinkai Li	2010	2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2010.5582456	econometrics;geography;hydrology;statistics	HPC	87.04838025416979	-60.176830038176256	29647

The proposed model is composed of two basic scattering models, one for foliage and the other for the hard targets. The connection between these two models, which accounts for the interaction between the foliage scatterers and the target and vice versa, is accomplished through the application of the reciprocity theorem. Wave penetration through the forest canopy and near-field and far-field scattering from the canopy's constituents is calculated using a coherent discrete scattering model that makes use of realistic tree structures. Calculation of scattering from a hard target illuminated by the reduced incident field and the scattered field of nearby vegetation is carried out using an iterative physical optics (PO) method formulated for fast computation of foliage-target interaction. To reduce the number of iterations, geometrical optics (GO) approximation is initially used for determining the shadowed areas over the hard target when illuminated by individual foliage scatterers. Furthermore, using a scaled measurement system at millimeter-wave frequency, the accuracy of the iterative PO model is demonstrated, employing a complex target that occupies a volume as big as 86lambdatimes33lambdatimes20lambda	approximation;coherence (physics);computation;embedded system;iteration;motorola canopy;system of measurement;the forest	Mojtaba Dehmollaian;Kamal Sarabandi	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2006.879109	near and far field;accuracy and precision;optics;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.03291617840738	-68.1240383655202	29662

Previous studies based on statistical data can hardly reveal the interior mechanism of spatial inequality due to the limitation of statistical units, while the application of remote sensing data, such as nighttime light (NTL) data, provides an effective solution. In this study, based on the DMSP/OLS NTL data, the urbanization type of all towns in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration was analyzed from the aspects of development level and speed. Meanwhile, spatial cluster analysis of development level by local Moran’s I was used to explore spatial inequality, and the trend was discussed by comparing the development characteristics on both sides of the transition line of different development levels (inequality boundary). The results showed that the development level of the whole region increased dramatically as the mean DN value increased by 65.99%, and 83.72% of the towns showed a positive development during 2000–2012. The spatial distribution of urbanization types showed that Beijing and Tianjin were at a high urbanization level with rapid speed of development, with the southern region having a medium development level and the northwestern region lagging behind. The spatial cluster analysis also revealed a gradually intensifying trend of inequality as the number of towns with balanced development reduced by 319 during 2000–2012, while the towns in the high-high areas increased by 99 and those in the low-low areas increased by 229. Moreover, the development speed inside the inequality boundary was obviously higher than that outside, indicating an increasingly serious situation for spatial inequality of urban development in the whole region.	cluster analysis;development speed;ntl;ordinary least squares;regional lockout;social inequality;spatial analysis;towns	Yi'na Hu;Jian Peng;Yanxu Liu;Yueyue Du;Huilei Li;Jiansheng Wu	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9070760	remote sensing;spatial distribution;economic geography;inequality;geology;spatial inequality;urban agglomeration;lagging;beijing;urban planning;urbanization	HCI	83.46866248448104	-55.63836589456133	29743

In doing so, we need to remove lots of details in the original high resolution image. In this paper, we review some little known results on an interesting topic called subpixel rendering, which can provide apparent higher resolution at the expense of color fringing artifacts.

3721a7bd8b77d7f6eefb0c4b3e12ecc5029d07d1	colour appearance modelling between physical samples and their representation on large liquid crystal display		The use of large displays for purposes of colour communication is becoming increasingly popular and the need for high-fidelity reproduction of appearance is becoming even more demanding. In this work, the colour appearance of the ColorChecker chart was matched on a large liquid crystal display (LCD) and a comparison between the physical colours and the displayed image was made. Colour definition and colour perception spaces were used to derive appearance models that define the difference between the digital and physical stimuli. The procedure was repeated using a selection of coloured garments as stimuli. The results revealed a good agreement in the defining the appearance difference between digital and physical stimuli. In both cases the difference in lightness between the two media was found to be responsible for the variation in matching. This outcome was used to develop a colour-rendering chain for the display. The use of appearance modelling in the digital image reproduction chain enhanced the appearance of solid paint-coated surfaces and dyed-garment images. Introduction Both cross-media reproduction and appearance modelling have been active fields of research for more than 15 years [14]. The most recent related study involving comparing physical stimuli with those on a display was carried out by Oicherman et al. to examine the effect of observer metamerism in colour matching between physical stimuli and small displays [5]. This study concerns with the matching took place on a large rather than small display. Also, the physical samples in this study were viewed under studio lighting instead of inside a viewing cabinet. Digital images of coloured stimuli were shown on an LCD. Observers modified colour to achieve a match with physical stimuli. By combining physical measurements between both stimuli and the use of colour specification and perception spaces, appearance modelling was attempted. The outcome of this study aims to define an appearance model that will aid achieving high-fidelity matches of images of different materials shown on a large LCD. Measurement Device All of the surface radiometric measurements were conducted using a Minolta CS-1000 tele-spectroradiometer (TSR). Stimuli Experimental planning began by selecting physical stimuli. For Experiment I, a set of uniform colours was sought. A number of standardised commercial calibration targets were considered and eventually the X-Rite ColorChecker was chosen. The GretagMacbeth ColorChecker chart consists of a 4×6 array of 50×50mm coloured patches, which are covered by a thick black frame. This size is sufficient to make patches discernible at a distance, which is critical for the colourmatching procedure as well as distant spectroradiometric measurement. The patches have a matt paint coating and the range of colours is sufficiently large as it includes primaries (often referred to as R, G, B, C, M, Y), a six-step greyscale and six colours that simulate objects found in nature [6]. Experiment II involved a number of garments that would cover the range of the four primary CIELAB hues (red, green, yellow and blue) without taking texture into account. Thus, four single-colour garments were chosen as depicted in (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Visual stimuli used in Experimental II The garments were measured using a Minolta CS-1000 tele-spectroradiometer (TSR) under the experiment lighting conditions. The ab and LC ab * plots in Figure 2 indicate that stimuli were close to the CIELAB primaries and that they cover a medium to high C ab * range of 30-90 while holding a medium L range of 40-60.	amplifier;box counting;color vision;digital image;experiment;grayscale;lcd television;light gun;linear equation;liquid-crystal display;matching (graph theory);observer pattern;rite method;simulation;tele-artist;television;traffic sign recognition;xara flare	Chrysiida Kitsara;M.

The majority of recent and current space instruments use reflective diffusers. As a result, numerous Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) calibration comparisons have been conducted between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other industry and university-based metrology laboratories. However, based on literature searches and communications with NIST and other laboratories, no Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function (BTDF) measurement comparisons have been conducted between National Measurement Laboratories (NMLs) and other metrology laboratories. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in the use of transmissive diffusers in the calibration of satellite, air-borne, and ground-based remote sensing instruments. Current remote sensing instruments employing transmissive diffusers include the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite instrument (OMPS) Limb instrument on the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) platform,, the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) on the Korea Aerospace Research Institute's (KARI) Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Aura platform, the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument and the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS).. This ensemble of instruments requires validated BTDF measurements of their on-board transmissive diffusers from the ultraviolet through the near infrared. This paper presents the preliminary results of a BTDF comparison between the NASA Diffuser Calibration Laboratory (DCL) and NIST on quartz and thin Spectralon samples.	bidirectional reflectance distribution function;bidirectional scattering distribution function;cns disorder;calibration;eos;emission - male genitalia finding;image sensor;imager device component;instrument - device;laboratory;on-board data handling;ozone;quartz;reflection (computer programming);remote sensing;standards characteristics	Georgi T.

We propose a 1-D kernel fitting algorithm for denoising in space domain and wavelet transformed (WT) domain, and for magnification in space domain. In the algorithm, the values of a column or a row from an image or its transformed version are taken as the measured results of a fitting function. The fitting coefficients are estimated by least square (LS) method. An image is denoised or magnified by resampling the fitted function, or followed by inverse transform if fitting is carried out in a transformed domain. We also discuss a modified singular value decomposition (SVD) method for comparison. To illustrate the application feasibility, the presented methods are experimentally compared with the basic wavelet-thresholding algorithm for image denoising, and with the standard bicubic interpolation method for magnification.	algorithm;bicubic interpolation;coefficient;curve fitting;experiment;kernel (operating system);least squares;noise reduction;resampling (statistics);singular value decomposition;thresholding (image processing);wavelet transform	Benyong Liu;Xiang Liao	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Information Assurance and Security	10.1109/IAS.2009.29	computer vision;mathematical optimization;pattern recognition;mathematics	Vision	56.58989263895409	-67.91669395889873	29931

However, one observes from computer simulation that the values of clipping and scaling parameters are quite different in image enhancement for various blurred images. Therefore, one aim of this paper is to develop an effective image classification technique to decide the best combination of clipping and scaling parameters by the opportunity cost method for image enhancement. Experimental results show that the proposed opportunity cost method with image classification for the nonlinear image enhancement achieves a better subjective and objective image quality performance than the method using the opportunity cost without image classification and other nonlinear image enhancement methods.	clipping (computer graphics);computer simulation;computer vision;image editing;image quality;image scaling;nonlinear system	Lung-Jen Wang;Ya-Chun Huang	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2012.120	image quality;image restoration;computer vision;feature detection;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics	Robotics	58.78966940836988	-63.97591120720686	30088
bf472460a215d5d7c38a1c90aaa911b508d08453	a novel tensor robust pca approach for background subtraction from compressive measurements		Background subtraction so far has been a fundamental and widely studied task in the field of video analysis, with a wide range of applications to video surveillance, teleconferencing and 3D modeling. Recently, due to the emergence of massive video data, background subtraction from compressive measurements (BSCM) provides a promising way for reducing the burden of storing and transmitting large video data. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor robust PCA approach for the task of BSCM. We utilize tensor low-rank approximation to eliminate the spatial-temporal redundancy in the video backgrounds, and design a multi-scale 3D total variation regularizer to enforce the smoothness of video foreground. Furthermore, we introduce the non-local self-similarity of video cuboid into our model to further reduce the video redundancy. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to solve the proposed optimization models. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world videos demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models over the state-of-the-art approaches.	3d modeling;3d television;augmented lagrangian method;background subtraction;channel (digital image);closed-circuit television;cuboid;eigen (c++ library);emergence;experiment;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;nonlocal lagrangian;optimization problem;self-similarity;simulation;singular value decomposition;streaming media;transmitter;tucker decomposition;video content analysis	Wenfei Cao;Yao Wang;Jian Sun;Deyu Meng;Can Yang;Andrzej Cichocki;Zongben Xu	2015	CoRR		computer vision;simulation;speech recognition;mathematics	Vision	56.66075219612536	-56.71005297553813	30090

Therefore many level measurement methods have been used to measure the level of solids in silos. Existing methods, however, are generally based on one-point measurement which makes the three dimensional (3D) level measurement impractical. Microwave radar based systems can be used to 3D perception but the multiple scatterings occurred from metallic walls of the silo, makes it impossible. In this study we present the preliminary results of our compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithm to enhance backscattering signals inside a grain silo. The method proposed here eliminates the effect of multiple scattering form silo wall and gives the accurate reading of the grain level. The effectiveness of the recommend CS-based reconstruction method, which will be able to extend to 3D level perception, was verified through a real data of bulk silo.	algorithm;compressed sensing;experiment;multipath propagation;nyquist rate;radar;silo;subsurface scattering	Enes Yigit;Hakan Isiker;Abdurrahim Toktas;Saibun Tjuatja	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326638	optics;scattering;compressed sensing;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	78.91466857014235	-69.47856315855816	30109

Since the sharpness of a camera lens changes continuously across the field of view, the characteristics of the lens need to be determined at many positions within the image. In short, the proposed simulation method consists of two parts. First, the point-spread function (PSF) at a limited number of field positions is constructed using Zernike polynomials. The polynomial coefficients at a specified field position are determined by fitting the calculated MTF for these PSFs to the measured MTF data. The other part interpolates Zernike coefficients for all other relevant positions within the image. In this way it is possible to find a sufficiently accurate PSF at any arbitrary field point. By utilizing a generalized non-translational invariant summation of PSFs, the sharpness at any field point in the image can be simulated. This system also has the advantage that the sharpness at different focusing positions can be determined quite easily. It is also a fairly simple matter to include effects such as distortion and vignetting. In the present paper, examples of simulations are shown and advantages as well as drawbacks of the method are discussed.	coefficient;distortion;interpolation;move-to-front transform;polynomial;simulation	Henrik Eliasson	2008		10.1117/12.759370	computer vision;digital photography;distortion;zernike polynomials;optical transfer function;lens;optics;vignetting;physics	Vision	61.89456978573276	-59.00968515020336	30118

In this paper, we present an image fusion technique using the dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). We have proposed novel masks to extract information from the decomposed structure using DTCWT. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new approach to fuse multimodality images using dual tree complex wavelet transform. Experiment results show that the proposed fusion method based on complex wavelet transform is remarkably better than the fusion method based on classical discrete wavelet transform. This method is relevant to visual sensitivity and tested by merging multisensor, multispectral and defocused images apart from medical images (CT and MR images). Fusion is achieved through the formation of a fused pyramid using the DTCWT coefficients from the decomposed pyramids of the source images. The fused image is obtained through conventional inverse dual tree complex wavelet transform reconstruction process.

The calibration equations for this product are developed and the approaches for the laboratory calibration and the on-orbit verification of that calibration are described also. The development of the MODIS science products begins with the Level 1B calibration products. The radiometric characteristics of the LIB product are reviewed, but the geometric registration and spectral characterization of the products are not described in this paper. The primary aspects of the MODIS sensor is discussed by Barnes [1]. Major science products for the MODIS oceans [2] and land surface [3] research communities are described elsewhere in this issue. Sensor design and characteristics necessary to understand the Level 1B software product are reviewed in the Section 2.0, Instrument Background. The emissive infrared algorithms are described in Section 3.0. The reflected solar bands algorithm, including subsections on the radiance and the reflectance factor products, is covered in Section 4.0. The Level 1B data software product attributes such as file format and uncertainty index are reviewed in Section 5.0. The conclusion and summary comments are provided in Section 6.0. 2.0 Instrument Background The MODIS is a 36-band spectroradiometer which covers a broad spectral range, and has very demanding calibration performance characteristics. The sensor design incorporates a paddle-wheel scan mirror to provide a wide swath across the Earth surface, and to provide access to an array of characterization sub-systems on each rotation of the mirror. The spectral separation of the light comes from three dichroics and sliver interference filters at each detector. The spectral ranges for the reflected solar bands (0.4 to 2.3 _m) and the emissive infrared bands (3.6 to 14.4 prn) calibrated and analyzed with separate techniques. The descriptions of the calibration approach and algorithm follows this separation. Figure 1 provides a schematic of the sensor optics, optical detectors and electronics to demonstrate how optical signals onto the scan mirror are transformed to digital signals or data. The MODIS design incorporates several on-board calibration (OBC) targets and each is valuable for some aspect of the calibration algorithm design. The scan mirror points to the internal OBCs: the solar diffuser (SD), the spectroradiometric calibration assembly (SRCA), the blackbody (BB) and cold space view (SV) on each mirror rotation. The scan mirror is double sided and both sides are used for the MODIS observations. A rotation of 360 degrees of the scan mirror requires 2.954 sec. Throughout this paper, a period of 1.477 sec is identified as a scan, and the data produced from it is called a scan line of data,	algorithm design;cpu cache;columbia (supercomputer);computation;data system;dichroism;digital signal (signal processing);eos;email;fax;interference (communication);internet branding;metric;molecular dynamics;montgomery modular multiplication;on-board data handling;scan line;schematic;sensor;sliver polygon;systemverilog	Bruce Guenther;Gerald D.

c08a072a00e11bd464de87ce4e1b601c4e43e86e	the development of a color visual difference model (cvdm)		A color visual difference model (CVDM) was developed to predict the imag e quality difference of two images. The model is an extensio n of the two previously published models: The monochromatic Visible Differenc e Predictor (VDP) by Scott Daly an d the color Spatial-CIELAB (SCIELAB) model by Zhang et al. The CVDM consists of color space conversion modulation by contrast sensitivity functions , visual masking effect, multiresolution detection me chanisms, and visible color difference calculation. Inputs to th e model ar e a reference image and a processed image, as well calibration paramet ers such as viewing distance , resolution of the images, and white point.

Unfortunately, the prevalent methods often fail to eliminate image noise, unrealistic details, or incoherent enhancement. In this paper, we propose a new sharpness enhancement approach that can boost the sharpness characteristics of an image effectively with affinity-based edge preserving. Our approach includes three gradient-domain operations: sharpness saliency representation, affinity-based gradient transformation, and gradient-domain image reconstruction. Moreover, we also propose an evaluation method based on sharpness distribution for analyzing all sharpness enhancement approaches in respect of sharpness characteristics. By evaluating the sharpness distribution and comparing the visual appearance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our sharpness enhancement approach.	affinity analysis;algorithm;computer graphics;computer vision;deblurring;gradient;ground truth;image editing;image noise;image segmentation;iterative reconstruction;processor affinity;real-time transcription;seamless3d;smoothing;strongly regular graph;unsharp masking;upsampling;variable shadowing	Zhifeng Xie;Rynson W.

0b4e5689d07aa4eba2fab2e23b68aa4afe232d5b	exploiting structured sparsity for hyperspectral anomaly detection		Sparse representation-based background modeling facilitates much recent progress in hyperspectral anomaly detection (AD). The sparse representation of background often exhibits underlying structure, which is crucial to distinguish between background and anomaly. However, how to exploit such underlying structure is still challenging. To address this problem, we present a novel hyperspectral AD method, which can exploit the structured sparsity in modeling the background more accurately. With the plausible background area detected by a local RX detector, a robust background spectrum dictionary is learned in a principal component analysis way. A reweighted Laplace prior-based structured sparse representation model is then employed to reconstruct the spectrum of each pixel. With considering the structured sparsity in representation, the background pixels can be reconstructed more accurately than the anomaly ones, which thus can be detected based on the reconstruction error. To further improve the detection performance, an intracluster reconstruction model is developed to exploit the spatial similarity among the background pixels in the same cluster. The anomaly pixels can then be detected based on the cost of intracluster reconstruction error. By linearly combining these two detection results, improvement is obviously achieved on detection accuracy. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art hyperspectral AD methods.	anomaly detection;data dictionary;horizontal situation indicator;pixel;principal component analysis;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence;the matrix	Fei Li;Xiuwei Zhang;Lei Zhang;Dongmei Jiang;Yanning Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2018.2821168	mathematics;computer vision;iterative reconstruction;artificial intelligence;object detection;anomaly detection;principal component analysis;pixel;sparse approximation;hyperspectral imaging;data set	Vision	68.85372817250143	-66.50467597269063	30284

In this paper, effectiveness of measuring power and energy per unit volume and the impact of height in system efficiency is analyzed. Variations in solar radiation intensity based on the angles of the Sun during the day and the year is briefly reviewed. It is shown how the wide ranges of these variations can affect efficiency of a solar power generating system and its energy delivery. Module of Irradiance and Collectivity Factors are introduced as parameters to estimate power/energy entering a volume and the efficiency of the system. Cost efficiency of the system is discussed considering all high cost items such as land, collector equipment and the supporting structure. A solar power-tracking concept is analyzed and shown how it would significantly increase the efficiency of the system. Feasibility of tracker in solar power generation is studied based on Tracking factor as defined here.	cost efficiency;watts humphrey	M.

Many existing MVS techniques make use of a two stage approach which estimates depth-maps from neighbouring images and then merges them to extract a final surface. Often the depth-maps used for the merging stage will contain outliers due to errors in the matching process. Traditional systems exploit redundancy in the image sequence (the surface is seen in many views), in order to make the final surface estimate robust to these outliers. In the case of sparse data sets there is often insufficient redundancy and thus performance degrades as the number of images decreases. In order to improve performance in these circumstances it is necessary to remove the outliers from the depth-maps. We identify the two main sources of outliers in a top performing algorithm: (1) spurious matches due to repeated texture and (2) matching failure due to occlusion, distortion and lack of texture. We propose two contributions to tackle these failure modes. Firstly, we store multiple depth hypotheses and use a spatial consistency constraint to extract the true depth. Secondly, we allow the algorithm to return an unknown state when the a true depth estimate cannot be found. By combining these in a discrete label MRF optimisation we are able to obtain high accuracy depth-maps with low numbers of outliers. We evaluate our algorithm in a multi-view stereo framework and find it to confer stateof-the-art performance with the leading techniques, in particular on the standard evaluation sparse data sets.	algorithm;distortion;experiment;hidden surface determination;map;markov random field;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;neural correlates of consciousness;pixel;redundancy (engineering);sparse matrix	Neill D.

Two time series of Sentinel-1 A/B images acquired from October 2016 to early April 2017 (including 31 ascending and 25 descending acquisitions) are used to form 6-day interferograms and to evaluate their potential for displacement measurements over small fast moving Alpine glaciers. Results show that, even at low latitudes as in the French Alps, fringe patterns can be observed over the glaciers during the cold season with favorable anti-cyclonic meteorological conditions. Different processing steps to derive final displacement fields are presented and discussed and the results are compared with ERS-Tandem results obtained on the same glaciers in winter 1996.	alpine;displacement mapping;time series	Matthias Jauvin;Yajing Yan;Emmanuel Trouvé;Bénédicte Fruneau	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519231	remote sensing;snow;latitude;glacier;interferometry;synthetic aperture radar;computer science	Embedded	82.28251823045237	-60.8007057933187	30501

For instance, NASA is continuously gathering high dimensional image data with instruments such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). This advanced sensor for Earth observation records the visible and near-infrared spectrum of the reflected light using more than 200 spectral bands, thus producing a stack of images in which each pixel (vector) is represented by a spectral signal that uniquely characterizes the underlying objects. The resulting data volume typically comprises several gigabytes per flight. In this article, we describe the state of the art in the devel opment and application of image and signal processing techniques for advanced information extraction from hyperspectral data. The article also describes new trends for efficient pro cessing of such data using parallel and distributed processing techniques in the context of time-critical applications.	distributed computing;gigabyte;imaging instruments;information extraction;lithosphere;pixel;signal processing;window of opportunity	Antonio J.

Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) can provide precipitation products that cover most of the conterminous United States at high resolution (approximately 4 km 4 km). There are two major issues concerning the application of NEXRAD data: 1) the lack of a NEXRAD geo-processing and geo-referring program and 2) bias correction of NEXRAD estimates. However, in public domain, there is no Geographic Information System (GIS) software that can use geostatistical approaches to calibrate NEXRAD data using raingauge data, and automatically process NEXRAD data for hydrologic and ecological models. In this study, we developed new GIS software for NEXRAD validation and calibration (NEXRAD-VC) using raingauge data. NEXRAD-VC can automatically read in NEXRAD data in NetCDF or XMRG format, transform projection of NEXRAD data to match with raingauge data, apply different geostatistical approaches to calibrate NEXRAD data using raingauge data, evaluate performance of different calibration methods using leaveone-out cross-validation scheme, output spatial precipitation maps in ArcGIS grid format, calculate spatial average precipitation for each spatial modeling unit used by hydrologic and ecological models. The major functions of NEXRAD-VC are illustrated in the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW) in Georgia using daily precipitation records of fifteen raingauges and NEXRAD products of five years. The validation results show that NEXRAD has a high success rate for detecting rain and no-rain events: 82.8% and 95.6%, respectively. NEXRAD estimates have high correlation with raingauge observations (correlation coefficient of 0.91), but relatively larger relative mean absolute error value of 36%. It is also worth noting that the performance of NEXRAD increases with the decreasing of rainfall variability. Three methods (Bias Adjustment method (BA), Regressing Kriging (RK), and Simple Kriging with varying local means (SKlm)) were employed to calibrate NEXRAD using raingauge data. Overall, SKlm performed the best among these methods. Compared with NEXRAD, SKlm improved the correlation coefficient to 0.96 and the relative mean absolute error to 22.8%, respectively. SKlm also increased the success rate of detection of rain and no-rain events to 87.47% and 96.05%, respectively. Further analysis of the performance of the three calibration methods and NEXRAD for daily spatial precipitation estimation shows that no one method can consistently provide better results than the other methods for each evaluation coefficient for each day. It is suggested that multiple methods be implemented to predict spatial precipitation. The NEXRAD-VC developed in this study can serve as an effective and efficient tool to batch process large amounts of NEXRAD data for hydrologic and ecological modeling. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Depending on what is emphasized, this method is called FIRST or WIPE:FIRST for the principles (Fourier Interpolation and Reconstruction via Shannon-type Techniques), and WIPE for the corresponding deconvolution method (WIPE reminds of CLEAN, a well-known deconvolution technique in astronomy). The regularization principle of FIRST refers to the Shannon sampling formula and to theoretical considerations related to multiresolution analysis. To describe the imaging kernel of FIRST (WIPE), the authors adopt a terminology derived from that of CLEAN. At each iteration of the selected constructive process (conjugate gradients for example), WIPE compares the dusty map with the dusty map of the model. In the corresponding truncated discrete convolution, the discrete point-spread function, the dusty beam, has two components: the traditional dirty beam and the regularization beam. Besides the clarity of the principles, the authors show, in a concrete manner, the advantages of WIPE over CLEAN. In a more general way, they also indicate how FIRST can be used for analysing the results provided by other methods. >	fourier analysis;interpolation;shannon (unit)	André Lannes;Eric Anterrieu;Sylvie Roques;Geraldine Fitoussi	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389502	iterative reconstruction;multiresolution analysis;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;information theory;interpolation;deconvolution;calculus;point spread function;aperture synthesis;mathematics;iterative method;conjugate gradient method;fourier analysis;statistics	Theory	59.26924372717712	-72.83212703887605	30690

For only visible and near infrared band in HJ-1A/B CCD images, the cloud detection algorithm using the shortwave infrared and thermal infrared band is restricted by the band-lacking problem. Based on the multi-temporal information of the HJ-1A/B CCD images, a new algorithm is proposed in this paper. Using available images in one month, a cloud-free reference image was firstly composed. Then, the cloud and snow pixel are separated through the difference of the blue band between the reference and each date. Subsequently, the regional covariance matrix is computed further to eliminate the non-cloud pixels. The test result shows that, the overall accuracy is about 85.96% to 93%. It indicates that the proposed method can integrate the temporal and texture information to improve detection accuracy for the cloud and snow.	algorithm;charge-coupled device;pixel;remote sensing application	Jinhu Bian;Ainong Li;Huaan Jin;Wei Zhao;Guangbin Lei;Chengquan Huang	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946469	meteorology;computer vision;snow;reflectivity;atmospheric optics;china;physics;remote sensing	Vision	76.69958465895681	-61.32692537483971	30720

To gain a better understanding of the landslides induced by this earthquake, we proposed a pixel-based change detection method for postearthquake landslide mapping by using bitemporal Landsat-8 remote sensing data [May 29, 2014 (pre-earthquake) and June 1, 2015 (postearthquake)]. Two river valleys (Trishuli river valley and Sun Koshi river valley) that contain important economic arteries linking Nepal and China were selected as the study areas. Validation of the mapping results with postearthquake high-resolution images from Google Earth shows that the pixel-based landslide mapping method is able to identify landslides with relatively high accuracy, and it also approves the applicability of Landsat-8 satellite for landslide mapping with its multispectral information. The spatial distribution analysis indicates that both river valleys are substantially affected by landslides, and the situation is even more serious in the high mountain areas. Landslides are generally found in areas of high elevation and large surface slopes, with mean values above 1600 m and 30°, respectively. These findings suggest that these areas suffer greatly from these geohazards, and the threat will continue for the next few years.	google earth;image resolution;landslides;multispectral image;pixel;temporal database;slope	Wei Zhao;Ainong Li;Xi Nan;Zhengjian Zhang;Guangbin Lei	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing	10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2661802	seismology;geomorphology;earth;physics;satellite;remote sensing	HCI	82.16874337211279	-57.17389048340151	30728

In this paper we present an algorithm which combines window-based local matching into a global optimization framework. Our local matching algorithm assumes that local windows can have at most two disparities. Under this assumption, the local matching can be performed very efficiently using graph cuts. The global matching is formulated as minimization of an energy term that takes into account the matching constraints induced by the local stereo algorithm. Fast, approximate minimization of this energy is achieved through graph cuts. The key feature of our algorithm is that it preserves discontinuities both during the local as well as global matching phase.	approximation algorithm;computer stereo vision;cut (graph theory);format-preserving encryption;global optimization;global serializability;matching (graph theory);mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;pixel;reflections of signals on conducting lines;window function	Motilal Agrawal;Larry S.

Unfortunately, satellite data often contain noise of various kinds which can compromise scientific analysis. Moreover, a satellite scene generally contains information on many different space scales associated with a variety of geophysical and/or biogeochemical processes. Thus, an accurate segmentation of such scenes is an essential step prior to scientific analysis. Only after such steps (e.g., noise reduction, segmentation) have been done can meaningful geophysical analyses be performed. The paper shows the natural synogestic relationship between the engineering and scientific components of the aforementioned problems. The benefits obtained by such a combined approach are illustrated with specific examples (oceanic, atmospheric and terrestrial) using both polar orbiting and geostationary satellite data.		James J.

Satellite data from a hyperspectral sensor can be transmitted at either Ka-band rates without compression or at X-band rates with lossy compression through links to ground stations. If lossy compression is used, there can be a 10:1 reduction in the amount of data to be transmitted. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has developed algorithms for lossy compression. For Canada's Hyperspectral satellite HERO (Hyperspectral Earth Resource Observer), consideration is being given to lossy compression of the data prior to data transmission. Experiments have been conducted with Hyperion and AVIRIS data to assess the impacts of compression on forest information products. These assessments have included forest classification products for forest inventory. This paper presents the results of these experiments with multiple analysis methods. The results indicate that 10:1 lossy compression produces too large a loss in information content in hyperspectral imagery for forest information products.

When observing objects in water through a camera contained in a waterproof housing or observing objects in an aquarium tank filled with preserving liquid, we should solve a problem of light refraction at the boundary surfaces of refractive index discontinuity which gives image distortion. The proposed method uses a space encoding method which does not have a problem of corresponding point detection as a stereo vision system has, and is faster than spot light projection or slit light projection methods. A ray tracing technique solves the problem of image distortion caused by refractive index discontinuity. It should be noted that monochromatic light projection onto objects gives more accurate measurement than white light projection because the refractive index depends on the wavelength of the light. Then, in order to measure colored objects, we should project red, green and blue light patterns onto them separately. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed method.	distortion;light field;monochrome;ray tracing (graphics);reflections of signals on conducting lines;stereopsis	Ryohei Kawai;Atsushi Yamashita;Toru Kaneko	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152430	three-dimensional space;ray tracing;computer vision;water resources;probability density function;computer science;stereopsis;lens;projection method;refractive index;optics;physics;encoding;remote sensing	Robotics	59.944703466646295	-53.09311981732697	30984

Similarly, light from the second surface illuminates the first. This mutual reflection effect can be exploited by examining pixels where interreflection is and is not present. From these measurements several intrinsic properties can be determined: the reflectance of each surface, the spectral power distribution of the incident illumination, and some constraints on the physical configuration of the two surfaces. The authors use finite dimensional linear models for the ambient illumination and for surface spectral reflectance, with m basis functions for illumination and n for surfaces. Examining p sensor values (e.g. RGB values) they find that if p satisfies the condition p>or=(2n+m)/3 they can solve for finite dimensional model descriptors of both surfaces and of the ambient illumination, as well as for a form-factor stemming from the surface configuration.

In this study, we test the ability to discriminate between two tree species of the same genera, using data from Landsat 8 satellite imagery, aerial images, and airborne laser scanning. Ground observations from forest stands dominated by either Norway spruce (Picea abies) or Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) were coupled with variables derived from each of the three sets of remote sensing data. Random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression classification models were fit to the data, and the classification accuracy tested by performing a cross-validation. Classification accuracies were compared for different combinations of remote sensing data and classification methods. The overall classification accuracy varied from 0.53 to 0.79, with the highest accuracy obtained using logistic regression with a combination of data derived from Landsat imagery and aerial images. The corresponding kappa value was 0.58. The contribution to the classification accuracy from using airborne data in addition to Landsat imagery was not substantial in this study. The classification accuracy varied between models using data from individual Landsat images.	aerial photography;airborne ranger;cross-validation (statistics);genera;logistic regression;random forest;sensor;statistical classification;support vector machine;threat (computer)	Marius Hauglin;Hans Ole Ørka	2016	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs8050363	biodiversity;peer review;forest;biological classification;invasive species;woody plant;ecology;remote sensing	ML	80.30888183672735	-57.0839855249444	31254
8a70f50cf5aec7e67f86f1cca6f8ed0a498d27db	effect of cloud fraction on arctic low-level temperature inversions in airs observations over both land and ocean		The low-level temperature inversions have significant impacts on Arctic climate change feedbacks. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) can extract the inversions over both land and ocean, and it is, however, sensitive to the presence of clouds. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of cloud fraction (CF) on AIRS inversions over both land and ocean. First, the AIRS inversions under clear-sky conditions are compared with the results from the microwave-based Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations in 2007–2013. Results show that despite the COSMIC and AIRS inversions appearing to be deeper and stronger in winter than in autumn, spring, and summer, the former is generally shallower and stronger than the latter in all seasons over both land and ocean. Time-series analysis of the mean monthly inversions from COSMIC and AIRS observations in 2007–2013 under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions further indicates that their differences are systematic and can be effectively mitigated after calibration under all sky conditions. Taking the calibrated COSMIC inversions as references, the AIRS inversion depths can be estimated with a root mean square (rms) of less than about 86 and 135 m, and the AIRS inversion strength can be obtained with an rms of better than about 1.7 °C and 1.3 °C under cloudy conditions over land and ocean, respectively. Moreover, while the AIRS inversion depths are insensitive to CF variations over both land and ocean, the inversion strengths are more sensitive to the CF variations over land than ocean.	cosmic;cloud fraction;high- and low-level;inversion (discrete mathematics);mean squared error;methods of computing square roots;microwave;priority inversion;time series	Liang Shuo Chang;Guiping Feng;Yang Zhang;Xiufeng He	2018	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2017.2772297	atmospheric infrared sounder;remote sensing;atmospheric sciences;mathematics;arctic;sea surface temperature;cloud fraction;cosmic cancer database;inversion (meteorology);sky;ionosphere	Metrics	83.69772738628785	-60.94381061924994	31267

This information is extracted by means of complex techniques from the phase of the signal. Building on the ideas of the persistent scatterer pair (PSP) method, we present an enhanced method aimed at fully extracting the coherent information even from low intensity SAR signals. The proposed method is very effective at extracting the available information from each single pixel of the SAR image where you could expect a coherent signal, even when there are not strongly scattering structures and the sensed signal is weak, as in the case of rather smooth surfaces or natural terrains. Several examples obtained from the processing COSMO-SkyMed data show that unprecedentedly dense ground deformation measurements can be obtained with the enhanced PSP method, not only corresponding to structures but also in natural terrains.	aperture (software);cosmo-rs;coherence (physics);coherent information;natural language processing;pixel	Mario Costantini;Federico Minati;Francesco Trillo;Francesco Vecchioli	2013	2013 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium - IGARSS	10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6721299	early-warning radar;space-based radar;synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;geology;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;remote sensing	Vision	80.55449287081711	-61.97054572395185	31350

The cardinal directions Ach, Cr1 and Cr2, designed by Krauskopf from habituation experiments and validated in our lab from spatial masking experiments, have been used to characterize color images. The achromatic component, already considered in previous study, will not be considered here. The same methodology has been applied to the two chromatic components to specify the decision thresholds and the reconstruction levels which ensure that the degradations induced will be lower than their visibility thresholds. Two observers have been used for each of the two components. From the values obtained for Cr1 component one should notice that the decision thresholds and reconstruction levels follow a linear law even at higher levels. However. for Cr2 component the values seem following a monotonous increasing function. To determine if these behaviors are frequency dependent, further experiments have been conducted with stimulus frequencies varying from icy/deg to 4cy/deg. The measured values show no significant variations. Finally, instead of sinusoidal stimuli, filtered textures have been used to take into account the spatio-frequential combination. The same laws (linear for Cr1 and monotonous increasing for Cr2) have been observed even if a variation in the quantization intervals is reported.	automated clearing house;color image;color quantization;experiment;icy;quantization (signal processing);texture mapping	Abdelhakim Saadane;Laurent Bédat;Dominique Barba	1998		10.1117/12.320112	iterative reconstruction;mental image;computer vision;color image;quantization;image processing;image compression;signal processing;color vision;optics;human visual system model;computer graphics (images)	Vision	62.37584683484819	-61.96810627944859	31468

This high spectral resolution can be used for object detection and for discriminate between different objects based on their spectral characteristics. One of the main problems involved in hyperspectral analysis is the presence of mixed pixels, which arise when the spacial resolution of the sensor is not able to separate spectrally distinct materials. Spectral unmixing is one of the most important task for hyperspectral data exploitation. However, the unmixing algorithms can be computationally very expensive, and even high power consuming, which compromises the use in applications under on-board constraints. In recent years, graphics processing units (GPUs) have evolved into highly parallel and programmable systems. Specifically, several hyperspectral imaging algorithms have shown to be able to benefit from this hardware taking advantage of the extremely high floating-point processing performance, compact size, huge memory bandwidth, and relatively low cost of these units, which make them appealing for onboard data processing. In this paper, we propose a parallel implementation of an augmented Lagragian based method for unsupervised hyperspectral linear unmixing on GPUs using CUDA. The method called simplex identification via split augmented Lagrangian (SISAL) aims to identify the endmembers of a scene, i.e., is able to unmix hyperspectral data sets in which the pure pixel assumption is violated. The efficient implementation of SISAL method presented in this work exploits the GPU architecture at low level, using shared memory and coalesced accesses to memory.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;cuda;computer graphics;gigabyte;graphics processing unit;memory bandwidth;object detection;on-board data handling;pixel;remote sensing application;sisal;shared memory;stellar classification	Jorge Sevilla;José M.

8e9340446da0ac69167d3de8ac21da6ce3a0a24d	increment information acquisition technology for remote sensing		In this paper, increment information is defined as the change of a scene between two observations. The increment information would be limited and can be acquired as long as the observation interval is short enough. This paper proposes a novel technology to acquire increment information with the cooperation of two types of sensor. Our technology is implemented by a high time resolution but low spatial resolution sensor cooperated with a high spatial resolution but low time resolution sensor. And observation of high resolution both spatial and time will be yielded easily with the increment information acquired. The paper describes the main algorithm of this technology and validates the feasibility with series of simulation experiments. Then we have a deep analysis about our method's robustness.	algorithm;experiment;image resolution;increment and decrement operators;simulation	Z. K. Peng;X. F.

This theory indicates that, when feasible, judicious selection of the type of distortion induced by measurement systems may dramatically improve our ability to perform image reconstruction. However, applying compressed sensing theory to practical imaging systems poses a key challenge: physical constraints typically make it infeasible to actually measure many of the random projections described in the literature, and therefore, innovative and sophisticated imaging systems must be carefully designed to effectively exploit CS theory. In video settings, the performance of an imaging system is characterized by both pixel resolution and field of view. In this work, we propose compressive imaging techniques for improving the performance of video imaging systems in the presence of constraints on the focal plane array size. In particular, we describe a novel yet practical approach that combines coded aperture imaging to enhance pixel resolution with superimposing subframes of a scene onto a single focal plane array to increase field of view. Specifically, the proposed method superimposes coded observations and uses wavelet-based sparsity recovery algorithms to reconstruct the original subframes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by reconstructing with high resolution the constituent images of a video sequence.	algorithm;aperture (software);code;coded aperture;compressed sensing;convolution;distortion;emoticon;focal (programming language);generative model;image resolution;iterative reconstruction;nonlinear system;pixel;random projection;simulation;sparse matrix;staring array;system of measurement;wavelet	Roummel F.

This resulted in the birth of Reflective, Anti-Reflective and Mean boundary conditions, which are all based on the idea of guaranteeing the continuity of the signal/image outside the boundary. Here we propose new boundary conditions that are obtained by suitably combining Taylor series and finite difference approximations. Moreover, we show that also Anti-Reflective and Mean boundary conditions can be attributed to the same framework. Numerical results show that, in case of low levels of noise and blurs able to perform a suitable smoothing effect on the original image (e.g. Gaussian blur), the proposed boundary conditions lead to a significant improvement of the restoration accuracy with respect to those available in the literature.	approximation;boundary case;circuit restoration;deblurring;display resolution;experiment;finite difference;gaussian blur;image noise;image restoration;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;numerical method;reflection (computer programming);scott continuity;smoothing;software framework	Pietro Dell'Acqua	2017	Adv.

Our previous work has observed that blurring increases kurtosis and introduced a new blur identification method based on kurtosis minimization (KM). In this letter, this observation has been studied using phase correlation. The KM method is compared with two other signal processing methods.

In this report we critically examine some of these techniques. Through a series of examples we show that none of the current mechanisms of disparity measurement are particularly robust. By considering some of the implications of disparity in the frequency domain, we present a new definition of disparity that is tied to the interocular phase difference in bandpass versions of the monocular images. Finally, we present a new technique for measuring disparity as the local phase difference between bandpass versions of the two images, and we show how this technique surmounts some of the difficulties encountered by current disparity detection mechanisms.	binocular disparity;system of measurement	Michael R.

Existing seam carving based object removal methods generally are time-consuming and oftentimes cause image distortion or cutting off many more seams than is necessary. In order to solve these limitations, our proposed method only considers the energy of all the pixels outside the target region. Firstly, based on the discontinuous seam carving, we calculate the energy map of both directions, up-down and bottom-up. Then we carve the seam respectively from the upper bound of the target region to up, from the lower bound of the target region to down and the middle part within the region. Experimental results prove that our proposed method outperform others in terms of efficiency and image quality significantly.	bottom-up parsing;clone tool;distortion;image quality;pixel;seam carving	Bo Yan;Yiqi Gao;Kairan Sun;Bo Yang	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738274	seam carving;computer vision;image processing;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	56.84384696678157	-61.439735169931275	31675

Our eyes cope with this vast range of intensities by adaptation; changing their sensitivity to be responsive at different illumination levels. This adaptation is highly localized, allowing us to see both dark and bright regions of a high dynamic range environment. In this paper we present a new model of eye adaptation based on physiological data. The model, which can be easily integrated into existing renderers, can function either as a static local tone mapping operator for single high dynamic range image, or as a temporal adaptation model taking into account time elapsed and intensity of preadaptation for a dynamic sequence. We finally validate our technique with a high dynamic range display and a psychophysical study.	eb-eye;high dynamic range;range imaging;tone mapping	Patrick Ledda;Luís Paulo Santos;Alan Chalmers	2004		10.1145/1029949.1029978	computer vision;tone mapping;computer science;adaptation;human visual system model;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	63.02058774403059	-59.660939657691564	31745

Estimates of different stand parameters, such as top tree height, were  derived using regression analysis and a segmentation approach on data obtained from small-footprint laser scan were contrasted  with the field measurements in 7 plots, specifically volume and basal area. Plots of 2,500m2 containing plantations of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Bong. Carr.) were scanned with two different point densities in years 2003 and 2004. These plots were divided into training and test  regions of 625 m2 each. Regression analysis was performed using percentiles corresponding to the canopy tree height at different vertical levels  and a segmentation method was used to delineate individual tree crowns where tree metrics can be determined. The bias of the  estimated values for the stand volume and basal area ranged from 1.21 to 6.49 m3ha-1 (0.17 to 0.92 %) and - 2.69 to 1.23 m2ha-1(- 3.9 to 1.7 %), respectively; and the bias calculated from the segmentation using 0.5 and 1m dataset ranged between - 349.77  to - 434.76 m3ha-1 (- 49.7 to - 61.8 %) for the stand volume and - 33.36 to - 42.24 m2ha-1 (- 48.5 to - 61.4 %) for the basal area. The results showed that the regression models estimated stand volume and basal more  accurately compared with values calculated from the segmentation. Furthermore, it is shown that there was no significant difference  in the estimates from the regression model when using different point densities.  		Michal Petr;Genevieve Patenaude;Juan C.

The salinity of the solution was varied from 1000 to 5000 parts per million. The measurements were first made in a rectangular waveguide. The phase velocity and attenuation of the electromagnetic wave propagating in the waveguide were measured, and from those the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity were calculated. The complex permittivity of the heated saline solution was also measured in a parallel-plate radial waveguide. Details of the measurement techniques, together with measured data, are presented. It is found that the high-frequency conductivity and dielectric constant predicted by an empirical formula agree with the measured data in the temperature range of 20 degrees to 40 degrees C.

ST-MAD employs spatiotemporal “images” (STS images [2]) created by taking time-based slices of the original and distorted videos. Motion artifacts manifest in the STS images as spatial artifacts, which allows one to quantify motion-based distortion by using classical image-quality assessment techniques. ST-MAD estimates motion-based distortion by applying MAD's appearance-based model to compare the distorted video's STS images to the original video's STS images. This comparison is further adjusted by using optical-flow-derived weights designed to give greater precedence to fast-moving regions located toward the center of the video. Testing on the LIVE video database demonstrates that ST-MAD performs well in predicting video quality.	algorithm;distortion;mad;optical flow;video	Phong V. Vu;Cuong T. Vu;Damon M.

15ac663677324fa0c352efd11f00efa5b488658c	massively parallel 3d image reconstruction		Computed Tomographic (CT) image reconstruction is an important technique used in a wide range of applications. Among reconstruction methods, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) is known to produce much higher quality CT images; however, the high computational requirements of MBIR greatly restrict their application. Currently, MBIR speed is primarily limited by irregular data access patterns, the difficulty of effective parallelization, and slow algorithmic convergence.  This paper presents a new algorithm for MBIR, the Non-Uniform Parallel Super-Voxel (NU-PSV) algorithm, that regularizes the data access pattern, enables massive parallelism, and ensures fast convergence. We compare the NU-PSV algorithm with two state-of-the-art implementations on a 69632-core distributed system. Results indicate that the NU-PSV algorithm has an average speedup of 1665 compared to the fastest state-of-the-art implementations.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;cpu cache;ct scan;computation;data access;distributed computing;electron;experiment;fastest;image quality;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;medical ultrasound;parallel computing;requirement;slime;sparse matrix;speedup;tomography;voxel	Xiao Wang;Amit Sabne;Putt Sakdhnagool;Sherman J.

Its planting terrain is complex and soil parent material is diverse. Currently, the citrus fertilization, irrigation and other management processes still have great blindness. They usually use the same pattern and the same formula rather than considering the orchard terrain features, soil differences, species characteristics and the state of tree growth. With the help of the ZigBee technology, artificial intelligence and decision support technology, this paper has developed the research on the application technology of agricultural Internet of Things for real-time monitoring of citrus soil moisture and nutrients as well as the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation decision support system. Some achievements were obtained including single-point multi-layer citrus soil temperature and humidity detection wireless sensor nodes and citrus precision fertilization and irrigation management decision support system. They were applied in citrus base in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The results showed that the system could help the grower to scientifically fertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level of citrus production, reduce the labor cost and reduce the pollution caused by chemical fertilizer.	achievement;artificial intelligence;cns disorder;citrus flavor;citrus plant;coupling (computer programming);deaf-blind disorders;decision making;decision support system;exposure to humidity;fertilization;fertilizers;internet of things;irrigation;knowledge bases;knowledge base;layer (electronics);national origin;numerous;nutrients;orchard;real-time transcription;reservoir device component;service layer;silo	Xueyan Zhang;Jianwu Zhang;Lin Li;Yuzhu Zhang;Guocai Yang	2017		10.3390/s17030447	fertilizer;sowing;engineering;decision support system;agriculture;irrigation;agronomy;orchard;water content;irrigation management;agroforestry	AI	84.01117821957176	-53.79398597318524	31868

However, owing to the complexity and unnecessary transformation, mathematic models are not good method to represent the variations of earth system phenomena. Grid-based models can overcome the shortcomings well. But the grid in used is not perfect enough. A three-dimensional (3D) Global Spatial Grid (GSG), named SDOG-ESSG, was adopted to represent the 3D and large-scale earth system phenomena. The models of variation representation was proposed, and the experiment on ionosphere was taken to prove the superiority of the methods.	3d computer graphics;earth system science;grid (spatial index)	Jieqing Yu;Lixin Wu;Liming He	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947143	geophysics;atmospheric sciences;earth science	EDA	87.81770362888119	-61.11310710377515	31937

Plant richness was measured at 44 sampling plots in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland. Several spectral indices, first-order statistics (median and standard deviation), and second-order statistics [metrics of a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)] were extracted from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image and a Pleiades 1B image. We selected the most important variables for predicting richness using recursive feature elimination and then built a model using random forest regression. The final model was based on only two textural variables obtained from the GLCM and derived from the Landsat 8 image. An accurate predictive capability was reported (R2 = 0.6; RMSE = 1.99 species), highlighting the possibility of obtaining parsimonious models using textural variables. In addition, the results showed that the mid-resolution Landsat 8 image provided better predictors of richness than the high-resolution Pleiades image. This is the first study to generate a model for plant richness in a wetland ecosystem.	algorithm;co-occurrence matrix;document-term matrix;ecosystem;emoticon;feature selection;first-order predicate;image resolution;image sensor;occam's razor;pleiades (supercomputer);radio frequency;random forest;recursion;sampling (signal processing)	Julian Cabezas;Mauricio Galleguillos;Jorge F.

The method performs frequency domain shrinkage on shape and dataadaptive patches. DA3D doesn’t process all the image samples, which allows it to use large patches (64× 64 pixels). The shape and data-adaptive patches are dynamically selected, effectively concentrating the computations on areas with more details, thus accelerating the process considerably. DA3D also reduces the staircasing artifacts sometimes present in smooth parts of the guide images. The effectiveness of DA3D is confirmed by extensive experimentation. DA3D improves the result of almost all state-of-the-art methods, and this improvement requires little additional computation time.

For those kinds of images, to some extent, the good enhancement effect can be obtained using the fuzzy sets-based image enhancement method instead of the traditional image enhancement approaches. The gray level maximum has not been changed in the classical fuzzy enhancement method proposed by S. K. Pal, so this method is not fit for the enhancement problem of degraded images with less gray levels and low contrasts; the fact that the range of membership function of gray levels is not normalization form, i.e. [0,1], is another disadvantage of the traditional fuzzy enhancement approach. To deal with the problems mentioned above, a generalized iterative fuzzy enhancement algorithm is proposed in this paper. A new image quality assessment criterion is suggested on the basis of the statistical features of the gray-level histogram of images to control the iterative procedure of the proposed image enhancement algorithm. Computer simulation results showed that this new enhancement method is more suitable than fuzzy enhancement and gray-level transformation for handling the enhancement problems of images with less gray levels and low contrasts.	image editing	Dongliang Peng;An-ke Xue	2005		10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571414	computer simulation;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;fuzzy set	Robotics	55.944887246205475	-64.06907226091367	31997

The optimal estimation of the NOE, however, is a quite challenging task, due to the inevitable combined presence of noise and outliers. In the last decade, several algorithms have been proposed to estimate the exact NOE. Nonetheless, these methods usually lead to different values for intrinsic dimensionality. These uncertainties make the user unable to determine the right intrinsic dimension. This letter proposes a statistical based method for finding the NOE in hyperspectral imagery. In the first step of this method, a number of candidates are selected using the residual analysis and change-point analysis. Then, according to application, one of these candidates can be selected. For this selection, here, an intrinsic dimensionality estimator, based on the singular value decomposition (SVD), is used to make this selection. Based on a comparison with second moment linear and outlier-geometry based estimation of NOE-affine hull (O-GENE-AH), the proposed method yields better results.	algorithm;cluster analysis;dimensionality reduction;image noise;intrinsic dimension;singular value decomposition	Amin Alizadeh Naeini;Saeid Homayouni;Mohammad Saadatseresht	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2014.2317352	computer vision;entropy;estimation;hyperspectral imaging;pattern recognition;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Vision	69.05419906539358	-67.8442882857295	32096

Real-life image data are always imprecise due to inherent uncertainties that may arise from the imaging process such as defocusing, illumination changes, noise, etc. Therefore, the localization and detection of corners has become a difficult task to accomplish under such imperfect situations. On the other hand, Fuzzy systems are well known for their efficient handling of impreciseness and incompleteness, which make them inherently suitable for modelling corner properties by means of a rule-based fuzzy system. The paper presents a corner detection algorithm which employs such fuzzy reasoning. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is compared to well-known conventional corner detectors and its performance is also tested over a number of benchmark images to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm under uncertainty.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;automation;benchmark (computing);corner detection;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;harris affine region detector;logic programming;mark harris (programmer);real-time clock;sensor;soft computing	Erik Valdemar Cuevas Jiménez;Daniel Zaldivar;Marco A.

We propose in this paper a dual-model approach to blind or no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) of noisy images through differentiating near-threshold and suprathreshold noise conditions. The underlying assumption for the proposed dual-model method is that for images with low level near-threshold noise, HVS tries to gauge the strength of the noise, so the image quality can be well approximated via measuring strength of the noise. And for images with their contents overwhelmed by high level suprathreshold noise, the HVS tries to recover meaningful structure from the noisy pixels using past experiences and prior knowledge encoded into an internal generative model of the brain. So image quality is closely related to the agreement between the noisy observation and the internal generative model explainable part of the image. More specifically, under the near-threshold noise condition, a noise level estimation algorithm based on natural image statistics is used, while under suprathreshold condition, an active inference model based on the free energy principle is adopted. The near-and suprathreshold models can be seamlessly integrated through a transformation between both estimates. The proposed dual-model algorithm has been tested on additive Gaussian noise contaminated images. Experimental results and comparative studies suggest that although being a no-reference approach, the proposed algorithm has prediction accuracy comparable to some of the best full-reference (FR) IQA methods.	approximation algorithm;behavioral pattern;distortion;extensibility;free energy principle;generative model;high-level programming language;human visual system model;image quality;noise (electronics);noise reduction;performance;pixel;scene statistics;utility functions on indivisible goods	Guangtao Zhai;André Kaup;Jia Wang;Xiaokang Yang	2013	2013 Picture Coding Symposium (PCS)	10.1109/PCS.2013.6737675	gradient noise;gaussian noise;median filter;image noise;computer vision;speech recognition;value noise;image processing;computer science;noise measurement;pattern recognition;salt-and-pepper noise	ML	59.904885988036014	-65.36884766797998	32309

Experiments indicate that the inclusion of characteristics of the human visual system into the objective metric, such as visual attention, improves the evaluation. This paper presents a new approach to evaluate the video quality based on an estimate of the local visual attention, using the structural similarity index. This approach is compared with three classical objective metrics: PSNR, SSIM and MS-SSIM, by means of the Pearson linear and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients. The videos are submitted to several types of distortions, such as blocking, blurring and salt & pepper noise. The results indicate that the proposed approach presents good correlation with the subjective scores, for videos that contain blurring and blocking degradations.	algorithm;blocking (computing);coefficient;distortion;experiment;gaussian blur;human visual system model;ms-dos;peak signal-to-noise ratio;salt (cryptography);salt-and-pepper noise;semantic similarity;structural similarity;video	Carlos Danilo Miranda Regis;José Vinícius de Miranda Cardoso;Marcelo Sampaio de Alencar	2012		10.1145/2382636.2382654	subjective video quality;computer vision;simulation;computer science;video quality;structural similarity;multimedia;human visual system model	Vision	62.40714829939452	-64.14493595144023	32466
8a34e7a1fcc3925f8703ebfa80312999bb0cf811	exploring the capability of compact polarimetry (hybrid pol) c band risat-1 data for land cover classification		"""Compact Polarimetry has gained significant importance in recent years among other earth observation missions due to its low power consumption, simple architecture, and larger swath width. For space-based SAR systems, these parameters are vital to monitor the earth surface continuously for various applications. The main manifestations of Hybrid polarimetry from fully polarimetric systems is transmitting a circular polarization and receiving in linear polarizations. In this paper, we assess the performance of compact polarimetry (hybrid polarimetry) over dual-pol RISAT-1 data for land cover classification over various ground targets using backscattered coefficient values, degree of polarization, and relative phase values. In order to understand the scattering mechanism of the targets, Raney decomposition, Pseudo Three Component decomposition, m-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\delta $ </tex-math></inline-formula> and m-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\chi $ </tex-math></inline-formula> decompositions were performed on the SAR datasets. The m-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\chi $ </tex-math></inline-formula> decomposition has proven to be robust when transmitting component is not perfectly circularly polarized. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier algorithm was used to classify the datasets. Three datasets (viz. RISAT-1 hybrid-pol data, RISAT-1 dual-pol data, and Resourcesat-2 data) were evaluated with SVM classifier and compared using three different kernel parameters, i.e. radial basis function (RBF), Polynomial with degree ‘2’ and Linear. From this paper, it was observed that the SVM with RBF kernel parameter gave highest Overall Accuracy (OA) of 92.34% for hybrid Pol RISAT-1 data. Similarly, the SVM with RBF kernel parameter gave an overall accuracy (OA) of 76.83% for dual-pol RISAT-1 data. SVM has classified the datasets into four classes viz. Urban, Water, Vegetation, and Bare soil. The evaluation of classified datasets were performed using confusion matrix for accuracy assessment. For validating the results, the classified image is compared with the optical imagery of Resourcesat-2 (LISS IV) sensor, Google Earth, and In-situ information that was collected synchronous to the satellite pass on July 5, 2016."""	algorithm;circular polarization;coefficient;confusion matrix;degree of polarization;google earth;polarimetry;polynomial;radial (radio);radial basis function kernel;support vector machine;transmitter;viz: the computer game	Kiran Dasari;Anjaneyulu Lokam	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2873348	support vector machine;architecture;kernel (linear algebra);distributed computing;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar;computer science;artificial intelligence;degree of polarization;radial basis function kernel;confusion matrix;pattern recognition	Vision	78.9715412951459	-58.60335768752714	32481

We scan the model in image order, averaging the pixel footprint values. The technique samples all, but only, the visible parts. It improves previous texture mapping methods that ignore selfoccluded footprints. It is superior to super-sampling. The image quality is assessed in both spatial and temporal domains. The good precision of the sampling process in the spatial domain provides an alias-free temporal domain.

We call the arrangement of delta functions the structural component of the mask, and use it to efficiently encode scene distance information. We illustrate the potential of our approach by analyzing a family of masks defined by a circular hole component and a structural component consisting of a linear combination of three Dirac deltas. We show that the structural component transitions from well conditioned to ill conditioned as the relative weight of the central peak varies with respect to the lateral ones. For the well-conditioned structural components, deconvolution is efficiently performed by inverse filtering, allowing for fast estimation of scene depth. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by constructing a mask for distance coding and using it to recover pairs of distance maps and structurally-deconvolved images from single photographs. For this application, we obtain significant speedup, and extended range and depth resolution compared to previous techniques."""	aperture (software);coded aperture;condition number;convolution;deconvolution;delta encoding;dirac delta function;encode;inverse filter;lateral thinking;map;speedup;structural element;variable shadowing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Horacio E.

Based on in-situ measured corn-related three-dimensional structure parameters during various growth stages, simulation databases of corn LAI and optical depth in L-band were established. A quantitative relationship between corn GVWC, corn optical depth in L-band, corn LAI, height and areal density of the corn stalks was constructed based on the simulation databases. The corn optical depth in this quantitative relationship was calculated by the retrieval method of low-vegetation optical depth proposed by Wang et al. We used Polarimetric L-band Microwave Radiometer (PLMR) airborne data obtained in the 2012 Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) project, and the leaf area index (LAI) product of LAINet wireless network to retrieve the GVWC of corn in study area. In-situ measured corn GVWC were used to validate the accuracy of the retrieved corn GVWC. The results show that the GVWC retrieval method proposed in this study is feasible for monitoring corn GVWC in real time.

We have shown newly that the solution for the ground wave propagation in a standard atmosphere can be obtained directly from the solution for the surface duct problem by applying the analytic continuation from the negative equivalent radius of curvature of the earth to the positive one. Through the theoretical and experimental studies, it is confirmed that the radio wave propagating over the sea in the land-to-sea mixed-paths is enhanced by the recovery effect. It is clarified that the ground wave is also enhanced in the surface duct in a long range propagation.

We define art patterns as the subset of line drawings and digital arts that are comprised of repeated elements. There exist textures that share characteristics with art patterns. Examples of such textures include piled discrete elements with curved contours. Inspired by recent success of exemplar-based texture synthesis, in this paper, we focus on synthesizing art patterns and textures with curvilinear features from exemplars, which we cast as a global optimization problem. Our energy function for this problem measures both the appearance similarity of color patterns and shape similarity of curvilinear features between an input exemplar and a synthesized image. We develop an overall expectation-maximization-style algorithm for minimizing this energy function. The shape similarity part of the energy is minimized through an innovative application of the level set method. We further generalize our energy function and optimization algorithm to multilayer pattern and texture synthesis. Our generalized optimization can effectively handle multiple layers and synthesize valid instances of interaction.	computation (action);drawings (art);edge detection;entity name part qualifier - adopted;exhibits as topic;expectation–maximization algorithm;global optimization;image segmentation;interaction;interactivity;large;line drawing algorithm;map;mathematical optimization;obstruction;optimization problem;parallel computing;scott continuity;signature;subgroup;texture mapping;texture synthesis;anatomical layer;biologic segmentation	Ruobing Wu;Wenping Wang;Yizhou Yu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics	10.1109/TVCG.2013.113	image texture;computer vision;digital art;shape;level set;mathematics;texture synthesis;level set method;set theory;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	56.193687515933284	-61.89191662689925	32812

The concurrent prevalence of handheld cameras creates a novel opportunity to use cameras and displays as communication channels. The electronic display in this channel serves a twofold purpose: to display an image to humans while simultaneously transmitting hidden bits for decoding by a camera. Unlike standard digital watermarking, the message recovery in camera-display systems requires physics-based modeling of image formation in order to optically communicate hidden messages in real world scenes. By modeling the photometry of the system using a camera-display transfer function (CDTF), we show that this function depends on camera pose and varies spatially over the display.We devise a radiometric calibration to handle the nonlinearities of both the display and the camera, and we use this method for recovering video messages hidden within display images. Results are for 9 different display-camera systems for messages with 4500 bits. Message accuracy improves significantly with calibration and we achieve accuracy near 99% in our experiments, independent of the type of camera or display used.	digital watermarking;display device;experiment;handheld game console;image formation;interactive kiosk;metric;support vector machine;thresholding (image processing);transfer function;transmitter	Wenjia Yuan;Kristin J.

Recently, a two-step method with two energy functions has been introduced to alleviate the staircase effect successfully. In the two-step method, firstly, the normal vector of noisy image is smoothed, and then the image is reconstructed from the smoothed normal field. In this paper, we propose a new image restoration model with only one energy function. When the alternating direction method is used, the estimation of the vector field and the reconstruction of the image are interlaced, which makes the new vector field can utilize sufficiently the information of the restored image, thus the constructed vector field is more accurate than that generated by the two-step method. To speed up the computation, the dual approach and split Bregman are employed in our numerical algorithm. The experimental results show that the new model is more effective to filter out the Gaussian noise than the state-of-the-art models.		Jianlou Xu;Xiangchu Feng;Yan Hao	2014	Multidim. Syst. Sign.

Theoretical analysis shows that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the reflected echoes from the observed scene is too low to use the conventional detect method. According to the cross-correlation between the echoes of adjacent pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and M-out-of-N (M/N) detection, a reflected echo detect method is proposed in this paper. This method can realize the accumulation of signal energy and enormously improve the performance of beam footprint detection. Mean-while, vehicle-based equivalent validation experiment is performed. Experiment results show that the proposed method can be well used for real-time transmitter's beam footprint detection.	cross-correlation;primitive recursive function;real-time clock;signal-to-noise ratio;synthetic data;transmitter;tree accumulation	Feifei Yan;Wenge Chang;Xiangyang Li	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730088	synchronization;transmitter;continuous-wave radar;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;radar lock-on;telecommunications;computer science;passive radar;bistatic radar;pulse repetition frequency;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;backscatter;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	75.71516760932198	-65.9236456681254	32893

The TLM models forest as two scattering levels, namely, ground and vegetation, separated by a distance Δh and with area-weighted backscatter ratio μ. The model is evaluated using eight VV-polarized bistatic-interferometric TanDEM-X image pairs acquired in the summers of 2011, 2012, and 2013 over the managed hemi-boreal test site Remningstorp, which is situated in southern Sweden. Ground phase is removed using a highresolution digital terrain model. Inverted TLM parameters for thirty-two 0.5-ha plots of four different types (regular plots, sparse plots, seed trees, and clear-cuts) are studied against reference lidar data. It is concluded that the level distance Δh can be used as an estimate of the 50th percentile forest height estimated from lidar (for regular plots: r > 0.95 and root-mean-square difference (σ) <; 10%, or 1.8 m). Moreover, the uncorrected area fill factor n0 = 1/(1 + μ) can be used as an estimate of the vegetation ratio, which is a canopy density estimate defined as the fraction of lidar returns coming from the canopy to all lidar returns (for regular plots: r > 0.59 and σ ≈ 10%, or 0.07).	coefficient;digital elevation model;fill factor (image sensor);motorola canopy;situated;solar cell;sparse matrix;verification and validation	Maciej J.

Moreover upon over-segments evaluation, an efficient approach is developed for dense stereo matching through robust higher-order MRFs and graph cut based optimization, which combines the conventional data and smoothness terms with the robust higher-order potential term. The experimental results on real-scene data sets clearly demonstrate that our over-segment-based higher-order stereo matching approach outperforms conventional stereo matching algorithms, as well as how over-segments improve the stereo matching process.	algorithm;binocular disparity;computer stereo vision;cut (graph theory);graph cuts in computer vision;loss function;mathematical optimization;reference frame (video)	Yiran Xie;Rui Cao;Hanyang Tong;Sheng Liu;Nianjun Liu	2010	2010 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications	10.1109/DICTA.2010.50	computer vision;higher-order logic;cut;shape;computer science;stereopsis;graph theory;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;image segmentation;markov process;brightness;pixel;robustness	Vision	54.468389329106465	-57.19776992894874	32985

SSPX solves small and large deformation problems, in either the undeformed (Lagrangian) or deformed (Eulerian) configuration. The program offers several options to compute strain: best fit for all or selected data, strain at a point, strain at stations, Delaunay, grid-nearest neighbor, and grid-distance weighted. Except for the strain at stations option in 3D, the program computes the strain on a surface that is either flat (slice) or that follows the topography of the data. In the case of a slice and in 3D, the location and orientation of the slice can be varied to visualize the strain along horizontal or vertical east–west, north–south sections. SSPX plots strain in a 2D view (3D strain is displayed as stereonets). We show the application of the program to GPS data, analogue and DEM mechanical simulations. & 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

c4c5318f942559588f139b5a077f684e1a5707e1	a new variational model in texture space for pansharpening		In this letter, a new variational model in texture space for pansharpening is proposed to increase spatial information of multispectral image, while preserving spectral and spatial consistencies of pansharpened image. Geometric structure consistency between panchromatic image and pansharpened image is very important for preserving spatial characteristics, especially in borders, edges, and textured regions. G-norm can extract more pure and accurate texture, curvature, and oscillating details than do previous first-order and second-order-based methods, such as Gradient and Hessian operators. Therefore, we aim to use the G-space to maintain spatial information. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a better performance in terms of both spatial and spectral qualities; however, it is not efficient in terms of computation time.	algorithm;calculus of variations;computation;first-order predicate;gsc bus;gradient;hessian;mathematical optimization;multispectral image;texture mapping;time complexity;variational principle;xs (perl)	Meysam Lotfi;Hassan Ghassemian	2018	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2018.2836951	mathematics;operator (computer programming);artificial intelligence;computer vision;curvature;panchromatic film;multispectral image;spatial analysis;hessian matrix;distortion;image resolution	Vision	54.30656710379557	-70.16290014359168	33019
daede065500b39468846a36e1433bffc0d87016d	spatial distortion prediction system for stereoscopic images	distortion;cameras	We propose a system to calculate the spatial distortion in 3-D images based on the shooting, display, and viewing conditions. It can be used to predict the extent of the perceived puppet-theater effect and the cardboard effect. The magnitude of the spatial distor- tion and the extent of the puppet-theater and cardboard effects are displayed using a space grid whose size can be estimated based on the objects' depths, calculated from the binocular parallax of the acquired stereoscopic images. This system can also be used to predict excessive binocular parallax and excessive parallax distribu- tion. Several cases in which puppet-theater and cardboard effects are expected to be produced are presented. We also demonstrate how the proposed system might be used to predict ratings of natu- ralness and quality of depth. © 2006 SPIE and	distortion;stereoscopy	Kenichiro Masaoka;Atsuo Hanazato;Masaki Emoto;Hirokazu Yamanoue;Yuji Nojiri;Fumio Okano	2006	J.

Since the very first interferometric acquisitions, the Integrated TanDEM-X Processor (ITP) delivered operationally “Raw”-DEMs and complex products of mono- and bistatic data. The RawDEMs are scenes of about 50 km × 30 km, generated for a dedicated DEM Mosaicking and Calibration Processor (MCP) which produces the final DEM. The so-called Coregistered Single-look Slant-range Complex (CoSSC) products are provided for each of these scenes in different flavors for production internal purposes and system performance monitoring as well as for scientific use. The capabilities of the ITP go far beyond the primary mission objective of DEM generation alone: it also provides the operationally available end-user products from different experimental modes as e.g. pursuit monostatic, dual polarization bistatic data, alternating bistatic in single and dual polarization and different bistatic and alternating bistatic spotlight modes. This paper focuses on the accuracy of the generated products, the ITPs contribution to the achieved accuracy of the data and the direct effect of it on the use and interpretation of RawDEM heights for temporal change detection. Also the basic characteristics of the operational experimental products are introduced..	dbpedia;digital elevation model;image stitching	Thomas Fritz;Helko Breit;Cristian Rossi;Ulrich Balss;Marie Lachaise;Sergi Duque	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351133	computer vision;radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;digital elevation model;geology;bistatic radar;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;optics;radar imaging;remote sensing	Embedded	79.79899514829664	-63.75021752997303	33087

Besides tablet's shape, size and colour, additional visual features such as tablet imprints are necessary for unique identification and, at the same time, the tablets should comply with the high visual quality standards. We focused on visual quality inspection of imprinted tablets by means of automated image analysis that requires registration of tablet images. Three different registration methods, based on direct matching of pixel intensities, principal axes matching, and circular profile matching, were compared on a large image database comprising various types of tablets. The circular profile matching method proved to be a powerful image analysis tool for improving visual quality inspection of imprinted tablets in real-time.	image analysis;pixel;real-time clock;tablet computer	Ziga Spiclin;Marko Bukovec;Franjo Pernus;Bostjan Likar	2007	2007 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (EFTA 2007)	10.1109/EFTA.2007.4416881	computer vision;image analysis;inspection;computer science;image registration;data mining;engineering drawing	Vision	57.827588545900205	-53.096085627985694	33130

Moreover, the conventional single-baseline PU method is restricted to the phase continuity assumption, so it cannot work correctly in the case that phase jumps between adjacent pixels are larger than π. To effectively solve this problem, multibaseline PU is put forward. The performance of conventional multibaseline PU methods is directly related to the noise level. In order to improve noise robustness, a cluster analysis (CA) based noise-robust PU algorithm for multibaseline interferograms (CANOPUS) is proposed in this paper, which is the extension and improvement of the CA-based efficient multibaseline PU algorithm proposed by H. Yu. For the sake of overcoming the disadvantages of the CA method, the dimension of the recognizable mathematical pattern is expanded. Under this condition, due to the density discrimination in spatial space, different clusters are able to be distinguished by the density-based clustering algorithm, and clusters are regarded as a set of density-connected patterns. Compared with the conventional CA method, the significant advantage of the new algorithm is that it improves noise robustness. What is more, the proposed algorithm runs in linear time. From the experiment results, it can be seen that the proposed method may be effectively applied to multibaseline InSAR data sets.	algorithm;aperture (software);baseline (configuration management);cathode ray tube;cluster analysis;dbscan;ibm systems network architecture;instantaneous phase;noise (electronics);one-class classification;phase noise;pixel;scott continuity;synthetic data;time complexity;visual intercept	Huitao Liu;Meng-dao Xing;Zheng Bao	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2014.2324595	computer vision;optics;inverse synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing	EDA	73.47241896710082	-65.82776145837599	33285

The 2-D tomographic approach here presented combines a linear inverse scattering model, based on the Kirchhoff approximation, with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique. In particular, FDTD is exploited to evaluate the incident field and Green's function in noncanonical scenarios, so that the kernel of the linear integral equation is completely built. After, an inversion scheme based on the truncated singular value decomposition is applied to obtain a regularized solution of the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields well-focused images free of multipath ghosts, thus allowing to discriminate the actual target position. Moreover, it permits to highlight the capabilities offered by multipath exploitation such as improved crossrange resolution and detection of targets in the non-line-of-sight region of the radar.	algorithm;approximation;finite-difference time-domain method;inter-protocol exploitation;kernel (operating system);kirchhoff's theorem;line-of-sight (missile);mahdiyar;multipath propagation;numerical method;radar;singular value decomposition;software propagation;tomography	Gianluca Gennarelli;Francesco Soldovieri	2013	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2012.2230314	mathematical optimization;mathematics;optics;radar imaging;singular value decomposition;remote sensing	Robotics	74.84226874077065	-68.81807297396922	33288

This salience metric guides a contrast adjustment process to enhance the perceived grayscale in the final output with a two-steps conversion. Experimental results show that our algorithm produces pleasing results for a variety of color images and we further extend the Channel Salience to edge detection.	algorithm;coherence (physics);coherent information;color image;computation;edge detection;filter design;google map maker;grayscale;software propagation	Wei Zhu;Ruizhen Hu;Ligang Liu	2013	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-013-0854-9	computer vision	Vision	58.48219173050496	-62.85707479319663	33291
60d37d26bba217b6425c5f1a38de4145f8c2fa06	potentials and limits of super-resolution algorithms and signal reconstruction from sparse data		A common distortion in videos is image instability in the form of chaotic global and local displacements of image frames caused by camera instability, fluctuations in the refraction index of the light propagation media and similar factors. Such videos that very frequently present moving objects on a stable background contain tremendous redundancy that potentially can be used for image stabilization and perfecting provided reliable separation of stable background from true moving objects. Recently, it was proposed to use this redundancy for resolution enhancement of video through elastic registration, with subpixel accuracy, of segments of video frames which represent stable scenes. The present work is aimed at studying the potentials and limitations of such a resolution enhancement. The work consists of two parts. The first part investigates, by means of computer simulation, the influence on the degree of the achievable resolution enhancement such imaging parameters as the camera fill factor, of intensity of fluctuations of pixel displacements and of the number of image frames used for fusion. The essential part of the process of resolution enhancement is signal reconstruction from sparse data accumulated from the set of randomly displaced image frames. Therefore the second part of the work addresses the theory of discrete signal reconstruction from sparse data. Using the discrete sampling theorem, it is shown that given a finite number of sparse image samples one can reconstruct a band-limited, in terms of a selected basis, approximation of the signal with minimal mean squared error. Limitation imposed by different bases to the positions of available sparse signal samples to secure optimal restoration are analyzed and it is shown that low pass band-limited in DFT basis functions can be precisely reconstructed from their arbitrary placed sparse samples. These results are then extended to image reconstruction from limited number of projections or from projections with partly lost samples. POTENTIALS AND LIMITS OF SUPER-RESOLUTION FROM MULTIPLE VIDEO FRAMES For investigating the potentials and resolution of the SR algorithm, a computer simulation program was built. The program’s block diagram is presented in Fig. 1. The algorithm for super-resolution from multiple frames is presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 illustrates simulation results of super-resolution.

In order to obtain a high quality interpolation, the motion field between frames must be well-estimated. However, many current techniques for determining the motion are prone to errors in occlusion regions, as well as regions with repetitive structure. An algorithm is proposed for improving both the objective and subjective quality of MCFI by refining the motion vector field. A Discriminant Saliency classifier is employed to determine regions of the motion field which are most important to a human observer. These regions are refined using a multi-stage motion vector refinement which promotes candidates based on their likelihood given a local neighborhood. For regions which fall below the saliency threshold, frame segmentation is used to locate regions of homogeneous color and texture via Normalized Cuts. Motion vectors are promoted such that each homogeneous region has a consistent motion. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over previous methods in both objective and subjective picture quality.	algorithm;discriminant;display resolution;image quality;image segmentation;motion field;motion interpolation;refinement (computing)	Natan Jacobson;Yen-Lin Lee;Vijay Mahadevan;Nuno Vasconcelos;Truong Q.

This approach is based on three main steps: (1) controlled preprocessing based on adaptive filtering (despeckling); (2) comparison between multitemporal images according to a proper operator; (3) automatic thresholding of the log-ratio image. The first step aims at reducing the speckle noise in a controlled way in order to maximize the separability between changed and unchanged classes. The second step is devoted to compare the two filtered images in order to generate a log-ratio image. Finally, the third step deals with the identification of changes by thresholding the log-ratio image according to a novel technique. Such a technique is based on the double thresholding Kittler & Illingworth (K&I) algorithm, which is reformulated under the Generalized Gaussian (GG) assumption for the changed and unchanged classes. Experimental results obtained on a multitemporal SAR data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	adaptive filter;algorithm;friedrich kittler;gadu-gadu;iteration;linear separability;noise reduction;preprocessor;thresholding (image processing);unsupervised learning	Yakoub Bazi;Lorenzo Bruzzone;Farid Melgani	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1368681	adaptive filter;computer vision;optics;statistics;remote sensing	Robotics	71.39282323224074	-63.527942470691634	33334
c37cd50396b5595f4e13d10f4293075c8bb4aae8	how sensitive is a vineyard crop model to the uncertainty of its runoff module?		Abstract Many crop models use the NRCS Curve Number method to estimate runoff, but the simplified assumptions of this method are rarely considered in model uncertainty assessments. The associated uncertainty may be high for cropping systems with a significant part of bare soil like vineyards, specifically under a Mediterranean climate. In this work, we evaluate for a vineyard crop model the structure uncertainty coming from its uncertain runoff module. We introduce a new method based on additional knowledge about the runoff process and on a mathematical property of the model structure. Situations characterized in terms of soil water content and mean runoff conditions are studied for two applications of the vineyard model and guidelines for model users are derived. This work shows that uncertainty quantification can benefit from the knowledge of mathematical properties of a model and provide clear guidelines to model users.	typset and runoff	Sébastien Roux	2017	Environmental Modelling and Software	10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.07.001	hydrology;uncertainty quantification;runoff curve number;soil science;crop;runoff model;computer science;soil water;surface runoff;vineyard	SE	85.85115620991715	-57.35718835620277	33347

It is motivated by combining Gaussian blurring, the Mean Curvature Motion (used for denoising and edge-preserving), and maximal blurring (used for inpainting). We investigate the generalised method using the combination of second order derivatives in terms of gauge coordinates. For the qualitative behaviour, we derive a solution of the PDE series and mention its properties briefly. Relations with general diffusion equations are discussed. Quantitative results are obtained by a novel implementation whose stability and convergence is analysed. The practical results are visualised on a real-life image, showing the expected qualitative behaviour. When a constraint is added that penalises the distance of the results to the input image, one can vary the desired amount of blurring and denoising.	control theory;deblurring;gaussian blur;geographic coordinate system;image processing;inpainting;maximal set;noise reduction;numerical stability;real life;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Arjan Kuijper	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-76386-4_21	computer vision;diffusion equation;mathematical optimization;image processing;computer science;mathematics;geometry;second-order logic	Vision	53.806715398051765	-70.57920907627631	33409
b6f1a831fe837e501ce490695bcd2713816b02b0	automatic crater detection and age estimation for mare regions on the lunar surface		In this paper, we investigate how well an automatic crater detection algorithm is suitable to determine the surface age of different lunar regions. A template-based crater detection algorithm is used to analyze image data under known illumination conditions. For this purpose, artificially illuminated crater templates are used to detect and count craters and their diameters in the areas under investigation. The automatic detection results are used to obtain the crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) for the examined areas, which is then used for estimating the absolute model age (AMA) of the surface. The main focus of this work is to find out whether there exists an ideal sensitivity value for automatic crater detection to obtain smallest possible errors between the automatically derived AMA and a reference AMA derived from manually detected craters. The detection sensitivity threshold of our crater detection algorithm (CDA) is calibrated based on five different regions in Mare Cognitum on the Moon such that the age inferred from the manual crater counts corresponds to the age inferred from the CDA results. The obtained best detection threshold value is used to apply the CDA algorithm to another five regions in the lunar Oceanus Procellarum region. The accuracy of the method is examined by comparing the calculated AMAs with the manually determined ones from the literature. It is shown that the automatic age estimation yields AMA values that are generally consistent with the reference values with respect to the one standard deviation errors.	.cda file;algorithm;automatic control;moon	Atheer L.

Since the selected areas in the source and target images are not homogenous which means they contain texture information, most of the previous methods in the literature depending on the Poisson equation cause occurrence of adverse effects such as blur or color leakage in the processed region. The proposed method does not cause those artifacts in most cases but it makes an improvement and minimizes the artifacts. The visual results also prove that the method is promising.	artifact (software development);gaussian blur;interactive digital photomontage;spectral leakage	Bekir Dizdaroglu	2013	2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2013.6531333	image texture;computer vision;computer science;poisson's equation;mathematics;geometry	Vision	56.51289823946239	-61.80284882959977	33468

Rain produces complex time varying intensity fluctuations in images or videos, which seriously reduce the performance of outdoor vision systems. Due to similar visual appearances of rain and moving objects, the current rain removal algorithms cannot easily distinguish between the two. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for rain detection and removal based on the rain image formation model and edge-preserving filtering. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated in comparison with the existing approaches, by experimenting on videos of intricate scenes with moving objects or time-varying textures.	algorithm;autostereogram;closed-circuit television;display resolution;edge enhancement;experiment;image formation;pixel;video	Qingsong Zhu;Ling Shao;Pheng-Ann Heng;Xuelong Li	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2013.6739519	computer vision;simulation;edge detection;computer science;remote sensing	Robotics	57.97202392709332	-57.02243958563125	33497

While many fast global illumination solutions have been proposed, all of them work under limiting assumptions on the materials and lighting in the scene. In the presence of many glossy (directionally scattering) materials, fast solutions either fail or degenerate to inefficient, brute-force simulations of the underlying light transport. In particular, many-light algorithms are able to provide fast approximations by clamping elements of the light transport matrix, but they eliminate the part of the transport that contributes to accurate glossy appearance. In this paper we introduce a solution that separately solves for the global (low-rank, dense) and local (highrank, sparse) illumination components. For the low-rank component we introduce visibility clustering and approximation, while for the high-rank component we introduce a local light technique to correct for the missing illumination. Compared to competing techniques we achieve superior gloss rendering in minutes, making our technique suitable for applications such as industrial design and architecture, where material appearance is critical.

3cc8dfbc3aaec6fa15985fdd77f2a7754ee9c0c5	characterizing cropland phenology in major grain production areas of russia, ukraine, and kazakhstan by the synergistic use of passive microwave and visible to near infrared data	growing degree days;land surface phenology;microwave;ndvi;evi	We demonstrate the synergistic use of surface air temperature retrieved from AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on Earth observing satellite) and two vegetation indices (VIs) from the shorter wavelengths of MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to characterize cropland phenology in the major grain production areas of Northern Eurasia from 2003–2010. We selected 49 AMSR-E pixels across Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan, based on MODIS land cover percentage data. AMSR-E air temperature growing degree-days (GDD) captures the weekly, monthly, and seasonal oscillations, and well correlated with station GDD. A convex quadratic (CxQ) model that linked thermal time measured as growing degree-days to accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) was fitted to each pixel’s time series yielding high coefficients of determination (0.88 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.98). Deviations of observed GDD from the CxQ model predicted GDD by site corresponded to peak VI for negative residuals (period of higher latent heat flux) and low VI at beginning and end of growing season for positive residuals (periods of higher sensible heat flux). Modeled thermal time to peak, i.e., AGDD at peak GDD, showed a strong inverse linear trend with respect to latitude with r2 of 0.92 for Russia and Kazakhstan and 0.81 for Ukraine. MODIS VIs tracked similar seasonal responses in time and space and were highly correlated across the growing season with r2 > 0.95. Sites at lower latitude (≤49◦N) that grow winter and spring grains showed either a bimodal growing season or a shorter unimodal winter growing season with substantial inter-annual variability, whereas sites at higher latitude (≥56◦N) where spring grains are cultivated exhibited shorter, unimodal growing seasons. Sites between these extremes exhibited longer unimodal growing seasons. At some sites there were shifts between unimodal and bimodal patterns over the study period. Regional heat waves that devastated grain production in 2007 in Ukraine and in 2010 in Russia and Kazakhstan appear clearly anomalous. Microwave based surface air temperature data holds great promise to extend to parts of the planet where the land surface is frequently obscured by clouds, smoke, or aerosols, and where routine meteorological observations are sparse or absent.	coefficient;game design document;heart rate variability;microwave;pixel;sparse matrix;synergy;thermal time hypothesis;time series	Woubet G.

The major noise sources, in terms of distributions, are Gaussian noise and Poisson noise. Noise acquired by images during transmission would be Gaussian in distribution, while images such as emission and transmission tomography images, X-ray films, and photographs taken by satellites are usually contaminated by quantum noise, which is Poisson distributed. Poisson shot noise is a natural generalization of a compound Poisson process when the summands are stochastic processes starting at the points of the underlying Poisson process. Unlike additive Gaussian noise, Poisson noise is signal-dependent and separating signal from noise is a difficult task. In our previous papers we discussed a wavelet-based maximum likelihood for Bayesian estimator that recovers the signal component of wavelet coefficients in original images using an alpha-stable signal prior distribution. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the method can be extended to multi-noise sources comprising both Gaussian and Poisson distributions. Results of varying the parameters of the Bayesian estimators of the model are presented after an investigation of a-stable simulations for a maximum likelihood estimator. As an example, a colour image is processed and presented to illustrate our discussion.	coefficient;color image;quantum noise;shot noise;simulation;stiff equation;stochastic process;tomography;utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet	Xu Huang;Allan C.

Although a conventional video coding standard is used to compress the 3-D video such as multi-view plus depth data, it often introduces serious coding artifacts around object boundaries where signal abruptly changes in color and depth images. In this paper, to suppress the coding artifacts around object boundaries in compressed depth map, a depth boundary reconstruction method is proposed by using the similarity between a target pixel and its adjacent pixels. Since the proposed method provides the improved quality of synthesized view, it is used as in-loop for improving 3-D video coding performance. In addition, the depth down/up-sampling coding approaches are used to further reduce the bit-rates. To verify the excellence of the proposed method, it was applied to compress the multi-view plus depth data which is well-known as an efficient data format for representing the 3-D video. Experimental results show that the proposed method is helpful for improving the 3-D video coding performance and obtaining the quality of synthesized view in terms of both objective and subjective measures.	3d film;algorithmic efficiency;data compression;depth map;pixel;ringing artifacts;sampling (signal processing);video coding format	Donghyun Kim;Seungchul Ryu;Kwanghoon Sohn	2013	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2013.6531123	video compression picture types;data compression;iterative reconstruction;computer vision;image resolution;computer science;coding tree unit;multimedia;motion compensation;video post-processing;statistics;multiview video coding;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	58.33686637545493	-59.05848941535609	33654

It can be efficiently represented in the wavelet domain by retaining a small number of wavelet coefficients. We exploit the arrangement of those wavelet coefficients to achieve fast volume rendering. The running time is O(n2+m), where n is the width of the rendered image, and m is the number of wavelet coefficients retained for the foveated volume. Our algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase is a fast reconstruction of the super-voxels from the wavelet coefficients, and the second phase renders the super-voxels by carefully tracking rays with different thickness in the super-voxels. No expensive preprocessing on the wavelet coefficients is required. Hence, it is possible to interactively modify different viewing parameters like the transfer functions. A potential application of our algorithm is in remote visualization of large volume data-sets.	algorithm;alpha compositing;coefficient;display resolution;experiment;image resolution;interactivity;mimo;preprocessor;rendering (computer graphics);thickness (graph theory);time complexity;transfer function;volume rendering;voxel;wavelet;wavelet transform	Hang Yu;Ee-Chien Chang;Zhiyong Huang;Zhijian Zheng	2005	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-005-0331-1	computer vision;simulation;second-generation wavelet transform;computer science;cascade algorithm;stationary wavelet transform;transfer function;fast wavelet transform;volume rendering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	66.30248044401816	-52.919134381407154	33692

In the past decade, extensive image deblurring algorithms have been proposed to restore a latent clean image from its blurred version. However, very little work has been dedicated to the quality assessment of deblurred images, which may hinder further development of more advanced deblurring techniques. Motivated by this, this paper presents a no-reference quality metric for defocus deblured images based on Natural Scene Statistics (NSS). Two categories of NSS features are extracted in both the spatial and frequency domains to account for both the global and local aspects of distortions in deblurred images. Specifically, the spatial domain NSS features are used to characterize the global naturalness, and the frequency domain NSS features are used to portray the local structural distortions. All features are combined to train a support vector regression model for quality prediction of defocus deblurred images. The performance of the proposed metric is evaluated in a subjectively rated defocus deblurred image database. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed metric over the relevant state-of-the-arts. As an application, the proposed metric is further used for benchmarking deblurring algorithms and very encouraging results are achieved.

This approach retains the GO approach of incorporating the effect of shadows cast by crowns on the background. The newly developed submodel uses an analytical approximation of the radiative transfer (RT) within the plant canopies to model the spectral properties of each scene component. A multiple scalehotspot function that incorporates effects for smaller canopy objects like branches, stems and leaves was also well modeled. Comparison of model results with field measurements (ASAS, POLDER and PARABOLA) over an old black spruce forest in central Canada demonstrated that the model can predict the basic features of the BRDF, i.e., bowl shape and the hotspot. The benefits of the model presented are simplicity, improved treatment of multiple scattering and a new method of estimating the component signatures.	approximation;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;java hotspot virtual machine;motorola canopy;type signature	Wenge Ni;Xiaowen Li;Curtis E.

In this study, we evaluate four correction methods in China’s cities: the linear regression model and the cubic regression model at the regional level, and the Human Settlement Index (HSI) and the Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI) at a pixel level. The results suggest that both correction methods at the regional level improve the correlation between NTL data and socioeconomic variables. However, since the methods can only be used on saturated pixels, the correction effects are limited, as the saturated area in Chinese cities is rather small. HSI and VANUI increase the inter-urban variability within certain cities, OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 9854 especially when their vegetation health and abundance is negatively correlated with NTL. However, the indices may induce bias when applied in a large region with a diverse natural environment and vegetation, and the application of HSI with a relatively high sensitivity of HSI to NDVI may be limited as NTL approaches maximum. Proper methods for reducing saturation effects should thus vary with different study areas and research purposes.	cubic function;horizontal situation indicator;inverted index;ntl;ordinary least squares;pixel;spatial variability	Lin Ma;Jiansheng Wu;Weifeng Li;Jian Peng;Hao Liu	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6109853	china;saturation;remote sensing	HCI	82.49964496425312	-56.355747295731284	33786

Among them, seam carving is a novel and efficient method, but it may distort the object's structure. For enlarging an image, we tend to make it larger and undistorted by first magnifying the image, and shrink it to the target size using seam carving. Thus, in this paper, we focus on shrinking. For spatial coherence, we emphasize the object shape and preserve significant content. We also combine seam carving and scaling operator, trying to avoid the bad results due to content distortion. Moreover, we extend our method to video retargeting, and classify the videos into those taken by the static camera setup and the others by the moving camera setup. Then we explore temporal coherence to decrease the jittery artifacts. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate our approach can raise the quality in video retargeting.	coherence (physics);distortion;image scaling;retargeting;seam carving	Damon Shing-Min Liu;Chi-Wei Huang	2016		10.1145/2915926.2915953	seam carving;computer vision;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.84319708896917	-55.88918241493566	33841

That multi-layered image is a composition of dual aspects of the same image, resembling a sound reverberation. As described herein, we propose a method to estimate the original reflection image before the layering. First, we model the multi-layered image generation process; then we derive a restoration filter by assuming that the displacement between the multiple reflection images in the single multi-layered image is known. Second, we propose a method to estimate the original image in conjunction with the displacement estimation. The displacement between the reflection images in a single multi-layered image includes scene depth information. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using both synthetic and real multi-layered images.	algorithm;autocorrelation;binocular disparity;circuit restoration;computation;critical system;diffuse reflection;displacement mapping;glossary of computer graphics;image restoration;kernel density estimation;synthetic intelligence;time complexity	Takahiro Yano;Masao Shimizu;Masatoshi Okutomi	2010	2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540204	attenuation;image texture;layout;image restoration;computer vision;feature detection;binary image;image processing;polarization;computer science;taylor series;glass;anisotropic diffusion;image formation;pixel	Vision	59.61173921425383	-53.56831704387876	33920

c4a457fd6b776540bb941c77420dce228658b6fd	adaptive stretching method for underwater image color correction		The physical properties of water lead to attenuation of light that travels through the water channel. The attenuation is dependent on the color spectrum wavelength, that results in low contrast and color cast in image acquisition. Several methods have been proposed to handle these problems, such as Linear Stretching, Histogram Equalization (HE) and their variants. Considering the advantages of HE and Linear Stretching, this paper presents a new Adaptive Linear Stretch method (ALS) which can e±ciently improve the subjective impression of the traditional Linear Stretching and keep the computational cost low at the same time. To achieve adaptability, the adaptable threshold is deduced from the histogram of image. Performance analysis reveals that the proposed method signi ̄cantly enhances the image contrast, reduces the color cast and meanwhile, keeps the computational consumption low.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;emoticon;histogram equalization;image histogram;nl (complexity);numerical aperture;profiling (computer programming)	Jun Ao;Chunbo Ma	2018	IJPRAI	10.1142/S0218001418540010	computer vision	Vision	58.74904804825626	-62.236286684776495	34018
b4a0455e3f0408a0a2473b5129e980dff669ef78	accelerated diffusion spectrum imaging with compressed sensing using adaptive dictionaries	data compression;diffusion tensor imaging;compressed sensing;algorithms	Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) offers detailed information on complex distributions of intravoxel fiber orientations at the expense of extremely long imaging times (1 hour). It is possible to accelerate DSI by sub-Nyquist sampling of the q-space followed by nonlinear reconstruction to estimate the diffusion probability density functions (pdfs). Recent work by Menzel et al. imposed sparsity constraints on the pdfs under wavelet and total variation (TV) transforms. As the performance of Compressed Sensing (CS) reconstruction depends strongly on the level of sparsity in the selected transform space, a dictionary specifically tailored for sparse representation of diffusion pdfs can yield higher fidelity results. To our knowledge, this work is the first application of adaptive dictionaries in DSI, whereby we reduce the scan time of whole brain DSI acquisition from 50 to 17 min while retaining high image quality. In vivo experiments were conducted with the novel 3T Connectome MRI, whose strong gradients are particularly suited for DSI. The RMSE from the proposed reconstruction is up to 2 times lower than that of Menzel et al.'s method, and is actually comparable to that of the fully-sampled 50 minute scan. Further, we demonstrate that a dictionary trained using pdfs from a single slice of a particular subject generalizes well to other slices from the same subject, as well as to slices from another subject.	compressed sensing;connectome;dictionary [publication type];diffusion spectrum imaging;experiment;gradient;image quality;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;tissue fiber;total disc replacement;video-in video-out;wavelet	Berkin Bilgic;Kawin Setsompop;Julien Cohen-Adad;Van J.

Based on spatial analysis and statistical analysis in GIS, the spatialtemporal changes of land use from 1986 to 2000 in the region were obtained and analyzed. Firstly, the transition matrix of land use change was calculated. Secondly, the relative change rate, the indices of frequency degree and importance degree were introduced and calculated. Our objectives were to investigate transition rates of land use and flow direction rates among land use types, the regional differences and the spatial distribution of land use change. The results show that the grassland area decreased while that of urban and built-up, water area, cultivated land and forestland increased in the 14 years. Furthermore, the study indicated that the grassland decreased by 3736.84ha, 42.54% of which was converted to cultivated land, 20.77% to water area and 16.95% to woodland. Most of the losses of cultivated land were converted to urban or built-up land. Relative change rate revealed that there were significant regional differences in quantitative change of land use in every county. Frequency degree index indicated that two land use conversions were distributed widely: the conversion of cultivated land into urban and built-up land and the conversion of grassland into cultivated land. The main directions of land use change were that urban and construction land had been enlarged, cultivated land had been encroached and grassland had been continuously reclaimed as cultivated land.

While airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology offers significant potential to estimate forest structural attributes, the capacity of this new tool to classify species is less well known. In this research, full-waveform metrics were extracted by a voxel-based composite waveform approach and examined with a Random Forests classifier to discriminate six subtropical tree species (i.e., Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.)), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.), Slash pines (Pinus elliottii Engelm.), Sawtooth oak (Quercus acutissima Carruth.) and Chinese holly (Ilex chinensis Sims.) at three levels of discrimination. As part of the analysis, the optimal voxel size for modelling the composite waveforms was investigated, the most important predictor metrics for species classification assessed and the effect of scan angle on species discrimination examined. Results demonstrate that all tree species were classified with relatively high accuracy (68.6% for six classes, 75.8% for four main species and 86.2% for conifers and broadleaved trees). Full-waveform metrics (based on height of median energy, waveform distance and number of waveform peaks) demonstrated high classification importance and were stable among various voxel sizes. The results also suggest that the voxel based approach can alleviate some of the issues associated with large scan angles. In summary, the results indicate that full-waveform LIDAR data have significant potential for tree species classification in the subtropical forests.	waveform	Lin Cao;Nicholas C. Coops;John L.

cd33621f7bb52b7ae6609ee794ee782df064f5db	spatial and temporal patterns of global ndvi trends: correlations with climate and human factors	ndvi;human footprint;vegetation;spatio temporal pattern;temperature and precipitation	Changes in vegetation activity are driven by multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, which can be reflected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from satellites. In this paper, NDVI trends from 1982 to 2012 are first estimated by the Theil–Sen median slope method to explore their spatial and temporal patterns. Then, the impact of climate variables and human activity on the observed NDVI trends is analyzed. Our results show that on average, NDVI increased by 0.46 × 10−3 per year from 1982 to 2012 globally with decadal variations. For most regions of the world, a greening (increasing)–browning (decreasing)–greening (G-B-G) trend is observed over the periods 1982–2004, 1995–2004, and 2005–2012, respectively. A positive partial correlation of NDVI and temperature is observed in the first period but it decreases and occasionally becomes negative in the following periods, especially in the Humid Temperate and Dry Domain Regions. This suggests a weakened effect of temperature on vegetation growth. Precipitation, on the other hand, is found to have a positive impact on the NDVI trend. This effect becomes stronger in the third period of 1995–2004, especially in the Dry Domain Region. Anthropogenic effects and human activities, derived here from the OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2015, 7 13234 Human Footprint Dataset and the associated Human Influence Index (HII), have varied impacts on the magnitude (absolute value) of the NDVI trends across continents. Significant positive effects are found in Asia, Africa, and Europe, suggesting that intensive human activity could accelerate the change in NDVI and vegetation. A more accurate attribution of vegetation change to specific climatic and anthropogenic factors is instrumental to understand vegetation dynamics and requires further research.	geometric median;human factors and ergonomics;theil index;theil–sen estimator;trend micro internet security	Ya Liu;Yan Li;Shuangcheng Li;Safa Motesharrei	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs71013233	meteorology;normalized difference vegetation index;climatology;ecology;vegetation;remote sensing	HCI	84.04519647590124	-56.69979112616428	34141

Numerous histogram equalization (HE)-based brightness preserving methods tend to produce unwanted artifacts. Thus, we propose two methods to overcome the drawbacks. The first proposed method divides the histogram based on the median, and iteratively divides into the lower and upper sub-histograms, to produce a totally four sub-histograms. The separating points in the lower and upper sub-histograms are assigned to a new dynamic range and clipping process is implemented to each sub-histogram. Finally, the conventional HE is implemented. The second method is the extension of the bi-histogram equalization plateau limit (BHEPL). This method segments the histogram of input image based on its mean value. Then, clipping process is implemented to each sub-histogram based on their median value. The proposed methods are compared with several conventional methods. The experiment results show that, both of the proposed methods outperform those conventional methods by producing clearer enhanced image with brightness and details preserving ability.	dynamic range;histogram equalization	Chen Hee Ooi;Nor Ashidi Mat Isa	2010	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2010.5681139	computer vision;dynamic range;electronic engineering;computer science;noise;histogram matching;histogram;image segmentation;adaptive histogram equalization;helium;histogram equalization;brightness;pixel	Visualization	57.55476030686575	-64.14445273847628	34143

1637de9ddbd84362dbf84a224d218a287ae915bb	polarimetry-based distributed scatterer processing method for psi applications		Permanent scatterer interferometry is a multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique that produces high-accuracy ground deformation measurement. A high density of permanent scatterer (PS) is required to provide accurate results. In natural environments with low PS density, distributed scatterers (DSs) could serve as additional coherent observations. This paper introduces a polarimetric scattering property-based adaptive filtering method that preserves PS candidates and filters DS candidates. To further increase the coherence estimate of DS candidates, the technique includes a complex coherence decomposition that adaptively selects the most stable scattering mechanisms, thus improving pixel coherence estimation. The proposed method was evaluated on 11 quad-polarized ALOS PALSAR images and 21 dual-polarized Sentinel-1 images acquired over San Fernando Valley, CA, USA, and Groningen, The Netherlands, respectively. The application of this method increased the number of coherent pixels by almost a factor of eight compared with a single-polarization channel. This paper concludes that a coherence estimate can be significantly improved by applying scattering property-based adaptive filtering and coherence matrix decomposition and accurate displacement measurements can be achieved.	adaptive filter;coherence (physics);displacement mapping;holographic interferometry;image noise;interference (communication);pixel;polarimetry;stationary process;synthetic data	Adugna G.

The selection of regularization parameter still remains a difficult problem due to the amplification of noise in the inversion process. In this paper, we have proposed a PSO based regularization technique which adapts the regularization parameters depending on the noise and blurring conditions in the degraded image.

The area of built-up surface was obtained from the classification of the Landsat 7 ETM+ images of the year 2000 for Shanghai. The proportion of built-up surface and population density were extracted from buffer zones with radii ranging from 100 to 2000 m, and used in regression analysis against various water quality parameters at 44 water quality monitoring stations across metropolitan Shanghai. Results suggest that in most cases, the pattern of urban land use as represented by the built-up surface was a stronger predictor than population density in explaining spatial patterns of water quality parameters in Shanghai. The best models of most water quality parameters were found for buffer zones of 2000 m radius rather than for smaller buffers, indicating the regional nature of the factors that influence water quality in the study area. Evidence suggests that strong associations between land use, population density, and water quality result from the contribution of untreated domestic wastewater and non-point pollution sources to waterways in Shanghai. Such relationships should remain strong in the near future until measures to increase the capacity of wastewater treatment and control of non-point pollution sources are fully implemented.	kerrison predictor	Zhi-Yong Yin;Susan Walcott;Brian Kaplan;Jian Cao;Weiqing Lin;Minjian Chen;Dongsheng Liu;Yuemin Ning	2005	Computers, Environment and Urban Systems	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2003.10.001	urbanization;environmental engineering;geography;geographic information system;cartography;remote sensing	HCI	83.64471101642239	-55.811700165026366	34249

All three techniques yield exact results under ideal conditions (constant motion field and perfect discretization). With appropriate derivative filters, accuracy well below a hundredth pixel/frame can be achieved. All techniques are quite insensitive to inhomogeneous and accelerated motion. The differential method, however, is biased by noise while the tensor method is not biased by noise. Under certain conditions, the phase method is insensitive against global illumination changes.	discretization;global illumination;gradient;high- and low-level;motion field;numerical analysis;pixel;propagation of uncertainty;quadrature filter;software propagation	Bernd Jähne;Horst W.

By layering a pair of CMY CFAs in this novel manner we can switch between multiple sets of color primaries (namely RGB, CMY and RGBCY) in the same camera. In contrast to fixed color primaries (e.g. RGB or CMY), which cannot provide optimal image quality for all scene conditions, our camera with switchable primaries provides optimal  color fidelity  and  signal to noise ratio  for multiple scene conditions.   Next, we show that the same concept can be used to layer two RGB CFAs to design a camera with switchable low dynamic range (LDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) modes. Further, we show that such layering can be generalized as a constrained satisfaction problem (CSP) allowing to constrain a large number of parameters (e.g. different operational modes, amount and direction of the shifts, placement of the primaries in the CFA) to provide an optimal solution.   We investigate practical design options for shiftable layering of the CFAs. We demonstrate these by building prototype cameras for both switchable primaries and switchable LDR/HDR modes.   To the best of our knowledge, we present, for the first time, the concept of shiftable layers of CFAs that provides a new degree of freedom in photography where multiple operational modes are available to the user in a single camera for optimizing the picture quality based on the nature of the scene geometry, color and illumination.

fcc76b1762dbeb49cbfa30ca66bd405e015ca331	training-free synthesized face sketch recognition using image quality assessment metrics		Face sketch synthesis has wide applications ranging from digital entertainments to law enforcements. Objective image quality assessment scores and face recognition accuracy are two mainly used tools to evaluate the synthesis performance. In this paper, we proposed a synthesized face sketch recognition framework based on full-reference image quality assessment metrics. Synthesized sketches generated from four state-of-theart methods are utilized to test the performance of the proposed recognition framework. For the image quality assessment metrics, we employed the classical structured similarity index metric and other three prevalent metrics: visual information fidelity, feature similarity index metric and gradient magnitude similarity deviation. Extensive experiments compared with baseline methods illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesized face sketch recognition framework.

Many methods for estimating the illumination’s color have been proposed [1-6]. Although not the most accurate, one of the simplest and quite widely used methods is the gray world algorithm [6]. Borrowing on some of the strengths and simplicity of the gray world algorithm, we introduce a modification of it that significantly improves on its performance while adding little to its complexity.	algorithm;color balance;gw-basic;global illumination;list of monochrome and rgb palettes;max;pixel;sensor	Weihua Xiong;Brian V.

bdab9891c3c0bc822c030de5158f4e7eb46c70d1	pseudo-polar reconstruction for tomography		We propose a stable and fast reconstruction technique for parallel-beam (PB) tomographic X-Ray imaging, relying on the discrete pseudo-polar (PP) Radon and PP Fourier transforms. Our main contribution is a resampling method, based on modern sampling theory, that transforms the PB measurements to a PP grid. The resampling process is both fast and accurate, and in addition, simultaneously denoises the measurements, by exploiting geometrical properties of the tomographic scan. The transformed measurements are then reconstructed using an iterative solver with TV regularization. We show that reconstructing from measurements on the PP grid, leads to improved recovery, due to the inherent stability and accuracy of the PP Radon transform, compared with the PB Radon transform. We also demonstrate recovery from a reduced number of PB acquisition angles and with SNR measurements. Our approach is shown to achieve superior results over other state-of-the-art solutions, that operate directly on the PB measurements.	ct scan;iterative method;matrix regularization;radiography;resampling (statistics);sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;solver;tomography	Shahar Tsiper;Yonina C.

b0f0e4cfd658baa951cac637d79569ee6e74bd90	remote sensing image denoising using patch grouping-based nonlocal means algorithm		Remote sensing images contain repetitive image patches, which makes nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm particularly suitable to denoise them. Blockwise NLM (BNLM) improves NLM’s shortage of high time complexity, but still has the problems of edge blurring and details losing. A patch grouping-based NLM (NLMPG) algorithm is proposed in this letter, and it follows BNLM in estimating the value of a patch by its similarity with other patches in the image, but it improves in two aspects: first, instead of using all image patches in the search window to denoise the center patch, only numbers of the most similar patches are selected, which helps to get rid of less relevant information, and second, NLM and BNLM use the same filtering constant for the whole image, but NLMPG customizes the value of filtering constant for each center patch by ratio of image patch variances, resulting in better performance. Experimental results verify that the proposed NLMPG algorithm is good at structure maintenance and edge preservation, achieving the state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both quantitative criteria and subjective visual quality.	aharonov–bohm effect;algorithm;apply;k-svd;netware loadable module;noise reduction;nonlocal lagrangian;patch (computing);singular value decomposition;time complexity;visual effects	Yingyue Zhou;Hongbing Xiang;Shuiying Li	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2761812	time complexity;mathematics;remote sensing;computer vision;artificial intelligence;filter (signal processing);noise reduction;economic shortage;algorithm	Vision	58.35257001769772	-66.96316056606447	34418

Our approach integrates two kinds of adaptation: 1) a 'coarse' adaptation, where a large window is used within each subband to estimate the local signal covariance; 2) a 'fine' adaptation, which uses small neighborhoods of coefficients modelled as the product of a Gaussian and a hidden multiplier, i.e., as Gaussian scale mixtures (GSM). The former provides adaptation to local spectral features, whereas the latter adapts to local energy fluctuations. We formulate our method as a Bayes least squares estimator using spatially variant GSMs. We also discuss the importance of image representation, compare the results using two different representations with complementary features, and study the effect of merging their results. We demonstrate through simulation that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art performance, in a L/sub 2/-norm sense.	coefficient;least squares;noise reduction;pyramid (geometry);simulation	Jose A.

Atmospheric composition near urban gglomerations is highly affected mainly due to industrial activity and road traffic. Urban smog events are common characteristics f large, very populated cities. Furthermore, artificial covers and emitted energy modify the energy budget of urban regions, and hus, local climatic conditions. One of the most often analyzed phenomena related to cities is the urban heat island (UHI) effect. rban heat island is defined as the positive temperature anomaly occurring between built-in areas and their surroundings. For etailed analysis of UHI in a particular area, different approaches can be used. Here, two different techniques (ground-based and atellite-based) are applied and the results are compared.

Polarimetric SAR can obtain the complete physical scattering mechanisms of targets, thereby having the potential to differentiate objects. In this paper, several classification methods are briefly summarized and the types of features that should be chosen during classification are discussed. A pre-classification step is introduced to reduce the workload of precise labeling. The Random Forest classifier, which performs well for many other classification tasks, is used for the initial land cover classification. Then, based on a polarimetric constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) edge detector, a fast super-pixel generation method for polarimetric SAR image is proposed, which does not require the adjustment of parameters in advance. Following that, majority vote is conducted on the initial classification result based on the super-pixels, so that the classification result can be optimized to better meet the mapping requirements. The experimental results based on GF-3 polarimetric SAR data verify the effectiveness of proposed procedure and demonstrate that GF-3 data has excellent performance in land cover classification.	aperture (software);avian crop;categories;constant false alarm rate;detectors;edge detection;experiment;huwe1 gene;image resolution;physical object;pixel;polarimetry;random forest;requirement;sensor;singular value decomposition;statistical classification;synthetic data	Yuyuan Fang;Haiying Zhang;Qin Mao;Zhenfang Li	2018		10.3390/s18072014	electronic engineering;polarimetry;computer vision;pixel;land cover;random forest;engineering;synthetic aperture radar;artificial intelligence	Vision	75.41554305124419	-61.133436638015496	34554

In the last years, several efforts have been done in order to provide an effective denoising methodology. Although good results have been achieved in terms of noise reduction effectiveness, most of the proposed approaches are not characterized by low computational burden and require the supervision of an external operator for tuning the input parameters.   METHODS Within this manuscript, a novel approach is investigated, based on Wiener filter. Working in the frequency domain, it is characterized by high computational efficiency. With respect to classical Wiener filter, the proposed Enhanced Wiener filter is able to locally adapt itself by tuning its kernel in order to combine edges and details preservation with effective noise reduction. This characteristic is achieved by implementing a Local Gaussian Markov Random Field for modeling the image. Due to its intrinsic characteristics, the computational burden of the algorithm is sensibly low compared to other widely adopted filters and the parameter tuning effort is minimal, being well suited for quasi real time applications.   RESULTS The approach has been tested on both simulated and real datasets, showing interesting performances compared to other state of art methods.   CONCLUSIONS A novel denoising method for UltraSound images is proposed. The approach is able to combine low computational burden with interesting denoising performances and details preservation.

In particular this is true for precision farming activities where the retrieval on the metric scale of biophysical parameters and of information regarding vegetation spatial distributions can be very effective in supporting farmers during the production cycles. However, the inversion problem giving the value of the desired variable from the measured electromagnetic quantities (the image data) can be very complex and the nonlinear relationships involved need to be handled by suitable algorithms. In this paper a complete processing scheme providing quantities of interest for precision viticulture from data provided by WorldView-2 (WV2) and COSMOSkyMed (CSK) space platforms is presented. Once the appropriate season time was selected, the satellite data have been acquired over the test area within a limited time window and concurrently with the collection of the groundtruth. The workflow, besides adequate pre-processing steps, includes two neural networks (NN) modules, one is dedicated to the extraction of a restricted number of nonlinear components from the WV2 data, the other one to the actual inversion problem. The obtained results seem to be satisfactory with respect to the requirements provided by the users.	algorithm;applicative programming language;artificial neural network;microwave;multispectral image;network architecture;nonlinear system;preprocessor;requirement	Fabio Del Frate;Daniele Latini;Matteo Picchiani;Giovanni Schiavon;Cristina Vittucci	2014	2014 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946724	computer vision;remote sensing	DB	78.23481584679347	-60.01750812770597	34697

To align landmarks and non-landmarks in the GSMS images, we propose a geometry-based global alignment method. Firstly, the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography (GSHHG) database and GSMS images are expressed as feature maps by geometric coding. According to the geometric and gradient similarity of feature maps, initial feature matching is obtained. Then, neighborhood spatial consistency based local geometric refinement algorithm is utilized to remove outliers. Since the earth is not a standard sphere, polynomial fitting models are used to describe the global relationship between latitude, longitude and coordinates for all pixels in the GSMS images. Finally, with registered landmarks and polynomial fitting models, the latitude and longitude of each pixel in the GSMS images can be calculated. Experimental results show that the proposed method globally align the GSMS images with high accuracy, recall and significantly low computation complexity.	algorithm;align (company);computation;gshhg;geographic coordinate system;gradient;image stitching;map;pixel;polynomial;refinement (computing);stationary process	Dan Zeng;Rui Fang;Shiming Ge;Shuiying Li;Zhijiang Zhang	2017	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs9060587	artificial intelligence;computer vision;pixel;geographic coordinate system;longitude;remote sensing;latitude;outlier;geometry;polynomial;geography	Vision	70.37040577206372	-58.04779125634011	34754

This computationally efficient approach of allocating resources at key locations has inspired computer visionists to develop new target detection and hacking algorithms based on motion detection in image sequences. In this study we implemented a recursive algorithm for estimating motion vector fields for each pixel in a sequence of Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images. Velocity information is used to segment the image and perform linear quadratic and acceleration-based frame interpolation to produce an apparent frame rate increase. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of low-rate digital fluoroscopy hence less exposure risks while preserving image quality. Furthermore the technique can be useful in the medical Picture Archival and Communication Systems (PACS) where image data can be compressed by storing and transmiting only the motion fields associated with the moving pixels. 1.© (1990) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

This paper combines spectral and spatial processing to estimate local changes in spectral reflectance between pairs of spectral images under spatially and spectrally varying multiplicative and additive noise, which arise from variations in illumination and atmospheric effects. This approach extends the spatial SPIRE algorithms that were described earlier and utilizes only a prior reflectance image cube and ensembles of typical multiplicative and additive illumination noise spectral vectors that are deduced from images cubes of similar scenes. The method minimizes the impact of environmental noise by replacing with their prior equivalents low-spatial-frequency content and low-order principal components that are known to be noisy based on prior noise spectra. This filtering and substitution process occurs in log space when minimizing the effects of multiplicative noise. Tests on Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment visible near-infrared-shortwave infrared data demonstrated the algorithm's superior ability to estimate absolute reflectance changes under varying illumination conditions. SPIRE performance was nearly identical to the empirical line method (ELM) ground-truth-based atmospheric compensation results and was better than the physics-based Atmospheric removal (ATREM) code overall, particularly, under high clouds and haze. A ldquoSelective SPIRErdquo technique that chooses between combined-spatial/spectral and spectral-only SPIRE reflectance estimates was developed; it maximizes estimation performance on both changed and unchanged pixels. Minimum-distance classification experiments demonstrated Selective SPIRE's superior performance relative to both ATREM and ELM in cross-image supervised classification applications.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;experiment;ground truth;l (complexity);machine learning;multiplicative noise;olap cube;pixel;stellar classification;supervised learning;utility functions on indivisible goods	Herbert E.

Several levels of filters insure that contamination from cloudy pixels is minimized. The MCC method produces displacement vectors, which are translated into satellite attitude corrections to be added to the orbital image navigation corrections. The auto attitude corrections are shown to be more accurate than the traditional linear translation methods. A further application of the attitude corrections is demonstrated whereby attitude corrections computed over land can be carried forward in the satellite’s orbit to accurately navigate imagery over the open ocean where no map reference points are available. Tested for two land sites well separated in a single orbit this method is shown to be as accurate as when applied to an individual image.	cross-correlation;displacement mapping;grid reference;molecular orbital;pixel	William J.

Regularization of the network output can be achieved by minimization of the second derivative norm of the network output and construction of a segmented network that approximates cubic splines with power units. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the network outputs to those of a nonregularized network and a network with a Gaussian regularizer. ã 1998 Scripta Technica, Syst Comp Jpn, 29(10): 3645, 1998	artificial neural network;charge-coupled device;cubic function;digi-comp i;gaussian (software);nonlinear system;spline (mathematics);spline interpolation;well-posed problem	Kuniaki Uto;Yukio Kosugi	1998	Systems and Computers in Japan	10.1002/(SICI)1520-684X(199810)29:10%3C36::AID-SCJ4%3E3.0.CO;2-L		ML	58.32248053844922	-76.09346819812157	34920

However, at present time, there is no accepted IQM able to predict the perceptual level of image degradation across different types of visual distortions. Some measures are more adapted for a set of degradations but inefficient for others. Indeed, the efficiency of any IQM has been shown to depend upon the type of degradation. Thus, we propose here a new approach for predicting the type of degradation before using IQMs. The basic idea is first to identify the type of distortion using a Bayesian approach, then select the most appropriate IQM for estimating image quality for that specific type of distortion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of classification accuracy across different types of degradations.	distortion;elegant degradation;image quality;statistical model	Aladine Chetouani;Azeddine Beghdadi;Mohamed A.

Though these summation techniques when modelled are effective in improving the quality of low light images, using the temporal summation in scenes where image velocity is high only come at a cost of motion blurring in the output scenes. Most recent research has been towards reducing motion blurring in scenes where motion is caused by moving objects rather than effectively reducing motion blurring in scenes where motion is caused by moving cameras. This makes it impossible to implement the night vision algorithm in moving robots or cars that operate under low light conditions. In this paper we present a generic new method that can replace the normal temporal summation in scenes where motion is detected. The proposed method is both suitable for motion caused by moving objects as well as moving cameras. The effectiveness of this new generic method is shown with relevant supporting experiments.	algorithm;brownian motion;experiment;gaussian blur;image quality;robot;velocity (software development)	Gabriel Zahi;Shigang Yue	2014	2014 International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Information Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI)	10.1109/MFI.2014.6997725	computer vision;mathematics;optics;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	55.914985465280594	-58.07911298081357	35004

Wavelets provide a localized, multiresolution representation of functions and this makes them ideal candidates for streaming surface reconstruction algorithms. We show how wavelets can be used to reconstruct the indicator function of a shape from a cloud of points with associated normals. Our method proceeds in several steps. We first compute a low-resolution approximation of the indicator function using an octree followed by a second pass that incrementally adds fine resolution details. The indicator function is then smoothed using a modified octree convolution step and contoured to produce the final surface. Due to the local, multiresolution nature of wavelets, our approach results in an algorithm over 10 times faster than previous methods and can process extremely large data sets in the order of several hundred million points in only an hour.	algorithm;approximation;convolution;octree;smoothing;wavelet	Josiah Manson;G.

In fact, the modulation of the GNSS signal and its frequency (L band) are particularly effective to sense vegetation attenuation and change of soil permittivity due to moisture. An experiment has been carried out in Italy using a GNSS reflectometer (GNSS-R) developed by STARLAB, mounted on top of a crane and looking toward a couple of agricultural fields by two downlooking antennas operating at right and left circular polarization. The data collected during the experiment have been interpreted by comparing them to the output of a theoretical simulator, with the purpose of interpreting from an electromagnetic point of view the scattering mechanisms involved in the experiment.

In this paper, a unique algorithm for propagation prediction with transmission and reflection in restricted spaces is proposed. By using binary labels to record propagation history, this algorithm can be implemented with parallel computing. As a result, we are able to handle a large computation amount for 3-D restricted spaces in an acceptable time duration. In consistency with the geometric structure of the COLLADA model, the proposed algorithm can also be applied to a large database. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in both reflection-only and reflection-and-transmission scenarios.	algorithm;collada;computation;data structure;parallel computing;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;software propagation;time complexity	Feixiang Zhang;Xiangwei Zhou	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992185	electronic engineering;telecommunications;line-of-sight propagation;radio propagation model;optics;beam tracing;physics;ray tracing	Robotics	68.37951592470618	-57.15480318928989	35135

This paper presents an approach for vector-to-raster registration. Candidate features are auto-extracted and vectorized from imagery, which are the basis to compare against existing vector layer(s) to be registered. Given that automated feature extraction (AFE) methods are imperfect, the objective is to determine and gather a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio from AFE upon which to base a registration process between vector data sets. Two vector registration methods were investigated. The first is based on an algebraic structural algorithm (ASA) in which structural components (e.g., angles, lengths and areas) are used as similarity metrics. The second is based on a similarity transformation of local features (STLF) in which a 4-parameter transformation is used to align features on a local basis. Experiments were performed to register road vector data to commercial panchromatic and multispectral QuickBird imagery.	algorithm;align (company);analog front-end;comparison of raster-to-vector conversion software;feature extraction;image registration;linear algebra;multispectral image;raster graphics;rasterisation;signal-to-noise ratio	Peter Doucette;Boris Kovalerchuk;Robert T.

Based on the coordinate component of the intersections the lengths of the voxels intersected with this ray are rapidly calculated. Meanwhile, after determining the index of the first voxel intersected with the ray, the indices of the remaining voxels intersected with this ray can be successively determined in terms of the incremental of the coordinate component between the adjacent intersections. By so doing shortens the time consumed in calculating the radiological path. The simulation results show that this algorithm is feasible and effective. Compared with the Siddon algorithm, it results in an about 4 times speedup in the calculation of the radiological path.	algorithm;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;pixel;simulation;speedup;voxel	Zhen Xue;Liangliang Zhang;Jinxiao Pan	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6024036	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;geometry	Visualization	68.98537476101984	-54.049086027038356	35214

While that is a physical and mathematical reality that cannot be violated, it is possible to create colors that appear as if they were produced by physically impossible stimuli. This can be accomplished through careful control of the viewing conditions and states of adaptation. This paper highlights the importance of considering color appearance issues in the design of displays and specification of color gamuts and illustrates how the perceived color gamut can be manipulated significantly through the relationship between white-point and primary luminance levels without changing the chromaticity gamut of a display system. Using a color appearance model, such as CIECAM02, display color gamuts can be specified in perceptual terms such as lightness, chroma, brightness, and colorfulness rather than in strictly physical terms of the stimuli that create these perceptions. Examination of these perceptual gamuts, and their relationships to the viewing conditions, allows demonstration of the possibility of producing display gamuts that appear to reach beyond the locus of pure spectral colors when compared with typical display setups.	color;computability in europe;diagram;locus;race condition	Mark D.

In our technique, we use measurements of the spectral response curve of the camera system as well as one or more spectral reflectance measurements of the illuminated object to optimize the color matching. We demonstrate our technique using two LED-based light sources: an off-the-shelf 3-channel RGB LED light source and a custom-built 9-channel multi-spectral LED light source. We use our technique to reproduce complex lighting spectra including both fluorescent and tungsten illumination using a Macbeth color checker chart and a human face as test subjects. We show that by using knowledge of the camera spectral response and/or the spectral reflectance of the subjects that we can significantly improve the accuracy of the color matching using either the 3-channel or the 9-channel light, achieving acceptable matches for the 3-channel source and very close matches for the multi-spectral 9-channel source.	bode plot;brian;channel (digital image);color management;entity–relationship model;eurographics;global information network architecture;kinesiology;optimizing compiler;production support;rca spectra 70;spectral rendering;stellar classification	Andreas Wenger;Tim Hawkins;Paul E.

9607f058a74d7a64801699c490e7e8f11201aef9	urban indicator for database updating - a decision tool to help stakeholders and map producers		The issue of regular spatial databases updating is partly solved by the abundance of satellite images. It is, though, time consuming, requires qualified human resources, high financial costs and requests efficiency (Bernard, 2007). This article presents a semi-automatic tool for urban detection, to guide the stakeholders and the producers throughout the updating process. The industrial context of the study implies a fast, instantaneous applicative workflow, operational on various landscapes with different sensors; it is thus based on existing algorithms and software resources. The process is generic and adaptable, with a phase of uncorrelation, chaining a Minimum Noise Fraction transformation with a textural analysis, a learning phase, processed from an existing database, and an automatic modelling of the detected objects. The quantification of the results shows the successful recreation of the existing database (90% of its surface) with a 7% rate of potential big omissions. A specific highlight is made on the detection of disappeared buildings, corresponding to 17.5% of the potential important omissions. This process has run in “real” updating operations, on 1.5 and 6 meters resolution Spot6 images, a 15 meters Landsat-8 image and a 1.5 meters resolution Pleiades image. A quantification of its results is also proposed in this study.	algorithm;applicative programming language;co-occurrence matrix;pleiades (supercomputer);semiconductor industry;sensor;spatial database	Bénédicte Navaro;Zakaria Sadeq;Nicolas Saporiti	2017		10.5220/0006327600810089	geography;knowledge management;environmental resource management;data mining	AI	79.8063860046253	-55.59304471598581	35433

It consists of two phases: rendering and correction. The rendering phase is edgedirected. From the low resolution image data, we generate a high resolution edge map by first filtering with a rectangular center-on-surround-off filter and then performing piecewise linear interpolation between the zero crossings; in the filter output. The rendering phase is based on. bilinear interpolation modified to prevent interpolation across edges, as determined from the estimated high resolution edge map. During the correction phase, we modify the mesh values on which the rendering is based to account for the disparity between the true low resolution data, and that predicted by a sensor model operating on the high resolution output of the rendering phase. The overall process is repeated iteratively. We show experimental results which demonstrate the efficacy of our interpolation method.	bilinear filtering;binocular disparity;image resolution;iterative method;linear interpolation;piecewise linear continuation;rendering (computer graphics)	Jan P.

In this study, we describe a model for automated identification of safety zones using decision rules based on lidar-measured vegetation height, flame height, and terrain slope. Inputs included lidar and orthoimage data collected over a study area in the southern Sierra Nevada, USA. Safety zones were required to be large enough to shelter 20 firefighters and two vehicles, and distance to the closest road was measured to determine ease of access. Safety zones comprised less than 0.5% of the study area at 4 m flame height (16 m SSD). As flame height increased, the number and size of safety zones decreased.

11883fc44a6b43f505e4d75d23cdf6a1064db883	downscaling of trmm3b43 product through spatial and statistical analysis based on normalized difference water index, elevation, and distance from sea		This letter aims to explore the potentialities of normalized difference water index (NDWI) and distance from sea to downscale coarse precipitation (TRMM3B43 product), whose contribution to downscaling precipitation remains unstudied. For this purpose, based on an open data set of 14 years, including TRMM3B43 and three predictors (NDWI, elevation, and distance from sea), stepwise regression and Akaike information criterion were applied in order to identify the best-fit models. The models that have given rise to best approximations and best-fits were used to downscale TRMM3B43 product, to a spatial resolution of 1 km. The resulting downscaled calibrated precipitations were validated by independent rain gauge stations (RGSs). The analysis exhibited that there is good and statistically significant correlations between TRMM3B43 and NDWI and a great agreement between downscaled precipitations and RGS measurements.	akaike information criterion;approximation;coefficient;curve fitting;downscaling;fits;kerrison predictor;remote graphics software;stepwise regression	Hicham Ezzine;Ahmed Bouziane;Driss Ouazar;Moulay Driss Hasnaoui	2017	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2017.2705430	mathematics;normalization (statistics);remote sensing;elevation;akaike information criterion;climatology;stepwise regression;precipitation;downscaling	DB	85.28972918177634	-60.25897903471448	35483

From the 4-D light field, this paper proposes a depth estimation method by accumulating binary maps, which are computed by the foreground–background separation with light field reparameterization. In the proposed foreground–background separation, an optical phenomenon is used where bundles of rays from the background are flipped on their conjugate planes. Using the Lambertian assumption and gradient constraint, the foreground and background of a scene can be converted to a binary map by voting the gradient signs in every angular patch. Using light field reparameterization, the disparity map can be obtained by accumulating the binary maps. Finding the extremum index in the existing methods corresponds to finding the zero crossing index in the proposed method. By accumulating the binary maps, the proposed method has an advantage on the computational efficiency in terms of memory usage, and can use various reparameterization strategies suitable for applications. Experimental results with synthetic and real images show that the proposed method can generate a high-quality disparity map.	angularjs;gradient;lambertian reflectance;light field;map;maxima and minima;synthetic intelligence;zero crossing	Jae Young Lee;Rae-Hong Park	2017	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2747154	artificial intelligence;optical phenomena;manifold;conjugate;computer vision;zero crossing;real image;light field;binary number;mathematics;foreground-background	Vision	59.15183135487358	-52.798841459800904	35489

Existing studies on foveation based video quality assessment only take into account static foveation mechanism. This paper first proposes an advanced foveal imaging model to generate the perceived representation of video by integrating visual attention into the foveation mechanism. For accurately simulating the dynamic foveation mechanism, a novel approach to predict video fixations is proposed by mimicking the essential functionality of eye movement. Consequently, an advanced contrast sensitivity function, derived from the attention driven foveation mechanism, is modeled and then integrated into a wavelet-based distortion visibility measure to build a full reference attention driven foveated video quality (AFViQ) metric. AFViQ exploits adequately perceptual visual mechanisms in video quality assessment. Extensive evaluation results with respect to several publicly available eye-tracking and video quality databases demonstrate promising performance of the proposed video attention model, fixation prediction approach, and quality metric.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;color vision defect;digital video;distortion;experiment;eye movements;eye tracking;foveated imaging;human visual system model;psychoacoustics;published database;simulation;wavelet;vetispiradiene synthase activity	Junyong You;Touradj Ebrahimi;Andrew Perkis	2014	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2287611	computer vision;visual perception;computer science;video tracking;mathematics;multimedia;wavelet transform;computer graphics (images)	Vision	63.409009286008384	-63.6530978873958	35524

With the fast development of computer technology, more and more efficient algorithms have been put forward in recent years. The Iteration Back Projection (IBP) method is one of the popular methods with SR. In this paper, a modified IBP is proposed for remote sensing image processing. This improved IBP can efficiently deal with local affine transformations within images for SR. Experiments and results are presented using both a synthetic set of images generated from a single Landsat ETM+ channel and a set of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) imagery.

It is based on simple image algebra between color components, which enhances the contrast between brown and green areas. A successive segmentation through multiple thresholds, based on newly proposed indices of “brown color excess” and the “nonforest detection index,” leads to a binary map that clearly identifies forested and nonforested areas. Experimental tests, performed and compared with other recommended methods based on: region growing, active contours, and clustering, outperformed in detection accuracy (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$F_{m}=96.4$ </tex-math></inline-formula>%) and processing times (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$T_{p} = 0.082$ </tex-math></inline-formula> s). The method presented copes well with detecting regional irregularities and reduces frequent issues of nondetection, as well as false positives caused by intensity changes, shadows, and/or partial occlusions. The low processing times achieved with the proposed method allow real-time applications for low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle and unmanned aircraft systems with conventional camera equipment."""	active galactic nucleus;aerial photography;algorithm;binary image;cluster analysis;erosion (morphology);fm broadcasting;fastest;offset binary;pixel;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;region growing;sensor;single-instance storage;unmanned aerial vehicle	Henry O.

To address this problem, azimuth nonlinear chirp scaling (ANLCS) is investigated in this letter. First, linear range walk is removed and then ANLCS is applied in the range frequency azimuth time domain to correct the azimuth-variant RCMs and to equalize the different FM rates. Taking the 2-D variance caused by the azimuth-variant configuration into consideration, a new perturbation function is derived based on the bistatic geometry. Using method of series reversion, a close form of range-azimuth coupling is obtained and corrected in the range Doppler domain by an interpolation-free operation. Incorporated with the secondary range compression, this method leads to a more accurate focusing for azimuth-variant bistatic configurations, even with high squints. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the method.	algorithm;chirp;coefficient;fm broadcasting;image scaling;interpolation;knowledge-based configuration;modulation;nonlinear system;perturbation function;radar;reliability-centered maintenance;reversion (software development);simulation;synthetic intelligence;velocity (software development)	Wei Wang;Guisheng Liao;Dong Li;Qing Xu	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2254106	radar engineering details;synthetic aperture radar;geology;bistatic radar;optics;radar imaging;inverse synthetic aperture radar;side looking airborne radar;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	76.25690203354928	-67.72743423154324	35758

The proposed method is based on the thresholding method using SAR amplitude, terrain information, and object-based classification techniques for noise removal. Since the water areas in SAR images have the lowest amplitude value, the thresholding method using SAR amplitude could effectively extract water bodies. However, the reflective properties of water areas in SAR imagery cannot distinguish the occluded areas caused by steep relief and they can be eliminated with terrain information. In spite of the thresholding method using SAR amplitude and terrain information, noises which interfered with users' interpretation of water maps still remained and the object-based classification using an object size criterion was applied for the noise removal and the criterion was determined by a histogram-based technique. When only using SAR amplitude information, the overall accuracy was 83.67%. However, using SAR amplitude, terrain information and the noise removal technique, the overall classification accuracy over the study area turned out to be 96.42%. In particular, user accuracy was improved by 46.00%.	guided imagery;human body;information extraction;map;nr1i2 wt allele;object-based language;obstruction;thresholding (image processing)	Seunghwan Hong;Hyo-Seon Jang;Namhoon Kim;Hong-Gyoo Sohn	2015		10.3390/s150306652	computer vision;remote sensing	Robotics	74.84340212791709	-59.18223855905965	35760

Successive removal of the optimal seams, i.e., those seams with the lowest sum of energy, allows reduction in image size. Pixels with lower energy are generally removed earlier; implying that (1) the modifications to the image are difficult to identify and (2) low energy can be deliberately assigned to particular objects so that they can be removed from the image. These two observations reveal that, although difficult, it is important to design a seam carving detection method.	image resolution;image scaling;pixel;seam carving;sobel operator	Jyh-Da Wei;Yu-Ju Lin;Yi-Jing Wu;Li-Wei Kang	2013		10.1145/2503385.2503445	seam carving;ray tracing;computer vision;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Vision	56.91452307967741	-61.45395962102457	35854

Spaceborne radiometers are ideally suited for global snowmelt monitoring. In this paper, four different algorithms are used to determine the snowmelt date from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data for a nearly 30-year period. Algorithms are based on thresholding channel differences, on applying neural networks, and on time series analysis. The results are compared with ground-based observations of snow depth and snowmelt status available through the Russian INTAS-SSCONE observation database. Analysis based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data indicates that these pointwise observations are applicable as reference data. The obtained error estimates indicate that the algorithm based on time series analysis has the highest performance. Using this algorithm, a time series of the snowmelt from 1979 to 2007 is calculated for the whole Eurasia showing a trend of an earlier snow clearance. The trend is statistically significant. The results agree with earlier research. The novelty here is the demonstration and validation of estimates for a large continental scale (for areas dominated by boreal forests) using extensive reference data sets.	algorithm;artificial neural network;köppen climate classification;microwave;thresholding (image processing);time series	Matias Takala;Jouni Pulliainen;Sari Metsämäki;Jarkko Koskinen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2009.2018442	meteorology;taiga;performance;hydrology;time series;optics;artificial neural network;physics;statistics;remote sensing	Visualization	82.9398010584005	-60.9093099697363	35885
7a46220775fbdbe027926314f87f42d7b1cecb43	underwater color image enhancement using improved multi-scale retinex and histogram linear quantification		The quality of underwater color image is degraded due to scatting and attenuation of the illumination in the underwater environment. In order to compensate for visual degradation, an underwater color image enhancement method by imitating human visual mechanism of processing color images is proposed. Firstly, the incomplete Beta function is applied to underwater color images to enhance the brightness of the image. At the same time, the improved multi-scale homomorphic filter with a weighted sum of three different scale homomorphic filters, instead of Gaussian filter in the Retinex algorithm, is employed to estimate the illumination image so as to remove image haze. Finally, the histogram for each channel of the RGB color space is analyzed, and the histogram linear quantification algorithm is applied to achieve color balance. The performance of the proposed bionic model is evaluated both subjectively and objectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper can improve the definition and balance the color of the underwater image effectively.	algorithm;color balance;color image;color space;elegant degradation;image editing;weight function	Qingwu Li;Wenqing Zhu;Mei Cao	2017		10.1145/3018896.3056806	attenuation;gaussian filter;computer network;brightness;color image;computer science;color balance;computer vision;color constancy;histogram;rgb color space;artificial intelligence	Vision	58.60265508347091	-62.57045288231333	35949

It is well known that, surface splines handle geometric distortion very well. The performance of surface splines for dense correspondence can be significantly improved by the reliable control points, but can also be degraded by false matches significantly. To maximize the number of reliable control points, optical flow for each pixel is estimated by global energy minimization using variational method. Here, the control points are selected using two validation techniques: left-right consistency check and epipolar geometry check using fundamental matrix. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on remotely sensed stereo image pair.	binocular disparity;calculus of variations;distortion;energy minimization;epipolar geometry;fundamental matrix (computer vision);optical flow;pixel;spline (mathematics);variational method (quantum mechanics);variational principle	Manimala Mahato;Shirish S.

These radar transmission modulations are cycles of phase-coded pulses whose lagged products form complementary code sets, enabling decoding of incoherent scatter lag profiles by means of matched filtering. Numerically optimized near-perfect modulations are potential successors of the alternating codes and random codes because they enable new measurement techniques, such as so-called multipurpose experiments. The near-perfect modulations cannot be decoded by means of matched filtering, but they are designed for analysis by means of lag profile inversion. Two improvements to this combination are introduced in this letter: Suppression of background noise correlations is implemented as part of lag profile inversion, removing the need for dedicated background measurements, and the concept of strong phase codes is adopted to near-perfect modulations, allowing one to neglect the receiver impulse response in lag profile inversion.	code;coherence (physics);experiment;numerical integration;zero suppression	Ilkka I.

This paper presents an insight into the applicability of currently available radiative transfer modelling and atmospheric correction techniques for processing airborne hyperspectral data in this unique coastal Antarctic environment. Results from the Atmospheric and Topographic Correction version 4 (ATCOR-4) package reveal absolute reflectance values somewhat in line with laboratory measured spectra, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 5% in the visible near infrared (0.4–1 μm) and 8% in the shortwave infrared (1–2.5 μm). Residual noise remains present due to the absorption by atmospheric gases and aerosols, but certain parts of the spectrum match laboratory measured features very well. This study demonstrates that commercially available packages for carrying out atmospheric correction are capable of correcting airborne hyperspectral data in the challenging environment present in Antarctica. However, it is anticipated that future results from atmospheric correction could be improved Remote Sens. 2014, 6 4499 by measuring in situ atmospheric data to generate atmospheric profiles and aerosol models, or with the use of multiple ground targets for calibration and validation.	airborne ranger;topography	Martin Black;Andrew Fleming;Teal Riley;Graham Ferrier;Peter Fretwell;John McFee;Stephen Achal;Alejandra Umana Diaz	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6054498	meteorology;atmospheric sciences;remote sensing	HCI	82.68749707537003	-61.92610070355608	36246

Thus each object presented in the image can be identified from their spectral response. The classification of multi-temporal hyperspectral image is a challenge task due to the problem of spectral variation over the time. In fact, many factors can affect the spectral signature of object like weather and climatic effects, so two images taken on the same area but at different times and under different conditions can lead to different spectral signatures for the same objects. This observation has fostered the idea of adopting 3D representation of spectral signature to classify multi-temporal hyperspectral image. The main objective of this representation is to have for each object a compact model which illustrate their spectral variation over the time, it represent the variation of reflectance as a function of time and spectral waveband. In this paper, we propose a new approach for multi-temporal hyperspectral image classification based on 3D spectral signature to solve the problem of spectral variation. This approach consist, foremost, to represent each pixel of classified image by a 3D spectral signature after the application of the powerful 3D modeling method """"Non-uniform Rational Basis Spline"""" (NURBS), after, to apply local shape descriptor """"spherical harmonic decomposition"""" to extract spectral features from each 3D spectral signature and, finally, to classify the image by means of supervised classifier """"Support Vector Machines (SVMs)"""" with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. To evaluate this approach, we used a series of multi-temporal hyperspectral """"hyperion"""" images."""	3d modeling;antivirus software;computer vision;file spanning;foremost;frequency band;hyperion;machine learning;multiclass classification;non-uniform rational b-spline;oddworld: abe's oddysee;pixel;radial basis function kernel;sensor;spline (mathematics);support vector machine;type signature	Karim Saheb Ettabaâ;Med Ali Hamdi;Rafika Ben Salem	2014	2014 1st International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Signal and Image Processing (ATSIP)	10.1109/ATSIP.2014.6834635	full spectral imaging;computer vision;pattern recognition;mathematics;remote sensing	Vision	75.78421546423455	-59.27051700241474	36272
0b60efc28ee1b7d9106f47eb031eba5705d4df50	optimal camera exposure for video surveillance systems by predictive control of shutter speed, aperture, and gain	video surveillance;surveillance;robotics;automatic exposure;lenses;algorithms;cameras;buildings;apertures	This paper establishes a real-time auto-exposure method to guarantee that surveillance cameras in uncontrolled light conditions take advantage of their whole dynamic range while provide neither under nor overexposed images. State-of-the-art auto-exposure methods base their control on the brightness of the image measured in a limited region where the foreground objects are mostly located. Unlike these methods, the proposed algorithm establishes a set of indicators based on the image histogram that defines its shape and position. Furthermore, the location of the objects to be inspected is likely unknown in surveillance applications. Thus, the whole image is monitored in this approach. To control the camera settings, we defined a parameters function (Ef ) that linearly depends on the shutter speed and the electronic gain; and is inversely proportional to the square of the lens aperture diameter. When the current acquired image is not overexposed, our algorithm computes the value of Ef that would move the histogram to the maximum value that does not overexpose the capture. When the current acquired image is overexposed, it computes the value of Ef that would move the histogram to a value that does not underexpose the capture and remains close to the overexposed region. If the image is under and overexposed, the whole dynamic range of the camera is therefore used, and a default value of the Ef that does not overexpose the capture is selected. This decision follows the idea that to get underexposed images is better than to get overexposed ones, because the noise produced in the lower regions of the histogram can be removed in a post-processing step while the saturated pixels of the higher regions cannot be recovered. The proposed algorithm was tested in a video surveillance camera placed at an outdoor parking lot surrounded by buildings and trees which produce moving shadows in the ground. During the daytime of seven days, the algorithm was running alternatively together with a representative auto-exposure algorithm in the recent literature. Besides the sunrises and the nightfalls, multiple weather conditions occurred which produced light changes in the scene: sunny hours that produced sharpen shadows and highlights; cloud coverages that softened the shadows; and cloudy and rainy hours that dimmed the scene. Several indicators were used to measure the performance of the algorithms. They provided the objective quality as regards: the time that the algorithms recover from an under or over exposure, the brightness stability, and the change related to the optimal exposure. The results demonstrated that our algorithm reacts faster to all the light changes than the selected state-of-the-art algorithm. It is also capable of acquiring well exposed images and maintaining the brightness stable during more time. Summing up the results, we concluded that the proposed algorithm provides a fast and stable auto-exposure method that maintains an optimal exposure for video surveillance applications. Future work will involve the evaluation of this algorithm in robotics. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Data from Topex/Poseidon (TP) and Jason-1 (J1) missions at GSL for the ice-free seasons of 1993-2002 and 2002-2008, respectively, reveal lower performance of J1 for areas closer to 20 km from the coastline compared to 10 km for TP. A calculated bias of 6.99 cm was subtracted to J1 range since TP has better tracking of shoreline waters and lower data rejection. High correlation coefficients for the relative rate of change between lake altimetry heights (LAHs) and corresponding gauge data for Yellowknife Bay and Hay River support the use of LAH changes as effective indicators of variability at GSL. Differences in LAH between the five areas indicate a nonuniform slope which we relate more to variability of the surface water temperature distribution than wind effects. The deeper and colder areas are associated to the least change of LAH gradient through time; therefore, they represent ideal areas to study interannual climate variability. A potential correlation between areas with higher variability in LAH gradients and higher changes in modeled surface water temperatures during the 2003 ice free season is observed.	coefficient;gnu scientific library;heart rate variability;image gradient;kaby lake;poseidon: master of atlantis;rejection sampling;spatial variability	Sergio E.

For the full reference (FR) IQA problem, great progress has been made in the past decade. On the other hand, several new large scale image datasets have been released for evaluating FR IQA methods in recent years. Meanwhile, no work has been reported to evaluate and compare the performance of state-of-the-art and representative FR IQA methods on all the available datasets. In this paper, we aim to fulfill this task by reporting the performance of eleven selected FR IQA algorithms on all the seven public IQA image datasets. Our evaluation results and the associated discussions will be very helpful for relevant researchers to have a clearer understanding about the status of modern FR IQA indices.

In this paper, we propose a new reversible image watermarking method based on interpolation-error expansion called region based interpolation error expansion (RBIEE). We improved Thodi's prediction error expansion (PEE) technique by using a novel interpolation algorithm which exploits interpixel correlation better. Furthermore, interpolation error histogram is divided into two regions. The parameters of each region are determined separately and iteratively to reach a given embedding capacity more precisely. However, adaptive embedding strategy is utilized to get better capacity-distortion performance. Advantage of the proposed method over the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of capacity and visual quality is demonstrated experimentally.	algorithm;digital watermarking;interpolation	Can Yüzkollar;Ümit Kocabiçak	2015	Appl.

c3cf385a33ea4f8c82cc597bebf2cbec2c757913	individual tree crown delineation from airborne laser scanning for diseased larch forest stands	individual tree crown;segmentation;journal article;phytophthora ramorum;canopy height model;lidar	Airborne laser scanning (ALS) can be utilised to derive canopy height models (CHMs) for individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. In the case of forest areas subject to defoliation and dieback as a result of disease, increased irregularities across the canopy can add complications to the segmentation of ITCs. Research has yet to address this issue in order to suggest appropriate techniques to apply under conditions of forest stands that are infected by phytopathogens. This study aimed to find the best method of ITC delineation for larch canopies affected by defoliation as a result of a Phytophthora ramorum infection. Sample plots from two study sites in Wales, United Kingdom, were selected for ITC segmentation assessment across a range of infection levels and stand characteristics. The performance of two segmentation algorithms (marker-controlled watershed and region growing) were tested for a series of CHMs generated by a standard normalised digital surface model and a pit-free algorithm, across a range of spatial resolutions (0.15 m, 0.25 m and 0.5 m). The results show that the application of a pit-free CHM generation method produced improved segmentation accuracies in moderately and heavily infected larch forest, compared to the standard CHM. The success of ITC delineations was also influenced by CHM resolution. Across all plots the CHMs with a 0.25 m pixel size performed consistently well. However, lower and higher CHM resolutions also provided improved delineation accuracies in plots dominated by larger and smaller canopies respectively. The selected segmentation method also influenced the success of ITC delineations, with the marker-controlled watershed algorithm generating significantly more accurate results than the region growing algorithm (p < 0.10). The results demonstrate that ITCs in forest stands infected with Phytophthora ramorum can be successfully delineated from ALS when a pit-free algorithm is applied to CHM generation.	airborne ranger;algorithm;chemdraw;crown group;digital elevation model;digital geometry;motorola canopy;pixel;region growing;watershed (image processing)	Chloe Barnes;Heiko Balzter;Kirsten Barrett;James Eddy;Sam Milner;Juan C.

Multi-view stereo methods produce fine details at texture areas, and depth recordings would compensate when stereo doesn't work, e.g. at non-texture regions. However, resolution of depth maps from depth sensors are rather low. Our objective is to produce a high-res depth map by fusing different sensors from multiple views. In this paper we present a learning-based method, and infer a high-res depth map from our synthetic database by minimizing the proposed energy. As depth alone is not sufficient to describe geometry of the scene, we use additional features like normal and curvature, which are able to capture high-frequency details of the surface. Our optimization framework explores multi-view depth and color consistency, normal and curvature similarity between low-res input and the database and smoothness constraints on pixel-wise depth-color coherence as well as on patch borders. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art.	depth map;image resolution;mathematical optimization;pixel;sensor;super-resolution imaging;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence	Jing Li;Zhichao Lu;Gang Zeng;Rui Gan;Long Wang;Hongbin Zha	2013	2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition	10.1109/ACPR.2013.89	image texture;computer vision;color image;mathematics;optics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	55.78295485545462	-56.542878531145185	36438

One of them is the precise understanding of optical properties of objects, which is possible to obtain from 3D plus brightness or color data. Those properties are usually important inspection criteria; for example, the specular sharpness of a coatted surface is usually related to the coating quality. This paper is related to a procedure for recovering the specular sharpness and other surface-related properties from objects. The current approach works on 3D plus brightness or color data, which are retrieved in two steps using a common structured-light triangulation-based technique and an ordinary non-structured spot light.

Water balance was developed using the WetSpass model and GIS spatial data, based on hydrometeorological data from the reference period of 1961–2000 including projected land usage changes and precipitation changes expected by 2025 in the city. The catchments were parameterised with reference to land usage, soil permeability, terrain declivities and the level of groundwater waters in summer and winter. The dependence between HRUs and their impact on components of the water balance was determined. Water balance forecasts have shown two-way changes in the components of approximately 12% of the catchments. A significant increase of surface runoff (an increase of 20–30 mm/HRU) at the expense of effective infiltration reduction (by 15–20 mm/HRU) was determined for arable land intended for development. An increase of infiltration and evapotranspiration at the expense of the surface runoff reduction is forecast for areas designed for urban afforestation. The tendency of increase of atmospheric precipitation within the city until 2025 was indicated by changes in the water balance components. Changes in the landscape resulting from urban expansion may lead to detrimental hydrological effects: accumulation of surface runoffs and occurrence of local flash flooding, as confirmed by the simulations carried out using the WetSpass model. The results may contribute to a more accurate understanding of the impact of urban landscape modification patterns on the water balance at the regional and local scale.	atmospheric dispersion modeling;code;coefficient;color balance;database;detailed balance;geographic information system;hru (security);homeostasis;interaction;peripheral;record sealing;simulation;typset and runoff;tree accumulation;uncontrolled format string;urban computing;urban ecosystem	Renata Graf;Kamil Jawgiel	2018	ISPRS Int.

Most of the methods assume that the intensities are a priori known. In practice, however, this information is usually not available. Therefore, the problem of the estimation of the intensity levels has been recently addressed by many researchers. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the tomographic reconstruction of binary images, when the two gray-levels are unknown. The problem is traced back to the minimization of an appropriate objective functional, in which a higher-order statistics-based discretization term enforces binary solutions. Instead of the gray-levels, the only parameter of this term is their mid-level value, which is iteratively approximated during the optimization process. Experiments on synthetic phantom images as well as on real data show that the proposed graduated optimization scheme can efficiently minimize the objective functional and the method provides accurate reconstructions. Compared to some of the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method provides competitive results, while it requires less parameter settings, thus it can be considered as a valid alternative.	approximation algorithm;binary image;discrete tomography;discretization;experiment;graduated optimization;mathematical optimization;phantom reference;synthetic data;tomographic reconstruction	József Németh	2015	Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision	10.1007/s10851-015-0581-0	econometrics;mathematical optimization;kurtosis;mathematics;statistics	Vision	56.09225550757885	-73.3519330776247	36557
e8fb97972505e93fa6f5376dca829c8ae0491aa3	regional water balance based on remotely sensed evapotranspiration and irrigation: an assessment of the haihe plain, china	remote sensing technique;etwatch;et;irrigation requirement	Optimal planning and management of the limited water resources for maximum productivity in agriculture requires quantifying the irrigation applied at a regional scale. However, most efforts involving remote sensing applications in assessing large-scale irrigation applied (IA) have focused on supplying spatial variables for crop models or studying evapotranspiration (ET) inversions, rather than directly building a remote sensing data-based model to estimate IA. In this study, based on remote sensing data, an IA estimation model together with an ET calculation model (ETWatch) is set up to simulate the spatial distribution of IA in the Haihe Plain of northern China. We have verified this as an effective approach for the simulation of regional IA, being more reflective of regional characteristics and of higher resolution compared to single site-specific results. The results show that annual ET varies from 527 mm to 679 mm and IA varies from 166 mm to OPEN ACCESS Remote Sens. 2014, 6 2515 289 mm, with average values of 602 mm and 225 mm, respectively, from 2002 to 2007. We confirm that the region along the Taihang Mountain in Hebei Plain has serious water resource sustainability problems, even while receiving water from the South-North Water Transfer (SNWT) project. This is due to the region’s intensive agricultural production and declining groundwater tables. Water-saving technologies, including more timely and accurate geo-specific IA assessments, may help reduce this threat.	electron tomography;simulation	Yanmin Yang;Yonghui Yang;Deli Liu;Tom Nordblom;Bingfang Wu;Nana Yan	2014	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs6032514	hydrology;remote sensing	AI	84.83490101379071	-57.415585534701094	36621

Because CPR operated in daylight-only data collection mode, daytime products were validated in this study. It is important to note that the different sensor characteristics cause differences in CTH retrievals. The CTH of active instruments, CPR and CALIOP, is derived from the return time of the backscattered radar or LiDAR signal, while the infrared sensor, SEVIRI, measures a radiatively effective CTH. Therefore, some systematic differences in comparison results are expected. However, similarities in spatial distribution and seasonal variability of COFs were noted among SEVIRI, CALIOP, and CPR products, although COF derived by the SEVIRI algorithm showed biases of 14.35% and −3.90% compared with those from CPR and CALIOP measurements, respectively. We found that the SEVIRI algorithm estimated larger COF values than the CPR product, especially over oceans, whereas smaller COF was detected by SEVIRI measurements over land and in the tropics than by CALIOP, where multi-layer clouds and thin cirrus clouds are dominant. CTHs derived from SEVIRI showed better agreement with CPR than with CALIOP. Further comparison with CPR showed that SEVIRI CTH was highly sensitive to the CO2 bias correction used in the Minimum Residual method. Compared with CPR CTHs, SEVIRI has produced stable CTHs since the bias correction update in November 2013, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, bias of −0.27 km, and standard deviation of 1.61 km.	a-train;algorithm;coefficient;daylight;high- and low-level;layer (electronics);one-to-one (data model);polarization (waves);radar;std bus;sensor;spatial variability;thickness (graph theory)	Chu-Yong Chung;Peter N.

Superpositions of periodic dot screens are largely used in electronic imaging in the field of color printing. In such superpositions the interaction between the superposed layers may cause new structures to appear which did not exist in any of the original layers: macrostructures (also known as moiré patterns) and microstructures (also known as rosettes). While macrostructures are not always generated in the superposition (cf. moiré-free superpositions), microstructures exist practically in any superposition, except for the most trivial cases. In fact, even the macrostructures, whenever they occur, consist of variations in the microstructure of the superposition. In the present paper we investigate the microstructures that appear in the superposition of periodic structures and their properties. We also find the conditions on the superposed layers under which the microstructure of the superposition varies—or remains invariant—when individual layers in the superposition are laterally shifted with respect to each other. © 2002 SPIE and IS&T.

Two approaches that contribute to pH mapping were compared. Firstly, high-altitude spectroradiometry (ASTER - Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer satellite data) together with ground-based spectroradiometry (ASD Filedspec spectroradiometer) were employed in order to identify the locations of the most significant sources of AMD discharge at the Sokolov lignite open-pit mines, Czech Republic. As a result, a map with delineated low-pH zones was created. Secondly, the feasibility of mapping surface pH on the basis of airborne multi-flight-line HyMap hyperspectral (HS) datasets was tested. The geochemical and mineral property was linked with emissivity spectra acquired in the field and laboratory. The spectral property of both AMD indicating minerals and the organic component occurring as part of mixtures proved to be identified using spectroscopy and spectral feature fitting (SFF) technique was employed to map the defined endmembers indicating a certain pH ranges in the HS image datasets.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;airborne ranger;discharger;hymap;multispectral image	Veronika Kopacková;Stephane Chevrel;Anna Bourguignon;Petr Rojík	2012	2012 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6350372	mining engineering;spectroscopy;radiometer;optics;hazardous waste;ph;mineralogy;aster;physics;remote sensing	Embedded	80.84117331086647	-61.369582026755346	36881

Based on this simple approximation, satellites have acquired plenty of large samples on basin-traversing swells induced by fierce storms situated in mid-latitudes. How to routinely reconstruct swell fields with these irregularly sampled observations from space via known swell propagation principle requires more examination. In this study, we apply 3-h interval pseudo SAR observations in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to reconstruct a swell field in ocean basin, and compare it with buoy swell partitions and polynomial regression results. As validated against in situ measurements, EnKF works well in terms of spatial-temporal consistency in far-field swell propagation scenarios. Using this framework, we further address the influence of EnKF parameters, and perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate estimations made under different sets of parameters. Such analysis is of key interest with respect to future multiple-source routinely recorded swell field data. Satellite-derived swell data can serve as a valuable complementary dataset to in situ or wave re-analysis datasets.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;computer simulation;data sources;data assimilation;data validation;ensemble kalman filter;estimated;ground truth;hypertrophy;interaction;interpolation;interrupt storm;normal statistical distribution;one thousand;physical phenomenon or property;polynomial;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;religious missions;sample variance;sampling - surgical action;satellite viruses;sensitivity and specificity;sensor;silo (dataset);situated;software propagation;symbolic computation;time consistency;time series;vergence;wavelength	Xuan Wang;Pierre Tandeo;Ronan Fablet;Romain Husson;Lei Guan;Ge Chen	2016		10.3390/s16122000	meteorology;remote sensing	Vision	73.07368797436855	-69.29536035423875	37289

This, however, is not effective in case of hyper-spectral images (HSI) because they contain dozens of informative spectral bands. To eliminate redundancy of spectral information among these bands, dimensionality reduction (DR) is applied while at the same trying to retain maximum information. In this paper, we propose a new method of information-preserved hyperspectral satellite image visualization that is based on fusion of unsupervised band selection techniques and color matching function (CMF) stretching. The results show consistent, edge-preserved and pre-attentive feature less images with high class separability. Different visualization techniques are compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme that can prompt an important advancement in the field.	dimensionality reduction;horizontal situation indicator;information;linear separability;list of content management frameworks	Sumera Sattar;Haris Ahmad Khan;Khurram Khurshid	2016	2016 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729700	full spectral imaging;computer vision;color image;imaging spectroscopy;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;machine learning;pattern recognition;image segmentation;data visualization;statistics;remote sensing;principal component analysis	Visualization	68.62078254366311	-63.763650764333704	37341

As an example, this letter examines the electromagnetic (EM) response of a metallic object that is submerged in a conducting layer of seawater that is situated between an infinite half-space of air and a seabed of lower electrical conductivity. When the source and the object are at some distance away in the water, the primary EM propagation mode is on the interfaces because the surface waves are less attenuated than those following the direct or reflected propagation paths. The simulation tool that predicts the performances of the EM detection system uses the method-of-moments integral equation technique. The method is validated and applied to calculate the scattered fields from a submerged perfectly conducting cylinder. The numerical results are then compared with experimental data that are obtained by towing a steel cylinder through an impressed field that is produced by a horizontal electric source.	cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;frequency response;numerical analysis;performance;prospective search;remote sensing application;simulation;situated;software propagation;surface wave	Marius Birsan	2007	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2007.900698	geophysics;exploration geophysics;surface wave;optics;electrical resistivity and conductivity;physics;quantum mechanics;remote sensing	Robotics	84.04038592632392	-67.5461978964777	37399

In this paper, axial signal analysis is carried on and reconstruction methods for a sample’s axial photoacoustic (PA) image are researched based on the acoustic-lens PA imaging system. The integral and envelope methods are both proposed to reconstruct a sample’s axial PA image, which has only been achieved approximately by the PA signals’ peak values obtained by a peak-holding circuit in previous reports. And the envelope method is proposed for the first time. Hilbert transform was used to obtain the envelope of the sample’s PA signals and axial PA images. Simulation results show that the integral method is appropriate for low frequency samples, and that the envelope reconstruction method can provide low frequency information of the PA images of samples. So for a sample, it would be best to combine the two methods together.	acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustic fingerprint;digital single-lens reflex camera;hilbert transform;iterative reconstruction;lateral thinking;pa-risc;photoacoustic imaging;signal processing;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yu Zhang;Zhilie Tang;Yongbo Wu;F.

144b5f98103086c7e6c835710518d935a0336292	adaptive enhancement for nonuniform illumination images via nonlinear mapping		Nonuniform illumination images suffer from degenerated details because of underexposure, overexposure, or a combination of both. To improve the visual quality of color images, underexposure regions should be lightened, whereas overexposure areas need to be dimmed properly. However, discriminating between underexposure and overexposure is troublesome. Compared with traditional methods that produce a fixed demarcation value throughout an image, the proposed demarcation changes as local luminance varies, thus is suitable for manipulating complicated illumination. Based on this locally adaptive demarcation, a nonlinear modification is applied to image luminance. Further, with the modified luminance, we propose a nonlinear process to reconstruct a luminance-enhanced color image. For every pixel, this nonlinear process takes the luminance change and the original chromaticity into account, thus trying to avoid exaggerated colors at dark areas and depressed colors at highly bright regions. Finally, to improve image contrast, a local and image-dependent exponential technique is designed and applied to the RGB channels of the obtained color image. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces good contrast and vivid color for both nonuniform illumination images and images with normal illumination. © The Authors.

Ballistic missile defense is a complex system with many distributed components: radar and imaging sensors, wireless and satellite communications, digital signal processing nodes, interceptor fire control, and command centers. The U.S. Navy has investigated the feasibility of missile defense through the light exo-atmospheric projectile (LEAP) experiment. This paper explains the lessons learned by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory from building, integrating, and testing instrumentation in the LEAP experiment and give insights for designing complex systems. The biggest challenge in the LEAP experiment involved people: communications between the large number of contractors and their understanding of the interactions between the various instruments. Other concerns included verifying software and system operation, robust data and satellite communications, time and coordinate conversions, and electromagnetic interference. LEAP demonstrated that complex systems, and missile defense system in particular, can only work through careful design, dedicated teamwork, clear and continuous communications, and extensive testing.	ballistic missile;communications satellite;complex system;complex systems;digital signal processing;interaction;interceptor pattern;interference (communication);radar;sensor;verification and validation	Kim R.

Time-of-flight cameras can provide depth information in real-time and overcome short-comings of traditional stereo analysis. However, they provide limited spatial resolution and sophisticated upscaling algorithms are sought after. In this paper, we present a sensor fusion approach to time-of-flight super resolution, based on the combination of depth and texture sources. Unlike other texture guided approaches, we interpret the depth upscaling process as a weighted energy optimization problem. Three different weights are introduced, employing different available sensor data. The individual weights address object boundaries in depth, depth sensor noise, and temporal consistency. Applied in consecutive order, they form three weighting strategies for time-of-flight super resolution. Objective evaluations show advantages in depth accuracy and for depth image based rendering compared with state-of-the-art depth upscaling. Subjective view synthesis evaluation shows a significant increase in viewer preference by a factor of four in stereoscopic viewing conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive subjective test performed on time-of-flight depth upscaling. Objective and subjective results proof the suitability of our approach to time-of-flight super resolution approach for depth scenery capture.	algorithm;asthenopia;color vision defect;computer vision;depth map;dizziness;evaluation;holism;html link type - copyright;image noise;image resolution;mathematical optimization;morphologic artifacts;optimization problem;photogrammetry;range imaging;real-time locating system;robotics;sensor;stereopsis;stereoscopy;super-resolution imaging;traffic sign recognition;treatment services review;verification of theories;view synthesis;weight;brightness	Sebastian Schwarz;Mårten Sjöström;Roger Olsson	2014	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2013.2287613	image texture;stereo cameras;computer vision;image resolution;computer science;signal processing;image sensor;image fusion;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	58.417791716653205	-57.205362072218584	37549

105f6c2e52425797a2d96040d06b80e782d42d11	a novel scheme for mimo-sar systems using rotational orbital angular momentum	rotational doppler effect (rde);multi-input–multi-output synthetic aperture radar (mimo-sar);orbital angular momentum (oam);vortex electromagnetic (em) waves	The vortex electromagnetic (EM) wave with orbital angular momentum (OAM) brings a new degree of freedom for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, although to date, its application to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) SAR has not yet been widely reported. In this paper, an orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based MIMO-SAR system is proposed. The rotational Doppler Effect (RDE) of vortex EM waves offers a novel scheme for an OAM-based MIMO-SAR system. By transmitting the rotational vortex EM waves, echoes of different OAM modes can be discriminated by a bandpass filter in the range-Doppler domain. The performance of the proposed scheme is independent of the time-variant channel responses, and the wider beam width of the vortex EM waves delivers, for the same antenna aperture size, better performance in terms of swath width and azimuth resolution, in contrast to the plane EM waves. Moreover, the spatial diversity of vortex EM waves shows great potential to enhance the MIMO-SAR system applications, which involve high-resolution wide-swath remote sensing, 3-D imaging, and radar-communication integration. The proposed scheme is verified by proof-of-concept experiments.

892c6faa4a18e6b20e1fde5900a50544a9a93d98	removal of impulse noise from color images based on the localized image characteristics and noise level		The proposed method is a switching vector median filter that utilizes suitable noise detection and restoration algorithms for different impulse noise densities. It works in a multistage manner with an enhancing accuracy of noise detection in each successive stage. The processing window is initially categorized into a non-edge-window and an edge-window, depending on the scale of abrupt transitions. The non-edge-window is further verified to be a smooth-window or a disorder-window, whereas the edge-window is again confirmed to be noise-free or a noisy edge-window. The proposed method is simulated on a variety of medical images and other standard test images to prove its efficiency in detection of noise and restoration.	impulse noise (audio);noise (electronics)	K.

Discriminating the various scatterer types from a composite echo is challenging due to variability in scatterres' quantity, azimuthal dependences of their polarimetric properties, and uneven mixing in resolution volumes. We use polarimetric spectral densities to estimate the volume content by constructing two dimensional (2D) histograms. The dimensions used to form image are Doppler velocity and polarimetric variable. The assimilation of these histograms in azimuth results in a 3D-azimuthal-spectral-histogram (3DASH). This representation allows us to use transparency for small occurrences to visualize the 3D-signatures of dominant content. The scatterer types have distinguishable signatures in 3DASH due to their diverse physical shapes, scattering properties, different headings, and speeds. 3DASH can help to understand what constitutes the polarimetric averages of the resolution volume. 3DASH can help provide resources for establishing intrinsic polarimetric values/functions for different types of biological scatterers, which are necessary for scatterer classification algorithms.	algorithm;data assimilation;polarimetry;spatial variability;type signature;velocity (software development)	Svetlana Bachmann;Dusan Zrnic;Victor E.

903261681ce9419a2482ebff87b98f031ff47946	spectral analysis and sensitive waveband determination based on nitrogen detection of different soil types using near infrared sensors	bipls;bpnn;cars;nir sensors;pls;sensitive wavebands;soil nitrogen	Compared with the chemical analytical technique, the soil nitrogen acquisition method based on near infrared (NIR) sensors shows significant advantages, being rapid, nondestructive, and convenient. Providing an accurate grasp of different soil types, sensitive wavebands could enhance the nitrogen estimation efficiency to a large extent. In this paper, loess, calcium soil, black soil, and red soil were used as experimental samples. The prediction models between soil nitrogen and NIR spectral reflectance were established based on three chemometric methods, that is, partial least squares (PLS), backward interval partial least squares (BIPLS), and back propagation neural network (BPNN). In addition, the sensitive wavebands of four kinds of soils were selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and BIPLS. The predictive ability was assessed by the coefficient of determination R² and the root mean square error (RMSE). As a result, loess ( 0.93 < R p 2 < 0.95 , 0.066 g / kg < RMSE p < 0.075 g / kg ) and calcium soil ( 0.95 < R p 2 < 0.96 , 0.080 g / kg < RMSE p < 0.102 g / kg ) achieved a high prediction accuracy regardless of which algorithm was used, while black soil ( 0.79 < R p 2 < 0.86 , 0.232 g / kg < RMSE p < 0.325 g / kg ) obtained a relatively lower prediction accuracy caused by the interference of high humus content and strong absorption. The prediction accuracy of red soil ( 0.86 < R p 2 < 0.87 , 0.231 g / kg < RMSE p < 0.236 g / kg ) was similar to black soil, partly due to the high content of iron-aluminum oxide. Compared with PLS and BPNN, BIPLS performed well in removing noise and enhancing the prediction effect. In addition, the determined sensitive wavebands were 1152 nm-1162 nm and 1296 nm-1309 nm (loess), 1036 nm-1055 nm and 1129 nm-1156 nm (calcium soil), 1055 nm, 1281 nm, 1414 nm-1428 nm and 1472 nm-1493 nm (black soil), 1250 nm, 1480 nm and 1680 nm (red soil). It is of great value to investigate the differences among the NIR spectral characteristics of different soil types and determine sensitive wavebands for the more efficient and portable NIR sensors in practical application.	algorithm;aluminum oxide;artificial neural network;backpropagation;biological neural networks;calcium;coefficient of determination;epilepsies, partial;frequency band;humus;interference (communication);mean squared error;nitrogen;papillon-lefevre disease;partial least squares regression;plant roots;sampling (signal processing);software propagation;soil;spectroscopy, near-infrared;spectrum analyzer;sensor (device)	Shupei Xiao;Yong He;Tao Dong;Pengcheng Nie	2018		10.3390/s18020523	engineering;humus;analytical chemistry;soil classification;partial least squares regression;red soil;coefficient of determination;nitrogen;soil water;near-infrared spectroscopy	ML	87.45188662069117	-53.609425197288395	37763

Following the recent paradigm of super-resolution, we formulate a dedicated atomic norm penalty and we solve this optimization problem by means of a primal-dual algorithm. This parsimonious model enables the reconstruction of lines from lowpass measurements, even in presence of a large amount of noise or blur. Furthermore, a Prony method performed on rows and columns of the restored image, provides a spectral estimation of the line parameters, with subpixel accuracy.	column (database);convex optimization;deblurring;diffusing update algorithm;gaussian blur;inpainting;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;noise (electronics);occam's razor;optimization problem;pixel;programming paradigm;prony's method;quasiperiodicity;spectral density estimation;super-resolution imaging;triune continuum paradigm	Kevin Polisano;Laurent Condat;Marianne Clausel;Valérie Perrier	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760265	computer vision;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematics	Vision	57.27124361542435	-72.67189963405157	37864

The X-band sensitivity to snow status was analyzed using two different electromagnetic approaches: 1st Radiative Transfer model, IEM, and a multi-scattering and multi-layer snow scattering model. It results that the description of the dry snow requires a more detailed information about the underlying layers to extract information about the volumetric and ground contribution of the snowpack. The comparison between multi-scattering and multi-layer model predictions and SAR data indicates a better agreement between the measurements and co-polarized backscattering values with respect to the cross polarized backscattering values which appears to be lower than expected indicating that a detailed description on the land surface parameters might help to generate more accurate simulations. The change detection technique for the detection of wet snow was investigated to obtain snow cover map. By using the threshold of -3dB the two frequency distributions for the snow and no-snow areas, are wellseparated only in the case of wet snow areas; on the contrary it results that, at the beginning of the melting season, the frequency distribution still overlaps. From the comparison with LANDSAT 7 ETM+ derived snow map, the omission error of 9.11% and the commission error of 1.84% confirm the typical underestimation of snow cover from SAR images with respect to optical images.© (2011) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The processing time of the MIP depends on the number of voxels of the 3D data. Therefore, it is very difficult to realize the MIP of the 3D medical image in real time. In order to overcome the large amount of computation for the MIP, we have developed a hierarchical MIP method that can perform the first-step MIP with sub-sampled image. At second step, the lowresolution MIP image can be used to save the computation time of the full-resolution MIP image. The hierarchical MIP method was implemented and its computation complexity was analyzed.	algorithm;computation;maximum intensity projection;medical imaging;time complexity;voxel	Keun Ho Kim;Min Jeong Kwon;Hyun Wook Park	2000		10.1109/ICIP.2000.901066	computer vision;image resolution;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;data visualization;computer graphics (images)	ML	68.92044479746262	-53.713000230391515	37879

The efficiency of the proposed approach is achieved in two ways. First, we formulate the dictionary matrix as a block multilevel Toeplitz matrix to minimize redundancy and thus memory consumption. Second, we exploit this specific structure in the dictionary to speed up the correlation step in OMP, which is implemented matrix-free. We compare our method to state-of-the-art, namely 3D Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique, and show that it delivers a visually comparable performance, while it gains the additional freedom to use further methods such as Compressed Sensing.

9eed5d2704a368f0a9e8cdc821c7190f8ead0132	no-reference image quality assessment with local features and high-order derivatives		Abstract The perceptual quality of images is often affected by applied image processing techniques. Their evaluation requires tests which involve human subjects. However, in most cases, image quality assessment (IQA) should be automatic and reproducible. Therefore, in this paper, a novel no-reference IQA method is proposed. The method uses high-order derivatives to extract detailed structure deformation present in distorted images. Furthermore, it employs local features, considering that only some regions of an image carry interesting information. Then, statistics of local features are used by a support vector regression technique to provide an objective quality score. To improve the quality prediction, luminance and chrominance channels of the image are processed. Experimental results on six large-scale public IQA image datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hand-crafted and deep-learning techniques in terms of the visual quality prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the method is better than popular full-reference approaches (i.e., SSIM and PSNR).	image quality	Mariusz Oszust	2018	J.

Their detection is required prior to any restoration. The goal of this paper is to reduce the false alarm rate of the detection. By assuming that blotches correspond to local illumination variations between the degraded frame and its surrounding ones, the novelty of the approach we propose is threefold. Firstly, an appropriate photometric parametric model is adopted. Secondly, a motion analysis involving a robust adaptive cross-correlation measure is used to locally measure the illumination variation. Thirdly, the extension to color sequences is performed. Experimental evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed preprocessing.	circuit restoration;color;cross-correlation;list of common shading algorithms;parametric model;preprocessor	Heyfa Ammar-Badri;Amel Benazza-Benyahia	2013	21st European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2013)		computer vision;geography;pattern recognition;optics	Vision	55.478164553630826	-59.182549441670396	38067

The object of this paper is to investigate the estimation of volumetric soil moisture in vegetated areas of plateau pasture using fully polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. Based on the water cloud model, Chen model, and Dubois model, we proposed two developed algorithms for soil moisture retrieval and validated their performance using experimental data. We eliminated the effect of vegetation cover by using the water cloud model and minimized the effect of soil surface roughness by solving the Dubois equations. Two experimental campaigns were conducted in the Qinghai Lake watershed, northeastern Tibetan Plateau in September 2012 and May 2013, respectively, with simultaneous satellite overpass. Compared with the developed Chen model, the predicted soil moisture given by the developed Dubois model agreed better with field measurements in terms of accuracy and stability. The RMSE, R2, and RPD value of the developed Dubois model were (5.4, 0.8, 1.6) and (3.05, 0.78, 1.74) for the two experiments, respectively. Validation results indicated that the developed Dubois model, needing a minimum of prior information, satisfied the requirement for soil moisture inversion in the study region.	algorithm;chen model;cloud computing;coefficient;entity–relationship model;experiment;image resolution;jaccard index;plateau effect;polarimetry;radar;watershed (image processing)	Xun Chai;Tingting Zhang;Yun Shao;Huaze Gong;Long Liu;Kaixin Xie	2015	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs70201279	water content;hydrology;specific absorption rate;soil science;remote sensing	Robotics	84.3637353765808	-61.136635061874586	38116

The adequate centre weight is the output of fuzzy rules in order to attain the final output pixel, which is adaptive with the sliding of the local filtering window in raster scanning order across the image. Unlike the previous detection based filters looking for the threshold iteratively, the proposed filter establishes the associated rules quickly and in a straightforward manner. A lot of computer simulations show that the proposed FCWM filter can achieve a superior performance either in detail preservation or in noise suppression.	fuzzy rule;median filter	Tung-Chien Chiang;Chih-Hui Chiu;Wen-June Wang	2006	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2006.011145	computer simulation;fuzzy logic;filter;adaptive filter;median filter;image restoration;knowledge base;raster graphics;kernel adaptive filter;membership function;defuzzification;image processing;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;machine learning;noise reduction;mathematics;fuzzy set;expert system;active filter;algorithm;weighting filter	Vision	54.76717951870597	-65.97982948014486	38154

We blindly estimate the blur from the salient edges of the code in an iterative optimization scheme, alternating between image sharpening, blur estimation, and decoding. The restored image is constrained to exploit the properties of QR codes which ensures fast convergence. The checksum of the code allows early termination when the code is first readable and precludes false positive detections. General blur removal algorithms perform poorly in restoring visual codes and are slow even on high-performance PCs. The proposed algorithm achieves good reconstruction quality on QR codes and outperforms existing methods in terms of speed. We present PC and Android implementations of a complete QR scanner and evaluate the algorithm on synthetic and real test images.

Besides polarimetric applications, also interferometric SAR processing can be significantly affected. Relative range shifts, internal image deformations, range and azimuth blurring, and interferometric phase errors are the most significant effects to be considered. In this paper we provide the theoretical background for ionospheric effects on InSAR. We quantify expected magnitudes of the respective effects for various existing SAR sensors and discuss methods for their detection and correction. Real data examples, mainly stemming from the ALOS PALSAR mission, are presented to verify the derived theory.	carrier frequency;distortion;group delay and phase delay;polarimetry;sensor;skywave;software propagation;stemming	Franz J.

This technology allows direct measurements without prior sample treatment. Ninety one samples of propolis were collected in Chile (Bio-Bio region) and Spain (Castilla-León and Galicia regions). The minerals measured were aluminum, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and some potentially toxic trace elements such as zinc, chromium, nickel, copper and lead. The modified partial least squares (MPLS) regression method was used to develop the NIR calibration model. The determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) obtained for aluminum (0.79, 53), calcium (0.83, 94), iron (0.69, 134) potassium (0.95, 117), magnesium (0.70, 99), phosphorus (0.94, 24) zinc (0.87, 10) chromium (0.48, 0.6) nickel (0.52, 0.7) copper (0.64, 0.9) and lead (0.70, 2) in ppm. The results demonstrated that the capacity for prediction can be considered good for wide ranges of potassium, phosphorus and zinc concentrations, and acceptable for aluminum, calcium, magnesium, iron and lead. This indicated that the NIR method is comparable to chemical methods. The method is of interest in the rapid prediction of potentially toxic elements in propolis before consumption.	aluminum measurement;calcium;chromium;coefficient of determination;dietary aluminum;dietary copper;dietary nickel;effective method;eye;magnesium;mean squared error;minerals;multistage interconnection networks;ninety nine;optical fiber;partial least squares regression;phosphorus;potassium;propolis;quantitation;regression analysis;reifenstein syndrome;root mean square;spectroscopy, near-infrared;tissue fiber;trace elements;contents - htmllinktype;part per million (ppm)	M.

Super resolution image reconstruction (SRR) is one of the commonest SR technologies and has been proposed in many forms. SRR reconstructs a highresolution image from multiple low-resolution images. However, the low-resolution images require an aliasing process prior to reconstruction. The present paper analyzes SRR in the frequency domain, and demonstrates that SRR is unsuitable for general applications.	aliasing;domain analysis;image processing;image resolution;iterative reconstruction;simpl;super-resolution imaging;video	Seiichi Gohshi	2015	2015 10th Asia-Pacific Symposium on Information and Telecommunication Technologies (APSITT)	10.1109/APSITT.2015.7217088	computer vision;image resolution;mathematics;optics;sub-pixel resolution;computer graphics (images)	Vision	59.76534209723688	-57.15441916985578	38402

The data is used to test a procedure that allows us to estimate visible surface reflectance from the longer wavelength 2.1 _tm channel (mid-IR). Estimating or avoiding surface reflectance in the visible is a vital first step in most algorithms that retrieve aerosol optical thickness over land targets. The data indicate that specular reflection found when viewing targets from the forward direction can severely corrupt the relationships between the visible and 2.1 _tm reflectance that were derived from nadir data. There is a month by month variation in the ratios between the visible and the mid-IR, weakly correlated to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). If specular reflection is not avoided, the errors resulting from estimating surface reflectance from the mid-IR exceed the acceptable limit of Ap 0.01 in roughly 40% of the cases, using the current algorithm. This is reduced to 25% of the cases if specular reflection is avoided. An alternative method that uses path radiance rather than explicitly estimating visible surface reflectance results in similar errors. The two methods have different strengths and weaknesses that require further study. 1.0 Introduction When viewed from space, the striking difference between land and ocean surfaces is the uniformity of the ocean and the large spatial variability of the land. Land surface reflectance is dependent on the type of vegetation and the type of soil, as well as the relative fraction of each (Huete and Tucker, 1990). Surface reflectance varies as the vegetation progresses through its growing cycle. It also varies due to seasonal changes in soil moisture and hydrological	algorithm;angularjs;circuit complexity;mobile device;seasonality;spatial variability;thickness (graph theory);tucker decomposition	Lorraine Remer;Andrew E.

Data from 4- and 11 μm bands are projected onto a new coordinates system provided by the decorrelating Principal Component Analysis. A robust PCA is obtained by using the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator for the covariance matrix that acts by strongly reducing the influence of thermal anomalies. A statistical validation has been carried out through a large bulk of data testing that the first and the second data component well fit a Gaussian and a Log-Normal distribution, respectively. Thus the first component directly satisfies the Location Scale property required for a CFAR detection, while for the second component the same property may be satisfied after a logarithmic transformation. A CFAR detection is applied to projected data and results of the two detectors are combined into a fusion block. Thanks to independence of uncorrelated data the two single detections can be combined with an AND or OR rule, and the overall false alarm probability is the product or the sum of corresponding per-channel probabilities. The results obtained in both cases are compared with the standard NASA-DAC-MOD14 product as a benchmark.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);constant false alarm rate;decorrelation;ground truth;performance;pixel;principal component analysis;sensor;statistical model	Tiziana Beltramonte;Maurizio di Bisceglie;Carmela Galdi;Silvia Liberata Ullo	2012	2012 Tyrrhenian Workshop on Advances in Radar and Remote Sensing (TyWRRS)	10.1109/TyWRRS.2012.6381138	econometrics;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	ML	72.4909680016673	-64.04300570893143	38482

They make possible to call the individual proximity operators of an arbitrary number of functions, whose sum is to be minimized. But the larger this number, the slower the convergence. In this letter, we show how to compute the proximity operator of a sum of two functions, for a certain type of functions operating on objects having a graph structure.

In this paper, a robust data-driven grating lobe suppression (GLS) method is proposed. Based on a contrast-based error estimation method and the grating lobes of the brightest scatterers in the SAR image, the periodic MEPE can be robustly estimated using the proposed method. By compensating the estimated periodic MEPE, the range grating lobes can be suppressed to the background level of the SAR image. Simulation results and real data processing have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.	acoustic lobing;aperture (software);arrayed waveguide grating;epilepsy, temporal lobe;generalized least squares;image resolution;nr1i2 wt allele;simulation;synthetic intelligence;transfer function;ultra-wideband;unmanned aerial vehicle;waveform;zero suppression	Wenbin Gao;Teng Long;Zegang Ding;Yi-Rong Wu	2016		10.3390/s16122066	computer vision;electronic engineering;optics	Robotics	76.07893503915767	-67.34561980820531	38559

A microwave inverse-scattering nested scheme combining a frequency hopping (FH) procedure and a multifocusing (MF) technique is proposed. On the one hand, the FH scheme effectively handles multifrequency GPR data, whereas on the other hand, MF techniques have been proven to be effective tools in reducing the occurrence of multilocal minima affecting GPR investigations. This allows the use of a local search technique based on the conjugate gradient method to iteratively solve the inverse problem at hand. Selected results are reported and analyzed to give some insights to the interested readers on the advantages and limitations of such an approach when handling synthetically generated and experimental GPR data.	algorithm;cg (programming language);conjugate gradient method;firefox;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;iterative method;kriging;local search (optimization);loss function;maxima and minima;microwave;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;scheme;single-frequency network;synthetic intelligence;transmitter	Marco Salucci;Giacomo Oliveri;Andrea Massa	2015	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2015.2444391	database index;ground-penetrating radar;inverse problem;remote sensing	Visualization	77.56673436124315	-70.0317715878988	38564
bc56a9df9c0c382dfea80f1c219259a7fdc492ec	fundamental limit of resolving two point sources limited by an arbitrary point spread function		Estimating the angular separation between two incoherently radiating monochromatic point sources is a canonical toy problem to quantify spatial resolution in imaging. In recent work, Tsang et al. showed, using a Fisher Information analysis, that Rayleigh's resolution limit is just an artifact of the conventional wisdom of intensity measurement in the image plane. They showed that the optimal sensitivity of estimating the angle is only a function of the total photons collected during the camera's integration time but entirely independent of the angular separation itself no matter how small it is, and found the information-optimal mode basis, intensity detection in which achieves the aforesaid performance. We extend the above analysis, which was done for a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) to a hard-aperture pupil proving the information optimality of image-plane sinc-Bessel modes, and generalize the result further to an arbitrary PSF. We obtain new counterintuitive insights on energy vs. information content in spatial modes, and extend the Fisher Information analysis to exact calculations of minimum mean squared error, both for Gaussian and hard aperture pupils.	angularjs;bessel filter;fisher information;image plane;mean squared error;monochrome;rayleigh–ritz method;self-information;sinc function;toy problem	Ronan Kerviche;Saikat Guha;Amit Ashok	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006566	optics	Vision	65.98904545242415	-71.47806650755375	38604

Global backscatter data is required for accurate performance estimation and instrument commanding inside the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions. Moreover, many scientific applications can be based on the analysis of backscatter behavior and evolution. The complete ground coverage will be achievable with TanDEM-X mission data. An interpolator, that allows the estimation of the backscatter for any required polarization and incidence angle from the available data, has been implemented. In this paper, the backscatter map generation algorithm will be presented, together with the first obtained results, generated using TerraSAR-X data. Moreover, the validity of the interpolation models will also be discussed, presenting the preliminary results of a statistical analysis of backscatter from TerraSAR-X data.	algorithm;backscatter (email);incidence matrix;interpolation;polarization (waves)	Paola Rizzoli;Benjamin Bräutigam;Steffen Wollstadt;Josef Mittermayer	2010	2010 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5654430	synthetic aperture radar;genetic algorithm;image resolution;geodesy;polarization;interpolation;optics;radar imaging;backscatter;physics;radar;satellite;pixel;angle of incidence;remote sensing	Robotics	78.90358800642659	-64.73005912453024	38638

The experimental devices consist of a 1920x1080 pixels color image processing system and a light box. This light box is used as an indirect lighting source to avoid the bright spot from the target if the direct light technique is used. The shrimps are taken by a video camcorder, then the real time video is executed from the moving video to images and recorded them as the image files. The images are considered and converted to binary data types. Blob detection algorithm is used to detect the difference properties of color within the regions in the digital image. After that, the results from the image processing methodology are compared with the real value. It found that the shrimp quantity getting from the image processing technique is comparable and corresponding to the real shrimp quantity counting by manual with error is less than 7% of real quantity.	algorithm;binary data;blob detection;color image;digital image;image file formats;image processing;pixel;sensor	Ramil Kesvarakul;Chamaporn Chianrabutra;Srisit Chianrabutra	2017		10.1145/3055635.3056652	digital image;bright spot;artificial intelligence;pixel;image processing;blob detection;pattern recognition;computer science;image file formats;color image;binary data;computer vision	Graphics	62.299281646264404	-58.22291260873382	38657

Future 3-D TV could enhance the visual home entertainment experience in a way that the user can navigate through the scene or switch the viewpoint. Moreover, new technologies such as autostereoscopic multiview displays provide a 3-D perception to the viewer without the need to wear additional glasses. For these technologies, the need arise to generate additional Virtual Views (ViV) of given scenes with different viewpoints. A new view can be synthesized at the receiver side by utilizing Depth Image-based Rendering (DIBR). Although DIBR has many advantages, one of the key challenges is, how to fill uncovered areas caused by disocclusions and incorrect depth values. To handle such disoccluded areas a new depth preprocessing method is proposed, which is applied prior to 3-D warping. Depth discontinuities in the Depth Map (DM) are smoothed to reduce the number and the size of uncovered areas in the ViV. Considering the fact that filtering the whole image introduces strong distortions, we adaptively weight the filter to reduce filter-induced artifacts. The proposed method shows considerable objective and subjective gains compared to the state-of-the-art.	3d television;artifact (error);autostereoscopy;depth map;distortion;glossary of computer graphics;preprocessor;smoothing	Martin Köppel;Mehdi Ben Makhlouf;Patrick Ndjiki-Nya	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738279	computer vision;distortion;image processing;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	59.90730752810542	-59.239984806203225	38671

Although the general problem of adding chromatic values to a greyscale image has no exact, objective solution, the current approach attempts to provide a method to help minimize the amount of human labor required for this task. Rather than choosing RGB colors from a palette to color individual components, we transfer the entire color """"mood"""" of the source to the target image by matching luminance and texture information between the images. We choose to transfer only chromatic information and retain the original luminance values of the target image. Further, the procedure is enhanced by allowing the user to match areas of the two images with rectangular swatches. We show that this simple technique can be successfully applied to a variety of images and video, provided that texture and luminance are sufficiently distinct.

647c9a9e9ad66b3a0939fa387623155854c1dee8	automatic estimation of the noise variance in sar images for use in speckle filtering		Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)is an active imaging system widely used in remote sensing applications. SARsystems are characterized by their high image resolution and all-weather operating ability, but suffer from the notorious speckle noise [1], which is a random multiplicative phenomenon that results from coherent imaging. In this paper we propose several heuristic methods for the estimation of the speckle noise variance. They can also be applied in other cases where multiplicative noise is present, and do not need specifically tuned input parameters.	aperture (software);coherence (physics);heuristic;image resolution;multiplicative noise	Giovanni Ramponi;Raffaele D'Alvise;Cecilia Moloney	1999			filter (signal processing);synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing application;speckle pattern;computer vision;speckle noise;multiplicative noise;computer science;phenomenon;artificial intelligence;image resolution	Robotics	72.80285032426738	-66.05276893686006	38687
d3e8cee189440bd0aee96b77a981353ed58bdd0a	reference input/output medium metric rgb color encoding (rimm/romm rgb)	satisfiability;color space;input output	A new color encoding specification known as Reference Output Medium Metric RGB (ROMM RGB) is defined. This color encoding is intended to be used for storing, interchanging and manipulating images that exist in a rendered image state without imposing the gamut limitations normally associated with device-specific color spaces. ROMM RGB was designed to provide a large enough color gamut to encompass most common output devices, while simultaneously satisfying a number of other important criteria. It is defined in a way that is tightly linked to the ICC profile connection space (PCS) and is suitable for use as an Adobe PhotoshopTM working color space. A companion color encoding specification, known as Reference Input Medium Metric RGB (RIMM RGB), is also defined. This encoding can be used to represent images in an unrendered scene image state. Introduction Digital images are often encoded in terms of color spaces that are tied directly to the characteristics of actual input or output devices. Common examples of such color spaces are scanner RGB, video RGB, and CMYK. However, such spaces generally are device-dependent in that their values can be associated with specific colorimetric values only in the context of the characteristics of the particular device on which the image is displayed or captured. On the other hand, device-independent color spaces generally are meant to represent colorimetric values directly. These color spaces most often are based on the system of colorimetry developed by the Commission International de l’Eclairage (CIE). Examples of such color spaces include CIE XYZ and CIELAB. It should be noted that the specification of a color value in a device-independent (or device-dependent) color space does not fully specify color appearance unless the viewing conditions also are known. For example, two patches with identical colorimetric values can have very different color appearance, depending on the conditions under which they are viewed. The fact that images exist in many different color spaces significantly complicates the development of software applications that use and manipulate images. For example, an image-processing algorithm that works in one color space might not have the expected behavior when used in another color space. This has led many people to advocate the use of a standard color encoding (or perhaps a small number of standard color encodings) for the storage, interchange and manipulation of digital images. Often, these proposals have involved specifying a particular output-device-dependent color space to be a “standard.” Examples of such color spaces include SWOP CMYK and sRGB. One significant problem with specifying an outputdevice-dependent color space as the standard is that typically it will limit the encodable color gamut and luminance dynamic range of images according to the capabilities of a specific output device. For example, hardcopy media and CRT displays typically have very different color gamuts. Therefore, using sRGB (which is based on a particular CRT model) as a standard color encoding would necessarily involve clipping many colors that could have been produced on a given hardcopy medium. The International Color Consortium (ICC) has defined a Profile Connection Space (PCS) that comprises a deviceindependent color encoding specification that can be used to explicitly specify the color of an image with respect to a reference viewing environment. Device profiles can be used in a color management system to relate the device-dependent code values of input images to the corresponding color values in the PCS, and from there to the device-dependent output color values appropriate for a specific output device. It could be argued that the PCS could serve as the standard color encoding we are looking for. However, it was never intended that the PCS be used to directly store or manipulate images. Rather, it was simply intended to be a color space where profiles could be joined to form complete input-tooutput color transforms. Neither the CIELAB nor the XYZ color encodings supported for the PCS is particularly well suited for many common kinds of image manipulations. It is therefore desirable to define a standard large-gamut color encoding that can be used for storing, interchanging and manipulating color images. This paper will describe a new color space known as Reference Output Medium Metric RGB (ROMM RGB). This color encoding is tightly coupled to the ICC PCS and is intended to be used for encoding rendered output images in a device-independent fashion. Rendered output images should be distinguished from images that are intended to be an encoding of the colors of an original scene. It is well known that the colorimetry of a pleasing rendered image does not match the colorimetry of the corresponding scene. Among other things, the tone/color reproduction process that “renders” the colors of a scene to the desired colors of the rendered image must compensate for differences between the scene and rendered image viewing conditions. For example, rendered images generally are viewed at luminance levels much lower than those of typical outdoor scenes. As a consequence, an increase in the overall contrast of the rendered image usually is required in order to compensate for perceived losses in reproduced luminance and chrominance. Additional contrast increases in the shadow regions of the image also are needed to compensate for viewing flare associated with renderedimage viewing conditions. In addition, psychological factors such as color memory and color preference must be considered in image rendering. For example, observers generally remember colors as being of higher purity, and they typically prefer skies and grass to be more colorful than they were in the original scene. The tone/color reproduction aims of well-designed imaging systems are designed to account for such factors. Finally, the tone/color reproduction process also must account for the fact that the dynamic range of a rendered image usually is substantially less than that of an original scene. It is therefore necessary to discard and/or compress some of the highlight and shadow information of the scene to fit within the dynamic range of the rendered image. Due to these and other factors, color encodings such as ROMM RGB that are intended for encoding rendered output images are inappropriate for use in encoding original-scene images. Rather, a color encoding that is directly related to the color of an original scene should be used. Accordingly, a companion to the ROMM RGB color encoding specification, known as Reference Input Medium Metric (RIMM RGB), has also been defined. This encoding is intended to represent original scene color appearance. The RIMM RGB color encoding not only provides extra dynamic range necessary for the encoding of scene information, it also provides a mechanism for clearly distinguishing whether or not an image has been rendered. Selection of Color Space It is desirable that the RIMM RGB and ROMM RGB color encoding specifications be defined such that they are as similar as possible to one another. This simplifies the development of image-manipulation algorithms across the two color encodings. It also simplifies the rendering process in which a rendered ROMM RGB image is created from an original scene image encoded in RIMM RGB. This is best achieved by basing the two encodings on the same color space. The criteria that were used to select this color space include the following: • Direct relationship to the color appearance of the scene/image • Color gamut large enough to encompass most realworld surface colors • Efficient encoding of the color information to minimize quantization artifacts • Simple transformation to/from ICC PCS • Simple transformation to/from video RGB (e.g., sRGB) • Well-suited for application of common image manipulations such as tonescale modifications, colorbalance adjustments, sharpening, etc. • Compatible with established imaging workflows An additive RGB color space with an appropriately selected set of “big RGB” primaries is ideal for satisfying all of these criteria. When images are encoded using any such set of primaries, there is a direct and simple relationship to scene/image colorimetry because the primaries are linear transformations of the CIE XYZ primaries. Big RGB color spaces have the additional advantage that simple LUTmatrix-LUT transformation can be used to convert to/from additive color spaces such as PCS XYZ, video RGB (sRGB) and digital camera RGB. Two of the criteria applied that affect the selection of RGB primaries are somewhat conflicting. First, their chromaticities should define a color gamut sufficiently large to encompass colors likely to be found in real scenes/images. At the same time, their use should result in efficient digital encodings that minimize quantization errors. Increasing the gamut can only be achieved by trading off against correspondingly larger quantization errors. If the primaries are chosen to include the maximum possible chromaticity gamut (i.e., the entire area within the spectrum locus), a significant fraction of the color space would correspond to imaginary colors located outside that region. Therefore, in any encoding using such a color space, there would be “wasted” code values that would never be used in practice. This would lead to larger quantization errors in the usable part of the color space than would be obtained with different primaries defining a smaller chromaticity gamut. It is therefore desirable to choose primaries with a gamut that is “big enough” but not “too big.” Fig. 1. Comparison of primaries in x-y chromaticity coordinates Figure 1 shows the primaries selected for RIMM/ ROMM RGB. Clearly, these primaries encompass the gamut of real world surface colors, without devoting a lot of space to non-realizable colors outside the spectrum locus. Also shown for comparison are the sRGB primaries.

Hu), yangbin01420 In this paper, we address the problem of fusing multi-focus images in dynamic scenes. The proposed approach consists of three main steps: first, the focus information of each source image obtained by morphological filtering is used to get the rough segmentation result which is one of the inputs of image matting. Then, image matting technique is applied to obtain the accurate focused region of each source image. Finally, the focused regions are combined together to construct the fused image. Through image matting, the proposed fusion algorithm combines the focus information and the correlations between nearby pixels together, and therefore tends to obtain more accurate fusion result. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional multi-focus image fusion methods, especially for those images in dynamic scenes. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of Aquarius mission is to measure the salinity of seawater to an accuracy on the order of 0.2 psu; this requires a model function of seawater permittivity with a high accuracy. Since 2011, the George Washington University (GW) has employed a cavity technique to determine the complex permittivity of seawater at 1.413 GHz. In this paper, a new seawater dielectric model function is introduced including the latest permittivity data for seawater with salinity 33 psu.

abc0243b3adc5a6f01439863a16ba98f44880562	ionospheric effects on the lunar-based radar imaging		We investigate the ionospheric effect on the global change observation lunar-based synthetic aperture radar (GCOLB-SAR), which offers an unprecedented temporal resolution and spatial coverage. However, the GCOLB-SAR is confronted with a great challenge: an extra-long distance electromagnetic wave propagating through atmospheric and ionospheric effects. The ionospheric effect for the satellite-borne SAR is no longer applicable for the GCOLB-SAR due to its ultra-long synthetic aperture time. In this paper, we consider the temporal-spatial variation effects of the ionosphere on the imaging of GCOLB-SAR. For the purpose of the study, an L-band GCOLB-SAR observation is considered. The signal model based on curved trajectory for GCOLB-SAR is derived and the temporal-spatial variation background ionosphere is analyzed. Preliminary analysis shows that the range shift is on the order of hundreds of meters, while the azimuth shift is of tens of meters. Such geometric deviations apparently should be corrected or compensated for GCOLB-SAR.	global change;l band;moon;radar;synthetic data	Zhen Xu;Kunshan Chen;Peng Xu;Huadong Guo	2017	2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128222	remote sensing;radar imaging;geodesy;electromagnetic radiation;computer science;azimuth;synthetic aperture radar;faraday effect;temporal resolution;ionosphere;scattering	Embedded	81.10012903173691	-66.07719943161278	38846

For this purpose, a series of simulations has been performed with an improved version of the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) end-to-end performance simulator (SEPS). The brightness temperature generator of SEPS has been modified to include a 100-m-resolution land cover map and a 30-m-resolution digital elevation map of Catalonia (northeast of Spain). This high-resolution generator allows the assessment of the errors in soil moisture retrieval algorithms due to limited spatial resolution and provides a basis for the development of pixel disaggregation techniques. Variation of the local incidence angle, shadowing, and atmospheric effects (up- and downwelling radiation) due to surface topography has been analyzed. Results are compared to brightness temperatures that are computed under the assumption of an ellipsoidal Earth.	algorithm;digital elevation model;end-to-end principle;image resolution;incidence matrix;l band;pixel;simulation;topography	Marco Talone;Adriano Camps;Alessandra Monerris;Mercè Vall-Llossera;Paolo Ferrazzoli;Maria Piles	2006	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2007.898254	meteorology;image resolution;image processing;hydrology;topography;accuracy and precision;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	83.7398061675242	-63.58881795660283	38849

Firstly, an improved gain function which integrates the speckle reduction with the feature enhancement is proposed to nonlinearly shrink and stretch the curvelet coefficients, and then the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to automatically adjust the parameters of the gain function. We propose an objective criterion for enhancement, and attempt to find the (near) optimal image according to the respective criterion. We employ the GA as a global search strategy for the best enhancement which has a satisfactory compromise between sharpening and smoothing. The experimental results show that the proposed method can efficiently enhance the edge features and contrast of SAR images and reduce the speckle noises, and outperforms the wavelet- and curvelet-based non-automatic enhancement methods.	curvelet;genetic algorithm;image editing	Jie Hu;Ying Li;Yu Jia	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-31919-8_42	computer vision;machine learning;curvelet;pattern recognition;mathematics	Vision	56.26156532265596	-64.48313719624532	39016

For this reason spectro-radiometric measurements were taken from an archaeological area in Cyprus. Field spectroradiometric measurements were undertaken from March to May of 2010. Spectro-radiometric measurements were taken over the previously detected magnetic anomalies using the GER 1500 spectroradiometer and they were found to be in a general agreement with the geophysical results. The results of the subsequent excavations which took place in the area verified partially the geophysical and spectro-radiometric measurements. However, the results obtained from the insitu spectro-radiometric campaigns were found very useful for detecting spectral vegetation anomalies related with buried features.

While GNSS-R ocean altimetry has been studied extensively, previous studies have focused on the use of the delay waveform (DW) only in the retrieval of sea surface height. This paper presents sea surface height retrievals using a “full Delay-Doppler Map (DDM)” method, and applies the approach to measurements of TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1), a recent space-borne mission. The End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) of GNSS-R waveforms developed for the CYGNSS mission is adapted for use with TDS-1 and applied as the forward model used in the retrieval process. Comparisons between measured and modeled DDMs have been conducted as a first step to validate this process. Retrievals of sea surface height using both the DW and full-DDM methods will be reported in the presentation. Potential methods for improving estimation error for future GNSS-R missions will also be described in the presentation.	dreamwidth;reflectometry;satellite navigation;waveform	Jeonghwan Park;Joel T.

b5c3e07dbb7cf0d076a1058a224df79738d8a583	application of fractional differential calculation in pretreatment of saline soil hyperspectral reflectance data		Pretreatment of spectrum data is a necessary and effective method for improving the accuracy of hyperspectral model building. Traditional differential calculation pretreatment only considers the integer-order differential, such as the 1st order and 2nd order, and overlooks important spectrum information located at fractional order. Since fractional differential (FD) has rarely been applied to spectrum field measurement, there are few reports on the spectrum features of saline soils under different degrees of human interference. We used FD to analyze field spectrum data of saline soil collected from Xinjiang’s Fukang City. Order interval of 0.2 was adopted to divide 0–2 orders into 11-order differentials. MATLAB programming was used to convert the raw spectral reflectance and its four common types of mathematics and to conduct FD calculation. Spectrum data for area A (no human interference area) and area B (human interference area) was separately processed. From the statistical analysis of soil salinization characteristics, the salinization degree and type for area B were more diverse and complicated than area A. MATLAB simulation results showed that FD calculation could depict the minute differences between different FD order spectra under different human interference areas. The overall differential value trend appeared to move towards 0 reflectance value. After differential processing, the trend of bands that passed the 0.05 significance test of correlation coefficient () showed an increase first then decrease later. The maximum absolute value for five spectrum transformations all appeared in the fractional order. FD calculation could significantly increase the correlation between spectral reflectance and soil salt content both for full-band and single-band spectra. Results of this study can serve as a reference for the application of FD in field hyperspectral monitoring of soil salinization for different human interference areas.

The ice growth phase of the experiment made use of two 6-ft diameter tanks and a 6-ft diameter mold with known roughness statistical parameters of rms height = 0.25 cm and Gaussian correlation (correlation length = 2.0 cm). One tank was used for growing a moderately thick saline ice sheet with very smooth surface, and the other was used for growing a thin layer of freshwater ice over the surface mold. The latter resulted in a layer with one statistically known rough boundary and one smooth boundary. Wide-bandwidth, multiple incidence angle backscattering measurements were performed, first on the bare saline ice sheet and then on the same sheet after the thin freshwater ice sheet was placed on top of it. Results indicate that the surface scattering dominates over saline ice volume scattering at all frequencies for low incidence angles for both the very smooth and Gaussian rough surfaces. The significance of volume scattering depends strongly on angle of incidence, frequency, volume scattering albedo, surface roughness, and surface correlation function.	dominator (graph theory);incidence matrix;nethack;salineos	Jonathan W.

In structural mapping, for example, the geometry and kinematics of large-scale structures needs to be reconstructed from local measurements and observations of linear and planar fabric elements. The traditional methods for fabric representations are inherently restrictive because they do not allow simultaneous representation of the orientation and nature of the fabric with respect to the structural level of observation. To overcome these limitations we represent planar (S) fabric elements as the flat portion of a 3-D ellipsoid or 'surfboard' symbol according to their strike/dip attributes. The associated linear (L) fabric elements are represented by the elongation direction of the 'surfboard', thus reflecting the pitch of the linear element in the fabric plane. The resulting composite linear-planar fabric (L-S) representation is positioned in 3-D space according to its location in (x, y, z) space. By adjusting the principal axis of the 'surfboard', variations in the shape of the elements can be used as an additional symbolization of the strain-state of the fabric, ranging from pure L to L>S, S>L to pure S fabrics. Various colour mappings of the 'surfboard' can be used to indicate the degree of co-planarity between lineations and planar fabric orientations. This 3-D visualization of L-S fabrics aids in first-order interpretation of regional scale ductile structures, such as thrusts and low-angle detachment faults. An application is presented from the Mulhacen metamorphic complex of the Internal Zone of the Betic Cordillera, SE Spain, demonstrating the 3-D fabric visualization method. This method facilitates recognition of variations in lineation trends with respect to the structural level within a ductile nappe structure and subsequent overprinting deformation events. The approach is considered relevant to all other applications where local field-based measurements and descriptions are fundamental to the reconstruction of macro-scale geologic processes.

8128cf0bbab826d8c3fdd6c9cdf20bf4b233a596	eliminating the interference of soil moisture and particle size on predicting soil total nitrogen content using a nirs-based portable detector	near infrared reflectance spectroscopy;back propagation neural network;soil total nitrogen content;soil moisture;portable soil detector;soil particle size	Applying near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) on farmlands can effectively estimate the total nitrogen (TN) content of soil online. We developed a NIRS-based portable detector of soil TN content that measures spectral data at 940, 1050, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1450, and 1550 nm. The soil spectral data are sensitive to external environmental conditions, particularly soil moisture content and particle size. The interference of these factors on predicting soil TN content must be eliminated when using the portable detector. First, soil samples were collected from a farm in Beijing, China, and scanned using the detector to obtain their absorbance data under varying soil moisture and particle size. Second, absorbance correction method and mixed calibration set method were proposed to correct the original spectral data and to eliminate the interference of soil moisture and particle size, respectively. The absorbance of the soil sample at 1450 nm exhibited a high correlation with soil moisture content. Thus, a moisture absorbance correction method (PMAI) was proposed to normalize the original spectral data into the standard spectral data and consequently eliminate the interference of soil moisture. A NIRS-based mixed calibration set based on the additivity of NIR spectra was produced with varying particle sizes, separated from the original soil samples, to eliminate the interference of soil particle size on the measurements of the portable soil TN detector. An estimation model of soil TN content was established based on the corrected absorbance data at six wavelengths (940, 1050, 1100, 1200, 1300, and 1550 nm) using an algorithm of the back propagation neural network. The correlation coefficient of calibration, correlation coefficient of validation, root mean square error of calibration, root mean square error of prediction, and residual prediction deviation were used to evaluate the model. Compared with the model used the original spectral data, the accuracy and stability of the new model were significantly improved. These methods could efficiently eliminate the interference of soil moisture and particle size on predicting soil TN content. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The spatial dependency of adjacent class labels is characterized based on local transition probabilities in order to use contextual information. Due to the computational load required to estimate class labels in the final stage of optimization and the need to acquire robust spectral attributes derived from the training samples, modified M-estimates are implemented to characterize the joint class-conditional distribution. The experimental results show that the suggested scheme outperforms conventional noncontextual classifiers as well as contextual classifiers which are based on least squares estimates or other spatial interaction models.	comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;least squares;linear classifier;markov chain;markov random field;mathematical optimization	Yonhong Jhung;Philip H.

The blur direction and extent of motion-blurred image, which are introduced by relative motion between a camera and its object scene, are needed in the methods of image restoration, such as blind deconvolution. As an extension to the fractional-order derivative, a noncausal fractional-order directional derivative operator is devised, which is robust to noise. Based on this new operator, a novel method identifying blur parameters is developed in this work. The performance comparison between the proposed method and the state-of-the-art method is also presented, demonstrating that the former provides better immunity to noise and capacity to identify motion blur extent, especially for large blur length.	autostereogram;blind deconvolution;circuit restoration;condition number;deblurring;differentiator;directional derivative;elegant degradation;experiment;gaussian blur;image restoration;velocity (software development);well-posed problem	Xiang Pan;Yongqiang Ye;Jianhong Wang;Xudong Gao;Xin Zhou	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1845-6	image restoration;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science;gaussian blur;blind deconvolution	Vision	56.113644925064975	-58.283500923147635	39380

These two data sets provide an excellent opportunity to monitor climate and vegetation variation over time. Two case studies, combining these two data sets, were recently conducted on a regional scale in South Africa. The one, concerned with the semiarid Limpopo River valley, combined point measurements of rainfall with local Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values to investigate the correlation between point rainfall and the NDVI response in the data sets. The results show a strong log-linear correlation between rainfall data and NDVI due to saturation of the NDVI at high rainfall and cloud contamination. The NDVI seems to be more sensitive to drought conditions than high rainfall. Putting this into perspective, it was deemed useful as a potential tool to monitor the movement of the 500 mm isohyte over the central parts of South Africa. The 500-mm rainfall isohyte is an important meteorological feature, which is significant for dryland agriculture and crop production in South Africa. Areas receiving more than this amount of rain annually are regarded as being suitable for dryland agriculture. However, rainfall over South Africa shows a high degree of interseasonal variability. This subsequent case study intended to track the movement of the isohyte as well as its impact on vegetation. The NDVI was used to monitor shifts in vegetation growth over 17 years, while rainfall surfaces were created to give an idea of the historical interseasonal migration of the 500 mm isohyte since 1930 including the 17 years of vegetation data. Results demonstrate that a threshold value for NDVI during a season can be used to approximate the area receiving sufficient rainfall for dryland agriculture. Available archived satellite data is insufficient to observe vegetation change in the context of natural climate variability. Historical rainfall data is therefore used as a guiding reference for using satellite data in monitoring regional vegetation conditions. Results show a potential for using satellite imagery for operational monitoring of global change with rainfall as ancillary data. This approach can be used on a regional scale to assess the suitability, for different types of agriculture, of specific areas, thereby aiding agricultural zoning.	agricultural robot;approximation algorithm;archive;global change;heart rate variability;inter-rater reliability;log-linear model;spatial variability	Brilliant Mareme Petja;Johan Malherbe;Dawie van Zyl	2004	IGARSS 2004. 2004 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2004.1369098	meteorology;normalized difference vegetation index;hydrology;physics;remote sensing	Visualization	84.22959906223568	-57.68278625404738	39400

These datasets have been developed using a variety of techniques, including, hydrologic modeling, satellite-based retrievals, data assimilation, and survey/in-field data collection. The objectives are to assess the relative utility of each dataset for monitoring crop yield variability, to quantitatively assess their capacity for predicting end-of-season corn and soybean yields, and to examine the evolution of the yield-index correlations during the growing season. This analysis is unique both with regards to the number and variety of examined yield predictor datasets and the detailed assessment of the water availability timing on the end-of-season crop production during the growing season. Correlation results indicate that over CONUS, at state-level soil moisture and ET indices can provide better information for forecasting corn and soybean yields than vegetation-based indices such as normalized difference vegetation index. The strength of correlation with corn and soybean yields strongly depends on the interannual variability in yield measured at a given location. In this case study, some of the remotely derived datasets examined provide skill comparable to that of in-situ field survey-based data—further demonstrating the utility of these remote sensing-based approaches for estimating crop yield.	data collection;data assimilation;estimated;glycine max;heart rate variability;kerrison predictor;post-traumatic stress disorder;projections and predictions;silo (dataset);soybeans;contiguous stage ii grade 2 follicular lymphoma	Iliana E.

CanX-4 and CanX-5 are a pair of formation-flying nanosatellites launching in 2009; once formation flight has been demonstrated, a future multistatic InSAR constellation of low-cost microsatellites can exploit subcentimeter intersatellite baseline knowledge, with digital elevation map height errors on the order of 1 m in the flat-terrain case. This paper evaluates the feasibility of such a mission, using case studies of commonly proposed configurations: the Interferometric Cartwheel, the Cross-Track Pendulum, and the Cartwheel-Pendulum (Car-Pe) configuration. In each case, several SAR transmitters are considered: L-, C-, and X-band transmitters with parameters mirroring existing ldquolargerdquo satellite SAR missions, and a theoretical X-band microsatellite transmitter. The available interferometric baselines, ground coverage, and image resolutions are evaluated in each scenario. The X-band ldquomicrordquo transmitter is feasible, but the low transmit power severely limits the ground coverage. The X-band ldquolargerdquo transmitter provides the largest ground coverage and the highest resolution along with the X-band ldquomicrordquo option. The resolutions are wavelength dependent and remain relatively constant among the configurations. The operating areas of the pendulum demonstrate the largest degree of overlap, while the longer along-track baselines of the cartwheel result in a smaller overlap. Both two-receiver (pendulum and cartwheel) configurations demonstrate baseline characteristics that may be optimal for different applications, while the three-receiver Car-Pe demonstrates the advantages of both the pendulum and cartwheel.	aperture (software);baseline (configuration management);digital elevation model;disk mirroring;synthetic data;transmitter	Erica H.

In this paper, a validation experiment is presented to verify the feasibility of GEO SAR imaging under the condition of long integration time of around several hundred or even thousands of seconds. The experiment employs the Chinese Beidou IGSO navigation satellites as the illuminator of opportunity. The receiver is deployed on the top of a building and then a space-surface Bistatic SAR (SS-BISAR) configuration is constructed. A transponder consisting of two antennas and an amplifier is constructed for evaluating the resolution. The images of the transponder and the natural scene are focused well, which can validate the GEO SAR imaging feasibility though the linear track and constant speed assumptions fail.	amplifier;beidou navigation satellite system;chinese room;geosynchronous orbit;illuminator (backlight);satellite navigation;transponder	Xichao Dong;Cheng Hu;Weiming Tian;Mingming Bian;Tian Zhang;Teng Long	2015	2015 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326639	synthetic aperture radar;geodesy;transponder;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Robotics	79.49420027712102	-65.56278272067526	39506

Computing on this compacted stream rather than the mixed input stream leads to improvements in performance, load balancing, and memory footprint. Stream compaction has numerous applications in a wide range of domains: e.g., deferred shading, isosurface extraction, and surface voxelization in computer graphics and visualization. We present a novel In-Kernel stream compaction method, where compaction is completed before leaving an operating kernel. This contrasts with conventional parallel compaction methods that require leaving the kernel and running a prefix sum kernel followed by a scatter kernel. We apply our compaction methods to ray-tracing-based visualization of volumetric data. We demonstrate that the proposed In-Kernel Compaction outperforms the standard out-of-kernel Thrust parallel-scan method for performing stream compaction in this real-world application. For the data visualization, we also propose a novel multi-kernel ray-tracing pipeline for increased thread coherency and show that it outperforms a conventional single-kernel approach.	computer graphics;data compaction;data visualization;deferred shading;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;general-purpose macro processor;graphics pipeline;graphics processing unit;isosurface;load balancing (computing);memory footprint;parallel computing;pipeline (computing);prefix sum;ray tracing (graphics);standard streams;stream (computing);thrust	David Meirion Hughes;Ik Soo Lim;Mark W.

At each missing pixel of the high resolution (HR) image we consider an ensemble of candidate interpolation methods (interpolator). The interpolators are interpreted as states of a finite-state machine (FSM). Accordingly, the up-scaling problem is converted to the problem of estimating the optimal sequence of interpolators corresponding to the sequence of missing HR pixel positions. We derive a parameter-free probabilistic model for this FSM to solve the estimation problem using trellis diagrams and Viterbi algorithm. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm results sharper HR images and higher peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) comparing to many algorithms in this domain.	diagram;finite-state machine;image resolution;image scaling;interpolation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;pixel;statistical model;trellis quantization;viterbi algorithm	Farhang Vedadi;Shahram Shirani	2012	2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing	10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467001	mathematical optimization;soft output viterbi algorithm;image resolution;interpolation;computer science;pattern recognition;probability;mathematics;maximum likelihood;finite-state machine;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;iterative viterbi decoding;statistics	Robotics	54.46786037270276	-59.13983098854858	39717

A methodology is described to assess the impact due to optical and electronic crosstalk on the measured radiance, and thereafter, the retrieval of geophysical products using MODIS Level 1 data sets. Based on a postulated set of electronic and optical crosstalk coefficients, and a set of MODIS scenes, we have simulated a system signal contamination on any detector on a focal plane when another detector on that focal plane is stimulated with a geophysical signal. The original MODIS scenes and the crosstalk impacted scenes can be used with validated geophysical algorithms to derive the final data products. Products contaminated with crosstalk are then compared to those without contamination to assess the impact magnitude and location, and will allow us to separate Out-Of-Band (OOB) leaks from band-to-band optical crosstalk, and identify potential failures to meet climate research requirements.	algorithm;coefficient;crosstalk;focal (programming language);metric;out-of-bag error;requirement;sensor	Hassan Oudrari;Thomas Schwarting;Kwo-Fu Chiang;Jeffrey McIntire;Chunhui Pan;Xiaoxiong Xiong;James J.

7cfefb6a247780dd08ded1c54192e403a6276747	detection of aufeis-related flood areas in a time series of high resolution sar images using curvelet transform and unsupervised classification		Due to their weather and illumination independence and due to their large area coverage at high spatial resolution, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have been recognized as a valuable data source for the mapping and tracking of aufeis flooding events. We modified and utilized the change detection approach of [1], based on wavelet analysis to map aufeis-related flooding on the Sagavanirktok River in northern Alaska, collected in the spring of 2015. This paper provides near real-time monitoring by generating detailed flood parameters such as flood classification probabilities, flood-related backscatter changes, and flood extent. The generated flood maps show the spatial extent and day-to-day progression of the 2015 flooding event across a 1004 km2 area, that was determined by processing a series of seven TerraSAR-X datasets. From our analysis, we learned that in early to late April, the formation of aufeis from the Sagavanirktok River crossed the Dalton Highway at several points. In late April to early May, associated warm temperatures led to open water flooding, which flooded the Sagavanirktok River at several locations. It can be argued that along the Sagavanirktok River, warm temperatures led to aufeis growth with the distribution of flow moving from the western channel to the eastern channel.	aperture (software);color gradient;curvelet;dalton (program);flood;image resolution;map;real-time clock;real-time computing;time series;unsupervised learning;wavelet	Olaniyi A.

For each field of view, the measurements are made from two broadband channels: a total waveband channel covering 0.2-50 μm and a shortwave (SW) band covering 0.2-4.3 μm. The validation to the ERM calibration was carried out by comparing the unfiltered longwave (LW) and SW radiances from ERM with those from Clouds and Earth's Radiation Energy System (CERES) flight model 3 onboard Earth Observing System Aqua satellite. While the ERM LW and SW radiances have a good correlation with CERES data, there is a systemic bias between the two data sets. A spectral correction is made for the ERM data using the CERES data. After the correction, the error of the ERM LW radiance is reduced from -3.00 to -0.60 W/sr · m2. For the SW radiance, the bias is reduced from 6.00 to 4.00 W/sr · m2. Based on the ERM in-orbit calibration data, the stability of the ERM LW radiometric response is analyzed, and it is shown that the gains are stable with a variation of less than 1.5% during its first 9 months in orbit. However, the gains at the SW channels have larger changes and exceed 3%. These drifts might be caused by the detector degradation. Also, the NFOV scanner at the SW channel is no longer working after its 8 months in orbit.	aqua;elegant degradation;frequency band;limewire;pool of radiance;shattered world	Hong Qiu;Liqin Hu;Yan Zhang;Duanjun Lu;Jin Qi	2012	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2012.2202668	meteorology;calibration;radiometry;atmospheric sciences;physics;satellite;remote sensing	Visualization	82.69800954851786	-63.2649632279798	40059

Light field raw image structure has several sub images and generally depth is estimated using multi baseline techniques or object labeling schemes. Both these approaches are quite complex. EPI representation of the sub images when applied to the multi-baseline framework provides outputs comparable to that of the multi-baseline approach along with significant reduction in complexity (50%). Fast depth estimation will become an important requirement as plenoptic cameras gets into the main stream. The proposed method has been tested on a couple of datasets captured with different light field camera setups and was found to perform as well as the multi-baseline approach in terms of quality of the depth map generated but taking only half of the computational time.	baseline (configuration management);computation;depth map;epipolar geometry;fast fourier transform;light field;raw image format;time complexity	Mithun Uliyar;Gururaj Putraya;S.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in using deformable objects in computer applications such as animation, video games, garment CAD, and surgical simulation. Deformable object modeling is quite expensive computationally. However, since most of the related calculations can be parallelized, we have developed a framework that utilizes NVIDIA's CUDA technology to accelerate a set of deformable object modeling algorithms by transferring their core computations to the GPU. Our results show that frame rates can be improved more than 20 times using GPU compared with using a multicore CPU. In addition, we have developed a method called Local Shape Matching which is an extension to the Shape Matching method. Using this new method we have achieved fast and robust simulations whose implementations have good numerical stability.	graphics processing unit	Aria Shahingohar;Roy Eagleson	2012	IJHPCA	10.1177/1094342011428144	parallel computing;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;computer graphics (images)	Vision	71.01993000436677	-52.35582187448828	40129

To overcome the limitations of existing pattern generation methods developed upon the assessment of lithographic paths of the reflected beam spots rather than the recognition of patterns, we place our primary concern on the pattern. We consider pattern generation for maskless lithography using the DMD as a graphic recognition field problem. The pattern generation process is conceptualized as dual pattern recognition in two contrary views, which are the substrate’s view and the DMD’s view. For pattern recognition in the DMD’s view, a unique criterion, the area ratio, is devised for approval of the on/off reflection of the DMD mirror. The Region-based Pattern Generation (RPG) scheme based upon the area ratio is proposed. For verification, a prototype RPG system is implemented, and lithography using the system is performed to fabricate an actual Flat Panel Display (FPD) glass. The results verify that the RPG scheme is robust enough to generate lithographic patterns in any possible lithographic configuration and the RPG system is precise enough to attain the lithographic quality required by the FPD manufacturer.	computational lithography	Manseung Seo;Jaesung Song;Changgeun An	2005		10.1007/11767978_10	lithography;computer vision;optical modulator;image processing;computer science;graphics;pattern recognition;digital micromirror device;computer graphics (images)	EDA	62.980102424605285	-59.20378628422192	40163

Despite allowing concurrent capture of hyperspectral video, spatial modulation in CASSI sacrifices image resolution significantly while reconstructing spectral projection via sparse sampling. Several multiview alternatives have been proposed to handle this low spatial resolution problem and improve measurement accuracy, for instance, by adding a translation stage for the coded aperture or changing the static coded aperture with a digital micromirror device for dynamic modulation. Stateof-the-art solutions enhance spatial resolution significantly but are incapable of capturing video using CASSI. In this paper, we present a novel compressive coded aperture imaging design that increases spatial resolution while capturing 4D hyperspectral video of dynamic scenes. We revise the traditional CASSI design to allow for multiple sampling of the randomness of spatial modulation in a single frame. We demonstrate that our compressive video spectroscopy approach yields enhanced spatial resolution and consistent measurements, compared with the traditional CASSI design.	coded aperture;digital micromirror device;image resolution;linear stage;modulation;multisample anti-aliasing;randomness;sampling (signal processing);snapshot (computer storage);sparse matrix	Daniel S.

The technology and infrastructure components are now well developed and understood, but the useful application of sensor network data and efficient delivery of real-time information still needs improvement to better incorporate management needs and priorities. This paper aims to contribute to the current understanding of the adoption of wireless technology in research and practice, by identifying the main drivers and barriers to the adaptive deployment of an environmental sensor network along the Great Barrier Reef coast. Specifically, it addresses the extent to which the deployment of sensor networks and the delivery of real-time data can best suit managers’ and decision makers’ needs by providing timely and useful spatial data. Study findings indicate that, although researchers and managers ask significantly different questions requiring real-time spatial data, there is great potential and interest from both science and management for continuous automatic monitoring of environmental parameters. Some of the key research and management needs that the sensor network technology should address include measuring water (marine) quality at biological monitoring sites, water circulation patterns and flood plume water quality, gathering long-term data on turbidity, photosynthetically active radiation and chlorophyll a, and developing uniform standards for the provision of data to networks.	adaptive sampling;data infrastructure;emergence;fragmentation (computing);information needs;information processing;information security;interaction;myrianed;real-time data;real-time locating system;sampling (signal processing);software deployment;subpixel rendering;traffic flow (computer networking)	Débora M. de Freitas;Stuart Kininmonth;Simon Woodley	2009	Computers, Environment and Urban Systems	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2008.11.002	geography;computer science;engineering;civil engineering;methodology;ecology;operations research;sensor array;information system;cartography;statistics;remote sensing;technology	HCI	81.39699562435254	-53.64111508260229	40195

The total atmospheric effect is mathematically developed in terms of spherical harmonics to degree and order 2,160 based on a recent static atmospheric density model. Also the contribution of its higher degrees is formulated. Another idea of this paper is to combine one of the recent Earth gravity models (EGMs) of the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) mission with EGM08 and the terrestrial gravimetric data of Fennoscandia in an optimum way. To do so, the GOCE EGMs are compared with the Global Positioning System (GPS)/levelling data over the area for finding the most suited one. This comparison is done in two different ways: with and without considering the errors of the EGMs. Comparison of the computed geoids with the GPS/levelling data shows that a) considering the total atmospheric effect will improve the geoid by about 5 mm, b) GOCO03S is the most suited GOCE EGM for Fennoscandia, c) the errors of some of the GOCE EGMs are optimistic and far from reality. Combination of GOCO03S from degree 120 to 210 and EGM08 for the rest of degrees shows its good quality in these frequencies.	apache axis;computation;emoticon;global positioning system;mean squared error;reduction (complexity);reference ellipsoid;reference model;semiconductor industry;steady state;terrestrial television;topography	Mehdi Eshagh;Sahar Ebadi	2013	Earth Science Informatics	10.1007/s12145-013-0115-5	geophysics;geodesy;geoid;european combined geodetic network	Robotics	79.34952928745925	-66.75061570882502	40202

We found that the thermal anomalies appeared 4-2 months in short term and 6-2 days in impending scale before this event. The positions of the thermal radiation precursor detected using OLR data have some relationship with the tectonic implications mechanism of this event.

The salt-and-pepper noise reviewed as the impulsive noise, in this paper, is modeled as a sparse signal because of its impulsiveness. To accurately reconstruct the clean image and the blur kernel, the framelet domains are exploited to sparsely represent the image and the blur kernel. From the reformulations conducted, a joint estimation is devised to simultaneously perform the image recovery, the salt-and-pepper noise suppression and the blur kernel estimation under a optimization framework. To solve the optimization problem, an efficient solver based on accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is developed to obtain the joint estimation solution. Numerical studies demonstrate the superior performance of the joint estimation algorithm compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation standards.	algorithm;deblurring;gaussian blur;kernel (operating system);mathematical optimization;numerical method;optimization problem;proximal gradient methods for learning;salt-and-pepper noise;solver;sparse matrix;zero suppression	Liming Hou;Hongqing Liu;Zhen Luo;Yi Zhou;Trieu-Kien Truong	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2017.8296710	salt-and-pepper noise;iterative reconstruction;computer vision;image restoration;noise measurement;kernel density estimation;pattern recognition;deblurring;artificial intelligence;computer science;solver;optimization problem	Vision	56.91750370821859	-71.71194559597353	40270

With such a set of filters images can be represented without loss of information. Intriguingly, the filter shapes are localized, oriented, and bandpass, resembling important properties of V1 simple cell receptive fields. Here we address the question of whether the independent components of natural images are also perceptually less dependent than other image components. We compared the pixel basis, the ICA basis and the discrete cosine basis by asking subjects to interactively predict missing pixels (for the pixel basis) or to predict the coefficients of ICA and DCT basis functions in patches of natural images. Like Kersten (1987) we find the pixel basis to be perceptually highly redundant but perhaps surprisingly, the ICA basis showed significantly higher perceptual dependencies than the DCT basis. This shows a dissociation between statistical and perceptual dependence measures.	basis function;coefficient;discrete cosine transform;independent computing architecture;interactivity;pixel	Matthias Bethge;Thomas V.

Together, these satellites will in the future produce a tremendous quantity of optical images worldwide, with increasing temporal coverage towards higher latitudes due to their polar orbits. Due to this large amount of images, it will be increasingly difficult to manually choose the best glacier mapping scenes as currently done for glacier mapping methods. Often it is also not optimal to use only one scene due to regionally varying mapping conditions. To fully exploit the volume of multi-temporal images, methods for mapping glaciers should be revisited. To this end, we aim to create robust, automatic algorithms for glacier mapping applications, exploiting the multi-temporal signatures in the satellite data.	algorithm;algorithmic trading;time series;type signature	Solveig H.

a3e66dbbfbee29f086df522a15519b31de6a76fb	the role of spatial heterogeneity in detecting urban slums		Abstract Satellite images allow characterizing and monitoring urban slums. Yet the urban landscape as a complex geographic system is composed of hierarchical patterns and discrete objects in a spatial and temporal continuum with different scales and anisotropy which can only be estimated from image snapshots. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of slums in terms of scale and anisotropy from discrete image pixels is nontrivial and has not been explicitly addressed by image-based studies detecting slums, where scale and direction in characterizing slum features are commonly done by trial and error. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the impact of scales and anisotropy detected in the scale space and frequency domain for the calculation of texture indices that ultimately govern the detection of slums. Employing case studies of three cities with a large portion of slum population and for which we have very high resolution satellite imagery, we identify the characteristic scales of slum and formal built-up areas. Results show that the characteristic scales correspond with the optimal grain size to obtain image texture features for detecting slums, while the directional spectral energy at the pixel level identifies characteristic directions. Thus texture indices calculated at the characteristic scale and along the characteristic directions of slum patterns improve the efficiency in feature extraction and classification of slums, where optimizing the scale has a higher impact on the detection of slums than choosing the optimal directions. This study provides a framework for scientifically selecting optimal scales and directions for slum mapping studies. The framework is recommended to be tested for more general applications in land surface characterization and classification especially by using high order texture indices.

The technique makes use of the theory of adaptive arrays and takes advantage of a priori knowledge of the ambiguous echo power as a function of the geometry and average ground reflectivity. The optimized antenna weighting turns out to be complex, and asymmetrical patterns are generally obtained for a spaceborne SAR. The technique allows the achievement of better performance compared to the current design values, especially at large off-nadir angles. >	mathematical optimization;radiation pattern	Sergio Barbarossa;Guido Levrini	1991	IEEE Trans.

Ground surface methods, which are widely used for objects buried in shallow depths, become ineffective for objects deep in the soil because the object's anomalous field diminishes rapidly with distance, and interference by metal debris on the ground surface is significant. For the location and identification of deeply buried UXO, a total-field magnetometer equipped with a cone penetrometer technology (CPT) drilling system is employed in this paper. A novel inversion method is developed to extract information from individual and multiple CPT profiles. Compared with conventional inversion methods providing a single minimum as an estimate, this approach tests the likelihood distribution over the anticipated solution space, hence providing reliability. Real-world data are collected from a test site for the location and identification of a specific target.

708f70bcb2e7a4c7f92c25ca30cbf82a8a35b17b	reduction of missing wedge artifact in oblique-view computed tomography		The manufacturer need for high-speed interconnection in three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) warrants inspection with through-silicon via (TSV) technology. Because the use of a flat component in tomographic reconstruction restricts the range of viewing angles, the computed tomography (CT) system produces limited-view projection images, which causes missing angle artifacts in the reconstructed 3D data. In this paper, we propose a total variation (TV) approach for tomographic image reconstruction. The proposed approach improves the image quality when the sinogram images have equal quality at all viewing angles and the accessible tilt range is restricted only by the physical limits of the oblique-view CT system. This method employs a bowtie TV (b-TV) penalty, which establishes a desirable balance between smooth and piecewise-constant solutions in the missing wedge region. Finally, the images resulting from the proposed method are shown to be smooth with sharp edges and fewer visible artifacts. Furthermore, the overall image quality is higher than those of images obtained by existing TV methods.	ct scan;oblique projection;tomography	Kyung-Chan Jin;Jung-Seok Yoon;Yoon-Ho Song	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-50832-0_46	computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence;computed tomography;iterative reconstruction;wedge (mechanical device);image quality;tomographic reconstruction;oblique projection	Vision	61.32838753829038	-57.337612216789864	40526

A challenge of image denoising is how to preserve the edges of an image when reducing noise. By modeling the intensity surface of a noisy image as statistically self-similar multifractal processes and taking advantage of the multiresolution analysis with wavelet transform to exploit the local statistical self-similarity at different scales, the pointwise singularity strength value characterizing the local singularity at each scale was calculated. By thresholding the singularity strength, wavelet coefficients at each scale were classified into two categories: the edge-related and regular wavelet coefficients and the irregular coefficients. The irregular coefficients were denoised using an approximate minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation method, while the edge-related and regular wavelet coefficients were smoothed using the fuzzy weighted mean (FWM) filter aiming at preserving the edges and details when reducing noise. Furthermore, to make the FWM-based filtering more efficient for noise reduction at the lowest decomposition level, the MMSE-based filtering was performed as the first pass of denoising followed by performing the FWM-based filtering. Experimental results demonstrated that this algorithm could achieve both good visual quality and high PSNR for the denoised images.	approximation algorithm;biologic preservation;categories;class;classification;coefficient;diffusion weighted imaging;forty nine;fractal;hp 48 series;image scaling;mean squared error;multifractal system;multiresolution analysis;noise reduction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;self-similarity;singular;singularity project;smoothing (statistical technique);technological singularity;test scaling;thresholding (image processing);wavelet transform;contents - htmllinktype	Junmei Zhong;Ruola Ning	2005	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2005.849313	computer vision;fractal;computer science;signal processing;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics;wavelet transform	Visualization	54.06629385071064	-66.38571213908865	40602

We show that the POLSAR coherency matrix can be completely decomposed into three components contributed by volume scattering and two single scatterers (characterized by rank-1 matrices). Under this scheme, solving for the volume scattering power amounts to a generalized eigendecomposition problem, and the nonnegative power constraint uniquely determines the minimum eigenvalue as the volume scattering power. Furthermore, in order to discriminate the remaining components, we propose two approaches. One is based on eigendecomposition, and the other is based on model fitting, both of which are shown to properly resolve the surface and double-bounce scattering ambiguity. As a result, this paper in particular contributes to two pending needs for model-based POLSAR decomposition. First, it overcomes negative power problems, i.e., all the decomposed powers are strictly guaranteed to be nonnegative; and second, the three-component decomposition exactly accounts for every element of the observed coherency matrix, leading to a complete utilization of the fully polarimetric information.	curve fitting;polarimetry;synthetic data	Yi Cui;Yoshio Yamaguchi;Jian Yang;Hirokazu Kobayashi;Sang-Eun Park;Gulab Singh	2014	IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing	10.1109/TGRS.2013.2257603	synthetic aperture radar;polarimetry;optics;physics;remote sensing	Vision	73.99532337240862	-65.48735652359126	40614
b427dc0f126996404976ecda4c43822ce43b8ce1	image analysis by meixner moments and a digital filter		In this paper, we propose a new method for the rapid calculation of Meixner’s discrete orthogonal moments and its inverses. In this method, we have used the notion of digital filters based on the Z transform both to accelerate the computation time of Meixner and to reduce the reconstruction error of the images. To guarantee the numerical stability and robustness with respect to the noise, we propose two algorithms that treat the images as a set of blocks where each block will be treated independently. In fact, through the first algorithm, the moments of Meixner are computed from a set of geometric blocks of fixed size. On the other hand, in the second algorithm, the images are represented by a slice set where each slice contains several homogeneous blocks of different sizes. The moments of Meixner, in this case, are calculated from each block in each slice. The application of these two algorithms allowed us to deduce a significant reduction in processed information and image space, that permits the use of Meixner moments of low order for a better description of the fine details of the images. The performances of the proposed method are demonstrated through several simulations on different image bases.	algorithm;computation;digital filter;image analysis;iterative reconstruction;numerical analysis;numerical stability;performance;simulation;time complexity;tomographic reconstruction	Tarik Jahid;Abdeslam Hmimid;Hicham Karmouni;Mhamed Sayyouri;Hassan Qjidaa;Abdellah Rezzouk	2017	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-017-5371-9	artificial intelligence;computer vision;computer science;discrete mathematics;robustness (computer science);homogeneous;computation;z-transform;numerical stability;velocity moments;digital filter	Graphics	66.5408378782085	-56.37938697339465	40653

In this paper, we make an attempt of developing an algorithm that can generate light-field raw data from a single input picture captured by a conventional camera together with its depth map. Our algorithm follows closely the imaging procedure of the light-field camera with micro lens, with certain simplification. Specifically, an input image (of size W × H) will be projected to a light-field data of size (M × P) × (N × P), assuming that the micro-lens array has size M × N micro lens and each micro lens is supported by P × P sensors. In our work, the main lens is partitioned into K × K cells, each pixel of the input picture is assumed to locate at certain distance from the main lens and regarded as a lighting source. The directional light emitted from each pixel goes through the main lens and the corresponding micro-lens to be recorded at a particular sensor in the CMOS array. We will derive the geometry of this imaging process as well as the intensity recorded at each sensor. We choose to run the refocusing algorithm to verify whether the light-field data generated by our algorithm is meaningful or not. Comparing the refocused images against the original input picture shows that our synthesis algorithm seems quite successful.	algorithm;cmos;depth map;integral imaging;level of detail;light field;pixel;sensor	Chao Sun;Yiqun Wu;Bing Zeng	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)	10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351040	computer vision;image sensor;cmos sensor	Robotics	62.576554552387464	-57.28228811999162	40834
a8c5ed0022889166daf93fd95d8529f296301f9c	fusion of heterogeneous remote sensing images by credibilist methods. (fusion d'images de télédétection hétérogènes par méthodes crédibilistes)		Abstract: With the advent of new image acquisition techniques and the emergence of high resolution satellite systems, remote sensing data to be exploited have become increasingly rich and varied. Their combination has thus become essential to improve the process of extracting useful information related to the physical nature of the observed surfaces. However, these data are generally heterogeneous and imperfect, which poses several problems in their joint treatment and requires the development of specific methods. It is in this context that falls this thesis that aimed at developing a new evidential fusion method dedicated to heterogeneous remote sensing images processing at high resolution. In order to achieve this objective, we first focus our research, firstly, on the development of a new approach for the belief functions estimation based on Kohonen’s map in order to simplify the masses assignment operation of the large volumes of data occupied by these images. The proposed method allows to model not only the ignorance and the imprecision of our sources of information, but also their paradox. After that, we exploit this estimation approach to propose an original fusion technique that will solve problems due to the wide variety of knowledge provided by these heterogeneous sensors. Finally, we study the way in which the dependence between these sources can be considered in the fusion process using the copula theory. For this reason, a new technique for choosing the most appropriate copula is introduced. The experimental part of this work is devoted to land use mapping in case of agricultural areas using SPOT-5 and RADARSAT-2 images. The experimental study carried out demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of the approaches developed in the framework of this thesis.

To accelerate the rendering process, we introduce characteristic point maps (CPMs), a hierarchy of view-independent points, which are chosen to preserve the appearance of the original model across different scales. In preprocessing, randomized matrix column sampling is used to reduce an initial dense sampling to a minimum number of characteristic points with associated weights. In rendering, the reflected radiance is computed using a weighted average of reflectances from characteristic points. Unlike existing techniques, our approach requires no restrictions on the original geometry or reflectance functions.	aliasing;global illumination;image quality;li-chen wang;low-pass filter;map;mipmap;os-tan;preprocessor;randomized algorithm;sampling (signal processing)	Hongzhi Wu;Julie Dorsey;Holly E.

The model sensitivity to physics options was tested in the four seasons and the results were compared to observations at different locations. Different physics packages were used based on different planetary boundary layer (PBL) and radiation schemes. The question to be answered in this study is: which scheme is the best scheme for certain location and/or weather regime?. The paper presents the details of model configurations, the results of the carried out simulations, and the behavior of the model with different physics options and initializations at different locations. The best physics options for each location and how to get better solutions for areas with complex land-use characteristics was identified. This is beneficial in determining how to choose an optimal set-up for a forecasting system, especially in Egypt.	numerical weather prediction;planetary scanner;simulation	H. S. Badr;H. A. Kandil;B.

We abstract the labelling problem using a support graph with each graph node representing a possible object-label assignment and the edge weights representing label compatibilities. Initial object-label probabilities are updated using a relaxation-like process. The update equation is the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, and is governed by an infinitesimal generator matrix computed from the edge-weights of the support graph. Iterative updating of the label probabilities can be effected using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the generator matrix. We illustrate the newly developed relaxation process for the applications of data classification.	generator matrix;graph (discrete mathematics);iterative method;linear programming relaxation;relaxation labelling	Hongfang Wang;Edwin R.

It is known that longer surface waves take more time to respond to surface winds, propagate further before decaying, and are generally less directly coupled to the local wind field. These factors could affect the ability of scattered GPS L-band signals to retrieve local wind fields. In this work, we attempt to quantify the relationship between the longwave spectrum and local winds by examining windspeed and surface slope measurements by buoys. Specifically, by applying a lag-correlator, it is observed that the average lag time decreases monotonically as the ocean surface wavelength decreases. It is found that 1 hour serves as a conservative bound on the average response time of L-band waves to local wind forcing.	cross-correlation;gps signals;global positioning system;l band;microwave;response time (technology);surface wave	David D.

However, in recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for this purpose. It is mainly two techniques that are used, SAR interferometry and stereoSAR. We have studied the influence of the snow cover on the accuracy of SAR derived DEMs. Three different Interferometric ERS1/2 tandem acquisitions are investigated, a dry-snow case, a wet-snow case and a no-snow case. It is found that with wet-snow the InSAR DEM has lowest accuracy. The dry-snow DEM is less accurate than the no-snow DEM, even though the coherence Is higher. This is explained by a redistribution of dry snow that can degrade the accuracy of interferometric DEM but still maintain high coherence. Six different Radamat s2-s7 stereo pair combinations covering dry-snow/dry-snow, wet-snowtwet-snow, partly-snow/partly-snow, no-snow/no-snow, dry-snow/no-snow and wet-snow/no-snow situations are considered. With stereoSAR It is observed that the type of snow cover has no significant Influence on the DEM accuracy. This is even the case for dry-snow/no-snow and wet-snow/no-snow stereopairs, even though these DEMs are less accurate than those originating from data with the same snow cover.	numerical aperture;synthetic data	Kjell Arild Høgda;Tore Guneriussen;Inge Lauknes	2002		10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026490	geomorphology;digital elevation model;geology;hydrology;physics;remote sensing	Robotics	81.38573081578998	-62.46654686369075	41046
bcf2999f302c64a11beb0531557728324a336573	quantifying land cover changes caused by granite quarries from 1973-2015 using landsat data		Environmental monitoring is an important aspect in sustainable development. The use of remote sensing in the mining industry has evolved significantly and allows for improved mapping and monitoring environmental impacts related to mining activities. The aim of this study was to measure land cover changes caused by granite quarrying activities located between Rustenburg and Brits towns, North West Province, South Africa using Landsat time series data. Landsat data used in the study were acquired in the years 1973, 1986, 1998 and 2015. Each image was classified using supervised classification and change detection was subsequently applied to measure land cover changes. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to highlight the dynamics in vegetation in the quarries. Accuracy assessment of the classification resulted in an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 75% and 0.71, respectively. The results of post –classification change detection revealed a significant increase of 907.4 ha in granite quarries between 1973 and 2015. The expansion in granite quarries resulted in development of water bodies (2.07 ha) within the quarries. Correspondingly, there were significant losses in vegetation (782.1 ha) and bare land (119 ha). NDVI results showed variability in mean NDVI values within the digitized quarries. The overall mean NDVI values trends showed that most granite quarries had the highest vegetation in 1998, while the least vegetation cover was observed 1986.	granite data services;kappa calculus;matthews correlation coefficient;multispectral image;recommender system;spatial variability;supervised learning;time series;towns;tree accumulation	Refilwe Moeletsi;Solomon Tesfamichael	2018		10.5220/0006675901960204	land cover;geomorphology;geology	HCI	83.41630779631619	-56.70848038013539	41090

More specifically, we are interested in optimally designing a sequence of experiments for probing a medium in order to form an image of the scatterers present in the medium. We consider the case where the received signal is corrupted by noise. We derive an expression for the mean square error for estimating the scatter coefficients and find the optimal sequence scheme that minimizes this error. Using the expression for the minimum mean square error, we show that we can do better than any beamforming approach to imaging. In the process, we also find the optimal energy allocation between the sequence of experiments. Closed-form expressions for the optimal transmission scheme and the minimum mean square error are provided.	beamforming;coefficient;design of experiments;experiment;image noise;mean squared error;optimal design;sensor	Raghuram Rangarajan;Raviv Raich;Alfred O.

The objectives of this study were to monitor the succession and changes in spatial structure of the vegetation after establishment of revegetation on windward sand dunes in arid area of Northwestern China, where the average annual rainfall is 160 mm. Field observations revealed that during the past 20 years, the main vegetation community has undergone a series of changes from herbages to herbages + Hedysarum scoparium to herbages + H. scoparium + Artemisia ordosica to Artemisia ordosica + herbages. In the diluvium and alluvium based sandy areas where the Nitraria tangutorum was the dominant species, the vegetation have had the succession from Nitraria tangutorum + herbages to Nitraria tangutorum + herbages + Artemisia ordosica to Artemisia ordosica + herbages + Nitraria tangutorum to Asterothamnus centrali + Stipa gobica + Artemisia ordosica. It is clear that, with the degradation of the man-assisted revegetation, e.g. H. scoparium, the natural species, such as Artemisia ordosica and herbages have dominated the communities. With the succession of the dominant species, the spatial structure of the plants has tended to concentrate to the height of 20-60 cm. Results revealed that the feasibility of sand dune fixation not only relates to the coverage of vegetation, but also to the spatial structure of the plants.	elegant degradation;succession	Jihe Wang;Quanlin Ma;Zihui Yang;Hujun Liu;E Youhao;Kejie Zhan	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

Understanding how soil moisture varies across the field is important for planning and management of those systems. Compared with traditional methods, the rapid developing methods of using remote sensing techniques have many advantages. In this paper, the developments, as well as the theories and methods of soil moisture monitoring and retrieving by remote sensing are summarized. A review on the study keys and development directions in the field of soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing is carried out. This paper mainly refers the theories and methods by using hyper spectrum data and microwave data, which are becoming mature and general used. A conclusion can be concluded that without the support of the assistant soil moisture data from observation and measurement, it is very difficult even impossible to retrieve the accurate value of surface moisture status only by remote sensing data.	automated planning and scheduling;ecology;elegant degradation;microwave;theory	Xiao Wang;Zengxiang Zhang	2005	Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2005.

We propose to combine low-level fusion and diffusion processes through the use of a unique model based on partial differential equations (PDE). The denoising process is driven by the seismic fault enhancing diffusion equation. Meanwhile, relevant information (as seismic faults) is injected in the fused blocks by an inverse diffusion process. One of the advantages of such an original approach is to improve the quality of the results in case of noisy inputs, frequently occurring in seismic unprocessed data. Finally, two examples will demonstrate the efficiency of our method on synthetic and real seismic data.	high- and low-level;noise reduction;numerical partial differential equations;synthetic intelligence	Sorin I.

Monitoring programs use multiple images for complete spatial coverage over time. Accurate retrievals of vegetation cover and vegetation change estimates can be hampered by variation, in both space and time, in the measured radiance, caused by atmospheric conditions, topography, sensor location, and sun elevation. In order to obtain estimates of cover that are comparable between images, and to retrieve accurate estimates of change, these sources of variation must be removed. In this paper we present a preprocessing scheme for minimising atmospheric, topographic and bi-directional reflectance effects on Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and SPOT-5 HRG imagery. The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute surface-leaving radiance, and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in reflectance. The bi-directional reflectance model has been parameterised for eastern Australia, but the general approach is more widely applicable. The result is surface reflectance standardised to a fixed viewing and illumination geometry. The method can be applied to the entire record for these instruments, without intervention, which is of increasing importance with the increased availability of long term Remote Sens. 2013, 5 84 image archives. Validation shows that the corrections improve the estimation of reflectance at any given angular configuration, thus allowing the removal from the reflectance signal of much variation due to factors independent of the land surface. The method has been used to process over 45,000 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ scenes and 2,500 SPOT-5 scenes, over eastern Australia, and is now in use in operational monitoring programs.	angularjs;approximation error;archive;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;diffuse reflection;hemispherical resonator gyroscope;preprocessor;row (database);sensor;the australian;topography;xml:tm	Neil Flood;Tim Danaher;Tony Gill;Sam Gillingham	2013	Remote Sensing	10.3390/rs5010083	meteorology;topographic map;terrain;astronomy;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;atmosphere;optics;physics;albedo;remote sensing	Graphics	82.66611201540572	-62.17193199669117	41346

The studied family of curves, called $C_1$, appeared in previous works as a suitable manifold for modeling imaging concepts in conventional and Compton scattering tomography (CST). More specifically, the straight line, integral support of the classical Radon transform used in computed tomography (CT) belongs to $C_1$. In conventional tomography, many reconstruction techniques compute the derivative of the data with the aim of reducing the order of singularity of the reconstruction kernel associated here to the Radon transform in two dimensions. However, differentiating data requires a regularization step (for instance, convolution with a smooth function) which reduces the resolution of reconstructed images.

It is known that the performance of such methods can be significantly improved by taking into account the statistical dependencies between the wavelet coefficients. It is shown that the vector-based hidden Markov model (VB-HMM) is capable of capturing both the subband marginal distribution and the inter-scale, intra-scale and cross orientation dependencies of the wavelet coefficients. In view of this, we propose a new maximum a posteriori estimator using the VB-HMM as a prior for the wavelet coefficients of images. This is realized by deriving an efficient closed-form expression for the shrinkage function. Experimental results are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed denoising method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both the peak signal to noise ratio and perceptual quality.	coefficient;hidden markov model;marginal model;markov chain;newton's method;noise reduction;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical model;wavelet	Marzieh Amini;M.

c73dab2cbabe2ab2019f8cbf4d16b2fa0173427c	an image sharpening strategy based on multiframe super resolution for multispectral data		Spatial resolution is one of the most important assessments to evaluate an image. Enhancing spatial resolution consequently becomes a hot issue. As is all known, multispectral (MS) image, which is widely studied in remote sensing (RS) field, can be fused with the corresponding high-resolution panchromatic image to promote spatial-quality. In this paper, we consider the question regarding how to enhance the spatial resolution of multispectral image in the case that we do not have high-resolution panchromatic image. The only inputs are the MS data and the same spatial-resolution multi-frame panchromatic image. This paper addresses the application of super-resolution (SR) reconstruction technique and provides a suggestion for MS image sharpening. We generate a high-resolution panchromatic image based on SR. Then we adjust it and the low-resolution MS image into the same size. At last, we fuse them via a hybrid image sharpening technique.

We find that the L-band VV, HH, and HV radar backscatter data increase by 6-7 dB from 5 to 25 m/s wind speed at a 45° incidence angle. The data suggest the validity of Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) HH model function between 5 and 15 m/s wind speeds, but show that the extrapolation of PALSAR model at above 20 m/s wind speeds overpredicts A0 and a1 coefficients. There is wind direction dependence in the radar backscatter with about 4 dB differences between upwind and crosswind observations at 24 m/s wind speed for VV and HH. The passive brightness temperatures show about a 5-K change for TV and a 7-K change for TH for a wind speed increasing from 5 to 25 m/s. Circle flight data suggest a wind direction response of about 1-2 K in TV and TH at 14 and 24 m/s wind speeds. The L-band microwave data show excellent linear correlation with the surface wind speed with a correlation better than 0.95. The results support the use of L-band radar data for estimating the wind-driven excess brightness temperature of sea surfaces. The data also support the applications of L-band microwave signals for high-resolution (kilometer scale) observation of ocean surface winds under high wind conditions (10-28 m/s).	coefficient;extrapolation;image resolution;incidence matrix;l band;microwave;offset binary;phased array;radar;verification and validation	Simon H.

Single image haze removal using dark channel prior and guided filter is one of the state-of-art algorithms recently proposed. However, its large quantity of calculation limits its real-time processing ability. So, in this paper, we design a hardware accelerator based on FPGA implementation for single image haze removal, which takes full advantage of the powerful parallel processing ability of the hardware and the parallelism of the algorithm. To be exactly, 1) the dark channel calculation part and the atmospheric light calculation part of the algorithm are modified to reduce the quantity of computation; 2) two pipelines are applied in the guided filtering to speed up the processing; 3) in addition, fast mean filtering technique is used to accelerate the mean filtering, which is the main calculation of the guided filter, by avoiding redundant computation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is also the first FPGA design for single image haze removal using dark channel prior and guided filtering. The design can achieve 13.74ms at 100 MHz when processing a 720 × 576 image, and gives almost the same results as that of original algorithm.	algorithm;autostereogram;computation;fast fourier transform;field-programmable gate array;graphics pipeline;hardware acceleration;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;parallel computing;pipeline (computing);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription	Zhengfa Liang;Hengzhu Liu;Botao Zhang;Benzhang Wang	2014	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.11.20141002	computer vision;simulation;hardware acceleration;computer science;operating system;computer graphics (images)	EDA	66.50105342624654	-59.52801188310749	41852
