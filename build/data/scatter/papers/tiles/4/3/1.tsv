93ffd0867931b827f9977c64773668918bade033	stable length distributions in colocalized polymerizing and depolymerizing protein filaments	actin filaments;journal_article;92c37;grupo de excelencia;hyperbolic conservation law;ciencias basicas y experimentales;matematicas;nonlocal boundary condition	A model for the dynamics of the length distribution in co-localized groups of polar polymer filaments is presented. It considers nucleation, polymerization at plus-ends, and depolymerization at minus-ends and is derived as a continuous macroscopic limit from a discrete description. Its main feature is a nonlinear coupling due to competition of the depolymerizing ends for the limited supply of a depolymerization agent. The model takes the form of an initial-boundary value problem for a one-dimensional nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law, subject to a nonlinear, nonlocal boundary condition. Besides existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions, convergence to a steady state is proven. Technical difficulties are caused by the fact that the prescribed boundary data are not always assumed by entropy solutions.	courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;disassembler;discretization;linear programming relaxation;maximal set;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;polymer;quantum nonlocality;social inequality;stationary process;steady state;theory;video-in video-out	Heinrich Freistühler;Christian Schmeiser;Nikolaos Sfakianakis	2012	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/100815773	classical mechanics;actin;mathematical optimization;calculus;mathematics	Theory	85.7565145536354	2.562956304880727	4281

The active actuation of the agent in “pole support phase” plays important roles in improving vaulting performance. Investigating this actuation can contribute to the design of novel control strategies during the time when the agent contacts with environment through the elastic device. In this study, we specifically examined an active bending effect performed in the “pole support phase.” We analyzed the active bending effect on reachable height (vaulting height) using the “Transitional Buckling Model.” We applied this active bending theory to a robot and verified the active bending effect to improve vaulting height. Results show that active bending motion in the “pole support phase” improves the pole vault performance and that the timing of the bending direction change is an important factor for defining the vaulting performance. These results will facilitate the application of robots using large elasticity.	buckling;elasticity (cloud computing);emergence;pole–zero plot;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Toshihiko Fukushima;Satoshi Nishikawa;Yasuo Kuniyoshi	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907471	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	69.96112458237306	-23.135085640488004	4305

The essence of the method is rendering color map Gouraud-shaded polygons. In color map Gouraud shading, the interpolated values are not the RGB color components but the indices of entries in a color map. The method can produce a great variety of complex patterns, and the generation time depends almost solely on the speed of rendering Gouraud-shaded polygons.	color mapping;gouraud shading	Hansong Zhang	1996	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/0097-8493(95)00076-3	sampling;computer vision;color image;gouraud shading;computer science;graphics;color space;generation time;computer graphics (images)	Vision	65.94701719187832	-49.06080821292805	4316

A group of agents sequentially receive noisy signals about the parameter (or moving target), which does not follow any particular dynamics. The parameter is not observable to an individual agent, but it is globally identifiable for the whole network. Viewing the problem with an online optimization lens, we aim to provide the finite-time or non-asymptotic analysis of the problem. To this end, we use a notion of dynamic regret which suits the online, non-stationary nature of the problem. In our setting, dynamic regret can be recognized as a finite-time counterpart of stability in the mean-square sense. We develop a distributed, online algorithm for tracking the moving target. Defining the path-length as the consecutive differences between target locations, we express an upper bound on regret in terms of the path-length of the target and network errors. We further show the consistency of the result with static setting and noiseless observations.	mathematical optimization;observable;online algorithm;online optimization;regret (decision theory);stationary process	Shahin Shahrampour;Alexander Rakhlin;Ali Jadbabaie	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525056	benchmark;mathematical optimization;estimation;vehicle dynamics;trajectory;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	54.356112252905376	2.638641854086182	4319

It is shown that the recipe of modifying standard receding horizon CG schemes based on the full knowledge of the state is effective provided that the latter is exactly computed at any time. On the contrary, when simple-shaped outer approximations of SUS are exploited for reducing the numerical complexity of the algorithm, loss of solvability or stability may result.

A set of force sensors to measure trainee’s ground reaction force are arranged at the force plates. The gait phases is detected by a neural network which inputs the force measurements directly. To realize the system in practical applications, we represent the rehabilitation expert knowledge by fuzzy membership functions and rules. The velocity tuning commands to assist the rehabitation process are generated through the fuzzy inference engine in each detection cycle. We have completed the integration of these techniques in experimental tests. The results demonstrate that the system is able to adapt to the trainee walking phase to increase the training effect.	artificial neural network;inference engine;sensor;velocity (software development)	Ren C.

Large magnification zooming is realized with a combination of optical zooming and electric zooming. When the magnification ratio is large, however, optical stabilization cannot completely remove unwanted vibrations in a video sequence induced by camera motion. Also, the zoomed video suffers from blur when the simple frame magnification is used for the electric zooming.	attribute-value system;digital video;super-resolution imaging;zoomed video port	Satoshi Kondo;Tadamasa Toma	2006		10.1145/1179849.1179957	computer vision;reflection;visualization;refraction;computer science;graphics hardware;caustic;superresolution;computer graphics (images)	Vision	62.754611276205374	-51.939800356786286	4392

By prescribed performance we mean that the tracking error converges to a predefined arbitrarily small residual set, with convergence rate no less than a prespecified value, exhibiting maximum overshoot as well as undershoot less than some sufficiently small preassigned constants. Utilizing an output error transformation, we obtain a transformed system whose robust stabilization is proven necessary and sufficient to achieve prescribed performance guarantees for the output tracking error of the original system, provided that initially the transformed system is well defined. Consequently, a switching robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF)-based adaptive, state feedback controller is designed, to solve the stated problem. The proposed controller is continuous and successfully overcomes the problem of computing the control law when the approximation model becomes uncontrollable.

In this study, a robust fuzzy-neural-network (FNN) control system is implemented to control a dual-axis inverted-pendulum mechanism that is driven by permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motors. The energy conservation principle is adopted to build a mathematical model of the motor-mechanism-coupled system. Moreover, a robust FNN control system is developed for stabilizing and tracking control of the dual-axis inverted-pendulum system. In this control system, a FNN controller is used to learn an equivalent control law as in the traditional sliding-mode control, and a robust controller is designed to ensure the near total sliding motion through the entire state trajectory without a reaching phase. The salient advantages of this FNN-based control scheme are as follows. 1) It does not require a perfect knowledge of system uncertainties so that this brings a high level of autonomy to the overall system and make the use of this control scheme very attractive for real time applications. 2) All adaptive learning algorithms in this control system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability analysis, so that system-tracking stability can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system. 3) Not only the weight vector in the rule-to-output layer are adjusted on line but also the mean and the standard deviation of Gaussian functions in the membership function layer. This training scheme will increase the learning capability of the FNN. 4) An adaptive bound estimation algorithm is investigated to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertain term including the minimum reconstructed error, higher-order term in Taylor series, and network parameters approximation error. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy can be verified by numerical simulation and experimental results.	adaptive filter;algorithm;apache axis;approximation error;artificial neural network;autonomy;computer simulation;control system;control theory;high-level programming language;inverted pendulum;lyapunov fractal;machine learning;mathematical model;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;optimal control	Rong-Jong Wai;Li-Jung Chang	2006	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859305	robust control;inverted pendulum;variable structure control;mathematical optimization;approximation error;magnet;pendulum;synchronous motor;higher-order logic;sliding mode control;membership function;energy conservation;adaptive control;computer science;networked control system;control system;taylor series;automatic control;mathematical model;control theory;gaussian process;mathematics;standard deviation;adaptive learning;fuzzy control system	Robotics	64.16805234248108	-10.365749888782883	4451

In such videos, the instructor's arms often obstruct the trainee's view of the work area. In this article, we present a diminished reality method for visualizing the work area hidden by an instructor's arms by capturing the work area with multiple cameras. To achieve such diminished reality, we propose detour light field rendering (DLFR), in which light rays avoid passing through penalty points set in the unstructured light fields reconstructed from multiple viewpoint images. In DLFR, the camera blending field used in an existing freeviewpoint image generation method known as unstructured lumigraph is re-designed based on our use cases. In this re-design, lesser weights are given to light rays as they pass close to given penalty points. Experimental results demonstrate that using DLFR, the appearance of an undesirable object can be removed from an image in real time.	alpha compositing;coat of arms;glossary of computer graphics;light field;mike lesser;ray (optics)	Shohei Mori;Momoko Maezawa;Naoto Ienaga;Hideo Saito	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR-Adjunct)	10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2016.0098	iterative reconstruction;computer vision;computational photography;real-time computing;visualization;computer science;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	61.44096305211257	-50.10500958043757	4485

We perform an experiment in which a mobile robot localizes using dead reckoning and range measurements to stationary radio-frequency beacons in its environment, incorporating the range measurements into the position estimate using a Kalman lter. This data set involves over 20,000 range readings to surveyed beacons while a robot moved continuously over a path for nearly 1 hour. Careful groundtruth accurate to a few centimeters was recorded during this motion. We show the improvement of the robot's position estimate over dead reckoning even when the range readings are very noisy. We extend this approach to the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), localizing both the robot and tag positions from noisy initial estimates. Finally, we discuss how our methods will be extended in future research.	dead reckoning;kalman filter;mobile robot;radio frequency;sensor;simultaneous localization and mapping;stationary process	Derek Kurth;George Kantor;Sanjiv Singh	2003		10.1109/IROS.2003.1250754	kalman filter;monte carlo localization;computer vision;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;simultaneous localization and mapping	Robotics	55.39187391464908	-36.44981165083032	4490

The controller gives an appropriate signal to the control valve depending upon the difference between the measured flow rate and the set flow rate. Conventional flowmeters produce a differential pressure in the flow, which is measured and suitably scaled to get the flow rate. Incidentally, a control valve uses the principle of restricting the area for flow which in turn produces a differential pressure. From the above, it is seen that if a relationship is developed between the differential pressure produced by the control valve and the flow through it, the valve itself could function as a flow meter also, apart from acting as a control valve. A relationship for this was established based on the equation for control valve capacity (Cv) for different valve positions. The expression requires knowledge of the differential pressure across the valve, the static pressure, temperature, the valve position, and the CvVs valve position characteristics in order to measure and control the flow rate. Error analysis is performed for the expression and to suggest means to improve the accuracy level. An iterative approach is necessary in order to obtain a particular flow rate using this method. This necessitates the use of a computer or a processor-based system, similar to present day intelligent controllers, to implement the scheme. A prototype was made in the laboratory using a 50-mm conventional control valve with pneumatic actuator, working as the control valve and flowmeter. An HP data acquisition and control system (DACS), used as the controller, was also used to provide the appropriate output signal to achieve the necessary flow control. The unit was calibrated at the air flow laboratory to an accuracy of 1:5%.	control system;data acquisition;iterative method;prototype	M. Atmanand Aumanand;M. S. Konnur	1999	IEEE Trans.

It does not need special force sensors. Some configurations of the power assistance system are also shown. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by feasibility experiments.

The approach recognizes special surfaces, i.e. planes, spheres, cones and cylinders, and offsets them precisely. An approximate offset surface within the specified tolerance is computed for a general free form surface. The method for a general free form surface consists of (1) sample offset surface based on second derivatives; (2) eliminate sample points which can give self-intersections; (3) surface fitting through the remaining sample points; and (4) removal of all the removable knots of the surface. The approach checks for self-intersections in the offset surface and removes the same automatically, if any. The non-self-intersecting offsets for surface of extrusion and surface of revolution are obtained by removing the self-intersections in the offset generator and profile curves respectively using point sampling, cleaning of sampled points, curve fitting and knot removal. The approach has better control on error. It generates offset surface with less number of control points and degree. The methodology works only for a class of problems where in the offset of a single  G  1  surface is still a single connected surface without having any holes. The offset methodology has been demonstrated through three types of surfaces namely surface of revolution, surface of extrusion and a general free form surface. This approach has been extensively used in creation of offset surfaces of composite laminate components. The presented approach can also be used to check for self-intersections in any general surface and to remove the same, if any, with little modifications, as long as the cleaned surface is a single connected surface.	non-uniform rational b-spline;offset (computer science)	G.

Based on Lyapunov criterion and Razumikhin theorem, two types of stabilizing controller are designed. One is the linear state feedback controller and the other is the parallel distributed fuzzy controller (PDFC). For each type of the controller, there are some sufficient conditions to be derived under which the whole closed-loop fuzzy time-delay system is stable asymptotically. Moreover, those sufficient conditions can be transformed into the problem of LMIs. The stabilizing controllers can be obtained by solving the LMIs. Finally, a practical continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system is given to illustrate the control design and its stabilization effectiveness.	broadcast delay;control engineering;control theory;controller (computing);feedback;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;logic synthesis;lyapunov fractal;reactor (software);routh–hurwitz stability criterion;self-stabilization	Wei-wei Lin;Wen-June Wang	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571192	continuous stirred-tank reactor;mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;exponential stability;fuzzy control system	Robotics	68.2676147821731	-0.0415645204591344	4565
8269952dee2f242cc54815e33918385b9d2e6764	lower limb musculoskeletal stiffness analysis during swing phase as a cable-driven serial chain system		To execute a lower limb movement task, the central nervous system (CNS) in human makes continuous adjustment through musculoskeletal system to generate suitable joint stability. Primarily, this is achieved by modulating the multi-joint stiffness values through adjustments in limb posture and muscle contraction level. This ability of CNS plays a significant role during a robotic gait rehabilitation training, where external forces are used to assist the leg training. A lower limb musculoskeletal model to study the stiffness variations during a movement task can be useful in designing better human-robot interaction paradigm. In this work, we model the lower limb musculoskeletal system as a cable-driven serial chain system during the swing phase of walking. Multijoint stiffness matrix is formulated for the serial chain system considering different number of muscles. Various joint stiffness parameters are formulated to study the role of dominant swing phase muscles in altering the multi-joint stiffness values.	cns;human–robot interaction;loose coupling;poor posture;programming paradigm;robot;stiffness matrix	Tassio Melo;N.

This paper presents a result which shows that a non-constant continuous model with a bounded time derivative does not exist when the system to be embedded is a discrete chaotic process. The result presented here does not contradict Takens' theorem which has no requirement of a bounded time derivative. The assumption of a bounded derivative is an important one since recurrent neural network learning rules usually implicitly assume that a bounded time derivative exists for the network dynamics equations which define the system model.	chaos theory	Edward M.

However, the muscle structure of vertebrate legs incorporates both a flexor-extensor architecture and biarticular muscles — muscles that span two joints. Flexor-extensor architecture enables the joint to swing freely when muscles are relaxed, while biarticular muscles have been shown to play an important role in transferring power from proximal to distal body parts, enabling high-powered motions such as running and jumping. In this paper, we present a robot leg based on the muscle structure of the human leg, incorporating biarticular muscles and a flexor-extensor architecture. We demonstrate that this robot leg is able to use it's biarticular “muscles” to transfer power from the upper limb to the ankle, mimicking key characterisitics of the human leg.	pneumatic artificial muscles;radio frequency;robot leg;software release life cycle	Theresa J.

The fabrication of these microparts is challenging due to their small size (0.5×0.5×0.2mm overall, 60μm thickness) and complex 3-D shape. Another challenge is the requirement that the parts need to be stably fixed on the wafer but at the same time easily removed by a two-finger microgripper. We developed a MEMS process to solve these critical issues with the following features: (1) SU-8 is used as the material for the parts because it is biocompatible and photo-patternable; (2) The 3-D profile is obtained by combining molding on a patterned Si substrate and photolithography. The extremely flat surface of the part is obtained by careful reflow of the SU-8; (3) A large number of microparts are fabricated on a regular matrix and at the same time can be easily lifted to facilitate grasping by a microgripper in the subsequent automatic assembly process.

Using a very limited set of ab initio and experimental data, semiempirical parameters are reoptimized to provide globally accurate potential energy surfaces, thereby eliminating the need for full-fledged ab initio dynamics simulations, which are very expensive. Through reoptimization of the semiempirical methods, excited-state energetics are predicted accurately, while retaining accurate ground-state predictions. The results show that the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm consistently yields solutions that are significantly better---up to 230% lower error in the energy and 86.5% lower error in the energy-gradient---than those reported in the literature. Multiple high-quality parameter sets are obtained that are verified with quantum dynamical calculations, which show near-ideal behavior on critical and untested excited state geometries. The results demonstrate that the reparameterization strategy via evolutionary algorithms is a promising way to extend direct dynamics simulations of photochemistry to multi-picosecond time scales.	dynamical system;evolutionary algorithm;excited state;genetic algorithm;gradient;ground state;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;simulation	Kumara Sastry;Duane D Johnson;Alexis L.

This paper presents a new numerical procedure for 3UPU and 3UPS spherical wrists, which is able to count and identify the disjoint regions into which the workspace is partitioned by the singularity surface and to assess to which region any two points of the workspace belong. If the two points belong to the same region, a singularity-free path connecting them is found.	jacobian matrix and determinant;numerical analysis;technological singularity;workspace	Davide Paganelli	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363148	control engineering;parallel manipulator;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;motion planning;actuator	Robotics	69.55907457984759	-21.20240166748289	4679

54c34c84e290d60cc490ca990728e0097928f41a	a closed-loop constant-temperature constant-voltage charging technique to reduce charge time of lithium-ion batteries		Existing charging techniques for lithium-ion batteries use a largely open-loop approach, where the charge profile is predecided based on a priori knowledge of cell parameters. There is a need for closed-loop charging techniques that use instantaneous cell voltage and/or temperature to modulate the charging current magnitude. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a constant-temperature constant-voltage (CT-CV) charging technique, considering cell temperature as a key degradation metric. The proposed CT-CV charging scheme employs a simple and easy-to-implement proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller aided by a feed-forward term. The charging current is dynamically adjusted in response to the battery temperature, which indirectly reflects its aging and thermal environment. As per experimental results, the proposed method achieves 20% faster charging with the same total temperature rise as constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) technique. Alternatively, it causes 20% lower cell temperature rise for given total charge time. It can easily accommodate applications that demand even faster charging by simply raising the set temperature. This paper establishes the benefits of the proposed CT-CV charging at cell level and raises the possibility of extending it to the pack level by integrating it with battery management systems.	ct scan;elegant degradation;pid	Lalit Patnaik;A.

258aefa948a224871fdea0d3cb70eaf04b731113	two-scale topology optimization with microstructures		In this paper we present a novel two-scale framework to optimize the structure and the material distribution of an object given its functional specications. Our approach utilizes multi-material microstructures as low-level building blocks of the object. We start by precomputing the material property gamut – the set of bulk material properties that can be achieved with all material microstructures of a given size. We represent the boundary of this material property gamut using a level set eld. Next, we propose an ecient and general topology optimization algorithm that simultaneously computes an optimal object topology and spatially-varying material properties constrained by the precomputed gamut. Finally, we map the optimal spatially-varying material properties onto the microstructures with the corresponding properties in order to generate a high-resolution printable structure. We demonstrate the ecacy of our framework by designing, optimizing, and fabricating objects in dierent material property spaces on the level of a trillion voxels, i.e several orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with current systems.	3d modeling;3d printing;acm transactions on graphics;algorithm;call of duty: black ops;elasticity (data store);hereditary property;high- and low-level;image resolution;interior algebra;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;precomputation;robot end effector;sql server compact;sampling (signal processing);topology optimization;voxel	Bo Zhu;Mélina Skouras;Desai Chen;Wojciech Matusik	2017	ACM Trans.

In the proposed RWNNC system, a wavelet neural network controller is the main tracking controller that is used to mimic a computed torque control law, and a robust controller is designed to recover the residual approximation for ensuring the stable control performance. Moreover, to relax the requirement for a known bound on lumped uncertainty, which comprises a minimum approximation error, optimal network parameters and higher order terms in a Taylor series expansion of the wavelet functions, an RWNNC system with adaptive bound estimation was investigated for the control of an induction servo motor drive. In this control system, a simple adaptive algorithm was utilized to estimate the bound on lumped uncertainty. In addition, numerical simulation and experimental results due to periodic commands show that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to parameter variations and external load disturbance.	algorithm;robust control;servo;wavelet	Rong-Jong Wai	2002	IEEE Trans.

We study the conditions under which information can be sustained in such a system. The anchor zone is assumed to be a circular disk, and a random walk type mobility model is adopted. First, we consider the one-speed case where all the nodes have a common velocity. Using the transport equation, adopted from nuclear reactor theory, we derive the criticality condition that defines a lower limit for the product of node density, communication distance and the radius of the anchor zone necessary for information floating. The dependence of this criticality parameter on the mean step size of the random walk is numerically established. Complemented by the asymptotic behavior, found by diffusion theory, an accurate approximation formula is derived. While the velocity of the nodes does not appear at all in the criticality condition of the one-speed system, in general, the shape of the velocity distribution has an important effect: the higher the spread of the distribution, the lower the criticality threshold is. This effect is analyzed and discussed.	self-organized criticality	Jorma T. Virtamo;Esa Hyytiä;Pasi E. Lassila	2013	Perform.

A variable structure output feedback stabilizing controller is designed by the Lyapunov function approach. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop system without disturbance is associated with a nonlinear semigroup and is asymptotically stable. In addition, we show that this controller is robust to the external disturbance in the sense that the vibrating energy of the closed-loop system is also convergent to zero as time goes to infinity in the presence of finite sum of harmonic disturbance at the control end.	block cipher mode of operation;euler;euler–bernoulli beam theory;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Bao-Zhu Guo;Wen Kang	2013	Proceedings of the 32nd Chinese Control Conference	10.1080/00207179.2013.861931	control engineering;variable structure control;mathematical optimization;stability;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	69.93258348270506	-0.9430617644759967	4841

Through the combination of sapphire inductively coupled plasma etching and the direct bonding process, a vacuum-sealed cavity employable for high temperature applications is achieved. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) research of the bonding interface indicates that the two sapphire pieces are well bonded and the cavity structure stays intact. Moreover, the tensile testing shows that the bonding strength of the bonding interface is in excess of 7.2 MPa. The advantage of sapphire direct bonding is that it is free from the various problems caused by the mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion between different materials. Therefore, the bonded vacuum-sealed cavity can be potentially further developed into an all-sapphire pressure sensor for high temperature applications.	3-mercaptopropionic acid;body cavities;coefficient;dental caries;direct bonding;fever;fiber optic technology;interface device component;microelectromechanical systems;offset binary;optical fiber;plasma active;plasma etching;pressure sensor device component;pyschological bonding;scanning electron microscopy;simulated annealing;tissue fiber;sensor (device);tensile strength	Wangwang Li;Ting Liang;Yulei Chen;Pinggang Jia;Jijun Xiong;Ying-ping Hong;Cheng Lei;Zong Yao;Lei Qi;Wenyi Liu	2017		10.3390/s17092080	engineering;analytical chemistry;scanning electron microscope;annealing (metallurgy);tensile testing;inductively coupled plasma;anodic bonding;direct bonding;sapphire;silicon on sapphire	HCI	92.69603734894743	-16.282907685172653	4860

To overcome the first problem, the system is decomposed into a zero dynamic subsystem and an input-output subsystem-the stability of the former is guaranteed by pole placement, while a NTSM controller is designed for the latter to realize its finite time convergence and better control performance. The relationship between the initial point and the sliding mode reaching time is explored, and further the convergence time is estimated to overcome the second problem.

The method uses a CMOS camera with a trigger control to allow recording of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals alternatively at two particular wavelengths, and determines the SpO2 from the measured ratios of the pulsatile to the nonpulsatile components of the PPG signals at these wavelengths. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SpO2 value depends on the choice of the wavelengths. We found that the combination of orange (λ = 611 nm) and near infrared (λ = 880 nm) provides the best SNR for the noncontact video-based detection method. This combination is different from that used in traditional contact-based SpO2 measurement since the PPG signal strengths and camera quantum efficiencies at these wavelengths are more amenable to SpO2 measurement using a noncontact method. We also conducted a small pilot study to validate the noncontact method over an SpO2 range of 83%-98%. This study results are consistent with those measured using a reference contact SpO2 device (r = 0.936, p <; 0.001). The presented method is particularly suitable for tracking one's health and wellness at home under free-living conditions, and for those who cannot use traditional contact-based PPG devices.	cmos;dual;efficiency;oxygen 100 % gas for inhalation;oxygen saturation measurement;oxygen saturation test result;photoplethysmography;srgn gene;signal-to-noise ratio;wavelength	Dangdang Shao;Chenbin Liu;Francis Tsow;Yuting Yang;Zijian Du;Rafael Iriya;Huiye Qiu;Nongjian Tao	2016	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2481896	absorption;electronic engineering;engineering;oxygen saturation;optics;physics;light-emitting diode	Visualization	94.04721158536044	-21.796157776028384	4915

Here we demonstrate autonomous robotic contour following with a biomimetic tactile fingertip, the TacTip, using an active touch method previously developed for other types of touch sensors. We use Bayesian sequential analysis for perception and implement an active control strategy to follow an object contour. The technique is tested on a 110 mm diameter circle and yields results comparable with those previously achieved for other tactile sensors. We intend to extend the work onto a different robot platform with improved trajectory control to improve robustness, speed and match with human performance.	biomimetics;contour line	Nicholas Pestell;Benjamin Ward-Cherrier;Luke Cramphorn;Nathan F.

572857ce8e9b481693c4ea9aeeedb0a17d864f96	dynamic pressure simulation of an external gear pump with relief chamber using a morphological approach		During the working cycle of an external gear pump, hydraulic oil trapped between the pair of meshing gear and pinon teeth may exert high-pressure pulses due to periodic volumetric compression and expansion of the trapped volume. The pressure pulses cause excessive alternating radial loads on the gear shafts, partially responsible for the noise and vibration in the unit. To reduce the trapped pressure pulsation, a relief chamber that connected to the trapped volume to absorb the pressure pulsation is designed in place of the traditional relief grooves to avoid the reconciliation between cross port leakage and pressure pulsation reduction. A new lumped parameter model compatible 2D morphological approach is proposed based on the mapping of gear profile function from real coordinate space to a binary-valued matrix in the integer coordinate space, reducing the control area calculation problem from polygon segmentation and numerical integration to pixel counting, relaxing the computational difficulty in design evaluations. Initial results show that the proposed method can trace and calculate the area of the trapped region, and the relief chamber is capable of effectively attenuating the peak magnitude of trapped pressure pulses by 95%.

c2020bd56fc7a100b4718c72a9e046b191d47e34	a hybrid kalman filtering approach based on federated framework for gas turbine engine health monitoring		The Kalman filter (KF) is the most common state estimation method for gas turbine health monitoring, and it runs in the centralized architecture. However, health estimation cannot be achieved by the KF-based method as sensor fault occurs, and malfunction of the central monitoring unit will unavoidably result to the termination of the diagnosis task. For these purposes, this paper develops a novel hybrid federated KF approach from the previous achievements. The hybrid KF consists of a bank of local filters and one master filter, and the federated filtering structure and asynchronous fusion mechanism are designed. Both the linearized KF and extended KF are employed as the local filters based on the linear correlation of thermodynamic parameters. The local state estimates and covariance are yielded in parallel, and then integrated in a master filter to produce global state estimate. The proposed methodology is evaluated and compared with the general federated KFs in terms of estimation accuracy, computational efforts, and robustness to sensor fault in the application of gas turbine health monitoring. The result shows that the hybrid KF is the best balance off the involved performance, and confirms our viewpoints in this paper.	centralized computing;kalman filter;local variable	Feng Lu;Yihuan Huang;Jinquan Huang;Xiaojie Qiu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2780278	robustness (computer science);filter (signal processing);genetic algorithm;architecture;control engineering;computer science;distributed computing;kalman filter;turbine;covariance;asynchronous communication	Robotics	55.52759307999026	-1.0354197523701048	4998

The technique permits deriving explicit expressions for the closed-loop transfer functions that describe the relevant system dynamics. It is shown that the closed-loop poles can be determined by finding the roots of two characteristic polynomial equations, hence allowing a complete characterization of the asymptotic stability of the system. The controllers require the specification of a large number of tuning parameters, including prediction and control horizons for every input and output signal as well as the elements of input and output weighting matrices. The stability analysis tools proposed lend significant support to the tuning task because sets of parameters that produce unstable poles can be identified and rejected. Furthermore, since the location of the poles influences the speed of the closed-loop response, it is also possible to compare the relative merits of alternative sets of stabilizing tuning parameters. Finally, it is shown that the multivariable predictive-control law can be written in standard shift–operator form, facilitating the implementation in a digital control computer using only shift registers, scalar multiplications, and scalar additions. The approach is illustrated in an example involving the control of a multistage gas–liquid absorption column.	polynomial	Giovani C. Nunes;Serkan Kincal;Oscar D.

These maps require accuracy in both the number of lanes and positioning of every lane, which we call lanelevel maps. Here, we present a method that combines coarse, inaccurate prior maps from OpenStreetMap (OSM) with local sensor information from 3D Lidar and a positioning system. We formulate a probabilistic model of lane structure using such information, and develop a number of tractable inference algorithms. These algorithms leverage the coarse structural information present in OSM, and integrates it with the highly accurate local sensor measurements. The resulting maps have extremely good alignment with manually constructed baseline maps generated for autonomous driving experiments.	algorithm;autonomous car;autonomous robot;baseline (configuration management);cobham's thesis;develop;experiment;high-level programming language;map;online algorithm;online and offline;openstreetmap;positioning system;sensor;statistical model	Avdhut Joshi;Michael R.

These parameters are estimated from the short-time Fourier transform using a simple peak-picking algorithm. Rapid changes in the highly resolved spectral components are tracked using the concept of “birth” and “death” of the underlying sine waves. For a given frequency track a cubic function is used to unwrap and interpolate the phase such that the phase track is m,aximally smooth. This phase function is applied to a sine-wave generator, which is amplitude modulated and added to the other sine waves to give the final speech output. The resulting synthetic waveform preserves the general waveform shape and is essentially perceptually indistinguishable from the original speech. Furthermore, in the presence of noise the perceptual characteristics of the speech as well as the noise are maintained. In addition, it was found that the representation was sufficiently general that high-quality reproduction was obtained for a larger class of inputs including: two overlapping, superposed speech waveforms; music waveforms; speech in musical backgrounds; and certain marine biologic sounds. Finally, the analysis/synthesis system forms the basis for new approaches to the problems of speech transformations including timescale and pitch-scale modification, and midrate speech coding [SI, [9].	algorithm;cubic function;image noise;interpolation;modulation;quantum superposition;short-time fourier transform;sinusoidal model;speech coding;synthetic intelligence;waveform	Robert J.

Furthermore, the performance is evaluated for different detector configurations. The main conclusions from the simulations are that (1) the performance of the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter is comparable, (2) joint filtering performs significantly better than dual filtering, and (3) a larger number of detectors results in better state estimation, but has no significant influence on the parameter estimation error	estimation theory;extended kalman filter;freeway;sensor;simulation	Andreas Hegyi;Daniela Girimonte;Robert Babuska;Bart De Schutter	2006	2006 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference	10.1109/ITSC.2006.1707357	control engineering;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;fast kalman filter;control theory;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics;alpha beta filter	Robotics	57.563810683975575	-14.559714853526028	5051

If there is a single root at 1 or at -1, then simple differencing will remove the nonstationary component. However, determining an operator which would remove a nonstationary component having a more complex distribution of zeros on the unit circle is a much more complicated problem. In this paper we propose a method for finding operators for seasonal type components, which have an implied placement of zeros on the circle. This is applied to short time speech signals.		J.

73b282c6ef9a5d8c818c6771d07e4719b54b8251	enzyme immobilization strategies and electropolymerization conditions to control sensitivity and selectivity parameters of a polymer-enzyme composite glucose biosensor	polyphenylenediamine;biosensing techniques;amperometry;ascorbic acid interference;enzyme;glucose;enzymes immobilized;reproducibility of results;enzyme modified electrode;permeability;hydrogen peroxide;polymers;kinetics;calibration;brain monitoring	In an ongoing programme to develop characterization strategies relevant to biosensors for in-vivo monitoring, glucose biosensors were fabricated by immobilizing the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) on 125 μm diameter Pt cylinder wire electrodes (Pt(C)), using three different methods: before, after or during the amperometric electrosynthesis of poly(ortho-phenylenediamine), PoPD, which also served as a permselective membrane. These electrodes were calibrated with H(2)O(2) (the biosensor enzyme signal molecule), glucose, and the archetypal interference compound ascorbic acid (AA) to determine the relevant polymer permeabilities and the apparent Michaelis-Menten parameters for glucose. A number of selectivity parameters were used to identify the most successful design in terms of the balance between substrate sensitivity and interference blocking. For biosensors electrosynthesized in neutral buffer under the present conditions, entrapment of the GOx within the PoPD layer produced the design (Pt(C)/PoPD-GOx) with the highest linear sensitivity to glucose (5.0 ± 0.4 μA cm(-2) mM(-1)), good linear range (K(M) = 16 ± 2 mM) and response time (< 2 s), and the greatest AA blocking (99.8% for 1 mM AA). Further optimization showed that fabrication of Pt(C)/PoPD-GOx in the absence of added background electrolyte (i.e., electropolymerization in unbuffered enzyme-monomer solution) enhanced glucose selectivity 3-fold for this one-pot fabrication protocol which provided AA-rejection levels at least equal to recent multi-step polymer bilayer biosensor designs. Interestingly, the presence of enzyme protein in the polymer layer had opposite effects on permselectivity for low and high concentrations of AA, emphasizing the value of studying the concentration dependence of interference effects which is rarely reported in the literature.	3-nitro-o-phenylenediamine;ascorbic acid;biosensors;blocking (computing);buffers;cell signaling;cylinder seal;deny (action);diameter (qualifier value);entrapment of medical device or device component;glucose oxidase;immobiliser;interference (communication);marijuana abuse;mathematical optimization;numerous;permeability;phenylenediamines;polymer;pushd and popd;rejection sampling;response time (technology);selectivity (electronic);tissue membrane;video-in video-out;wire wrap;electrode;monomer	Sharon A.

Based on the sawtooth wave function, this paper initiates a novel approach for generating multi-wing butterfly chaotic attractors from the generalized first and second kinds of Lorenz-type systems. Compared with the traditional ring-shaped multi-scroll Lorenz chaotic attractors, the proposed multi-wing butterfly chaotic attractors are much easier to be designed and implemented by analog circuits. The dynamical behaviors of these multi-wing butterfly chaotic systems are further studied. Theoretical analysis shows that every index-2 saddle-focus equilibrium corresponds to a unique wing in the butterfly attractors. Finally, a module-based unified circuit diagram is constructed for realizing various multi-wing butterfly attractors. It should be especially pointed out that this is the first time in the literature that a maximal 10-wing butterfly chaotic attractor is experimentally verified by analog circuits.

The main strategy in this method is to rotate the upper body in a way to exert a secondary moment that counteracts to the factors which create the undesired moment. In order to compute the yaw moment by considering all the factors, we utilized Eulerian ZMP Resolution, as it is capable of characterizing the robot’s rotational inertia, a crucial component of its dynamics. In doing so, intrinsic angular momentum rate changes are smoothly included in yaw moment equations. Applying the proposed technique, we conducted several bipedal walking experiments using the actual bipedal robot CoMan. As the result, we obtained 61% decrease in undesired yaw moment and 82% regulation in yaw axis deviation, which satisfactorily verify the efficiency of the proposed approach, in comparison to off-the-shelf techniques.	angularjs;apache axis;coat of arms;computation;experiment;hudson;moment problem;motion planning;robot;smoothing;xfig;yaws;zero moment point	Barkan Ugurlu;Jody Alessandro Saglia;Nikolaos G.

In particular, we develop what we call an S-variable approach to the synthesis. S-variables are also called auxiliary variables in some references, and known to be useful for reducing conservativeness in robustness analysis and synthesis. In this paper, we show a sort of stochastic version of the conventional (i.e., deterministic) robust stability condition with S-variables, and numerically illustrate that introducing S-variables is also effective in the synthesis for systems characterized by random polytopes.	futures studies;lifting scheme;linear system;numerical analysis;time-invariant system;variable (computer science)	Yohei Hosoe;Dimitri Peaucelle	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810589	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	68.49997305576888	-0.4117405472541103	5117

From this perspective, a hydrodynamic lattice Boltzmann model for simulating immiscible multiphase flows with high density and high viscosity ratios, up to   O(1000)      O  (  1000  )         and   O(100)      O  (  100  )         respectively, is presented and validated against analytical solutions. The method is based on a two phase flow model with operators extended to handle  N    immiscible fluids. The current approach is   O(N)      O  (  N  )         in computational complexity for the number of different gradient approximations. This is a major improvement, considering the   O(N 2 )      O  (    N    2    )         complexity found in most works. A sequence of systematic and essential tests have been conducted to establish milestones that need to be met by the proposed approach (as well as by other methods). First, the method is validated qualitatively by demonstrating its ability to address the spinodal decomposition of immiscible fluids. Second, the model is quantitatively verified for the case of multilayered planar interfaces. Third, the multiphase Laplace law is studied for the case of three fluids. Fourth, a quality index is developed for the three-phase Laplace–Young’s law, which concerns the position of the interfaces between the fluids resulting from the different surface tensions. The current model is compatible with the analytical solution, and is shown to be first order accurate in terms of this quality index. Finally, the multilayered Couette’s flow is studied. In this study, numerical results can recover the analytical solutions for all the selected test cases, as long as unit density ratios are considered. For high density and high viscosity ratios, the analytical solution is recovered for all tests, except that of the multilayered Couette’s flow. Numerical results and a discussion are presented for this unsuccessful test case. It is believed that other LB models may have the same problem in addressing the simulation of multiphase flows with variable density ratios.	lattice boltzmann methods	Sébastien Leclaire;Marcelo Reggio;Jean Yves Trépanier	2013	J.

A navigation system with a low-grade inertial measurement unit and an accurate single-antenna Global Positioning System (GPS) measurement system is considered for observability analysis. Uncertainties in attitude, gyro bias, and GPS antenna lever arm were shown to determine unobservable errors in the position, velocity, and accelerometer bias. It was proved that all the errors can be made observable by maneuvering. Acceleration changes improve the estimates of attitude and gyro bias. Changes in angular velocity enhance the lever arm estimate. However, both the motions of translation and constant angular velocity have no influence on the estimation of the lever arm. A covariance simulation with an extended Kalman filter was performed to confirm the observability analysis.	angularjs;extended kalman filter;gyro;global positioning system;observable;simulation;system of measurement;theory;velocity (software development)	Sinpyo Hong;Man Hyung Lee;Ho Hwan Chun;Sun Hong Kwon;Jason L.

For this purpose, in an uncertain 2D environment with simple shape, we propose new sensor-based navigation algorithms Simple(Class1) and Simple(Bug2) based on classic algorithms Class1 and Bug2. Moreover, in order to show a near-optimality of the proposed algorithms, we determine a competitive ratio r/sub 1/=(path length selected by Simple(Class1))/(the shortest path length selected by the model-based path-planning), and also determine a worst ratio r/sub 2/=(path length selected by Class1/(path length selected by Simple(Class1)). Also, we determine a competitive ratio r/sub 1/=(path length selected by Simple(Bug2))/(the shortest path length selected by the model-based path-planning), and also determine a worst ratio r/sub 2/=(path length selected by Bug2)/(path length selected by Simple(Bug2)). Since the competitive ratio r/sub 1/ is bounded by a small finite value, the new algorithms are regarded as near-optimal algorithms. On the other hand, since the worst ratio r/sub 2/ is determined by a large finite valve or infinite, the new algorithms are greatly improved against the classic algorithms.

Soft robotics, which is widely believed to yield new `species' of robots that are more adaptable, more capable, and safer, is such a trend. For all their advantages, the loads these current robot designs can bear and the forces they can produce are still limited. Besides the many examples it provides for the capabilities of soft materials, biology also teaches us that a certain proportion of stiff structures is needed in larger soft robots. In a previous article by the authors, a soft, bioinspired manipulator comprised of hard and soft elements was proposed. The selection and design of a suitable actuation system for this manipulator is the scope of this present article.	experiment;mathematical optimization;robot;soft robotics;tesla coil	Gundula Runge;Sabrina Zellmer;Tobias Preller;Georg Garnweitner;Annika Raatz	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418955	control engineering;simulation;engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.7036260171748	-25.298234867765	5257

A comprehensive analysis is given on how to determine a required set of clothoids and, based on this, how to sample a clothoid in a lookup table in order to achieve required approximation precision. The algorithm is computationally very efficient and therefore suitable for real-time path planning, as well as for other applications that benefit from fast clothoid computation.	algorithm;approximation error;computation;image scaling;interpolation;lookup table;motion planning;real-time clock;real-time path planning;real-time web;role-based collaboration;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;window of opportunity	Misel Brezak;Ivan Petrovic	2014	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2013.2283928	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;theoretical computer science;mathematics;motion planning;computational complexity theory;curve fitting;approximation theory	Robotics	66.29132690433883	-36.036959684020815	5260

7b9bae103172cae5c25aeba96711548bea4c7045	a fast online multivariable identification method for greenhouse environment control problems		Abstract Growing and pruning radial basis function (GAP-RBF) is extended for identification and control of multivariable nonlinear systems in this work. The proposed MGAP-RBF algorithm utilizes a sliding data window in the growing criterion and limits the number of hidden neurons by introducing a soft constraint in the pruning strategy to reduce the effect of disturbance and to improve learning speed, respectively. The performance of the proposed method is tested through some benchmark problems, and the results show that the proposed method can gain faster speed than the original GAP-RBF method and Ran algorithm, and more importantly, it can obtain an overwhelming advantages especially for some large-scale data sets with some complex attributes. Finally, the proposed method is applied to online PID tuning on a greenhouse environment control process. Simulation results show the proposed MGAP-RBF algorithm has better performance than the traditional RBF method and the original GAP-RBF method, in particular, it is faster and provides a more compact network with reduced computational complexity than the original GAP-RBF method.

This progress has resulted in reducing environmental degradation, and yet continuing to support improvements in performance. Regarding gasoline engine, a considerable step forward has been achieved by Common Rail (CR) technology able to exactly regulate the injection pressure during whole engine speed range. As a consequence, the injection of a fixed amount of fuel is more precise and it is possible to perform multiple injections for combustion cycle. In this paper, the authors present a mean value model aimed at the control of a CR system for a Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine. The model is based on the descriptions of electro-valve, including the actuator circuit, and the fuel pressure in the rail. The performances of the proposed model are finally depicted through comparisons with experimental data collected by a CR system mounted on a 2.0 liters spark ignition engine, showing a good accuracy and reliability.	elegant degradation;flexible-fuel vehicle;graphics device interface;performance;ripple effect;simulation;stationary process;switch;test case	Alessandro di Gaeta;Giovanni Fiengo;Angelo Palladino;Veniero Giglio	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400211	engine control unit;chromium;internal combustion engine;engineering;environmental degradation;automotive engineering;mathematical model;mathematics;engine coolant temperature sensor;forensic engineering;waste management;petroleum	EDA	79.40233839662801	-15.250017387789757	5359

This data is used to develop crosstalk models that indicate existing T1.417 Standard NEXT and FEXT models are probably conservative by about 5 dB for 25-pair binder groups. However, many cables start from wire centers as pulp cables of 100-pair binder groups. Even if most of these older pulp cables are 26-AWG, prudence dictates that a more conservative model be used for these cases. On a going forward basis for new and rehab construction, it should be recognized that PIC (air core and filled) cables with not larger than 25-pair binder groups are the predominant cable media supplied by manufacturers for feeder and distribution loops. Results for NEXT in 12-pair binders are also analyzed and show that 26-AWG cable has about 2 dB more NEXT loss than 24-AWG cable and 12-pair binders have about 2 dB more NEXT loss than 25-pair binders. In addition, the NEXT loss separation between adjacent binders of 12 and 13 pairs is found to be not more than 10 dB as compared with the more optimistic 15.5 dB assumed within the industry.	crosstalk;twisted pair	Craig Valenti	2002	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2002.1007372	attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio;cable harness;direct-buried cable;crosstalk;digital subscriber line;category 5 cable;category 4 cable;telecommunications;computer science;twisted pair;shielded cable;fanout cable;cable	Vision	83.49179289542873	-17.433074499963812	5379

This process is becoming a field of increasing importance in the food industry. In most cases, and especially for sugar products, widespread applications of crossflow microfiltration is limited by the low permeate fluxes usually obtained. This limitation is linked to the difficulty to reduce the degree of membrane fouling (settling of particles on the membrane), a phenomenon which is dependent on several variables and difficult to control. In the present work, human expertise of the process is used to set up the fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller is validated through simulations using a neural network model of this process and by real time experimentation on a pilot plant. The results of simulations and pilot tests show that it becomes possible to impose dynamics to the process which permits to maintain the state variable close to a given reference and to limit membrane fouling considerably. An off-line optimization of the fuzzy controller is performed using genetic algorithms. The cost results obtained during a real experiment, after genetic optimization of the fuzzy controller are much better than those obtained previously. Furthermore, the tuning of the controller through optimization is realized under constraints which lead, after optimization, to a heuristic structure completely understandable by microfiltration experts.	optimal control	Nathalie Perrot;L.

First, it is shown that a sort of separation property of quantiser-controller design holds as far as the feedback system stability concerns. This allows us to design feedback controllers independently of the choice of quantisers. Then, based on this property, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the optimally quantised feedback system to be stable, which is described in terms of the poles/zeros of a linear feedback system to be quantised. Finally, we provide a class of suboptimal dynamic quantisers for which the resulting quantised control systems are guaranteed to be stable.	control system;digital monster (virtual pet);feedback;hyperbolic absolute risk aversion;ikeda map;linear system;quantization (signal processing);star catalogue	Shun-ichi Azuma;Toshiharu Sugie	2010	Int.

RBFs are used for surface reconstruction of 3D objects, reconstruction of corrupted images etc. As there is no explicit order in data sets, computations are quite time consuming that leads to limitation of usability even for static data sets. Generally the complexity of computation of RBF interpolation for N points is of O(N3) or O(k N2), k is a number of iterations if iterative methods are used, which is prohibitive for real applications. The inverse matrix can also be computed by the Strassen algorithm based on matrix block notation with O(N2.807) complexity. Even worst situation occurs when interpolation has to be made over non-constant data sets, as the whole set of equations for determining RBFs has to be recomputed. This situation is typical for applications in which some points are becoming invalid and new points are acquired.  In this paper a new technique for incremental RBFs computation with complexity of O(N2) is presented. This technique enables efficient insertion of new points and removal of selected or invalid points. Due to the formulation it is possible to determine an error if one point is removed that leads to a possibility to determine the most important points from the precision of interpolation point of view and insert gradually new points, which will progressively decrease the error of interpolation using RBFs. The Progressive RBF Interpolation enables also fast interpolation on """"sliding window"""" data due to insert/remove operations which will also lead to a faster rendering."""	computation;context of computational complexity;interpolation;iteration;iterative method;point of view (computer hardware company);progressive scan;radial (radio);radial basis function network;strassen algorithm;usability	Václav Skala	2010		10.1145/1811158.1811161	spline interpolation;sliding window protocol;mathematical optimization;radial basis function;bilinear interpolation;surface reconstruction;hierarchical rbf;interpolation;polynomial interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;stairstep interpolation;machine learning;inverse quadratic interpolation;bicubic interpolation;iterative method;linear interpolation;nearest-neighbor interpolation;multivariate interpolation;trilinear interpolation;image scaling	Graphics	63.487279383457064	-43.0535047499273	5502

Next, we propose a DAFISMC to control the large-scale system such that the tracking performance of the overall control system can be achieved. By the strictly-positive-real Lyapunov stability theorem, the stability of the overall system is analyzed.

In the recent past, research on image-based visual servoing has been concentrated on potential problems of stability and on robustness with respect to camera calibration errors. Only little attention, if any, has been devoted to the robustness of image-based visual servoing to depth estimation errors. It is generally believed that a rough approximation of the depth distribution is sufficient to ensure the stability of the control law. In this paper, we prove that the robustness domain is not so wide and that an extreme care must be taken when approximating the depth distribution.	approximation;camera resectioning;optimal control;visual servoing	Ezio Malis;Patrick Rives	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241732	robust control;control engineering;computer vision;von neumann stability analysis;calibration;camera resectioning;computer science;image sensor;control theory;mathematics;visual servoing	Robotics	61.099507245071365	-33.03417943231697	5555
933e02c2efdd53c5322d07f468e8220c2dd046fd	response surface modeling and grey relational analysis to optimize turning parameters with multiple performance characteristics		"""Optimization of process parameters is the key step in response surface methods to achieve high quality without cost inflation. The multi-response optimization of the machining parameters viz, chip-tool interface temperature, main cutting force and feed force on lathe turning of En-31 steel as alloy steel using RSM with grey relational analysis is reported. A grey relational grade obtained from the grey relational analysis is used to solve the turning operations with multiple performance characteristics. The models were developed using response surface methodology. Optimal cutting parameters can be determined by RSM method using the grey relational grade as the performance index. Chip-tool interface temperature, main cutting force, and feed force are important characteristics in turning operations. Using these characteristics, the cutting operations, including cutting velocity, feed rate, depth of cut, and effective tool nose radius, are optimized. A model is developed to correlate the multiple performance characteristic called grey relational grade and turning parameters and a new combination of RSM and grey relational analysis is proposed. The grey relational grades were significantly affected by cutting parameters and tool nose radius. Optimal parameter setting is determined for the multi-performance characteristic.

Therefore, it is valuable to increase tool life, to improve surface accuracy, to reduce main cutting force, feed force and to reduce machining zone temperatures (chip-tool interface temperature) in turning operations through an optimization study. In turning operation the resultant force is divided into three force components, main cutting force, feed force and radial force. All three force components are of interest because apart from the main component that gives the cutting power and its determination is apparently necessary, the radial and feed components control dimensional and form errors in case of workpiece and tool deflection and tool wear. Usually, in metal cutting operation the main cutting force is the largest force as compared to feed force and radial force (Trent, 1991). One of the most important phenomenons occurring during the machining process is that heat generation in the machining zone. Researchers, Shaw (2004) and Komanduri (2001) agree that most of the energy applied to the cutting process is converted into heat in the machining zone of plastic deformation, the shearing plane, where the workpiece material turns itself in to chip and in the secondary zone of plastic deformation, where chip slides on the rake face. Finally, some heat also arises on the tertiary zone, where the tool relief face slides on the newly machined surface. This last source is, however, not considered in most cases, either for simplicity, or because the heat generated is very small when using sharp cutting edges. The heat generated in those machining zones is distributed among the cutting tool, the workpiece, the chip, and after that to the environment. Heat generated at the machining zone (shearing plane) can make the metal cutting action easy, but it can flow into the cutting edge and that will negatively affect the tool life by shortening it. When machining steel with cutting tools different tool wear mechanism occur, such as, abrasion, adhesion, oxidation, and even some diffusion, which act simultaneously and in proportions depending mainly on the cutting temperature. However, some researchers relating wear mechanisms to the cutting speed have been made and some important results have been published. For example the raise in cutting temperature at the machining zone occurs basically due to the cutting speed increase. Author (2010) reported, the cutting speed is main influencing factor on chip-tool interface temperature as compared to others. It has been shown that increasing cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut lead to an increase in cutting temperature. However, increasing the tool nose radius decreases the cutting temperature. Aneiro, Coelho, and Brandao (2008) investigated the influence of cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut) on tool temperature, tool wear, cutting forces and surface roughness when machining hardened steel with multilayer coated carbide tools. A standard K-type of thermocouple inserted near the rake face of the tool was used to measure the interface temperatures. They concluded that the temperature near the rake face increases significantly when the depth of cut changes from 0.2 to 0.4mm. The increase in contact length between chip and rake face could be responsible, since it grows, together with uncut chip cross-section. Similar trend was observed in the cutting forces, tool wear and surface roughness during machining of hardened steel. Findes et al. (2008) studied the influence of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on cutting pressures, cutting force, and on cutting temperature, when machining AISIH11 steel treated at 50 HRC work piece material with mixed ceramic tool. The results show that depth of cut has great influence on the radial cutting pressure and on cutting force. The cutting pressure and cutting force increase with an increase in depth of cut and feed rate. It is found that increase in cutting speed increases cutting zone temperature rapidly. In their study, cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were the primary factors investigated. One of the most important parameters in tool geometry is the tool nose radius. It strengthens the tool point. It also produced better finishes as well as control the chip-tool interface temperatures, because tool marks are not deep as formed by 32 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/response-surface-modeling-greyrelational/66420?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Engineering, Natural, and Physical Science, InfoSci-Operations, Logistics, and Performance Assessment eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Engineering eJournal Collection, InfoSciSelect.

Odometry is the one of many techniques that able to solve it. Nao humanoid robot actually doesn't have an odometry module by itself and odometry sensors that currently available on it and can be used is only IMU module. An odometry sensor that quite interesting in recent times, usually for fusioning together with IMU, easier to mount and not so hard to obtain is a visual sensor camera. In this paper we will show how to implement and place stereo cameras in a Nao robot that has no mounting points for external cameras. By using stereo instead of monocular camera approach, we could obtain odomentry measurement scale in actual size. The software used in this paper is OpenCV that can handle all process regarding from image processing to pose estimation. Stereo visual odometry system that we have designed and implemented on a humaoid robot Nao now can be used to measure simple movement and robot rotation. By extending this research achievement, an odometry system now can be designed and implements on a bigger infrastructure, such as Lumen Robot Friend Platform. This also unlock research availability to do 3D scene reconstuction with a Nao robot and all another researches that based on localization.	humanoid robot;image processing;internationalization and localization;nao (robot);opencv;robot leg;sim lock;sensor;sparse voxel octree;stereo camera;stereo cameras;systems design;visual odometry	Jonathan Chandra;Ary Setijadi Prihatmanto	2016	2016 6th International Conference on System Engineering and Technology (ICSET)	10.1109/ICSEngT.2016.7849619	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;geography;visual odometry;odometry	Robotics	54.7946090606881	-37.821507041988404	5585

In some cases this takes the form of a long term instability, for example in experiments cited here instability became evident only after 2,500 repetitions. Here we develop both time domain and frequency domain approaches to both learning and repetitive control, including use of root locus and Nyquist concepts. And these different viewpoints are used to explain in different ways this phenomenon of apparent initial convergence followed by divergence. It is seen that with typical distributions of tracking errors in the frequency spectrum relative to the bandwidth of the feedback controller, this phenomenon is easily generated. Three classes of approaches are summarized for addressing this problem, either by stopping the mechanism of divergence, or by causing the convergence to continue to zero tracking error.	ambiguous grammar;control theory;experiment;frequency response;instability;iterative method;locus;nl (complexity);spectral density;steady state;system dynamics;vergence	Richard W.

In the rule of Breast Stroke Style, it is allowed to hit one dolphin kick during underwater movement. Until December 2014, we couldn't do dolphin kick before hands start to move. Now, dolphin kick can be performed at any time by the rule amendment. In this research, we modeled this style of movement and searched for optimum timing of dolphin kick. We used computational simulation model called SWUM (SWimming hUman Model). From the simulation results, we got the conclusion that we should do dolphin kick 0.4 seconds faster than hands move. In addition, we indicate the timing affects the body posture. These results agree with the current top swimmer's timing.	computation;dolphin;experiment;fluid animation;poor posture;simulation	Yuki Hayashi;Masanobu Homma;Zhiwei Luo	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418775	simulation;computer science;engineering;computational model	Robotics	68.56042677812165	-28.657429084364374	5635

This method combines the classical calibration algorithm using a planar pattern and the Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) metadata of image files captured by digital cameras. The EXIF metadata records many information about the camera’s setting such as the focal length of zooming lens. So we can use the focal length from EXIF to know the zoom lens setting. Firstly, a pre-calibration should be done to know the relationship between zoom lens settings and the intrinsic camera parameters. We take some sample lens settings from the minimum focal length to the maximum one by changing the lens zooming positions, and perform the mono focal calibration for each lens setting configuration. Then we get the coefficients of the polynomial function through curve fitting. After that we can get the intrinsic parameters correspond with the zoom lens setting of new image files shoot by this digital camera. Our experiments show the proposed method can provide accurate intrinsic camera parameters for all the lens settings continuously.	algorithm;camera resectioning;coefficient;curve fitting;digital camera;exif;experiment;focal (programming language);image file formats;polynomial;zooming user interface	Xiaobing Sun;Jizhou Sun;Jiawan Zhang;Mingchu Li	2004		10.1117/12.526972	computer vision;computer science;optics;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.177986200949334	-49.46067358569537	5650

ad38fd8e695388e7e283c9609ad8ca3e85b501a2	characteristics of the cylinder-induced shock wave and turbulent boundary layer interactions	shock wave;flow field;shear layer;turbulent boundary layer;triple point	The flow field of shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) induced by protuberances is a problem of significant academic and practical importance (Ozcan 1991) and has been studied extensively by many investigators (Voitenko et al. 1966; Westkaemper 1968; Sedney 1973; Sedney and Kitchens 1977; Wang et al. 2012; Hahn and Frendi 2013). Korkegi (1971) reported that such interactions could cause structural damage on the high-speed aircrafts resulting from severe thermal loading. Moreover, some recent work has been focused on using the flow field disturbed by protuberances as control mechanisms for supersonic vehicles (Stephen et al. 2014). Sedney studied the separation ahead of protuberances in supersonic turbulent flow using the optical surface indicator technique at Mach = 2.5; the correlations of the primary separation distance, the diameter and height of the cylinders were discussed in the 1970s (Sedney 1973; Sedney and Kitchens 1977). By concluding the remarkable results of other investigators, Dolling made a short review on supersonic turbulent boundary layer over cylinders and reported that H/D (the ratio of the cylinder height H to diameter D) was not the essential parameter dominating the flow field. Wheaton has done meaningful work on instability induced by the cylinder at Mach 6 in the Purdue quiet tunnel (Wheaton et al. 2011). A quite admirable review on canonical SBLIs has been accomplished by Clemens and the mechanisms of instability were discussed in detail (Clemens and Narayanaswamy 2013). In the present study, the fine structures of SBLIs induced by cylinders with various heights were investigated using the NPLS technique. The height of the triple point ahead of the cylinder was studied statistically for the first time. The experiments were conducted in a 100 mm 9 120 mm supersonic wind tunnel at a nominal Mach number of 3.8. The flow field was studied by mounting cylinders of various heights on the floor of the test section, with a typical boundary layer thickness of d = 15 mm at the mounting position. The runtime of the tunnel is about 4 s, and the material of the wall on which the cylinders are mounted is organic glass, having a very low heat conduction rate. Therefore, in a general way, the flow could be considered as adiabatic, with a free stream Reynolds number of 5.19 9 10/m. In total, four cylinders with the same diameter D = 20 mm were tested and the heights H were 18, 20, 25 and 30 mm, respectively, corresponding to H/D values of 0.9, 1, 1.25 and 1.5. The NPLS technique, which was developed by Zhao et al. (2009) several years ago, is employed to visualize the flow field. It is composed of a double-pulse Nd:YAG laser with a maximum pulse energy of 350 mJ, a 2048 pixel 9 2048 pixel CCD camera, a synchronizer and a nanoparticle generator. The core of NPLS is the nanoparticle generation and distribution, ensuring uniform Rayleigh scattering during the	charge-coupled device;control system;cylinder seal;cylinder-head-sector;dollz;experiment;instability;interaction;pixel;rayleigh–ritz method;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;synchronizer (algorithm);thickness (graph theory);turbulence	Dun-dian Gang;Shihe Yi;Lin He	2016	J.

The approach provides an advantage to improve flexibility of robotic cooperation, in which the desired trajectories in Cartesian space derived from task requirements are converted into the trajectories of robots in joint space for a fixed-coordinated multi-robot system. For this purpose, a parametric cooperative index matrix is introduced to handle the relationship of the input desired Cartesian trajectories and the position of robots. A case study of 2-dimension object-motion trajectory tracking using four robots is presented in the end. It proved that the proposed approach effectively delivers trajectory task requirements to the joint trajectories of robots.	ordered dithering;requirement;robot;simulation	Honghai Liu;David J.

The framework is derived using the Saint-Venant equations for shallow water system. These equations are used to obtain the state space model for Kalman Filter which works as a central estimator. The estimator estimates the sensor readings for the next time cycle based on the readings of the past and neighbor sensors. The estimates from the Kalman filter and the actual observations are then fed to a χ2 detector. The detector computes the difference between the two readings and compares it with a given threshold to detect if the system has been compromised. Our discussion shows that the proposed framework can detect various attacks and faults in the system.	attack model;fault detection and isolation;kalman filter;sensor;state-space representation	Kebina Manandhar;Xiaojun Cao;Fei Hu	2012	2012 35th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium	10.1109/SARNOF.2012.6222737	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;extended kalman filter	Embedded	55.87730830382968	-0.4514861441157053	5777

Using these methods, outdoor (far-field) high accuracy sound source localization in different climates needs highly sensitive and high performance microphones which are very expensive. In the last decade, some papers were published to reduce the microphones count in indoor 2D cases using TDE and ILD-based methods simultaneously. However, using ILD-based methods needs only one dominant source for accurate localization. Also it is known that by using a linear array, two mirror points will be produced simultaneously (half-plane localization). In this paper we try to apply this method to outdoor (low reverberation) cases for a dominant sound source (due to the use of ILD). We propose a novel approach for 3D entire-space localization using TDE, ILD and HRTF simultaneously and only three microphones. Based on the proposed method, a special reflector (instead of dummy head) for microphones arrangement is designed and source counting is used to find that only one dominant sound source is active in the localization area. Simulation results indicate that this approach is useful in outdoor and low degree reverberation cases when source counting and SNR improvement are carried out simultaneously.	charge-coupled device;covox speech thing;dummy variable (statistics);head-related transfer function;internet listing display;microphone;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral method;surround sound;transparent data encryption	Ali Pourmohammad;Seyed Mohammad Ahadi	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021673	three-dimensional space;electronic engineering;speech recognition;engineering;multilateration;head-related transfer function;accuracy and precision;acoustic source localization;correlation	Robotics	86.89180736176282	-35.469640821534426	5784
2afe0bcba7197b1eefc6703bb6d5adebf99799f5	packet loss compensation for control systems over industrial wireless sensor networks		Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) can provide wireless communication for the control system and have therefore received considerable attention. However, network-induced delays or packet losses, among other issues, significantly degrade the performance of IWSNs and can even destabilize an entire system. In this study, a predictive compensator, a modified linear quadratic regulator (LQR) compensator, and a combination of both compensators were proposed to mitigate the effects of unpredictable packet loss in an IWSN. The control system applying the three proposed compensators was simulated under various condition of packet loss using Matlab Simulink and Truetime. An inverted pendulum was used as the object of the controller. Simulation results showed that, among the three compensators, the combined compensator works best in compensating for the packet loss in both forward and backward channels of the control system.	control system	Vu-Anh-Quang Nguyen;Myungsik Yoo	2015	IJDSN	10.1155/2015/256757	real-time computing	Embedded	66.38585258731068	-8.66233123308267	5788

Spray coating is shown to be most effective for additional deposition on non-planar surfaces. PZT films were formed both on flat and uneven surfaces at a thickness of about 1 \im. Perovskite structures were formed with suitable heat treatment and ferroelectric P-E hysteresis loop was also obtained. This paper is the first report from our group and other researchers on the deposition of smart materials for MEMS using a spray coating method. Spray coating has been proposed as an effective three-dimensional coating method which can be used to deposit piezoelectrics, pyroelectrics, magnetics, etc. for sensors and actuators. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties between the substrate surface and ejected liquid are most essential process factors in the spray coating method for improving the film growth conditions.	3d film;as-interface;chemical vapor deposition;conformal coating;hysteresis;microelectromechanical systems;microfabrication;piezoelectricity;thickness (graph theory)	Masaaki Ichiki;Lulu Zhang;Zhen Yang;Tsuyoshi Ikehara;Ryutaro Maeda	2003	International Journal of Computational Engineering Science	10.1142/S1465876303002106	materials science;ceramic materials;spin coating;dip-coating;nanotechnology;spray nozzle;composite material;thin film;physics	Robotics	91.6640567271661	-16.19516840982444	5838
ea8aea7e98027f60ac88634070157a5df2fd3ca5	theoretical analysis and experimental study of subgrade moisture variation and underground antidrainage technique under groundwater fluctuations		Groundwater is amain natural factor impacting the subgrade structure, and it plays a significant role in the stability of the subgrade. In this paper, the analytical solution of the subgrade moisture variations considering groundwater fluctuations is derived based on Richards’ equation. Laboratory subgrade model is built, and three working cases are performed in the model to study the capillary action of groundwater at different water tables. Two types of antidrainage materials are employed in the subgrade model, and their anti-drainage effects are discussed. Moreover, numerical calculation is conducted on the basis of subgrade model, and the calculate results are compared with the experimental measurements.The study results are shown.The agreement between the numerical and the experimental results is good. Capillary action is obviouswhen the groundwater table is rising. As the groundwater table is falling, the moisture decreases in the position of the subgrade near the water table and has no variations in the subgrade where far above the table. The anti-drainage effect of the sand cushion is associated with its thickness and material properties. New waterproofing and drainage material can prevent groundwater entering the subgrade effectively, and its anti-drainage effect is good.		Liu Jie;Hailin Yao;Pan Chen;Zheng Lu;Xingwen Luo	2013	J.

The robust design approach consists of monolithic integration principles to minimize assembly efforts and of an optimization of the functional components with respect to robustness against remaining assembly and manufacturing tolerances. The design approach presented involves the determination of the relevant tolerances arising from the domains manufacturing, assembly, and operation of the micromachine followed by a sensitivity analysis with the objective of identifying the worst offender. Subsequent to the above-described steps, an optimization of the functional design of the freeform optics with respect to a compensation of the effects of the tolerances is performed. The result leads to a robust design of the freeform optics and hence ensures a defined and optimal minimum performance of the micromachine in the presence of tolerances caused by the manufacturing processes and the operation of the micromachine. The micromachine under discussion is the tunable optics of an ophthalmic implant, an artificial accommodation system recently realized as a demonstration model at a scale of 2:1. The artificial accommodation system will be developed to replace the human crystalline lens in the case of a cataract.	actuator device component;british undergraduate degree classification;cataract;freeform surface modelling;functional design;linkage (software);mathematical optimization;microchip implant (human);monolithic kernel;ophthalmic dosage form;optics;simulation;specification;system integration;visual accommodation;genetic linkage;intraocular lens implantation procedure	Ingo Sieber;Thomas Martin;Ulrich Gengenbach	2016		10.3390/mi7050085	control engineering;multidisciplinary design optimization;engineering;engineering drawing;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	87.59098735411268	-23.70860939920974	5881

For the case of non-zero initial angular velocity, a move-to-rest attitude manoeuvre path based on sinusoidal angular acceleration is designed for flexible spacecraft. The angular acceleration of the attitude slew path is smooth and continuous, which can reduce appendages’ vibration exciting by manoeuvre. And a novel attitude control scheme with flexible dynamics is designed which is independent of modal information. The stability of the attitude control system is proved based on Lyapunov theory. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The control algorithm is robust to disturbances, and easy to implement as well.

Earlier investigation of ECG like waveform generation is based on two identical Van-der Pol (VdP) family of oscillators, which are coupled by time delays and gains. In this paper, we suitably modify the three state equations corresponding to the nonlinear cross-product of states, time delay coupling of the two oscillators and low-pass filtering, using the concept of fractional derivatives. Our results show that a wide variety of ECG like waveforms can be simulated from the proposed generalized models, characterizing heart conditions under different physiological conditions. Such generalization of the modelling of ECG waveforms may be useful to understand the physiological process behind ECG signal generation in normal and abnormal heart conditions. Along with the proposed FO models, an optimization based approach is also presented to estimate the VdP oscillator parameters for representing a realistic ECG like signal.	broadcast delay;fusion proteins, gag-pol;generalization (psychology);heart failure;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;oscillator device component;physiological processes;waveform	Saptarshi Das;Koushik Maharatna	2013	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.08.012	fractional calculus;phase space;control theory;mathematics	AI	80.6021452346994	1.023707845809399	5897
5cf0685e76218c278194a4064a8d98c17f34fa4d	a novel hybrid dual-pm machine excited by ac with dc bias for electric vehicle propulsion		This paper proposes a novel hybrid-excited dual-PM machine for electric vehicle propulsion. The key is to use an integrated stator winding to replace the armature winding and the field winding in the conventional hybrid-excited machine. The stator winding is excited by ac current with dc bias, in which the ac component is used to produce the rotating armature field, while the dc bias current is used for the flux regulation. Therefore, the function of the ac and dc windings can be incorporated and realized by using just one set of winding. The torque density and flux regulating capability can be improved, and the winding configuration is also simplified. In addition, dual-PM excitation structure combines the advantage of stator-PM doubly salient machine and rotor-PM magnetic-geared machine, which can further enhance the torque capability. The operating principle and control strategy of the proposed machine are discussed. The electromagnetic performances are studied using the time-stepping finite-element method. A machine prototype is manufactured and experimental tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the machine design.	armature (computer animation);biasing;control theory;finite element method;flux qubit;performance;prototype;r.o.t.o.r.;stepping level	Qingsong Wang;Shuangxia Niu;Xiang Luo	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2682778	control engineering;electronic engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	75.15418306307588	-18.364536023734207	5903

Moreover, modeling uncertainties, mechanical disturbance, and sensor noise coexist with time delay in such systems, which makes the controller synthesis even more challenging. It has been proven effective to model the time delay as fictitious disturbance so that a disturbance observer (DOB) can be employed to cancel the negative effect of time delay. In this brief, a new double DOB (DDOB) design is proposed by adding one more DOB into the control system to handle actual external disturbance and enable satisfactory tracking performance. Design considerations of the baseline controller and the two DOBs are illustrated, and robust stability analysis is provided to handle modeling uncertainties. A real-time wireless communication protocol, RT-WiFi, is integrated with a DC motor to examine the performance of the proposed DDOB by simulations and experiments.	algorithm;assistive technology;baseline (configuration management);broadcast delay;coexist (image);communications protocol;control system;experiment;image noise;low-pass filter;noise shaping;observer (quantum physics);real-time clock;robustness (computer science);sampling (signal processing);simulation	Wenlong Zhang;Masayoshi Tomizuka;Peng Wu;Yi-Hung Wei;Quan Leng;Song Han;Aloysius K.

Exceptionally high discriminating power, high sensitivity towards branching as well as relative position(s) of substituent(s) in cyclic structures and negligible degeneracy offer proposed indices a vast potential for use in characterisation of structures, similarity/dissimilarity studies, lead identification and optimisation, combinatorial library design and quantitative structure-activity/property/toxicity/pharmacokinetic relationship studies so as to facilitate drug design.	adverse reaction to drug;ankle brachial pressure index (observable entity);care-of address;combinatorial chemistry;computer program;degeneracy (graph theory);directed acyclic graph;drug design;drug discovery;fifth generation computer;isomerism;mathematical optimization;name;quantitative structure-activity relationship;quantitative structure–activity relationship;topological index;version	Monika Singh;Harish Jangra;Prasad V Bharatam;A.

Although conventional research focuses on parameter identification, global stability of the identification remains questionable. Therefore, robustness against some parameters is required. This paper describes the design of a robust full-order observer which takes core loss into account, using both the gain-scheduled H/sub /spl infin// control and the linear matrix inequality technique. This design always results in a stable controller. The robustness of the proposed method against variations of resistances is evaluated by experiments.

Interactions among moving objects in the virtual worlds are modeled by dynamic constraints and contact analysis. In order to portray the geometric interaction in a dynamical system or to simulate physical behaviors of entities in the virtual environments, it is essential to perform collision detection at interactive rate with minimal computation possible. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for contact determination and interference detection between geometric models undergoing rigid motion. The set of models includes polyhedra and surfaces described by B-splines. The algorithms make use of temporal and spatial coherence between successive instances to reduce the number of pairwise tests and hierarchical data structures for checking overlaps between a pair of objects. Their running time is a function of the motion between successive instances. The main characteristics of these algorithms are their simplicity and efficiency. They have been implemented. A subset of these implementations, including I-Collide, RAPID and V-Collide are available as part of the collision detection packages at the UNC-CH website.	algorithm;b-spline;coherence (physics);collision detection;computation;contact analysis (cryptanalysis);data structure;dynamical system;entity;hierarchical database model;interaction;interference (communication);polyhedron;rapid;simulation;time complexity;virtual reality;virtual world	Ming C.

Our approach is based on polygonal interpolation from the sampled process followed by resampling and the usual fast Fourier transform. This study emphasizes the merit of the polygonal hold versus the sample-and-hold (zero order) and shows that polygonal interpolation results in better accuracy, especially at high frequencies. For purposes of illustrations the sampled process is assumed to be either a Kolmogorov or a Von Karman process.

0796d47da48e0b2bba7d673c99becde77f3df1a4	dynamic game-based analysis for a hybrid multi-agent robotic system		In this paper, a novel design and analysis of the dynamic game of the Hybrid Multi-Agent Robotic System (HMARS) is proposed for dealing with the formation problem of multiple robots with leaders and followers. Each autonomous agent is a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with switching behaviors including target approach and obstacle avoidance. Under the well designed controller, an agent can perform formation tasks together with other agents in order to accomplish a cooperative mission. The top-down design method deals with not only logical conflicts but also optimal solution of the game at Nash equilibrium point. On the other hand, the bottom-up design method searches for the best performance on the local controller over continuous trajectory. In addition, reachibility is verified at the logical level. The contributions of this paper can be split into three parts: first, Lyapunov style formation control of a HMARS is developed based on reachibility, existence and stability issues under the hybrid approach; second, a dynamical cooperative game for HMARS is proposed and analyzed for the stability with Constrained Logic; third, we offer a framework to implement cooperation of HMARS with the innate characteristics from discrete event space to continuous state space.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;bottom-up proteomics;consensus dynamics;lyapunov fractal;mobile robot;multi-agent system;nash equilibrium;obstacle avoidance;state space;top-down and bottom-up design;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chih-Fu Chang;Jane Yung-jen Hsu;Li-Chen Fu	2007	IJEBM		control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	56.47125925616396	-21.27259346349244	5999

Our technique applies on sub-domains defined by their polyhedrical boundary. It relies on the meshing of interfaces between sub-domains before meshing the domain itself. Since this idea basically trades smoothness, small-size, and regularity of the interfaces for unbalance, we describe a fast, efficient, linear-time evaluation algorithm that correct this default. Its use is experienced with industrial benchmarks, and compared with other heuristic schemes.	horner's method;load balancing (computing)	Jérôme Galtier	1997		10.1007/BFb0002835	simulation;computer science;load balancing;computer aided design;image-based meshing;computer security;algorithm	Robotics	70.78314780372816	-43.075184769586805	6025

0cf0dafb9815bf8d1da8c9d4bd9cb55a71d9a62a	the aqualoc dataset: towards real-time underwater localization from a visual-inertial-pressure acquisition system		Robots localization is a challenging task which is essential for any autonomous robot or remotely operated one. In outdoor, GNSS signals can be used to get a quite accurate estimate of the position. However, in GNSS denied environment, such as indoor or underwater, localization needs to be estimated from other sensors. In aerial and terrestrial robotics, monocular VO (Visual Odometry), VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) and, more recently, VI-SLAM (Visual-Inertial SLAM) have shown great results [1], [2], [3], [4]. Filtered SLAM based on Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) have been set aside to the profit of Bundle Adjustment (BA) based SLAM [5]. These SLAM methods, hugely relying on nonlinear optimization, have been successfully used to estimate localization from lowcost sensors such as cameras and MEMS-IMU (MicroElectro-Mechanical System Inertial Measurement Unit). The availability of many public terrestrial or aerial datasets have helped a lot in the quick development of these methods. For example, KITTI [6], EuRoC [7] and Mono-VI TUM [8] are famous datasets dedicated to the study of VSLAM or VI-SLAM algorithms. In this paper, we focus on vision-based SLAM methods in underwater environments. The use of visual information is challenging underwater as the medium creates many visual degradations such as turbidity, back-scattering and light absorption. These difficulties led most works to turn to sonar based SLAM systems [9], [10]. Nevertheless, some works have also demonstrated the potential of cameras for underwater localization [11], [12]. However, most of these SLAM methods rely on the integration of expensive navigational sensors (Doppler Velocity Logs, Fibber Optic Gyroscopes or high-end IMUs) to provide accurate enough localization information, using only sonars or cameras to bound the drift [13], [14]. We believe that underwater localization from low-cost sensors processed through BA based SLAM could open the way to new localization techniques. However, the lack of underwater datasets is a limitation to the development of such algorithms.

Tissue surface temperature for monopolar electrode configuration is measured using infrared thermometry. The experimental results are fitted to a finite-element model for transient heat transfer taking into account energy storage and conduction in order to extract information about “apparent” specific heat, which encompasses storage and phase change. The average apparent specific heat determined for low temperatures is in agreement with published data. However, at temperatures approaching the boiling point of water, apparent specific heat increases by a factor of five, indicating that vaporization plays an important role in the energy dissipation through latent heat loss.	cold temperature;diathermy;electrosurgery;excitation;fatty liver;heat loss;laser ablation;liver parenchyma;scientific publication;seizures;thermometry;video-in video-out;phase change;radiofrequency	Wafaa Karaki;Ali Cagdas Akyildiz;Suvranu De;Diana-Andra Borca-Tasciuc	2017	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2016.2595525	temperature;temperature measurement;electrode;mathematical model;biological engineering;physics;quantum mechanics;surgery	Visualization	92.35935552197078	-22.8302598429092	6085

Consequently, the transparency of these closed-loop systems is difficult to study. In comparison, inverse dynamics controllers can deal with the nonlinear terms in the dynamics in a way that, in the ideal case, the closed-loop systems become linear and decoupled. In this paper, for multi-DOF nonlinear teleoperation systems with uncertainties, adaptive inverse dynamics controllers are incorporated into the 4-channel bilateral teleoperation control framework. The resulting controllers do not need exact knowledge of the dynamics of the master, the slave, the human operator, or the environment. A Lyapunov analysis is presented to prove the transparency of the teleoperation system. Simulations are also presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	adaptive filter;bandwidth (signal processing);bilateral filter;computer simulation;converge;differentiator;inverse dynamics;lyapunov fractal;master/slave (technology);nonlinear system;robot	Xia Liu;Mahdi Tavakoli	2011	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/016918611X584668	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;transparency;inverse dynamics;mechanical engineering	Robotics	65.37841864004452	-11.175984105713715	6089

Based on the fact, a novel Bayesian compressed sensing algorithm for wideband spectrum sensing is proposed. In our proposed framework, firstly, the original signal should be sampled with sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Secondly, the clustering of the spectrum molded by many block structures is also utilized to increase the accuracy of spectrum sensing.

However, the experimental data sometimes deviate significantly from this simple model, especially for severe breakdown events. At low voltages the current typically follows a diode-like behaviour, whereas at the largest biases the current is dominated by a series resistance effect. In the case of the non-linear post-breakdown conduction mode this resistance is not constant. In this work, an analytical expression for the non-linear 1-V characteristic using the generalized diode equation in conjunction with the transmission properties of nano-sized constrictions is proposed.	diode;nonlinear system	Enrique Miranda	2008	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2008.06.007	electronic engineering;systems modeling;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;gate oxide;equivalent series resistance;low voltage;diode	EDA	91.29322215138548	-9.685167596926036	6108

An image and its depth map of a target are obtained using a Phab 2 mobile device. The image is processed to extract line segments of the target. Next a rectangular planar region of the target is selected, which is then refined using the depth data. The chosen region is then compared with the CAD model, and a planar face in the CAD model that matches the selected region is obtained using various geometric properties. Using the matching planar faces, a pose of the camera is computed, which is then used for augmenting the CAD model onto the image correctly. The test results demonstrate that the method can be used for real fabrication in a complex environment.	3d modeling;ar (unix);computer-aided design;depth map;mobile device	Daewoon Kim;Sung-In Choi;Jung Seo Park;Kwang Hee Ko	2018		10.1145/3281505.3281601	computer vision;artificial intelligence;cad;line segment;fabrication;mobile device;computer science;depth map;planar	Robotics	55.25755087132566	-47.85834748914462	6114

The PDDG/PM3 results for heats of formation also show substantial improvement over density functional theory with large basis sets. The PDDG modifications consist of a single function, which is added to the existing pairwise core repulsion functions within PM3 and MNDO, a reparameterized semiempirical parameter set, and modified computation of the energy of formation of a gaseous atom. The PDDG addition introduces functional group information via pairwise atomic interactions using only atom-based parameters. For 622 diverse molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms, mean absolute errors in calculated heats of formation are reduced from 4.4 to 3.2 kcal/mol and from 8.4 to 5.2 kcal/mol using the PDDG modified versions of PM3 and MNDO over the standard versions, respectively. Several specific problems are overcome, including the relative stability of hydrocarbon isomers, and energetics of small rings and molecules containing multiple heteroatoms. The internal consistency of PDDG energies is also significantly improved, enabling more reliable analysis of isomerization energies and trends across series of molecules; PDDG isomerization energies show significant improvement over B3LYP/6-31G* results. Comparison of heats of formation, ionization potentials, dipole moments, isomer, and conformer energetics, intermolecular interaction energies, activation energies, and molecular geometries from the PDDG techniques is made to experimental data and values from other semiempirical and ab initio methods.	ab initio quantum chemistry methods;amines;atom;austin model 1;basis set (chemistry);cellular material:mcnt:pt:calculus:qn:estimated;computation (action);computational chemistry;conditional random field;duoxa1 gene;density functional theory;domino tiling;energy, physics;functional theories of grammar;halogens;heat (physical force);hydrocarbons;hydrogen;interaction;internal consistency;isomerism;kidney failure, chronic;lookup table;mndo;mandibular right second molar tooth;maple syrup urine disease;nddo;nomo2 gene;normal statistical distribution;pm3 (chemistry);phosphorus;population parameter;ring device;semantics (computer science);semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;silicon;small;time complexity;version;kilocalorie;newton	Matthew P.

Traditional hand-drawn animation often constructs a more flexible and impressive depiction than that of computer graphics. Among deformations in handmade drawing, anime has traditionally used deformed depictions that are used to exaggerate the effect of perspective in order to exaggerate the posture of a figure into stylish and dramatic distortions. However, in terms of 3D geometry, the depiction may contain a few contradictions between each part of the body and the background.	computer graphics;distortion;poor posture;stylish	Kei Utsugi;Takeshi Naemura;Takafumi Koike;Michio Oikawa	2011		10.1145/2037826.2037864	computer vision;computer science;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	64.05951075437768	-47.397594588977405	6133

This form arises in many areas of science and engineering, and especially in astronomy, where one has photon counting detectors. The method presented consists of three procedures. First, estimating the density using the kernel method; second, highpass filtering the manifestly positive density; finally, obtaining the time-frequency distribution with a modified Welch’s method. For the sake of validation, event-based data are generated from a given distribution and the proposed method is used to construct the time-frequency spectrum and is compared to the original density. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.	care-of address;genetic algorithm;kernel method;noise (electronics);noise reduction;sensor;spectral density estimation;time–frequency representation;welch's method	Lorenzo Galleani;Leon Cohen;Douglas J.

When the delay is small such that the first-order Taylor approximation holds, the delayed mixture is transformed as the mixture of the original sources and their derivatives. Two algorithms are proposed for the rotation step that recovers the extended source vector (original sources and the corresponding derivatives). The first approach is based on the odd symmetry of the derivative of the autocorrelation function; and the second method identifies the locations of single auto terms in the optimized time-scale plane. A simulation analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results showed that the proposed methods substantially improved the performance of SOBI and its extension in the time-scale plane when the sources presented delays in the mixtures. In addition, the proposed algorithms were applied representatively to experimental multichannel surface electromyographic signals to identify motor unit action potential trains from the interference signal. The performance of the proposed methods was superior to previous methods also in this representative application. In conclusion, extensions of the SOBI approach of source separation have been proposed for the case of sources being delayed in the mixtures. These techniques were proven superior to previous approaches.	action potential;algorithm;approximation;autocorrelation;blind signal separation;electromyography;first-order predicate;interference (communication);motor unit;simulation;source separation;visually impaired persons;mixture	Ning Jiang;Dario Farina	2011	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2010.2084999	computer simulation;algorithm design;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	Vision	88.70363855851762	-42.22347157197437	6152

Thirdly, an intersection formula in homogeneous coordinates is verified which makes it possible to do consistent homogenous coordinate processing from the very beginning of geometric modelling to the very last of the objects displayed. Lastly an outline of how the 4×4 determinant method is applied to basic geometric problems is described.

We consider the Klein–Gordon equation for a toy graviton field coupled to a static matter current in a spherically-symmetric setup. The classical field reproduces the Newtonian potential generated by the matter source, while the corresponding quantum state is given by a coherent superposition of scalar modes with a continuous occupation number. An attractive self-interaction is needed for bound states to form, the case in which one finds that (approximately) one mode is allowed, and the system of N bosons can be self-confined in a volume of the size of the Schwarzschild radius. The horizon wave function formalism is then used to show that the radius of such a system corresponds to a proper horizon. The uncertainty in the size of the horizon is related to the typical energy of Hawking modes: it decreases with the increasing of the black hole mass (larger number of gravitons), resulting in agreement with the semiclassical calculations and which does not hold for a single very massive particle. The spectrum of these systems has two components: a discrete ground state of energy m (the bosons forming the black hole) and a continuous spectrum with energy ω > m (representing the Hawking radiation and modeled with a Planckian distribution at the expected Hawking temperature). Assuming the main effect of the internal scatterings is the Hawking radiation, the N -particle state can be collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a superposition of a total ground state with energy M = Nm and Entropy 2015, 17 6894 a Planckian distribution for E > M at the same Hawking temperature. This can be used to compute the partition function and to find the usual area law for the entropy, with a logarithmic correction related to the Hawking component. The backreaction of modes with ω > m is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux. The above corrections suggest that for black holes in this quantum state, the evaporation properly stops for a vanishing mass.	battery eliminator circuit;black hole;bound state;coherence (physics);epr paradox;evaporation;fock state;ground state;partition function (mathematics);quantum state;quantum superposition;semantics (computer science);semiclassical physics	Roberto Casadio;Andrea Giugno;Octavian Micu;Alessio Orlandi	2015	Entropy	10.3390/e17106893	classical mechanics;micro black hole;black hole information paradox;thermal;graviton;entropy;black hole;black hole thermodynamics;coherence;bound state;schwarzschild radius;hawking radiation;sonic black hole;semiclassical physics;fuzzball;evaporation;partition function;event horizon;black star;physics;white hole;quantum mechanics;wave function	ML	89.54960478310402	0.5615711378268493	6197

The classical music of the west is based on the twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET) interval (tuning) system which became dominant throughout the world. Today, other interval systems are being re-discovered by the west with the advances in information technologies. Many multi-media applications use digital signal processing to; process, synthesize, recognize, classify and share music. The important classification features such as; interval system, mode and maqams provide solutions for the discrepancy of music; east-west; Turkish-Arab-Chinese-Indian; blues-jazz-clasical. In this paper, the theoretical problem of constructing an interval system independent from the harmonics `the fifths', today known as the N-limit tonality diamond (matrix), is examined. It was first proposed by Ibni Sina's teacher Al-Jurjani approximately 1,000 years ago and solved for N = 5. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the problem was solved for N = 9 and 13. The missing solutions for N = 3 and 7 and misleading N = 15 solutions make the analysis of such music even harder. In this paper, N-limit tonality diamond problem is solved for increasing N as an application in digital signal processing. These rare and distict intervals are proposed as features for easier identification and classifications.	digital signal processing;discrepancy function;multiple inheritance	Suleyman Gokhun Tanyer	2014	2014 22nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2014.6830217	speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;multiple signal classification;digital signal processing;machine learning;harmonic analysis;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	HPC	85.97933665091321	-32.19563515242451	6198

a9fd2dc0c97d3e0b26f9a5fde5603fe64eda69e6	a reliable range-free indoor localization method for mobile robots		This paper presents an indoor localization method for the mobile robots using the radio signal values and the geometry path on the map. It is divided into three parts, the building the maps, the estimating the position of the robots, and the experiment. First, as the map generation, we build two kinds of the maps which are a radio-based map and a topological map. The radio-based map consists of the radio signals of the Wi-Fi access points at the certain locations. The geometry path map is composed of the topological data that the mobile robots can make as the motion trajectories. Second, as the localization process, we use the fingerprint estimation and the multi-hypothesis tracking (MHT) method. The fingerprint estimation can find the absolute area where the robot is placed by matching the radio-based map and the online observations of the Wi-Fi signals. The MHT method can obtain the optimal position in the topological map by considering the dead-reckoning motion. Finally, when it comes to the experiment, we performed the proposed localization method with a real mobile robot in an office environment to verify its effectiveness and performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate the accurate position of the robots even though they do not use the expensive range sensors such as the laser range finder.	dead reckoning;effective method;experiment;fingerprint recognition;gyroscope;location-based service;mhtml;map;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;numerical analysis;radio wave;sensor;smartphone;wireless access point	Yu-Cheol Lee	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2015.7294166	computer vision;simulation;geography;cartography	Robotics	55.045386771596775	-34.41384656051495	6301

So the parameter design of its' regulators can be made according to the traditional DC regulator design method. However, the PMSM and its' driving converter have the characteristics of strong non-linear, which result to the differences between the designed parameters and the real values. Based on the closed loop control of speed and current, the simulation model of the surface-mounted PMSM (SPMSM) vector control system with the Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) method was proposed and realized in the paper, which highly simulated the real system. The principles of regulated PI were given, which had been proved by the experimental platform based on DSP2812. The experimental results are in accordance with the simulation results, which prove that the method can effectively improve the performance of the system.	control system	Kaiqi Zhao	2011		10.1109/IAS.2011.6074314	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	70.82620474307554	-13.265169524120484	6308

Generating invisible signals that are capable to maintain the control inputs proximal to the saturation limits, the attacks are naturally discovered due to constraint violation. Two different design schemes are proposed: the first one is a direct allocation method based on a simple linear programming algorithm, while the second one is a dynamic optimization problem with a barrier function.

However, speech compression degrades speech quality, and hence causes a reduction in recognition performance. It has been shown that the classic technique for extraction of line spectral frequency (LSF) parameters in speech coders is prone to aliasing distortion. The use of a low-pass filtering on upsampled LSF vectors has been shown to alleviate this problem, therefore improving speech quality. In this paper, the effect of this non-aliased LSF (NA-LSF) extraction method on speaker recognition performance is observed using GSM-EFR coded speech. When the NA-LSFs are used in the coder the verification performance loss introduced by the GSM-EFR is reduced, producing similar performance to uncoded speech	aliasing;distortion;enhanced full rate;lsf;low-pass filter;mobile phone;speaker recognition;speech coding;time-compressed speech;transaction authentication;upsampling	Halil Uzuner;Stephane Villette;Khaldoon Al-Naimi;Ahmet M.

Miniature factory is inspired by the downsizing trend of the production tools. The system is constructed based on primary functional and performance requirements such as miniature size, operation with sub-millimeter precision, modular and reconfigurable structure, parallel processing capability, ease of transportation and integration. Proposed miniature factory consists of several functional modules such as two parallel kinematic robots for manipulation and assembly, galvanometric laser beam scanning system for micromachining, camera system for inspection, and a rotational conveyor system for sample part delivery. The overall mechanical structure of the proposed microfactory facilitates modularity and reconfigurability, parallel processing, flexible rearrangement of the layout, and ease of assembly and disassembly of the whole structure. Experiments involve various tasks within a single process such as pick-place of the 3 mm diameter metallic ball, marking a 2D sub-millimeter image on the ball surface with high power laser, and inspection along with verification of the image by means of microscopic camera. Results have shown the possibility of implementation of the desktop microfactory concept for machining and assembly of tiny mechanical parts with microprecision.	computer performance;desktop computer;disassembler;experiment;item unique identification;parallel computing;reconfigurability;requirement;robot	Zhenishbek Zhakypov;Tarik Uzunovic;Ahmet Ozcan Nergiz;Eray A.

Besides the Nwat parameter, the effect of the force field, the molecular dynamics simulation length, and the implicit solvent model used in the MMGBSA analysis have been also evaluated. We found that considering 30 interfacial water molecules improved the correlation between predicted and experimental binding energies by up to 30%, compared to the standard approach. Moreover, the correlation resulted in being rather sensitive to the force field and, to a minor extent, to the implicit solvent model and to the length of the MD simulation.	angina pectoris, variant;computation (action);energy, physics;force field (chemistry);implicit solvation;molecular dynamics;population parameter;simulation;solvent models	Irene Maffucci;Alessandro Contini	2016	Journal of chemical information and modeling	10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00196	atomic physics;chemistry;computational chemistry	Comp.	97.21481114618852	-4.5422173675039135	6390

This article presents a comprehensive feature-based method for tolerance analysis of mechanical assemblies with both dimensional and geometric tolerances. In this method, dimensional and geometric tolerance zones are described by the combination of fuzzy modelling and small degrees of freedom SDOF concept. In this model, the uncertainty in dimensions and geometric form of features is mathematically described using fuzzy modelling, and the kinematic effects of tolerances in assemblies are expressed by SDOF concept. In the proposed method, complicated GD&T concepts such as various material modifiers maximum material condition, least material condition and regardless of feature size, envelope requirement, bonus tolerances and Rule No. 1 Taylor principle in several conditions are accurately modelled. Compatible with the proposed model, a procedure for modified worst case and statistical tolerance accumulation analysis is introduced. An algorithm is laid out that describes the steps and the procedure of tolerance analysis. The application of this method is demonstrated through an example, and the results are compared with experimental results.	best, worst and average case;statistical model	S. Khodaygan;M. R.

Then fill analysis for the two plans were carried out. The dual-gates plan was selected as an optimal choice for its smaller clamping force, wall shear stress and injection pressure in comparison with the single-gate plan. Although weld lines and air trap exists between the two gates, but they can be eliminated or just have a little effect on the quality of parts. It indicated that the technology of mold flow analysis can be used to optimize the design of gate location and gates number and assist the engineers to improve the quality of their designs of mould.	data-flow analysis;router (computing)	Tangqing Kuang;Wenjuan Gu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-18369-0_65	engineering;operations management;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	EDA	85.27378270287502	-15.80902660867517	6406

Based on experimental measurements that relate plantar forces with gait phase, the design of a gait-based LEE is divided into BW-supporting and free-swinging and realized by means of built-in compliant mechanisms in its exoskeleton-knees. Design considerations to accommodate human knee geometry and adapt walking gaits are highlighted. The snap-fit mechanisms for human gait-based operations are illustrated and analyzed numerically. The effects of several different exoskeleton-knee designs on reducing plantar force are experimentally compared validating the effectiveness and light-weight advantages of LEE in reducing plantar force in walking.

The proposed technique reduces observer-controller gains from classical output feedback SMC approach via reducing the level of parametric uncertainty. To this end, we distribute uniformly the compact set of unknown parameters into a finite number of smaller compact subsets. Then we construct a family of distributed candidate SMC for these smaller compact subsets. The Lyapunov-like energy function is employed to identify an appropriate candidate SMC that closely estimates the plant at each instant of time. The key idea of the proposed design is to allow classical SMC to be switched into a distributed candidate SMC that best approximates the plant among a finite set of the distributed candidate SMC. The method is evaluated on a 2-DOF robot manipulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical development.	block cipher mode of operation;control system;control theory;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;robot;thyristor	Shafiqul Islam;Peter Xiaoping Liu	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/COASE.2010.5584589	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.36390080815362	-4.16217015027849	6423

Various low-cost sensor-based and vision-based systems are developed for capturing the hip and knee joint angles. However, the performances of these systems have not been validated and compared between each other. The purpose of this study is to set up an experiment and compare the performances of a sensor-based system with multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs), a vision-based gait analysis system with marker detection, and a markerless vision-based system on capturing the hip and knee joint angles during normal walking. The obtained measurements were validated with the data acquired from goniometers as ground truth measurement. The results indicate that the IMUs-based sensor system gives excellent performance with small errors, while vision systems produce acceptable results with slightly larger errors.	gait analysis;ground truth;performance;sensor	Maria Kyrarini;Xingchen Wang;Axel Gräser	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications (MeMeA) Proceedings	10.1109/MeMeA.2015.7145231	computer vision;simulation;engineering;surgery	Robotics	58.258198274950914	-37.874689890085676	6429

We solve the order selection problem by incremental growing of a DCS network until the controller meets a pre-specified precision. Calculation of the controller output is very fast and suitable for realtime control since the resulting network is as small as possible and only the best matching unit and its topological neighbors are activated on presentation of an input stimulus. Training of the DCS is based on error feedback learning and proceeds in two phases. In the first phase we use a crude model of the cameras and the kinematics of the head to learn the topology of the input submanifold and a rough approximation off-line. In a second phase, the operating phase, we employ error feedback learning for online adaptation of the linear output units. Besides our TRC binocular head we use a Datacube image processing system and a Stäubli R90 robot arm for automated training in the second phase. The controller is demonstrated to successfully correct errors in the model and to rapidly adapt to changing parameters.	approximation;binocular vision;cell (microprocessor);data cube;image processing;online and offline;real-time computing;robotic arm;selection algorithm	Jörg Bruske;Michael Hansen;Lars Riehn;Gerald Sommer	1996		10.1007/3-540-61510-5_39	computer vision;simulation;robotic arm;image processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;degrees of freedom	Robotics	62.616623133148416	-26.82247277867875	6449

Both the single support phase (SSP) and the double support phase (DSP) are considered. The gait of the biped can be determined when the trajectories of the hip and the swing limb are designed. The trajectories of the hip and the swing limb are approximated with the time polynomial functions. The coefficients of the functions are determined by the constraint equations cast in terms of coherent physical characteristics, such as repeatability, continuity, stability, and minimization of the effect of impact. The fuzzy wavelet neural network controller is trained by error back-propagation algorithm. Given the certain gait parameters such as the step length, maximum step height, walking speed, and so on, the control scheme can generate the smooth gait profiles. The simulation results show that the designed controller can follow the reference trajectories well.	robot	Pengfei Liu;Jiuqiang Han;Jianmei Ma;Donglin Wang	2007	IJWMIP	10.1142/S0219691307001719	effect of gait parameters on energetic cost;simulation;control theory	Robotics	68.52583350403528	-17.244816727589416	6495

EC-RISM is based on self-consistent calculations of a solute's electronic structure and the distribution function of surrounding water. Following-up on the workflow developed after the SAMPL5 challenge on cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients we extended and improved the methodology by taking into account exact electrostatic solute-solvent interactions taken from the wave function in solution. As before, the model is calibrated against Gibbs energies of hydration from the """"Minnesota Solvation Database"""" and a public dataset of acidity constants of organic acids and bases by adjusting in total 4 parameters, among which only 3 are relevant for predicting pKa values. While the best-performing training model yields a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1 pK unit, the corresponding test set prediction on the full SAMPL6 dataset of macroscopic pKa values using the same level of theory exhibits slightly larger error (1.7 pK units) than the best test set model submitted (1.7 pK units for corresponding training set vs. test set performance of 1.6). Post-submission analysis revealed a number of physical optimization options regarding the numerical treatment of electrostatic interactions and conformational sampling. While the experimental test set data revealed after submission was not used for reparametrizing the methodology, the best physically optimized models consequentially result in RMSEs of 1.5 if only improved electrostatic interactions are considered and of 1.1 if, in addition, conformational sampling accounts for quantum-chemically derived rankings. We conclude that these numbers are probably near the ultimate accuracy achievable with the simple 3-parameter model using a single or the two best-ranking conformations per tautomer or microstate. Finally, relations of the present macrostate approach to microstate pKa results are discussed and some illustrative results for microstate populations are presented."""

de79441986f363dca0124f2acb8cbaf483528aa3	feedback control for cassie with deep reinforcement learning		Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.		Zhaoming Xie;Glen Berseth;Patrick Clary;Jonathan W.

By using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to compensate for system uncertainties, a novel switching controller is developed by combining direct adaptive control approach and backstepping technique, which consists of a conventional adaptive neural controller dominating in the neural active region and an extra robust controller to pull back the transient outside the neural active region. The key features of the proposed algorithm are given as follows. First, a novel nth-order smoothly switching function is presented, and then an energy-efficient controller is obtained. Second, only a neural network (NN) is employed to compensate for all the unknown parts in each backstepping design procedure to reduce the number of adaptive parameters, so that a more simplified controller is proposed. Third, by exploiting a special property of the affine term, the developed strategy avoids the controller singularity problem completely without using projection algorithm. As a result of the above features, the developed control algorithm is convenient to implement in applications. Finally, the overall controller ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) and the output of the system converges to a small neighborhood of the reference trajectory by properly choosing the design parameters. Three simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	nonlinear system	Jian Wu;Weisheng V Chen;Dong Zhao;Jing Li	2013	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2013.05.042	mathematical optimization;controller;adaptive control;control theory	Robotics	65.62756166906811	-6.092073316093096	6611

The trajectory of the COM of the robot is mainly planned by the dynamic equation of the virtual leg of the robot.

be57a83fecfb58a3413cd49ad67747dd47084b80	sparse optimal control of lti systems under sparsity-dependent delays		We address the problem of sparse $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ control design for linear time invariant (LTI) systems in the presence of feedback delays. Depending on the network configuration, the delays may be constant, or an explicit function of the sparsity itself. We first state a sufficient condition for delay stability, and show that it appears as a non-convex bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraint for the $\mathcal{H}_{2}$-minimization problem. We relax this BMI as a set of convex semidefinite programs that result in a two loop optimization algorithm. The inner-loop promotes sparsity of the state feedback matrix constrained by the set of stabilizing gains for the delayed system. The outer-loop aligns the direction of sparsity with the minimizing $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ norm direction. We solve this two loop optimization using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding sparse feedback matrices that achieve a low $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ norm while guaranteeing stability of the closed-loop delayed system.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;bilinear filtering;brain–computer interface;converge;iterative method;linear time-invariant theory;loop optimization;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;optimal control;semidefinite programming;simulation;social inequality;sparse matrix;time complexity;time-invariant system	Nandini Negi;Aranya Chakrabortty	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431138	inequality;control theory;loop optimization;lti system theory;implicit function;sparse matrix;computer science;linear system;matrix (mathematics);optimal control	Robotics	63.14125300954997	0.46968968295137364	6705

Ray tracing algorithms employing interval arithmetic (IA) or affine arithmetic (AA) for root-finding are robust and general in the class of surfaces they support, but traditionally slow. Nonetheless, implemented efficiently using a stack-driven iterative algorithm and SIMD vector instructions, these methods can achieve interactive performance for common algebraic surfaces on the CPU. A similar algorithm can also be implemented stacklessly, allowing for efficient ray tracing on the GPU. This paper presents these algorithms, as well as an inclusion-preserving reduced affine arithmetic (RAA) for faster ray-surface intersection. Shader metaprogramming allows for immediate and automatic generation of symbolic expressions and their interval or affine extensions. Moreover, we are able to render even complex forms robustly, in real-time at high resolution.	affine arithmetic;central processing unit;correctness (computer science);graphics processing unit;image resolution;interval arithmetic;iterative method;metaprogramming;ray tracing (graphics);real-time clock;root-finding algorithm;s-expression;simd;shader	Aaron Knoll;Younis Hijazi;Andrew E.

Given the time lags, the time-delayed second-order correlation matrices are first diagonalized simultaneously. Then, a genetic algorithm is used to update the time lags.

This raises the question: how do generality and simplicity trade off in the design of robot hands? This paper explores the tension between simplicity in hand design and generality in hand function. It raises arguments both for and against simple hands, it considers several familiar examples, and it proposes an approach for autonomous manipulation using a general-purpose but simple hand. We explore the approach in the context of a bin-picking task, focused on grasping, recognition, and localization. The central idea is to use learned knowledge of stable grasp poses as a cue for object recognition and localization. This leads to some novel design criteria, such as minimizing the number of stable grasp poses. Finally, we describe experiments with two prototype hands to perform bin-picking of highlighter markers.	autonomous robot;experiment;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose modeling;internationalization and localization;outline of object recognition;prototype	Matthew T.

cce917ede6cb659ddc03808693a5be8f26636111	the icvsie: a general purpose integral equation method for bio-electromagnetic analysis		Objective: An internally combined volume surface integral equation (ICVSIE) for analyzing electromagnetic (EM) interactions with biological tissue and wide ranging diagnostic, therapeutic, and research applications, is proposed. Method: The ICVSIE is a system of integral equations in terms of volume and surface equivalent currents in biological tissue subject to fields produced by externally or internally positioned devices. The system is created by using equivalence principles and solved numerically; the resulting current values are used to evaluate scattered and total electric fields, specific absorption rates, and related quantities.  Results: The validity, applicability, and efficiency of the ICVSIE are demonstrated by EM analysis of transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic resonance imaging, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation.  Conclusion: Unlike previous integral equations, the ICVSIE is stable regardless of the electric permittivities of the tissue or frequency of operation, providing an application-agnostic computational framework for EM-biomedical analysis. Significance: Use of the general purpose and robust ICVSIE permits streamlining the development, deployment, and safety analysis of EM-biomedical technologies.	biomedical technology;deploy;electric stimulation technique;electromagnetics;functional electrical stimulation;interaction;license;neuromuscular diseases;numerical analysis;quantity;resonance;transcranial magnetic stimulation;turing completeness;electric field	Luis J.

To ensure stability, motion of a biped needs to follow specific pattern to comply with certain stability criterion such as zero moment point. Actuator torques limitation is also a serious restriction on motion path. Indeed, the velocity of the robot during each step is bounded with robot's physical limitations. The motion path of the robot is designed considering environmental conditions and robot's tasks. Therefore, online trajectory planning is one of the most important problems in this field. In this paper a neural network based algorithm for stable path generation is introduced which can be used online to generate path for a biped carrying different payloads. The neural network is trained based on optimum paths generated by a genetic algorithm for different values of payload mass, while considering actuator limits as optimization constraints.	artificial neural network;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;motion planning;robot;velocity (software development);zero moment point	Saeed Mansouri;Mohammad Jafar Sadigh;Tara Farizeh	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181265	control engineering;motion control;payload;simulation;genetic algorithm;stability;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;trajectory;control theory;motion planning;artificial neural network;zero moment point	Robotics	64.52318525794381	-22.81825441897092	6746

f11afef60488f7a214834b40ccaaeed839481fb2	piecewise affine hybrid automata representation of a multistage fuzzy pid controller		As cyber physical systems become more complex, modeling for the purposes of verification and validation (V&V) becomes a primary barrier. Additionally, this complexity drives an increased disconnect between the system implementation and the original human generated requirements. Therefore, a key challenge is to model cyber physical systems at the appropriate level of abstraction required for V&V while maintaining a clear and understandable linkage between the human designer and the system under design. Fuzzy logic is a method to synthesize linguistic, natural language requirements into real world models. It has also been shown that fuzzy logic is a suitable method to learn the behavior of a nonlinear system when a model is not present. A fuzzy logic controller is a special class of hybrid system and provides a mechanism to relate a system model to human specified requirements. Leveraging the wealth of verification techniques for hybrid systems, the goal of this paper is to provide a mechanism capable of modeling and analyzing the safety and stability of learning and adaptive systems while maintaining a direct relationship to the original system requirements. This paper focuses on the model synthesis of a multistage PID fuzzy controller designed for a second-order plant, converting it from linguistic rule based requirements into a piecewise affine hybrid system and simulated using Matlab.	hybrid automaton;multistage amplifier;pid	Matthew A.

This work investigates and proposes solutions to the problem of controlling an anthropomorphic robot arm for personal assistance, by dealing with the peculiarities of its design, i.e. the mechanics of its cable-actuated, intrinsically compliant structure, and by emphasizing its potential in applications of physical and functional interaction with the environment and with human users. To satisfy the requirements of increasing the safety in the interaction and the robot functionality in tasks performed in cooperation with humans, three solutions are developed and tested for the considered personal robot. The initial idea is aimed at developing an efficient as well as computational convenient interaction control strategy, i.e. a compliance control scheme in the Cartesian space. The analysis of its limited performance suggests two further control strategies, i.e. a compliance control scheme in the joint space and an impedance–compliance control scheme. Their compared analysis points out that all the three solutions can safely operate in the human environment, but from a functional point of view only the last two schemes can effectively control the personal robot arm in its whole workspace. The paper describes the mechanics of the considered robot arm, with special regard to its anthropomorphism and cableactuation and presents in details the three control schemes. They are critically evaluated through the experimental results achieved in tasks of physical and functional interaction with the environment and with human users. The impedance–compliance controller emerges as the more appropriate to the addressed application as well as to the peculiar cable-actuated structure. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

To stabilize the NCS, we propose a new predictive control design scheme with plant outputs as the only available data. With uniformly globally exponentially stable (UGES) protocols, input-to-state stability of the entire NCS is ensured by small gain theory. In particular, the predictive controller can compensate transmission delays with any finite upper bound under the constraint that the sampling periods of the plant output and the observer output are small enough as well as the constraint that the predictor is accurate enough. The scheme is applied to a benchmark example to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.	control system;nonlinear system	Ximing Sun;Kun-Zhi Liu;Changyun Wen;Wei David Wang	2016	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2015.11.001	control engineering;real-time computing;networked control system;engineering;control theory;model predictive control	Networks	65.95198503801421	1.280515762891429	6808

However, the hybrid simulator is generally subjected to an inherent problem of energy increase in collision of two hardwares in the loop because of delay times. To solve this problem, Osaki et al. proposed a compensation method of delay time that can realize a variable coefficient of restitution [1]. However, the above method has a drawback that a model error of the system degrades the accuracy of the compensation method. This paper describes the influence of the model error and proposes a new approach to improve the accuracy of delay time compensation based on the coefficient of restitution by introducing a new model of the system. A collision experiment by the hybrid simulator is carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed compensation method compared with the conventional compensation method.	chain-of-responsibility pattern;coefficient;computer simulation;numerical analysis	Yoshikazu Satake;Satoko Abiko;Xin Jiang;Atsushi Konno;Masaru Uchiyama	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385804	computer simulation;control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;accuracy and precision;force;statistics	Robotics	67.97045500899954	-17.470495807168014	6828

1e206036777a1762333e2ee770dba212892675f7	control-oriented modeling and validation of bicycle curve dynamics with focus on lateral tire parameters		Under the objective of modeling, simulating and controlling the dynamics of bicycles in dangerous situations, such as wheel slippage, an accurate tire model is essential. Especially the lateral tire behavior is crucial since it is fundamental for stability in both rectilinear and curve maneuvers. So far, various test bench measurements are available in literature that describe lateral tire forces and moments under different load, sideslip and camber angle. The most recent measurements that study the behavior of common bicycle tires that are still available on the market come to very different results, even for identical tires. Anyhow, test bench measurements almost always imply conditions that differ from field application of bicycles on actual road surface. The aim of this paper is to use lateral tire parameters extracted from literature and include them into a multibody model of lateral bicycle dynamics. The simulation result is then compared to measurements recorded in a realistic environment. Therefore a bicycle is equipped with sensors to provide a large set of relevant variables of lateral vehicle dynamics. The validation process identifies a set of tire parameters that allows good model accuracy. Also for different tires at different inflation pressure model validity can be shown using tire parameters extracted from test-bench measurements.	control system;elasticity (data store);extraction;friction;instability;large;lateral computing;lateral thinking;rem sleep behavior disorder;regular grid;simulation;steering wheel;test bench;carcass;sensor (device);wheelchair;width	Silas Klug;Alessandro Moia;Armin Verhagen;Daniel Georges;Sergio Maria Savaresi	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062445	tire rotation;test bench;vehicle dynamics;bicycle and motorcycle dynamics;slippage;slip (aerodynamics);camber angle;tire uniformity;automotive engineering;engineering	Robotics	73.10890214575416	-16.927188059777237	6849

In this work we describe a computer model of the primary and secondary rod pathways in the vertebrate retina. The model is composed of the following cell populations: rods, cones, rod bipolar cells, cone bipolar cells, AII amacrine cells and ganglion cells. Cells of the model are connected via chemical as well as electrical synapses according to realistic convergence and divergence factors. There are electrical synapses between rods, rods and cones, AII amacrine cells, and cone bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells. The model assumes that low intensity stimuli simulating scotopic conditions reach all rods in the receptor array but less than half of them are excited. The excited rods response is controlled by a photocurrent waveform whose amplitude can be manipulated to simulate stimuli of different intensities within the scotopic range. The model is used to investigate the effects of different degrees of coupling among photoreceptors and among AII amacrine cells, as well as values of rod hyperpolarization activated current Ih on the dynamic range of the retina. Results show that for realistic values of Ih conductance the dynamic range of the rod array is maximized at the critical connectivity degree for bond percolation. However, the dynamic range of the rod bipolar and ganglion cells is maximized for a photoreceptor connectivity degree below the critical value. The latter result is a consequence of the high convergence of chemical synapses from rods to rod bipolar cells.	numerical aperture	Rodrigo Publio	2008			conductance;retina;synapse;hyperpolarization (biology);biophysics;rod;electrical synapses;physics;scotopic vision;gap junction	Crypto	95.7781695940848	-8.163145442131523	6886

The delays are assumed to be bounded and longer than a sampling time unit. We apply the act-and-wait control concept to stabilize the system: the controller is on for one sampling period (act) and off for some sampling periods (wait). If the waiting period is longer than the maximum delay in the feedback, then the stability can be described by finite number of eigenvalues. Although the closed-loop stability of the stochastic system with the act-and-wait controller is characterized by the Lyapunov exponent of infinite random matrix products, the dimension of these matrices is finite, which results in a significant reduction of computational complexity. The applicability of this method is demonstrated in a simple example, where we compare deterministic stability with the Lyapunov exponent based results.	computational complexity theory;control system;linear system;lyapunov fractal;sampling (signal processing);stochastic process	Mohammadreza Ghasemi;Siming Zhao;Tamás Insperger;Tamás Kalmár-Nagy	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;discrete mathematics;stability;matrix multiplication;control theory;mathematics;stability theory;linear system;computational complexity theory;statistics	Robotics	67.45640744250267	2.8458117280638264	6890

In that context, Electrically Power Assisted Cycles (EPACs) received a great attention: several efforts have been made in order to improve their performance in terms of autonomy, weight, esthetic and feeling with the driver. In this work, project and realization of a full hybrid electric bike (HEB) are presented. The main idea, borrowed from the more explored 4-wheel world, is to use the possible energy fluxes between cyclist and motor in order to improve the efficiency of the primary engine (the human body) being completely self-sustaining and grid-independent (differently to all the other EPACs). Collected biometric data that lead to the algorithm design are presented in detail focusing particularly on human metabolic efficiency measurement. Finally, an experiment performed in cycling track compares the mechanical and metabolic results between traditional and hybrid electric bike.	algorithm design;autonomy;biometrics;power supply	Pierfrancesco Spagnol;Giovanni Alli;Cristiano Spelta;P.

In this paper, we consider the propagation of the property of nonlinear norm-observability through a simulation relation. Given two control systems that are related by a graph simulation relation, we derive conditions under which the norm-observability of the simulating system implies the norm-observability of the simulated system. The obtained results are given in terms of set-valued functions. Several examples are included to illustrate various applications of our results.	control system;simulation	Rui Li;Yiguang Hong;Xingyuan Wang	2017	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2017.04.011	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	69.07638094517898	3.6857344234355542	6982

In this paper, a methodology for detecting errors in DC motor operation and adapting its control parameters to compensate for the same using continuous linear checksums, is developed. The approach is different from prior application of checksum codes to analog circuits and servomotor systems, in that none of the states of the DC motor are directly controllable. Accordingly, from measurements of the observable states of the system, the control law for the motor is modified almost instantaneously, to recover motor performance in the most optimal manner possible in the presence of parametric deviations due to wear and tear. We focus on wear out susceptible electromechanical anomalies such as loss of torque due to increased ballbearing friction, etc. Simulation results supported by a hardware prototype support the viability of the proposed error detection and compensation methodology.	analogue electronics;armature (computer animation);autonomous system (internet);checksum;code;control system;error detection and correction;experiment;nonlinear system;observable;optimal control;prototype;quality of service;real-time transcription;sensor;simulation;transducer	Md Imran Momtaz;Suvadeep Banerjee;Abhijit Chatterjee	2016	2016 IEEE 34th VLSI Test Symposium (VTS)	10.1109/VTS.2016.7477298	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;error detection and correction;engineering;electrical engineering;dc motor;friction;mathematical model;control theory;low-cost carrier;torque;encoding;statistics	Embedded	75.81198173976753	-16.10265896237176	6984

The methodology is implemented on a vertical two-link robotic manipulator. A manifold learning (ML) algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of the system. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) routine is trained to act as an out-of-sample (OoS) extension algorithm, and is used to map existing and newly generated points. The initial results of the study show promise in the application of ML routines for system identification (SI) on a reduced data set and eventually application to control setups.	algorithm;artificial neural network;linear system;mimo;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;nonlinear system;robot;simulation;system identification	Ryan Finn;Rickey Dubay	2018	2018 Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)	10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369499	mimo;artificial neural network;machine learning;system identification;manipulator;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	61.39033051878715	-12.170804090749941	7032

In this paper, it is assumed that each perturbation is bounded by a linear function of delayed state with unknown gains, and an adaptation law is proposed to estimate these unknown gains. Moreover, by making use of the updated values of these unknown bounds we propose a memoryless state feedback controller for such a class of uncertain time-delay systems. Based on Lyapunov stability theory and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the closed-loop dynamical system resulting from the proposed adaptive robust control schemes is globally stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the results.	adaptive filter;control theory;dynamical system;linear function;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;robust control	Hansheng Wu	2000	IEEE Trans.

For that purpose, we measured the rotation numbers corresponding to the phase-locking rhythms achieved in a large set of values of the normalized forcing frequency (NFF) and of the coupling strength between the master and the slave oscillators. In particular, we were interested in the system behavior in the strong-coupling limit, because such problem has not been extensively studied from an experimental perspective. Our results indicate that, in such a limit, a degenerate codimension-2 bifurcation point at NFF = 2 exists, in which all the phase-locking regions converge. These findings were corroborated by means of a mathematical model developed to that end, as well as by ad hoc further experiments.	electronic oscillator	Moisés Santillán	2016	I. J.

To construct a realistic soft tissue model, finite element (FE) modeling techniques are preferred over the particle-based techniques since the material properties can be integrated directly into the FE model to provide more accurate visual and haptic feedback to a user during the simulations. However, running even a static (time-independent) nonlinear FE model in realtime is a highly challenging task because the resulting stiffness matrix (K) is not constant and varies with the depth of penetration into the model. We propose a new computational approach allowing visio-haptic interaction with an FE model of a human liver having both nonlinear geometric and material properties. Our computational approach consists of two main steps: a pre-computation of the configuration space of all deformation configurations of the model, followed by the interpolation of the precomputed data for the calculation of the nodal displacements and reaction forces that are displayed to the user during the real-time interactions through a visual display and a haptic device, respectively. For the implementation of the proposed approach, no a priori assumptions or modeling simplifications about the mathematical complexity of the underlying soft tissue model, size and irregularity of the FE mesh are necessary. Moreover, it turns out that the deformation and force responses of the liver in the simulations are heavily influenced by the selected simulation parameters, such as the material model, boundary conditions and loading path, but the stability of the visual and haptic rendering in our approach does not depend on these parameters. In addition to showing the stability of our approach, the length of the precomputations as well as the accuracy of the interpolation scheme are evaluated for different interpolation functions and configuration space densities. & 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The human hand is a very complex grasping tool that can handle objects of different sizes and shapes. Many research activities have been carried out to develop artificial robot hands with capabilities similar to the human hand. In this paper the mechanism and design of a new humanoid-type hand (called TUAT/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand) with human-like manipulation abilities is discussed. The new hand is designed for the humanoid robot ARMAR which has to work autonomously or interactively in cooperation with humans and for an artificial lightweight arm for handicapped persons. The arm is developed as close as possible to the human arm and is driven by spherical ultrasonic motors. The ideal end-effector for such an artificial arm or a humanoid would be able to use the tools and objects that a person uses when working in the same environment.

Although a substantial amount of effort has been dedicated to the problem of surface reconstruction, a comprehensive means of evaluating this class of algorithms is noticeably absent. We propose a simple pipeline for measuring surface reconstruction algorithms, consisting of three main phases: surface modeling, sampling, and evaluation. We use implicit surfaces for modeling shapes which are capable of representing details of varying size and sharp features. From these implicit surfaces, we produce point clouds by synthetically generating range scans which resemble realistic scan data produced by an optical triangulation scanner. We validate our synthetic sampling scheme by comparing against scan data produced by a commercial optical laser scanner, where we scan a 3D-printed version of the original surface. Last, we perform evaluation by comparing the output reconstructed surface to a dense uniformly distributed sampling of the implicit surface. We decompose our benchmark into two distinct sets of experiments. The first set of experiments measures reconstruction against point clouds of complex shapes sampled under a wide variety of conditions. Although these experiments are quite useful for comparison, they lack a fine-grain analysis. To complement this, the second set of experiments measures specific properties of surface reconstruction, in terms of sampling characteristics and surface features. Together, these experiments depict a detailed examination of the state of surface reconstruction algorithms.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);ct scan;experiment;implicit surface;point cloud;printing;sampling (signal processing);synthetic intelligence	Matthew Berger;Joshua A.

4ad88b050a9a47cade916b45cab323376086a0ee	comparative analysis of the accuracy of the distance to the observed object for geometric methods	comparative analysis	The article presents a comparative analysis of the accuracy of the distance to the observed object for geometric methods in noisy observations of bearings-only information. Algorithms for determining the parameters of the trajectories of moving objects are widely used in control systems and navigation systems, with one of the most difficult tasks is to determine the trajectory parameters for passive goniometric monitoring a moving object under the action of perturbations. Conditions of the problem imply that the observer and the object of observation (target) is moving in two dimensions on a smooth trajectory. In the discrete time the observer measures the angle of the bearing to the target. Angle measurement is performed with error representing a white noise. Coordinates of an observer at each discrete point in time are assumed to be known. Must be based on observations to recover the trajectory of target with a specified accuracy. In the mathematical sense, this task is the task of restoring function to a limited number of observation data. Feature of the problem is that the observation data at each discrete moment of time sufficient to obtain a unique solution. Currently known methods for calculating the number of geometric coordinates and motion parameters of objects (KPDO) based on using only the goniometric information, with the greatest application is the method of N -Bearing [1]. A common feature of these methods is that they are applicable only for uniform rectilinear motion of the observed object, whereas in the wild movement of the observed object, as a rule, nonlinear. A number of studies [2,3], the author proposed a method N Polynomials, which allows to determine the parameters of the trajectory in the case of nonlinear motion of the observed object. The basis of this method is an approximation of the object's trajectory observing the parametric functions of the coordinates of time, given as a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials [4]. As a basic system of polynomials can be used Chebyshev polynomials of the 1 st and 2 nd kind, as well as Legendre polynomials. Distinctive features of the proposed method is: 1. opportunity to determine the trajectory nonlinear moving target; 2. ensuring continuity solution for any parameters of maneuvering targets; 3. separate mathematical processing of simulation results and an error estimate for each of the coordinates; 4. minimizing the approximation error of the trajectory through the use of orthogonal polynomials; 5. minimize errors of observation through the use of processing raw data by the method of least squares; 6. ease of obtaining the parameters of the trajectory at any point in time calculated by differentiation of the simulated functions. Results compare the accuracy of determining the parameters of the trajectories nonlinear moving target for various models of movement by the method N Polynomials, and the method N -Bearing are shown in figures 1-3. Figure 1. Errors in determining the origin for purposes of uniformlyac celerated motion on Big VIP Figure 2. Errors in determining the origin for purposes of uniformly accelerated motion in a small VIP Figure 3. Errors in determining the origin for moving target in a parabola on average VIP Thus, use of N Polynomials to determine the parameters of the trajectory of a moving object in the nonlinear terms of noise, is preferred because it allows much more accurate solution of the problem and ensure the continuity of the solution.	algorithm;approximation error;chebyshev polynomials;control system;geographic coordinate system;least squares;legendre polynomials;nonlinear system;polynomial ring;qualitative comparative analysis;regular grid;scott continuity;simulation;white noise	Sergey Alexandrovich Pyunninen	2011	CoRR		qualitative comparative analysis;econometrics;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;geometric data analysis;statistics	Robotics	57.16808705368386	-40.63793790789121	7171
41379e5c5084b91313f7a36701ff1fb91fbaa4c5	an analysis of policies from stochastic linear quadratic gaussian in robotics problems with state- and control-dependent noise		Among all the mathematical frameworks used in the control and robotics communities to handle uncertainties, the stochastic variants of optimal control frameworks are appealing, in particular because of the existence of efficient tools to solve them computationally, such as dynamic programming. However, in many cases, because of their formulation as a classical optimization problem, it may be difficult to ponder the expected solutions for a given choice of the objective function to minimize. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of the policies obtained from solving Stochastic Linear Quadratic Gaussian problems, thinking in particular in robot motion planning applications. To perform this analysis, we assume simplified linear systems perturbed by Gaussian noise, with state-dependend and control-dependent components, and objective functions summing up control-related and state-related costs. We provide (1) useful bounds for understanding the effect of the objective function parameters, (2) insights on what the expected paths of system should be and (3) results on the optimal choice of the planning horizon.	robotics	Hugo Carlos;Jean-Bernard Hayet;Rafael Murrieta-Cid	2018	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-017-0736-x	control engineering;linear-quadratic regulator;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;gaussian noise;motion planning;mathematical optimization;markov decision process;optimal control;linear system;mathematics;optimization problem	Robotics	60.339960445242454	1.2055307254800824	7178

Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2001, 41, 369-375], aimed at distinguishing between enantiomers. The chirality code is a sequence of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to the value of a certain """"chirality function"""" at equidistant points within a chosen interval. For molecules of moderate size the chirality function has thousands of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each quartet of atoms. Therefore it looks as if the chirality code cannot provide a faithful representation of the chirality function and thus a faithful representation of the molecular structure. We now show that functional groups present in the molecule result in clusters of near-lying and partially overlapping peaks, whose position in the chirality code is characteristic for the particular functional group. This enables a sound structural interpretation of the chirality code."""

A reduced-order switched model is constructed for a given robustly stable switched system, which has the same structural polytopic uncertainties as the original system, such that the resulting error system is robustly asymptotically stable and an H∞ error performance is guaranteed. A sufficient condition for the existence of the desired reduced-order model is derived and formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. By solving the corresponding convex optimization problem in such existence condition, the vertex system of reduced-order model can be obtained, which also provides an H∞ gain for the error system between the original system and the reduced-order model. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed techniques. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

66d68d175cf6fe4e667d28434e33c98c8497f245	fast 3d map reconstruction using dense visual simultaneous localization and mapping based on unmanned aerial vehicle		Traditional 3D map reconstruction methods based on unmanned aerial (UA) always relies on multi-camera optical equipment or additional space positioning equipment. All of these restrict the UA's application scenarios to some extent. Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM), using the camera as the only external sensor, can construct a 3D map of its spatial environment while recording its own localization. This paper proposes a technique of fast 3D map reconstruction based on UAs by using VSLAM, with parallel computing based on CUDA, to achieve fast dense reconstruction based on a UA platform. This research belongs to one of the emerging but very exciting application areas using UAs. It helps to expand the application scope of UAs to some extent. From the experiments, it is demonstrated that the methodology presented in this paper works well, and could be applied to real world applications.	aerial photography;cuda;experiment;parallel computing;simultaneous localization and mapping;usb attached scsi;unmanned aerial vehicle;user agent	Siyuan Peng;Fang Huang;Jian Tao;Bo Tie;Jun Lu;Xiaodong Zhang	2018	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517796	visualization;iterative reconstruction;computer vision;artificial intelligence;simultaneous localization and mapping;feature extraction;positioning equipment;cuda;computer science	Robotics	54.62977695600305	-44.86517734486616	7262

First we consider dynamical systems (i.e., fully observable systems with no inputs), wh ich we call eventually positive. We compute forward-invariantcones and Lyapunov functions for these systems. We then extend the notion of eventually positive systems to the input-output s ystem case. Our extension is performed in such a manner, that some valuable properties of classical internally positive input-output systems are preserved. For example, their induced norms can be computed using linear programming and the energy functions have nonnegative derivatives. I.

This equation contains dissipative corrections, accounting for the interaction with the environment, whose expression strongly depends on the adopted Markov approximation. In the case where a control is present, the rigorous derivation of the Markov approximation in the standard case, the weak coupling limit, shows that the control appears not only in the coherent part of the equation but also in the dissipative correction. This complicates the analysis of the dynamics but also offers the opportunity of indirectly affecting the interaction with the environment through the control. In this paper we study this scenario for a finite dimensional quantum system interacting with a (Bosonic) bath of harmonic oscillators. We prove several control theoretic properties of this system and discuss how the control can be used to effectively shape the influence of the environment and obtain desired features of the dynamics.	approximation;coherence (physics);dissipative system;interaction;lindblad equation;markov chain;quantum system;theory	Domenico D'Alessandro;Edmond A.

Our proposition is to bound the nonlinear part of the dynamic feasibility constraint between some properly chosen extreme values. Making sure that this constraint is satisfied for the extreme values guarantees its satisfaction for all possible values in between. This follows a classical approach from robust nonlinear control theory, which is to consider a nonlinear dynamical system as a specific selection of a time-invariant Linear Differential Inclusion. As a result, dynamic feasibility can be imposed by using only linear constraints, which can be included in an efficient linear MPC scheme, to generate 3D walking motions online. Our simulation results show two major achievements: 1) walking motions over uneven ground such as stairs can be generated online, with guaranteed kinematic and dynamic feasibility, 2) walking on flat ground is significantly improved, with a 3D motion of the CoM closely resembling the one observed in humans.	control theory;differential inclusion;dynamical system;experiment;humans;inverse kinematics;maximal set;nonlinear system;robot;robotics;simulation;time-invariant system;toejam & earl	Camille Brasseur;Alexander Sherikov;Cyrille Collette;Dimitar Dimitrov;Pierre-Brice Wieber	2015	2015 IEEE-RAS 15th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363423	dynamics;kinematics;simulation;shape;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.13657384686907	-17.87452442360816	7377

Applying angular encoding to normal vectors results in narrower data paths and permits hardware integration of look-up tables of acceptable size. A special-purpose logic-embedded memory architecture is presented, where bumpand reflection-mapping of textured surfaces are executed by an intelligent memory device. High-performance surface shading is achieved by making use of precomputed shadingand reflection-map coordinate generation tables, and considering cache coherence of pixel-to-pixel normal vectors. Such a dedicated memory chip can easily be interfaced to a standard rasterizer, in place of texture memory to offer bump-, textureand reflection-mapping hardware support.

The control approach is model-free and uses a small-amplitude perturbation signal to enable real-time estimation of the cost function gradient. The strategy has similarities with the approaches of `stochastic approximation' and `extremum seeking control', which are well-known methods in the control community. Particular fine-tuning of the algorithm, such as perturbation filtering, cost function shaping and disturbance feedforward are discussed. The control strategy has been validated on a (quasi-optical) millimetre wave resonator system. A significant disturbance acting on this set-up is the non-stationary frequency of the wave source (gyrotron). In various experiments it has been demonstrated that the control approach is well capable of keeping the optical cavity in resonance, to track wavelength variations and to reject disturbances in the low and mid-frequency range. The only performance limitation of the approach occurs in cases which require fast disturbance tracking. This is due to the bandwidth restrictions in the underlying mirror motion system.	algorithm;control theory;experiment;feedforward neural network;frequency band;gradient;loss function;maxima and minima;motion system;noise shaping;real-time clock;resonance;stationary process;stochastic approximation	Niek J.

This paper proposes a general, robust approach for mesh denoising by using a combination of bilateral filtering, feature recognition, anisotropic neighborhood searching, and surface fitting and projection techniques. Motivated by the bilateral filtering from image processing applications, we develop a new bilateral filter operating on the normal vector fields of the mesh. Then, we detect mesh features and classify mesh vertices into non-feature vertices and feature vertices. The corresponding anisotropic neighborhoods for each vertex are searched by constructing a weighted dual graph, over which biquadratic Bezier surface patches are fitted and projected. The projection points are averaged to update each vertex of the mesh. The steps above are repeated iteratively until convergence, i.e., the Hausdorff distance between two sequential denoised meshes is less than a pre-defined threshold. A number of examples presented in the paper demonstrate that our method generally yields visually and numerically better denoising results, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanical design of the pectoral fins improves both the waterproof capability and the control precision. By adjusting the rotation angles of the pectoral fins, the robotic fish can fulfill up-and-down motion. Due to the uncertainty of the depth information measured by the pressure sensor, fuzzy logic method is applied to the depth control of the robotic fish.

The method makes use of top–down analysis algorithm and bottom–up reconstruction of frequency contents of musical signals using a reference database that contains the spectral profiles of all single notes. Recognition accuracy is enhanced by analyzing the time-frequency contents using a bank of narrow band filters with very sharp transition band. The filters are designed using the Frequency-Response Masking technique. The high selectivity of the filters has enhanced the frequency analysis and increased the accuracy of identification. The method was tested with musical notes generated from an acoustic piano. The results show that for single notes and chords up to four notes, perfect identification can be achieved.	filter bank;medical transcription	Say Wei Foo;Edwin Wei Thai Lee	2003	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126603001082	speech recognition;engineering;musical notation;filter bank;transcription	EDA	80.71393637446252	-34.03216833037478	7504

In this work, thermal paths within a 3-D stack are investigated using the HotSpot simulator, and the results are compared to experimental data of a fabricated two layer stack with a single back metal layer. Resistive heaters and sensors measure the heat flow in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The dependence of the thermal conductivity on temperature is integrated into the thermal simulation process. At high temperatures (~ 80°C), this effect is responsible for inaccuracies in the temperature and thermal resistance of up to, respectively, 20% and 28%. As confirmed by simulation, those horizontal paths that lie mostly within the silicon layer conduct more heat as compared to the vertical paths, since the thermal conductivity of silicon dioxide is ~ 200 times smaller than the thermal conductivity of silicon.	integrated circuit;java hotspot virtual machine;path analysis (statistics);resistive touchscreen;semiconductor;sensor;simulation;thermal resistance	Boris Vaisband;Ioannis Savidis;Eby G.

Periodic one-dimensional (1D) tubes, 2D lattices, and 3D crystals are easily created from “DNA tiles” with spacings of 10-20 nanometers. “DNA origami” allows the folding of long DNA strands into arbitrary shapes and patterns up to about 100 nanometers in size with five nanometer features. This suggests that DNA self-assembly might be used for sublithographic fabrication of devices or even circuits. There are, however, a number of challenges. For example, compared to the inorganic materials used as semiconductors, DNA has poor electronic properties and must be augmented by other materials. Such challenges must be solved before DNA self-assembly can be used in a complete process for nanofabrication. We will present partial solutions to a few of them.	dna microarray;self-assembly;semiconductor;sensitivity and specificity	Paul W. K.

Nanopositioning stages are used to achieve the high positioning resolution and accuracy for a wide and growing scope of applications. However, their positioning accuracy and repeatability are not well known and difficult to guarantee, which induces many drawbacks for many applications. For example, in the mechanical characterisation of biological samples, it is difficult to perform several cycles in a repeatable way so as not to induce negative influences on the study. It also prevents one from controlling accurately a tool with respect to a sample without adding additional sensors for closed loop control. This paper aims at quantifying the positioning repeatability and accuracy based on the ISO 9283:1998 standard, and analyzing factors influencing positioning accuracy onto a case study of 1-DoF (Degree-of-Freedom) nanopositioning stage. The influence of thermal drift is notably quantified. Performances improvement of the nanopositioning stage are then investigated through robot calibration (i.e., open-loop approach). Two models (static and adaptive models) are proposed to compensate for both geometric errors and thermal drift. Validation experiments are conducted over a long period (several days) showing that the accuracy of the stage is improved from typical micrometer range to 400 nm using the static model and even down to 100 nm using the adaptive model. In addition, we extend the 1-DoF calibration to multi-DoF with a case study of a 2-DoF nanopositioning robot. Results demonstrate that the model efficiently improved the 2D accuracy from 1400 nm to 200 nm.	closed-loop transfer function;experiment;frequency drift;image resolution;nanorobotics;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;repeatability;robot calibration;sensor;thermal grease	Ning Tan;Cédric Clévy;Nicolas Chaillet	2015	Micromachines	10.3390/mi6121461	control engineering;open-loop controller;repeatability;calibration;simulation;engineering;control theory;accuracy and precision	Robotics	61.49697909342734	-34.591029283367014	7618

Any jammer or interference will be well localized in the TF plane. By treating the TF plane as an image, the interference patterns can be detected by using the image analysis technique of Hough-Radon transform (HRT). Curves with mathematical equations can be easily detected by transforming the shapes into Hough domain, and searching for dominant peaks (maximum values). The co-ordinates of the dominant peaks provide the parameters of the shape. For example, in case of a straight line, the Hough domain would be the “rho, theta” space, where “rho and theta” are the parameters of a straight line. The maximum value in the rho, theta plane would correspond to the exact parmeters of the straight line. If a high resolution TFD for a spread spectrum signal is achieved, then any linear chirp or non-linear chirp interference will show up as straight lines and curves in the TF plane. By applying the HRT on the TF plane, chirp interferences can be identified. Evaluation of the proposed techniques show successful detection of both linear and hyperbolic (nonlinear) chirp interferences in spread spectrum signals even under very low SNR conditions of 0 dB. The method detects any localized interference as along as the interference pattern in the TF plane can be represented by a	chirp;hough transform;nonlinear system	Shynimol Thayilchira;Sridhar Krishnan	2002		10.1109/ICASSP.2002.5745644	computer vision;radon transform;erbium;image analysis;time–frequency analysis;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;chirp spread spectrum;chirp;spread spectrum;modulation	Crypto	82.04554667921829	-40.964435750643624	7621

A practical method is proposed in this paper to alleviate this computational cost. The stability conditions are first formulated as an LMI feasibility problem involving the search of a suitable parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. This problem is then solved for a finite number of parametric configurations and the validity of the resulting Lyapunov function is checked on the whole parametric domain using a μ-analysis based test. In case the validation fails, a worst-case configuration is determined using particle swarm optimization and the whole process is repeated using an augmented set of parametric configurations. The resulting iterative algorithm is successfully applied to a realistic fighter aircraft model.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;best, worst and average case;computation;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;parametric polymorphism;particle swarm optimization;perturbation theory;profiling (computer programming);time complexity	Clement Roos;Laure Lafourcade;Jean-Marc Biannic	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426499	control engineering;mathematical optimization;stability;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign;iterative method;lyapunov exponent;lyapunov optimization;statistics	Robotics	65.5549258848145	-1.3113349905928444	7688

For this aim, our modular system is comprised of a Mecanum-wheel based omnidirectional motion system with a dense array of line sensors. The system comprises other sensors and actuators, which can be replaced or augmented with more specialized sensors and mechanical systems for each application.

The system allows users to virtually try on 3D shoe models in a live video stream. A two-stage object tracking algorithm was developed to correctly align shoe models to moving feet during the try-on process. Tracking was driven by an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that superimposed the captured depth data and predefined reference foot models. Test data showed that the two-stage approach produced increased positional accuracy compared with tracking using only surface registration. Trimming the reference model using the instant view angle improved the computational efficiency of the ICP algorithm. The developed virtual try-on function is an effective tool for realizing human-centered design. This study also showed a new application of RGB-D Cameras to product design.	algorithm;align (company);augmented reality;computation;iterative closest point;iterative method;personalization;photogrammetry;reference model;streaming media;test data;user-centered design	Yu-I Yang;Chih-Kai Yang;Xin-Lan Liao;Chih-Hsing Chu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM)	10.1109/IEEM.2015.7385813	computer vision;simulation;engineering;solid modeling;foot;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	54.6908771786608	-45.93558402668957	7715

1970e83fa736732b369a67132066fc3fa411591f	a magnetic manipulator cooled with liquid nitrogen		Miniature robots manipulated by external magnetic fields could enable less invasive surgeries. Magnetic tools, capsules, or medication can be controlled inside a human body using electromagnets. However, resistive magnetic devices able to produce strong magnetic fields in a large volume inefficiently use space and energy. This letter presents the design and testing of a magnetic manipulator cooled with liquid nitrogen. This technique reduces the electrical resistance of copper wires. It, therefore, reduces the amount of heat generated to produce a given magnetic field. Liquid nitrogen-cooled electromagnets are smaller than air-cooled ones and use less power. This letter examines how both effects scale with the size of the workspace. The system presented possesses six electromagnets and its ability to control a robot is demonstrated experimentally.	ethanol 0.62 ml/ml topical solution;experiment;liquid nitrogen;magnetic resonance imaging;operative surgical procedures;robot (device);small;workspace;capsule (pharmacologic)	Julien Leclerc;Benedict Isichei;Aaron T.

The inertia ellipsoid, which is used for graphically representing the mass properties of a single rigid body, is extended to a generalized ellipsoid for a series of rigid bodies such as a robot arm. By drawing the Generalized Inertia Ellipsoid (GIE) on a computer display, one can visualize the mass properties and dynamic behaviour of a robot manipulator. This method is applied to aid the design of a mechanical arm; the dimensions of the arm structure and its mass distribution are optimized on the basis of the evaluation of the arm dynamics displayed on a graphics terminal.	robot	H.

The modification consists in using the simplified data-dependent Bayesian evidence normalizing the classical BACD formula and in the recursive evaluation of these two functions. The suggested approach seems to be computationally effective and numerical stable as shown by experiments. Apart from the evaluation of the algorithm accuracy two illustrative examples with modelled signals are given. One application to the violin signal segmentation demonstrates the algorithm performance - even relatively weak and gradual signal changes can be detected.	algorithm;autoregressive model;data dependency;experiment;numerical analysis;recursion;synthetic intelligence	Roman Cmejla;Pavel Sovka	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;statistics	ML	78.59800580754258	-10.384136877203613	7737

This advance is expected to bring gravitational wave observations of relativistic astrophysical events such as black hole mergers and supernovae into the realm of regular astronomy. These upgrades require complex vibration isolation systems to better decouple the test masses from ground disturbances. These high performance systems require correspondingly more complex and aggressive active control loops to meet the increased demand in instrument sensitivity. This paper applies a modal damping technique with state estimation to optimize the trade-off between disturbance rejection and sensor noise amplification. The state estimator design applies a customized cost function around the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm.	algorithm;black hole;frequency band;image noise;loss function;modal logic;quadruple-precision floating-point format;rejection sampling;sensor	Brett Shapiro;Nergis Mavalvala;Kamal Youcef-Toumi	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		damping;pendulum;electronic engineering;resonance;sensitivity;interferometry;sensor;noise;control theory;vibration isolation;optics;physics;actuator	EDA	74.46116175567481	-12.2499620575267	7772

First, we make an IR model of the object with the internal heat source, and generate thermal images by the optical system of the reticle seeker and the atmospheric turbulence. Using the obtained thermal images, we can simulate IR reticle seekers in various scenarios including countermeasures (CM) such as flares. Simulation results show that we can generate more accurate images by using the proposed method, which is applicable to the study of the development of counter-countermeasures (CCMs).	simulation	Hyun-Ki Hong;Sung-Hyun Han;Gyoung-Pyo Hong;SurngGabb Jahng;Jong-Soo Choi	1997	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126697000243	computer vision;simulation;engineering	EDA	56.47452657698184	-43.03077347713784	7787

However, the current filter based fault prediction methods for the nonlinear systems are all based on the framework of the probability theory, and cannot realize fault prediction of the nonlinear systems with fuzzy uncertainty. Based on the extended fuzzy Kalman filter (EFKF) and the extended orthogonality principle, an improved fuzzy Kalman filter (IFKF) is firstly proposed to estimate the system states or the parameters in this paper. Then, according to the IFKF, a multi-step improved fuzzy Kalman predictor (MIFKP), which can be considered as an adaptive predictor, is obtained. Once the characteristic parameter is chosen, the MIFKP can be used to implement the multi-step fault prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach has the better prediction ability and stronger robustness than the traditional multi-step extended fuzzy Kalman predictor (MEFKP).	algorithm;computer simulation;kalman filter;kerrison predictor;nonlinear system	Zhi-Jie Zhou;Chang-Hua Hu;Hongdong Fan;Jin Li	2008	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2008.04.008	fuzzy logic;kalman filter;control engineering;probability theory;invariant extended kalman filter;uncertainty;fast kalman filter;nonlinear system;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics	AI	64.08133321063745	-6.335323370280917	7811

Based on a linear matrix inequality setting, some equivalent criteria are proposed to ensure that the closed-loop hidden MJS is stochastically stable.

Our convergence analysis exploits results on input-to-state stability of discrete parameterized systems. For a class of multiple-input, multiple-output discrete-time linear systems, with all iteration-varying uncertainties bounded, we give one condition that ensures boundedness of all system trajectories and an additional, second condition that ensures convergence of tracking error. Notably, we do not require the standard ILC contraction mapping requirement to hold at each iteration. Moreover, we show that it is possible to achieve perfect output tracking if the iteration-varying uncertainties all converge with increasing iteration.	contraction mapping;control theory;converge;iteration;iterative method;linear system;system camera	Deyuan Meng;Kevin L.

If no model is available automatic learning and adaptation methods have to be applied. The aim of this contribution is twofold: (1) To present an easy to maintain and cheap test platform, which fullls the requirements of a complex control problem. (2) To discuss the application of Genetic Programming for evolution of control programs in real time. An extensive number of experiments with two real robots has been carried out. 1 Complex Bio-Inspired Robots Conventional industrial robots are designed in such a way that a model can be derived easily and the inverse kinematic can be calculated. In operation, the inverse kinematics is used to compute the trajectory for movement between given points in the working area of the robot. Connections between actuators are made as sticky as possible to yield (near) linear behaviour 7]. Perception relies on sense-model-plan-act cycle, where for planning a mostly predeened model of the system is required. For the development of robots which are inspired by biological systems 1 \controllability"""" is not a primary design principal. Thus, their actuators are mostly dependent. A model usually does not exist, is very hard to derive or too complex so that a model-based calculation of motor commands requires too much time for reactive tasks. There is no obvious optimal control strategy for a desired action (e.g. movement) because of the complex interdependencies of all the actuators and a non-linear feedback from the environment. Examples of (at least partially) bio-inspired robots are modular robots like the robot snake 2,3] and robot shes like the robot tuna build at MIT Ocean Engineering 4]. But even if a model exists, a robot can get into a situation where this model is not valid anymore, e.g. through malfunctioning of parts. If the control strategy is based on the model and an unexpected error occurs (e.g. the breaking of a 1 Shortly called: bio-inspired robot."""	biological system;british informatics olympiad;control theory;experiment;genetic programming;industrial robot;interdependence;inverse kinematics;mathematical morphology;nonlinear system;optimal control;requirement;sticky bit	Peter Dittrich;Andreas Bürgel;Wolfgang Banzhaf	1998		10.1007/3-540-64957-3_71	simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;autonomous system;artificial intelligence;evolutionary algorithm;motion planning;algorithm	Robotics	60.71860343144712	-23.69844661518596	7944

One problem has been the use of conventional mold compounds to encapsulate the high density wirebonded packages, due to performance issues, such as wire sweep and coplanarity. Additionally, in order to match lead-free solutions in the near future, antimony- and halogen-free molding compound must be developed because antimony (Sb) and halogens in current flame retardant systems pose environmental hazardous. This article, discusses a “green” compound that eliminated these environmentally hazardous elements, resolving moldability and reliability issues for high density wirebonded packages.#R##N##R##N#The reliability assessment was conducted at the maximum reflow peak temperature of 240 °C after moisture soaking at 60 °C/60%RH for 40 h, followed by temperature cycle tests. The study aimed for good package integrity, process, and performance to meet the requirements of high volume production and an acceptable moisture sensitivity (level 3) with a reflow temperature of 240 °C. The study indicates that moldability and reliability involved separate issues and offers a solution for high volume production and field application.	encapsulation (networking);wire bonding	T. Y.

Different from conventional wall-following approaches that are mostly based on the multi-sensor information fusion technology, this strategy manages to execute the wall-following activity with only a single distance proximity switch. This approach brings several advantages over the previous ones, including the avoidance of mutual interference between sensors and reduction of high hardware cost. In this paper we present the establishment, analysis and implementation of this strategy, with showing the experimental results and giving its potential applications.	interference (communication);mathematical model;mobile robot;sensor	Ying Liu;Ruiqing Fu;Jiping Wang;Yongsheng Ou;Xinyu Wu;Ansi Peng	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181389	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	57.656067691932584	-31.02238147595122	8053

The FTC scheme is developed using an LPV approach to extend ideas previously developed for linear time-invariant systems, in order to cover a wide range of operating conditions. The scheme benefits from the combination of the inherent robustness properties of ISMs (to ensure sliding occurs throughout the simulation) and CA, which has the ability to redistribute control signals to all available actuators in the event of faults/failures.	fault tolerance;flight simulator;implicit shape model;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;optimal control;real-time transcription;simulation;time complexity;time-invariant system	Halim Alwi;Christopher Edwards;O.

The system has been the result of a three-year European Community Research Project. The goal was to move from a centralized control architecture to a fully distributed one, where each component of the system makes a decision by itself and the control of the whole system is a shared task. The interchange of information between components is performed via fieldbuses. The graphic computer tool developed is able to perform an automatic code generation starting from a graphic description of the system provided by the user. Thus, different aircraft fuel system configurations can be considered. According to the specific aircraft under study, they can include more or less tanks and components in the system. For each case, the control code of the distributed system can be quickly modified. It can, then, be integrated in each component device to operate in the system. This paper describes the main ideas of the new distributed avionic system and the graphical tool.

The fluorescence emissions of the R/sub 1/ and R/sub 2/ lines were studied as functions of temperature and strain. Fluorescence decay lifetime measurements indicate that these fibers may be suitable for thermometric applications up to 973 K while strain measurements show only a very weak dependence. Similarly, characterization of the R-line shifts also show a weak strain sensitivity and an appreciably larger change with temperature. One fiber sample has been tested to destruction to demonstrate this weak strain dependence. Single-crystal ruby fibers are, thus, found to be potential candidates for dedicated temperature sensing from room temperature to /spl sim/923 K.	detection theory;experiment;optic axis of a crystal;r language;ruby	H.

High-amplitude seismic events, representing reflections from subterranean surfaces, are transformed to color pixels, and the resulting 3-D images reveal the structure of the geological layers. Such morphological features as hills, valleys, and faults are apparent indicating that the approach could prove useful for identifying potential oil reservoirs. The authors implement the technique on a personal computer to produce displays of similar quality, but they find that the construction of the 3-D images is too slow for reasonable interactivity. However, with the addition of a parallel-processing accelerator, a personal-computer-based workstation would be feasible for this kind of 3-D visualization and interpretation.<<ETX>>	interactive visualization;interactivity;personal computer;pixel;reflection (computer graphics);workstation	Robert H.

The time keeping capability of oscillators is best described by the scalar quantity phase. Phase computations and equations describing phase dynamics have been useful in understanding oscillator behavior and designing oscillators least affected by disturbances such as noise. In this paper, we present a unified theory of phase equations assimilating the work that has been done in electronics and biology for the last seven decades. We first provide a review of isochrons, which forms the basis of a generalized phase notion for oscillators. We present a general framework for phase equations and derive an exact phase equation that is practically unusable but facilitates the derivation of usable ones based on linear (already known) and quadratic (new and more accurate) approximations for isochrons. We discuss the utility of these phase equations in performing (semi) analytical phase computations and also describe simpler and more accurate phase computation schemes. Numerical experiments on several examples are presented comparing the accuracy of the various phase equations and computation schemes described in this paper.	approximation;computation;experiment;image noise;numerical method;oscillator (cellular automaton);semiconductor industry;usability	Onder Suvak;Alper Demir	2011	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2011.2113630	mathematical optimization;calculus;control theory;mathematics;oscillation;quantum mechanics	EDA	82.10279555570828	1.5615840328521153	8190

First of all, the dermition of robust H∞ filter is given. Considering the nonlinear disturbance link to uncertain singular systems with time-varying delay effects, we come up with the design idea of full order robust H∞ filter based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Under the condition that nonlinear uncertain functions satisfy Lipschitz condition, using Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) methods, a sufficient condition of such nonlinear uncertain delayed filtering error singular systems which are asymptotically stable and satisfy the robust H∞ performance is obtained. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the applicability of the proposed method.	linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;social inequality	Jiqing Qiu;Zirui Xing;Li Li;Mohan Yang;Yi Li	2012	2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359001	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	67.36449948601474	-0.676297934016895	8219

The vertical takeoff and landing, as well as horizontal flight, both with the characteristic of low speed and high precision, are major requirements for this work. The quadrotor architecture has been chosen for analysis because of its low dimensions, good maneuverability, simple mechanics and available payload capacity. As a major drawback, the high energy consumption when operating is a constraint to be modeled and optimized. In the first step, an internal logistics modeling is performed in order to determine the location of depots, clusters and sub-clusters; workstations are defined and routes are generated using a genetic algorithm for each quadcopter of a particular fleet. In a second step, the weight to be transported by each quadcopter is determined, depending on the assigned route and workstations that should go through the sequence either to remove materials (picking) or to deliver materials (delivery). In a third step, it is determined the electric power amount to be drained off the battery of every quadcopter for a given route depending on the weight carried, distance covered, number of workstations visited and the quadcopter aerodynamic efficiency.	logistics	Víctor Olivares;Felisa M.

Firstly, the nonlinear interconnected systems with the additive disturbance inputs are represented into the bilinear interconnected systems via Taylors series expansion and then we adopt the T-S fuzzy modeling technique to construct the fuzzy bilinear models. Secondly, the saturated linear state-feedback controllers for fuzzy interconnected bilinear systems are presented. An ellipsoid is the contractively invariant set of the fuzzy interconnected bilinear systems. The LMI-based conditions are proposed such that the fuzzy interconnected bilinear systems are asymptotically stable with the H∞ performance with the ellipsoid contained in the region of attraction. Moreover, an assigned polytopic region of the state space, containing the equilibrium, is enclosed into the region of attraction of the equilibrium itself. Finally, a numerical example is utilized to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.	bilinear transform;fuzzy control system	Xinrui Liu;Dongsheng Yang;Zhidong Li	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31362-2_42	mathematical optimization;control theory	Security	65.37576255192664	-4.0358521596222054	8271

In cases where the seafloor depth is greater than the DVL bottom-lock range, localizing between the surface and the seafloor presents a localization problem since both GPS and DVL observations are unavailable in the mid-water column. This work proposes a solution to this problem that exploits the fact that current profile layers of the water column are near constant over short time scales (in the scale of minutes). Using observations of these currents obtained with the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler mode of the DVL during descent, along with data from other sensors, the method discussed herein constrains position error. The method is validated using field data from the Sirius AUV coupled with view-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and on descents up to 3km deep with the Sentry AUV.	autonomous robot	Lashika Medagoda;Stefan B.

An array consists of two accelerometers mounted on a rigid rod. The absolute angle of each body segment was determined by band pass filtering of the differences between signals from parallel axes from two accelerometers mounted on the same rod. Joint angles were evaluated by subtracting absolute angles of the neighboring segments. This method eliminates the need for double integration as well as the drift typical for double integration. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated by experimental results involving healthy subjects who walked on a treadmill at various speeds, ranging between 0.15 m/s and 2.0 m/s. The validation was performed by comparing the estimated joint angles with the joint angles measured with flexible goniometers. The discrepancies were assessed by the differences between the two sets of data (obtained to be below 6 degrees) and by the Pearson correlation coefficient (greater than 0.97 for the knee angle and greater than 0.85 for the ankle angle).	array data structure;articular system;coefficient;herlitz disease;meter per second;muscle rigidity;treadmill, device;accelerometers;algorithm;goniometers	Milica Djuric-Jovicic;Nenad S.

From a system-theoretic viewpoint, there is a need to develop rigorous design and analysis tools for control, fault diagnosis and security of water distribution networks. This work develops a mathematical framework suitable for fault diagnosis and security in water systems; in addition it investigates the problem of determining a suitable set of locations for sensor placement in large-scale drinking water distribution networks such that contaminant detection is optimized. This work contributes to the research by presenting a problem formulation were the state-space representation of the propagation and reaction dynamics is coupled with the impact dynamics describing the “damage” caused by a contamination of the water distribution network. We propose a solution methodology for the sensor-placement problem by considering several risk-objectives, and by utilizing various optimization and evolutionary computation techniques. To illustrate the methodology, we present results of a simplified and a real water distribution network.	cobham's thesis;error-tolerant design;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary computation;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;iteration;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;online and offline;optimization problem;sensor;simulation;software propagation;state-space representation;theory	Demetrios G.

The proposed approach aims at retaining system stability in the presence of model uncertainties, actuator faults, parameter variations, and neglected nonlinear effects. The design is based on a realistic model that includes road uncertainties, disturbances, and faults. The design begins by dividing the system into two subsystems: a first subsystem with 3 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) representing the chassis and a second subsystem with 4 DoF representing the wheels, electrohydraulic actuators, and effect of road disturbances and actuator faults. Based on the analysis of the system performance, the first subsystem is considered as the internal dynamic of the whole system for control design purposes. The proposed algorithm is implemented in two stages to provide a stability guaranteed approach. A robust optimal sliding mode controller is designed first for the uncertain internal dynamics of the system to mitigate the effect of road disturbances. Then, a robust sliding mode controller is proposed to handle actuator faults and ensure overall stability of the whole system. The proposed approach has been tested on a 7-DoF full car model subject to uncertainties and actuator faults. The results are compared with the ones obtained using H∞ approach. The proposed approach optimizes riding comfort and road holding ability even in the presence of actuator faults and parameter variations.	algorithm;chassis;fault tolerance;nonlinear system;optimizing compiler;software bug;wheels	Morteza Moradi;Afef Fekih	2015	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2014.2357341	robust control;structural engineering;control engineering;fault tolerance;von neumann stability analysis;uncertainty;engineering;control reconfiguration;control theory;mathematics;statistics;robustness;actuator	Robotics	65.70262645523947	-8.297950469724176	8318

While previous work employed costly ray tracing or complex polynomial expressions, we present a coarser, but also significantly faster solution. Our method is based on a first-order approximation of the ray transfer in an optical system, which allows us to derive a matrix that maps lens flare-producing light rays directly to the sensor. The resulting approach is easy to implement and produces physically-plausible images at high framerates on standard off-the-shelf graphics hardware.	computation;first-order reduction;graphics hardware;map;matrix multiplication;order of approximation;polynomial;ray (optics);ray tracing (graphics);real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;software propagation;time stretch analog-to-digital converter	Sungkil Lee;Elmar Eisemann	2013	Comput.

As a natural extension of the recent development on control vector Lyapunov functions, the notion of output control vector Lyapunov function (OCVLF) is introduced for investigating decentralized measurement feedback stabilization problems. Sufficient conditions on (local) stabilizability are discussed which are based on the proposed notion of OCVLF. It is shown that a decentralized controller for a nonlinear interconnected system can be constructed using these conditions under an additional vector dissipation-like condition. To illustrate the proposed method, two examples are given.	block cipher mode of operation;distributed control system;feedback;hilbert–huang transform;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;type system	Dabo Xu;Valery A.

310f2f47dd321131678f5582d6c351ed0597c35b	filtered medial surface based approach for 3d collision-free path planning problem		This paper introduces an original 3D path planning approach for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications. More specifically, the core idea is to generate a smooth and collision-free path with respect to the vehicle dimension. Given a 3D grid representation of the environment, the Generalized Voronoi Graph (GVG) is first approximated using a filtered medial surface (FMS) algorithm on the corresponding navigable space. Based on an efficient pruning criterion, the produced FMS excludes GVG portions corresponding to narrow passages unfitting safe UAV navigation constraints, and thus it defines a set of guaranteed safe trajectories within the environment. Given a set of starting and destination coordinates, an adaptedA-star algorithm is then applied to compute the shortest path on the FMS. Finally, an optimization process ensures the smoothness of the final path by fitting a set of 3D Bézier curves to the initial path. For a comparative study, theA-star algorithm is applied directly on the input environment representation and relevant comparative criteria are defined to assert the proposed approach using simulation results.

The arbitrarily broken pieces must be reassembled and new material often added to complete the process of shape reconstruction. To prevent physical damage of the pieces during reconstruction and enhance shape visualization scientists have begun to exploit 3D data acquisition and graphical modeling tools. An algorithm for enabling free-form shape reconstruction from digitized data of fragmented pieces is described in this paper. The method exploits the topological structure and learning algorithm of a 3D self-organizing feature map (SOFM). The lattice of the SOFM is a spherical mesh that maintains the relative connectivity of the neighboring nodes as it transforms under external forces. The weight nodes of the lattice represent vertices of the constituent elements in the facetted surface model.

To get more robust and accuracy prediction under different serving conditions, this paper presents a new prediction method. The proposed method establishes two equivalent forms of the dynamic model of flying ball, where the discrete form for state estimation and the continuous form for trajectory prediction. The two forms share the same parameters’ value. According to force analysis, It is found that the model parameters are deeply related to ball’s state (position, velocity) . So we train the model parameters offline respect to ball’s state, instead of setting them to a constant value. This enables the model to be adapted accordingly online. Experimental results show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method for the ball with different velocities.	algorithm;experiment;mathematical model;online and offline;ping-pong scheme;robot;velocity (software development)	Yifeng Zhang;Rong Xiong;Yongsheng Zhao;Jian Chu	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33503-7_44	control engineering;simulation;computer science;adaptive behavior;control theory	Robotics	61.85694170891092	-14.22253518458161	8374

The target considered is a homogeneous monolayer. The Monte Carlo technique used is based on the program TRIM 151, [6]. The first method relies on the fact that some calculated data can he used more than once. The second method relies on the fact that a point source results in a rotation-symmetric ion distribution. To study the behavior of the two methods a smoothness indicator has been defined. It is a measure for the distance of a simulation result to the ideal result, i.e., the result based on an infinite number of ion trajectories. This indicator showed that a CPU time reduction of a factor 80 has been achieved.	central processing unit;ion implantation;monte carlo method;simulation	Eddie van Schie;Jan Middelhoek	1989	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/43.21829	dynamic monte carlo method;simulation;hybrid monte carlo;markov chain monte carlo;monte carlo molecular modeling;mathematics;kinetic monte carlo;monte carlo integration;statistics;monte carlo method	HPC	89.53464332665207	-8.889674571520521	8386

This ESC algorithm consists of an upper level controller and a lower level controller. The upper level controller calculates the desired yaw moment for satisfying the driver's intention. The lateral dynamic model can be more accurate by getting rid of the uncertainties caused by complex tire model. In the lower level controller, the individual braking forces are determined by the optimal strategy.

1df601e8562b5e35fda89d837030ecce0f83771d	conductive filament formation at grain boundary locations in polycrystalline hfo2 -based mim stacks: computational and physical insight		Resistive switching in high-κ (HK) dielectric based metal-insulator-metal (MIM) devices occurs locally and is accompanied by dynamic changes in the structural and electrical properties of the HK dielectric. In polycrystalline HfO 2  HK dielectric based MIM devices, grain boundaries (GBs) play a significant role in the formation of a percolation path for the resistive switching as the GB regions contain a large number of defects and favor the formation of conductive/low resistive paths. In this work, we present a multi-physics based combined Kinetic Monte Carlo-Finite element model (KMC-FEM) 3D percolation framework to simulate the resistive switching (high resistive state (HRS) to low resistive state (LRS)) process in TiN/HfO 2  (5 nm)/Pt MIM stacks. The KMC-FEM model describes the effect of GBs on the formation of conductive path during the HRS to LRS resistive switching. In addition, this model is used to find the statistical distribution of conductive filament/path formation in amorphous and polycrystalline HfO 2  dielectrics. Conductive atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations on the characteristics of the HfO 2  dielectrics at the nanometer scale complement the simulation results. The results clearly show that the HRS to LRS resistive switching occurs preferably at the GB regions in polycrystalline HfO 2  and at random locations in amorphous HfO 2  -based MIM stacks.	computation	Kalya Shubhakar;Sen Mei;Michel Bosman;Nagarajan Raghavan;Alok Ranjan;Sean J.

More specifically, we comment on the use of Chemical Force Microscopy (CFM) to study various aspects of architectural and chemical design details of specific molecules and polymers and its influence on the control of chemical interactions between the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) tip and the sample. This technique is based on the fabrication of nanomechanical cantilever sensors (NCS) and microcantilever-based biosensors (MC-B), which can provide, depending on the application, rapid, sensitive, simple and low-cost in situ detection. Besides, it can provide high repeatability and reproducibility. Here, we review the applications of CFM through some application examples which should function as methodological questions to understand and transform this tool into a reliable source of data. This section is followed by a description of the theoretical principle and usage of the functionalized NCS and MC-B technique in several fields, such as agriculture, biotechnology and immunoassay. Finally, we hope this review will help the reader to appreciate how important the tools CFM, NCS and MC-B are for characterization and understanding of systems on the atomic scale.	adhesives;atomic-force microscopy;attempt;biosensors;decompression sickness;gnu nano;interaction;microscopy, atomic force;network computing system;repeatability;selectivity (electronic);surface chemistry;zinostatin;analyte;sensor (device)	Clarice Steffens;Fabio L.

In this study, we introduce a few techniques for formation of hydrogel membranes in microfluidic channels and their applications. First, using enzymatically crosslinkable hydrogels and microfluidic techniques, we realize the width-controllable hydrogel membrane, which was difficult to adjust so far. Second, we suggest a simple one step stamping method for the in-situ formation of hydrogel membranes with various patterns and closed loop shapes. Finally, as the applications of hydrogel membrane, we proposed a multiple directional chemical gradients method, which mimics the real cell environments. Using the proposed membrane formation method, the stable multiple chemical generation was established and the chemotactic response of bacteria was successfully monitored. These results suggest that our suggested systems can be used to understand many cellular activity including cell adhesion and migration directed by chemotaxis or complex diffusions from biological fluids in three dimensional microstructures.	gradient	Eunpyo Choi;Hyung-Kwan Chang;Indong Jun;Kyung Min Park;Heungsoo Shin;Ki Dong Park;Jungyul Park	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181566	chemical industry;microfluidics;microchannel;fluorescence;membrane;nanotechnology;self-healing hydrogels;tissue engineering;microorganism;silicon	Robotics	94.7314172483159	-16.19996134683987	8431

PDAC is based on the following concept which Grizzle et al. (2001, 2004) used previously: 1) point-contact 2) interlocking. Point-contact means that the contact state between a robot and the ground is made point. This makes it possible to control based on the robot inherent dynamics although the control becomes difficult. We present the new approach using this concept to describe the robot dynamics as a 1-DOF autonomous system. By means of PDAC, stable 3-dimensional walking based on the robot inherent dynamics is realized.	apple electric car project;automatic control;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);lateral thinking;mobile robot;velocity (software development)	Masahiro Doi;Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Toshio Fukuda	2004	4th IEEE/RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2004.	10.1109/ICHR.2004.1442687	mobile robot;simulation;stability;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;social robot;control theory;robot control	Robotics	66.2302590831521	-23.16998560782977	8434

The fuzzy controller has been optimized by means of a Genetic Algorithm and implemented using a dedicated hardware device. After a preliminary study on a quarter car, a seven degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) model was implemented and used for controller simulation and optimization. The proposed control system takes the vehicle heave into account, improving the opposing requirements of comfort and drivability. The following conditions were optimized: drivability over random test roads, sine-wave holes, and sleeper-plates at different speeds. Fuzzy control makes it possible to change the characteristic parameters of the sky-hook suspension in an optimal way according to the different road conditions. The number of fuzzy controller inputs is kept as small as possible, avoiding the use of expensive sensors that increase the overall cost of the system. The proposed system is also easily applicable to existing commercial suspension systems. In addition to the comfort features, the fuzzy controller allows a reduction in load fluctuation, abnormal behavior and tire consumption.	fuzzy control system;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;quantum fluctuation;requirement;sensor;simulation;sleeper;soft computing	Riccardo Caponetto;Olga Diamante;Giovanna Fargione;Antonino Risitano;Domenico Tringali	2003	IEEE Trans.

The optimal MPC control law for constrained linear quadratic regulator (LQR) systems is piecewise affine on polytopes. However, computing this optimal control law becomes computationally intractable for large problems, and motivates the application of reinforcement learning techniques using neural networks with rectified linear units. We introduce a modified reinforcement learning policy gradient algorithm that utilizes knowledge of the system model to efficiently train the neural network. We guarantee that the network generates feasible control inputs by projecting onto polytope regions derived from the maximal control invariant set of the system. Finally, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the characteristics and performance of our algorithm.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;computational complexity theory;constraint satisfaction;convex function;gradient;linear system;maxima and minima;maximal set;neural network software;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical stability;optimal control;rectifier (neural networks);reinforcement learning;simulation	Steven W.

The motion characteristics of the mechanism was simulated and analysed in the COSMOSMotion based on the simplfied model of the 3-D model. The simulation results show that the motion law of the active oscillating rod is just opposite with the passive oscillating rod and the velocity curve of the active oscillating rod is not smooth at all with large fluctution at the maximum and minimum values. Optimization of the cam profile curve is needed to enhance the oscillating mechanism's kinematic accuracy and improve the properties of the polishing head.	3d modeling;maxima and minima;simulation;solidworks;velocity (software development);wang tile	Junpeng Shao;Mingshan Chi;Yanqin Zhang;Bin Xu	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023233	structural engineering;control engineering;engineering;vibration;oscillation;engineering drawing;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	75.48937489932052	-19.985187502300626	8513

Although the theory is general, the target application of the paper concerns ocean wave energy harvesting. The control technique involves the use of a causal discrete-time feedback algorithm to dynamically optimize the power extracted from the waves. The theory assumes that the input impedance of the converter is known precisely, but that a priori models are unavailable for the characterization of the stochastic behavior of the waves, as well as their hydrodynamic excitation of the system. For these assumptions, we develop an adaptive control technique, which iteratively re-optimizes the feedback law for the controller based on recursive subspace identification of the stochastic disturbance dynamics. The technique is demonstrated on a simulation example pertaining to a cylindrical surface-floating wave energy converter in heave.	algorithm;causal filter;characteristic impedance;embedded system;input impedance;optimal control;recursion;simulation;stationary process;stochastic control;wireless experimental centre	J.

A key to the utility of volumetric ultrasound imaging is the ability to produce high quality displays of the target in real time as data is acquired. We propose a rendering technique that enables volumetric visualization of data with arbitrary geometry at real time rates. An image is generated by blending a set of slices of the volume data orthogonal to the viewing direction. Each sample in each slice is assigned a color and transparency as a function of the nearest voxel data. Finding the voxel associated with each pixel is accomplished efficiently using a precalculated volume look-up table, which converts from the Cartesian viewing coordinate system to the arbitrary (typically spherical) coordinate system of the volume data. The volume rendering technique uses off the shelf hardware and is shown to be fast and flexible.	alpha compositing;cartesian closed category;display resolution;lookup table;medical ultrasound;pixel;real-time locating system;rendering (computer graphics);viewing cone;volume rendering;volumetric display;volumetric lighting;voxel	Gregory Bredthauer;Olaf von Ramm	2004	2004 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: Nano to Macro (IEEE Cat No. 04EX821)		computer vision;tiled rendering;scientific visualization;image-based modeling and rendering;lookup table;3d rendering;rendering;computer science;coordinate system;parallel rendering;mathematics;multimedia;real-time rendering;texture memory;alternate frame rendering;volume rendering;data visualization;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	67.83932688526993	-50.93864329686941	8537

By means of retarded differential inclusions theory and the fixed point theorem of multi-valued maps, the existence of periodic solutions for the neural networks is obtained. After that, we derive some sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability and convergence of the neural networks, in terms of nonsmooth analysis theory with generalized Lyapunov approach. Without assuming the boundedness (or the growth condition) and monotonicity of the discontinuous neuron activation functions, our results will also be valid. Moreover, our results extend previous works not only on discrete time-varying and distributed delayed neural networks with continuous or even Lipschitz continuous activations, but also on discrete time-varying and distributed delayed neural networks with discontinuous activations. We give some numerical examples to show the applicability and effectiveness of our main results.

Under some conditions, discrete-time PWA systems can be transferred into their equivalent state dependent nonlinear systems form. The equivalent state dependent systems that include reference and disturbances models are very general. The process is assumed to include common delays in input or output channels of magnitude k. Then the NGMV control strategy [16] can be applied. The NGMV controller is related to a well-known and accepted solution for time delay systems but has the advantage that it can stabilize open-loop unstable processes [17].	affine scaling;algorithm;broadcast delay;control theory;hybrid system;nonlinear system;picasa web albums	Yan Pang;Michael J.

The method exploits a priori information about speech and noise spectral shapes stored in trained codebooks, parameterized as linear predictive coefficients. The method also uses information about noise statistics estimated from the noisy observation. Maximum-likelihood estimates of the speech and noise short-term predictor parameters are obtained by searching for the combination of codebook entries that optimizes the likelihood. The estimation involves the computation of the excitation variances of the speech and noise auto-regressive models on a frame-by-frame basis, using the a priori information and the noisy observation. The high computational complexity resulting from a full search of the joint speech and noise codebooks is avoided through an iterative optimization procedure. We introduce a classified noise codebook scheme that uses different noise codebooks for different noise types. Experimental results show that the use of a priori information and the calculation of the instantaneous speech and noise excitation variances on a frame-by-frame basis result in good performance in both stationary and nonstationary noise conditions.	autoregressive model;codebook;coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;enhanced variable rate codec;estimation theory;experiment;hausdorff measure;itakura–saito distance;iterative method;kerrison predictor;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;noise generator;scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;speech enhancement;stationary process;waveform;zero suppression	Sriram Srinivasan;Jonas Samuelsson;W.

Firstly, the kinematics and dynamics of free-floating dual-arm space robot system with two objects are analysed. In order to overcome the difficulty that the dynamic equations of the system are nonlinearly dependent on inertial parameters, the system is modeled as under-actuated robot system, and the idea of augmentation approach is adopted. It is demonstrated that the dynamic equations of the system can be linearly dependent on a group of inertial parameters with augmented inputs and outputs. And then based on the above results, the robust control scheme for dual-arm space robot system with uncertain inertial parameters to track the desired trajectories in joint space is proposed. The proposed control scheme is computationally simple, because we guarantee the controller robust to the uncertain inertial parameters rather than explicitly estimating them online. In addition to this, it need not require controlling the position and attitude of the floating base. Finally, a planar free-floating dual-arm space robot system with two objects is simulated to verify the proposed control scheme	nonlinear system;robot;robust control;time-scale calculus	Yishen Guo;Li Chen	2006	2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2006.282598	robust control;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	67.25806261966859	-19.563838573721608	8579

The new images that are generated this way correspond to a new projection model defined by two slits, termed here the Crossed-Slits (X-Slits) projection. In this projection model, every 3D point is projected by a ray defined as the line that passes through that point and intersects the two slits. The intersection of the projection rays with the imaging surface defines the image. X-Slits mosaicing provides two benefits. First, the generated mosaics are closer to perspective images than traditional pushbroom mosaics. Second, by simple manipulationsof the strip sampling function,wecanchange the locationof oneof the virtual slits, providingavirtualwalkthroughof aX-slits camera; all this can be done without recovering any 3D geometry and without calibration.

For core devices with floating body, the 2nd peak of the front-gate transconductance (gm) degrades with incremental TID. Moreover, the 1st and 2nd peak of the drain current (Ids) hysteresis also declines due to the increased recombination current at the back-gate interface after irradiation. The front-gate subthreshold hump effect is more obvious under the OFF (off-state) and TG (transmission gate) bias conditions. By contrast, the back-gate subthreshold hump exhibits a maximum negative shift under the ON (on-state) bias condition and causes the most significant hump effect owing to the largest charge accumulation at the bottom of the shallow trench isolation (STI) oxide. The maximum negative shift of the back-gate threshold voltage is observed under the TG bias condition, leading to the coupling effect. Finally, for narrow-channel devices, it is found that the radiation-induced positive trapped charge in the STI oxide will degrade the electron mobility in the front-gate channel region, leading to a gm decrease because of the increased surface roughness scattering. & 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The cockroach escape circuit is shown to be an excellent source of inspiration for the development of a collision avoidance system. The crash avoidance system is implemented in an artificial neural network which is trained off-line, but then is shown to produce real-time performance. A collision avoidance scheme which makes use of a crash alarm strategy is developed for training the neural network. A dynamic model of a four-wheeled vehicle with front wheel steering and realistic performance constraints is used to test the crash avoidance system. Simulation results show that the well-trained neural network causes successful, reflexive crash avoidance behaviors in a dynamic environment without a priori information.	artificial neural network;artificial neuron;mathematical model;online and offline;real-time transcription;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Chun-Ta Chen;Roger D.

Camera calibration is a process which accurately models this relationship. The calibration procedure determines the geometric parameters of the camera, such as focal length and center of the image. Most of the existing calibration techniques use predefined patterns and a static camera. Recently, a novel calibration technique for computing the focal length and image center, which uses an active camera, has been developed. This technique does not require any predefined patterns or point-to-point correspondence between images-only a set of scenes with some stable edges. It was observed that the algorithms developed for the image center are sensitive to noise and hence unreliable in real situations. This report extends the techniques provided to develop a simpler, yet more robust method for computing the image center.	algorithm;calibration;camera resectioning;computation (action);focal (programming language);point-to-point protocol	Anup Basu;Kavita Ravi	1995	IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics.

Different from single function inertial switches for only converting circuit states, a wireless inertial microswitch incorporating the bistable flexible mechanism was designed and fabricated using multilayered microelectroforming technology, which can be used for remote detection of both the threshold acceleration and the corresponding response time in severe environments. The threshold snap-through characteristic of the nonlinear bistable mechanism has been introduced to achieve the threshold acceleration sensing capability. The switch mainly consists of one wireless module, one proof mass supported by two pairs of ultralong V-shaped slender beams with the dimension of 28.0~μ m × 25.0 μm × 5150.0 μm, and two contact points for recording triggering times through the high speed sending and receiving wireless module. Then, an accurate design model for analyzing the threshold acceleration and the dynamic response time was established. The 20 repeated experimental results are in good agreement under the same triggering threshold acceleration of 32.38 g, in which, the response time with the traveling distance of 530.0~μm is 179.80 ± 0.20 ms.	bistability;experiment;hardware acceleration;mathematical model;microelectromechanical systems;network switch;nonlinear system;response time (technology);responsiveness;sensor	Jian Zhao;Pengbo Liu;Zhenan Tang;Kefeng Fan;Xiaosong Ma;Renjing Gao;Jiading Bao	2014	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2014.2327483	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;bistability	Mobile	91.06669316455414	-20.798464992471697	8685

The teleoperation system with uncertainties is modeled as a linear parameter varying plant to employ the gain-scheduling control framework. The time-varying transmission delay, disturbances, and uncertainty of the environment are considered in the design of the control. The usual assumption that the human operator and the environment are passive is not made in this method. The control scheme employs an online estimation of the environment including disturbance and transmission time delay between master and slave. Simulation results show that position and force tracking errors are small, and the system shows stable behavior in spite of the uncertainties. A transparency analysis in the frequency domain shows that the developed control scheme guarantees perfect transparency in the low frequencies.	broadcast delay;coefficient;human–computer interaction;molecular dynamics;robust control;scheduling (computing);simulation	Jang Ho Cho;Doo Yong Lee	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346263	real-time computing;control system;control theory;frequency domain	Robotics	68.41763491519686	-12.982625780079609	8732

We use a local neighbourhood of size 3 × 3 × 3 and assume a voxel grid with equal resolution along two axes and lower along the third. The weights (local distances) in the local neighbourhood are optimized by minimizing the maximum error over linear trajectories, which is a completely digital approach. General solutions are presented, as well as numerical solutions for the cases when the voxels are 1.5 and 2.58 times longer in one direction. Integer solutions for both real and integer scale factors are presented. As an application example, the medial axis of an object is computed in an image with elongated voxels and compared to the medial axis computed on the same image interpolated to equal resolution along all axes.	voxel	Ida-Maria Sintorn;Gunilla Borgefors	2002		10.1007/3-540-45986-3_22	scale factor;stereoscopy;computer vision;neighbourhood;medial axis;binary image;computer science;trajectory;mathematics;geometry;distance transform;voxel;image scaling	Vision	67.02143035303318	-43.12680017793389	8741

Based on the deformable characteristic of the clothes, the tension force of clothes is analyzed and the model of tension degree is established. A clothes climbing robot called Clothbot is composed of a two-wheeled gripper and a 2 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) tail. Based on the locomotion of this robot, the weights of tension degree and the locomotion characteristic are added into the A* algorithm. Combined with the two weights applied, the optimal path to the target for the Clothbot is obtained. The Clothbot has been developed to evaluate the algorithm. The simulation and the experiments have verified the feasibility of this method. In addition, The error state of the movement of the robot which is called side tumbling has been corrected by the motion of the 2-DOF tail.	a* search algorithm;effective method;experiment;motion planning;robot end effector;simulation	Yuanyuan Liu;Xinyu Wu;Dezhen Song;Ruiqing Fu;Duan Zheng;Yangsheng Xu	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385673	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;clothing;motion planning;robot control	Robotics	70.65321315990926	-23.008597992598588	8753

It is assumed that the stability conditions are represented by some inequalities in the form of a p-dimensional fuzzy summation. To investigate the system stability, the inequalities are expanded to n-dimensional fuzzy summation (n ges p). The boundary and regional informations of membership functions are then utilized for relaxation of stability analysis results. Two analysis approaches are proposed in this paper. The first approach is called the global-membership-function-shape-dependent approach, in which the lower and upper bounds of the membership functions, and its products from 2 to n in the full operating domain, are considered in the stability analysis. The second approach is named as the regional-membership-function-shape-dependent approach in which the operating region is partitioned to subregions, and the boundary information of membership functions on each operating subregion is employed to facilitate the stability analysis. In both approaches, by the help of the boundary and/or regional information of the membership functions, some inequality constraints in the form of multidimensional fuzzy summation containing some slack matrices are constructed. Stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability conditions.	fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;linear programming relaxation;membership function (mathematics);numerical method;race condition;slack variable;social inequality	Mohammad Narimani;Hak Keung Lam	2009	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2025959	mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;stability;membership function;multidimensional systems;linear matrix inequality;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;fuzzy control system;dependence analysis	Embedded	67.60848518716084	-0.33156980977456296	8754

New sufficient conditions for the solvability of the regulation problem are presented. For computational solution of the regulation problem, a linear programming approach is proposed where the constraints are given by the solvability conditions and the performance index represents a guaranteed trade-off between the closed-loop stability margin and the level of control effort.	polyhedron	Basílio E.

A simulated character has the potential to adapt to changing terrain and disturbances in a realistic and robust manner. In this paper, we present a balancing control algorithm based on a simplified dynamic model, an inverted pendulum on a cart. The simplified model lacks the degrees of freedom found in a full human model, so we analyze a captured reference motion in a preprocessing step and use that information about human running patterns to supplement the balance algorithms provided by the inverted pendulum controller. At run-time, the controller plans a desired motion at every frame based on the current estimate of the pendulum state and a predicted pendulum trajectory. By tracking this time-varying trajectory, our controller creates a running character that dynamically balances, changes speed and makes turns. The initial controller can be optimized to further improve the motion quality with an objective function that minimizes the difference between a planned desired motion and a simulated motion. We demonstrate the power of this approach by generating running motions at a variety of speeds (3 m/s to 5m/s), following a curved path, and in the presence of disturbance forces and a skipping motion.	algorithm;control system;dynamical simulation;inverted pendulum;loss function;mathematical model;motion capture;optimization problem;preprocessor	Taesoo Kwon;Jessica K.

Any intermediate image during the morph is homeomorphic to the initial image and the morphing process is a homotopy. The method permits points, line-segments, and polygons to be included as features in the image. Our method is based on time-varying triangulation, that is, triangulation changes as features move. Accordingly, the deformation mapping is updated locally for the part for which the triangulation changes. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and the complexity of the algorithm is analyzed.	algorithm;aliasing;image warping;morphing	Kikuo Fujimura;Mihail Makarov	1998	Graphical Models and Image Processing	10.1006/gmip.1998.0454	image warping;feature detection;topology;image processing;interpolation;computer science;mathematics;geometry;algorithm	Robotics	66.48943275501342	-41.0218109698682	8779

Generalized sampled-data hold functions (GSHF) are used as local controllers to place the modes of the equivalent discrete-time closed-loop system in the desired locations in the z-plane. These locations are assumed to be obtained by using a proper mapping from the continuous-time domain. The GSHFs are obtained one at a time, in a sequential fashion. In other words, each local controller is designed for the equivalent discrete-time closed-loop model associated with the previously designed controllers. While no bound is provided on the intersample ripple, the convergence of the samples to zero ensures that the intersample values will also approach zero as time increases. The main characteristic of the proposed method is that unlike conventional pole-placement algorithms, the design complexity here does not increase after each local controller is obtained. A numerical example is provided which confirms the efficacy of the proposed pole-placement technique.	algorithm;control engineering;design for manufacturability;distributed control system;linear time-invariant theory;numerical analysis;optimal control;placement (eda);ripple effect;scalability;time complexity;time-invariant system	Mani M.

Such metrics, while appropriate for Gaussian-distributed waveforms, are of limited value in the more complex sound environments encountered in industrial/military settings that have nonGaussian and nonstationary-distributed waveforms. Recent research has shown that metrics incorporating the temporal characteristics of a waveform are needed to evaluate hazardous acoustic environments for purposes of hearing conservation. The joint peak-interval histogram is a prospective candidate for use in such an application. This paper shows that the joint peakinterval histogram can be obtained from an estimation of the temporal pattern of a complex noise waveform by using higherorder cumulant-based inverse filtering.	acoustic cryptanalysis;image histogram;inverse filter;prospective search;waveform	Sheau-Fang Lei;Roger P.

This article aims to theoretically investigate the nonlinear jumping phenomena and bifurcation conditions of a class of electrostatically-driven MEMS actuators with a time-delay feedback controller. Considering the comb structure consisting of a flexible beam and shuttle mass, the partial differential governing equation is obtained with both the linear and cubic nonlinear parametric excitation. Then, the method of multiple scales is introduced to obtain a slow flow that is analyzed for stability and bifurcation. Results show that time-delay feedback can improve resonance frequency and stability of the system. What is more, through a detailed mathematical analysis, the discriminant of Hopf bifurcation is theoretically derived, and appropriate time-delay feedback force can make the branch from the Hopf bifurcation point stable under any driving voltage value. Meanwhile, through global bifurcation analysis and saddle node bifurcation analysis, theoretical expressions about the system parameter space and maximum amplitude of monostable vibration are deduced. It is found that the disappearance of the global bifurcation point means the emergence of monostable vibration. Finally, detailed numerical results confirm the analytical prediction.	actuator device component;anatomic node;anatomic bifurcation;behavior;bifurcation (procedure);bifurcation theory;control theory;controllers;cubic function;discriminant;emergence;excitation;hopf bifurcation;mathematics;microelectromechanical systems;monostable;nonlinear dynamics;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical stability;population parameter;resonance;voltage	Lei Li;Qichang Zhang;Wei Wang;Jianxin Han	2016		10.3390/mi7100177	control engineering;electronic engineering;biological applications of bifurcation theory;control theory;bifurcation theory;saddle-node bifurcation;parametric oscillator;physics;bifurcation diagram	Robotics	79.42812854569553	3.0893224842348816	8905

We present a novel system based on a robot manipulator, which is used to support a UAV in the last, most challenging, landing phase. In this phase, the aerial vehicle is connected to the robot by means of a universal hinge. This allows to decouple the UAV's orientation from the robot's end-effector orientation. The main contribution of the paper is a new control approach for the whole system composed of a VTOL UAV and a manipulator. A combination of a backstepping controller accounting for the UAV's dynamics with an impedance controller for the manipulator is used for coordinated control of the whole system. The proposed approach allows to independently control position and orientation of a VTOL UAV, whereby an arbitrary stable attitude controller can be used for the flying vehicle. The advantage of the presented approach is that the interaction forces between robot and UAV are taken into account explicitly and that a Lyapunov stability proof for the UAV subsystem can be derived directly. Robustness and performance of the control approach are investigated in simulation and experiments. The experimental results for an AR.Drone quadrotor and a DLR/KUKA light-weight robot with seven degrees-of-freedom are presented in the paper.	aerial photography;characteristic impedance;control theory;dynamic language runtime;experiment;human–computer interaction;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;parrot ar.drone;robot end effector;robustness (computer science);simulation;stationary process;unmanned aerial vehicle	Moritz Maier;Konstantin Kondak	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402422	control engineering;simulation;backstepping;engineering;electrical impedance;control theory;robot control;attitude control;robot kinematics	Robotics	65.2368494031916	-16.287924893540723	8910

The main contribution of this paper concerns criteria for obtaining optimal inputs in this context. Two input design criteria are proposed and analyzed. They involve sensitivity functions. The first criterion requires the inversion of the Gram matrix of sensitivity functions. The second one does not require this inversion and is then applied for parameter estimation of a model taken from the aeronautical domain. The estimation results obtained using an optimal input are compared with those obtained with an input optimized in a more classical context (Gaussian measurement noise and parameters a priori known to belong to some boxes). These results highlight the potential of optimal input design in a bounded-error context.	dynamical system;estimation theory;nonlinear system	Carine Jauberthie;Lilianne Denis-Vidal;Qiaochu Li;Zohra Cherfi-Boulanger	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.03.003	mathematical optimization;dynamical systems theory;design of experiments;parametrization;control theory;nonlinear system;interval arithmetic;gaussian;bounded function;estimation theory;mathematics	EDA	60.038525252930704	2.83802485555841	8911

According to previous research, the back-drivability of torsion torque control using torsion torque sensor depends on load-side friction. Therefore, the authors focus on load-side torque control. Load-side torque is estimated using load-side torque observer because load-side torque cannot be detected in this system. Using estimated load-side torque feedback, the back-drivability of the proposed method becomes infinite. The back-drivability of the three methods (i.e., P-D, I-PD, and pseudo I-PD) are compared using the simulation and experimental results. Finally, the simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.	emoticon;friction;macaca sinica;motion;parkinson disease;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;pure data;simulation;torsion (gastropod);velocity (software development);xfig	Yusuke Kawai;Yuki Yokokura;Kiyoshi Ohishi;Kotaro Saito;Atsushi Shimamoto	2016	2016 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2016.7496345	torque converter;classical mechanics;control engineering;damping torque;torque sensor;stall torque;torque steering;control theory;coupling;torque motor;direct torque control	Robotics	69.08665124975258	-17.69688153155588	8913
d3536bad7c0e251dc0925e902e927844ff2e179b	selective assembly of cyclodextrins on poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) block copolymers	poly ethylene oxide;self assembly;hydrogen bond;molecular recognition;block copolymer;higher order;poly propylene oxide;statistical distribution	This paper presents a computational study on the formation of a molecular necklace formed by specific threading of cyclodextrins (CDs) on block copolymers. Structural as well as energetic principles for the selective complexation of alpha- and beta-cyclodextrin with poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) block copolymers (PEO-PPO) are elucidated considering a diblock copolymer of equimolecular composition (PEO)4-(PPO)4 as guest. A non-statistical distribution of CDs, i.e. alpha-CDs primarily located on the PEO chain and beta-CDs on PPO blocks of the polymer, is based on a variety of structural features and energetic preferences considering both potential as well as solvation energies. This selectivity becomes already obvious considering 1:1 complexes between PEO and PPO monomers and the two CDs, but is increasingly evident when calculating higher order ensembles. Besides the host-guest interaction, docking between CDs themselves is an important, also non-statistical, prerequisite for the self-assembly of highly ordered tubes. The formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between adjacent CDs in a tubular aggregate gives an important contribution to the overall stability of the molecular necklace. The net effect, based on the preferential interaction between host and guest as well as between the host molecules themselves, results in the formation of a stable, highly ordered macromolecular, multicomponent aggregate.

An improved free-matrix-based inequality (FMBI) is derived. By using this inequality and the convex combination technique, some new delay-dependent absolute stability criteria are derived. These conditions are given in the term of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and accordingly can be readily solved and checked. Finally, a numerical example is solved using the proposed method to demonstrate the effectiveness and its improvement over existing ones.

A six degree of freedom (DOF) accelerometer with embedded data logging capability has been utilized to collect the convey or dynamic motion data from several assembly plants. This paper summarizes convey or dynamic motion data collected from several assembly plants, analyzes these dynamic motion data using simple statistical analysis to quantify the convey or motion's stability in the main direction of travel, and identify any frequency pattern of the convey or dynamic motion data with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) frequency analysis.	data logger;embedded system;fast fourier transform;frequency analysis;robotic automation software;software release life cycle	Jane Shi	2008		10.1145/1774674.1774699	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering	Robotics	76.3861108067608	-16.729576905096994	8982
1762da6fadce39f8476c8fb475a3cac78881c833	blind separation of sparse sources in the presence of outliers		5 Blind Source Separation (BSS) plays a key role to analyze multichannel data since it aims at recovering unknown underlying elementary sources from observed linear mixtures in an unsupervised way. In a large number of applications, multichannel measurements contain corrupted entries, which are highly detrimental for most BSS techniques. In this article, we introduce a 10 new robust BSS technique coined robust Adaptive Morphological Component Analysis (rAMCA). Based on sparse signal modeling, it makes profit of an alternate reweighting minimization technique that yields a robust estimation of the sources and the mixing matrix simultaneously with the removal of the spurious outliers. Numerical experiments are provided that illustrate the 15 robustness of this new algorithm with respect to aberrant outliers on a wide range of blind separation instances. In contrast to current robust BSS methods, the rAMCA algorithm is shown to perform very well when the number of observations is close or equal to the number of sources.	algorithm;blind signal separation;experiment;numerical method;source separation;sparse matrix;unsupervised learning	Cécile Chenot;Jérôme Bobin	2017	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.03.024	mathematical optimization;mathematics;robustness (computer science);spurious relationship;blind signal separation;outlier;matrix (mathematics);weighting	ML	80.33944583521415	-8.247625668532903	9004
6ba6992ef688ecdccfefd32956cef6970e83d0b3	improvement of humanoid walking control by compensating actuator elasticity		The actuators in humanoid robots inevitably have compliance in their joint mechanisms. The joint elasticity often negatively affects static and dynamic performance of the robot. In the specific case of humanoid walking, the elasticity in the actuators can create problems not only on the performance but also on the stability, which is most critical for walking. In this paper, the joint deformation is modeled and its compensation method is proposed to improve walking control performance and stability. The proposed algorithm is implemented on our humanoid robot and its performance is demonstrated by improved stability of walking.	algorithm;elasticity (cloud computing);elasticity (data store);experiment;humanoid robot;input/output;linear approximation;sensor	Jeeseop Kim;Mingon Kim;Jaeheung Park	2016	2016 IEEE-RAS 16th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2016.7803250	simulation;humanoid robot;control theory	Robotics	67.57633347957481	-18.890271288089878	9006

Due to the growing acceptance of titanium in many industries, near-nett shape of these materials by machining cannot be eliminated fully. There are problems encountered when machining titanium in shops working with aircraft alloys. Machining of titanium alloys requires cutting forces slightly higher than those needed to machine steels, but these alloys have metallurgical characteristics that make them more difficult to machine than steels of equivalent hardness. The beta alloys are the most difficult titanium alloys to machine. This paper discusses the study of metallurgical and microstructure analysis of Ti-6Al-4V alloys. Experiments were carried out using two different inserts having different coating methods (PVD and CVD) and different nose radius (0.8 mm and 1.2 mm). The performance of machining has been studied in terms of cutting force, tool wear and surface finish.	physical vapor deposition	S. Ramesh;L. Karunamoorthy;V. S. Senthilkumar;K.

708f62599708c0171cf28eb773020b1b82920f8d	parameterization of fuel-optimal synchronous approach trajectories to tumbling targets		Docking with potentially tumbling Targets is a common element of many mission architectures, including on-orbit servicing and active debris removal. This paper studies synchronized docking trajectories as a way to ensure the Chaser satellite remains on the docking axis of the tumbling Target, thereby reducing collision risks and enabling persistent onboard sensing of the docking location. Chaser satellites have limited computational power available to them and the time allowed for the determination of a fuel optimal trajectory may be limited. Consequently, parameterized trajectories that approximate the fuel optimal trajectory while following synchronous approaches may be used to provide a computationally efficient means of determining near optimal trajectories to a tumbling Target. This paper presents a method of balancing the computation cost with the added fuel expenditure required for parameterization, including the selection of a parameterization scheme, the number of parameters in the parameterization, and a means of incorporating the dynamics of a tumbling satellite into the parameterization process. Comparisons of the parameterized trajectories are made with the fuel optimal trajectory, which is computed through the numerical propagation of Euler’s equations. Additionally, various tumble types are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the presented computation scheme. With this parameterized trajectory determination method, Chaser satellites may perform terminal approach and docking maneuvers with both fuel and computational efficiency.	algorithmic efficiency;apache axis;approximation algorithm;computation;docking (molecular);euler;geosynchronous satellite;numerical analysis;numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;software propagation	David Charles Sternberg;David Miller	2018	Front.

Reliable and accurate calibration is achieved by operator-interactive camera calibration and object localization. Both rely on nonlinear least-squares algorithms combined with linear ones. Since the object pose becomes known through object localization, the computer-generated trajectory mode can be effectively used in our new approach. This newly developed calibration technique has been successfully utilized in a recent JPL/GSFC (Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Goddard Space Flight Center) telerobotic servicing demonstration. The positioning alignment accuracy achieved by this technique from four camera views was 0.51 cm on the average for a tool insertion in the servicing task. >	telerobotics;virtual reality	Won S.

Motions are recorded by a human operator, and then the data is used to model a nonlinear system, i.e., the dynamic motor primitive (DMP). In order to learn from multiple demonstrations, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are employed rather than using conventional Gaussian process for the evaluation of the non-linear term of the DMP. Then the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) algorithm is applied to generate a synthesized trajectory with smaller position errors in 3D space.

The robot consists of an arm covered with soft materials and hybrid joints, which can be put into active or passive mode as needed. In an unexpected or expected collision with human, the arising impulse force is attenuated effectively by the physical model formed with the hybrid joint and the soft material. Owing to the displacement movement of the link when the joint is passive, a recovery control algorithm has been developed for the end-effector to maintain its desired task position after the collision. Simulation and experiment results confirm that the proposed physical model is suitable for robot working in the human-robot symbiotic environment and the control method are useful for robot’s task fulfillment.	algorithm;computer simulation;control theory;displacement mapping;mobile manipulator;robot end effector;zero suppression	Zhijun Li;Aiguo Ming;Ning Xi;Zhaoxian Xie;Jiangong Gu;Makoto Shimojo	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570739	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;physical model;engineering;mobile manipulator;control theory;robot control;impact	Robotics	70.25764878596075	-24.738909583014102	9210

4faa85ec6e6b709f8e17254eb1c573ea0c31239c	glocal control for network systems via hierarchical state-space expansion		In this paper, we propose a glocal (global/local) control method for large-scale network systems. The objective of the glocal control here is to suppress global propagation of a disturbance injected at a local subsystem based on the integration of different types of controllers, called global and local controllers. For the design of global and local controllers, we construct an aggregated model and a truncated model that can, respectively, capture global average behavior and local subsystem behavior of the network system of interest. Based on state-space expansion, called hierarchical state-space expansion, we show that a cascade interconnection of the aggregated model and the truncated model can be seen as a low-dimensional approximate model of the original network system, which has good compatibility with independent design of the global and local controllers. Furthermore, we show that appropriate integration of the global and local controllers can improve control performance with respect to global propagation of local disturbance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through a numerical example of a benchmark model representing the bulk power system in the eastern half of Japan.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);interconnection;numerical analysis;simulation;software propagation;state space	Hampei Sasahara;Takayuki Ishizaki;Tomonori Sadamoto;Jun-ichi Imura;Henrik Sandberg;Karl Henrik Johansson	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264616	interconnection;electric power system;control theory;state space;benchmark (computing);control system;computer science	Robotics	61.35667907420021	3.773350038455082	9221

9cd0d1e431ef25f0b26a8f2069fc208a5a61235f	influence of transverse temperature gradient on the propagation of triple flames in porous channels		Abstract We present in this paper a numerical simulation to the problem of triple flame propagation in a porous-walls channel in the presence of a temperature gradient across the channel. The problem has been formulated using the thermo-diffusive approximation and then solved numerically using finite elements method. The study showed that temperature gradient plays a crucial role on the existence and propagation of triple flames. More precisely, the effect of temperature gradient on the flame propagation was found to: (i) cause the flame to exist only for a limited range of values of the temperature gradient parameter, (ii) establish multiplicity of solutions each of them characterizes unique combustion regimes, (iii) modifies the flame shape from the usual triple flame shape when the temperature gradient is large, and finally (iv) enhance the reactivity of the underlying mixture, but on the other hand will have serious implications on the safety of the combustion chamber.	gradient;software propagation;transverse wave	Faisal Al-Malki	2018	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2018.04.026	mathematical analysis;classical mechanics;combustion;temperature gradient;finite element method;combustion chamber;transverse plane;multiplicity (mathematics);porosity;mathematics;communication channel	ML	90.34762819000261	3.1850011635242828	9267

Among various ways of combining AC and BC microphones for speech enhancement, it is shown that the total enhancement performance can be maximized if the BC microphone is utilized for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of the desired speech signal. Considering the fact that a small deviation in the speech PSD estimation process brings severe spectral distortion, this paper focuses on controlling weighting factors while estimating the a priori SNR with the decision-directed approach framework. The time--frequency varying weighting factor that is determined by taking a minimum mean square error criterion improves the capability of eliminating residual noise and minimizing speech distortion. Since the weighting factors are also adjusted by measuring the usefulness of the AC and BC microphones, the proposed approach is suitable for tracking the parameter even if the characteristic of environment changes rapidly. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm to conventional algorithms in high noise environments.	algorithm;distortion;mean squared error;microphone;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density;speech enhancement	Ho Seon Shin;Tim Fingscheidt;Hong-Goo Kang	2015	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2015.2446202	estimation;speech recognition;acoustics;speech;mathematics;linguistics;signal-to-noise ratio;statistics	Robotics	83.18345768118436	-34.168415374793014	9268

The display consists of a 4 × 4 array of taxels, each of which can be in a raised or a lowered position, thus generating different static configurations. One of the most challenging aspects when designing densely-packed arrays of EM actuators is obtaining large actuation forces while simultaneously generating only weak interactions between neighboring taxels. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and effective magnetic shielding architecture. The moving part of each taxel is a cylindrical permanent magnet embedded in a ferromagnetic pot, forming a pot-magnet. An array of planar microcoils attracts or repels each pot-magnet. This configuration reduces the interaction between neighboring magnets by more than one order of magnitude, while the coil/magnet interaction is only reduced by 10 percent. For 4 mm diameter pins on an 8 mm pitch, we obtained displacements of 0.55 mm and forces of 40 mN using 1.7 W. We measured the accuracy of human perception under two actuation configurations which differed in the force versus displacement curve. We obtained 91 percent of correct answers in pulling configuration and 100 percent in pushing configuration.	actuation dosing unit;coil device component;diameter (qualifier value);displacement mapping;electromagnetics;embedded system;embedding;emotions;experience;greater than;haptic device component;haptic technology;interaction;magnet <device>;marijuana abuse;pack unit;percent (qualifier value);personal identification number;pitch (music);psychologic displacement;scalability;the pot calling the kettle black;tissue membrane	Juan Jose Zarate;Herbert R Shea	2017	IEEE Transactions on Haptics	10.1109/TOH.2016.2591951	magnetic flux;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;manganese;nuclear magnetic resonance;force;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	88.56522502902587	-18.39205350595795	9272

Numerically computed solutions of these models typically satisfy the first-order conditions necessary for equilibrium, but do not provide any information about the elastic stability of the solution. The inability to detect or avoid physically unstable model solutions poses a major hindrance to reliable model-based simulation, planning, design, and control. In this paper, we adapt results from optimal control to determine the stability of Kirchhoff rods and Cosserat rods subject to general end constraints, including coupled multirod models which describe parallel continuum robots. We formulate a sufficient condition for the stability of a solution, a numerical test for evaluating this condition, and a heuristic stability metric. We verify that our numerical stability test agrees with the classical results for the buckling of single columns with various end constraints and for multicolumn frames. We then validate our approach experimentally on a six degree-of-freedom parallel continuum robot.	automated planning and scheduling;buckling;column (database);control theory;elasticity (data store);experiment;first-order reduction;heuristic;kirchhoff's circuit laws;kirchhoff's theorem;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical stability;optimal control;rigs of rods;robot;simulation;triune continuum paradigm	John Till;D.

It has been observed that the temperature rise of a plastic sheet exhibits an input delay-like behavior due to heater lags and other environmental parameters. Therefore, the modified Smith predictor technique is applied to compensate for this delay, allowing for improved tunability, performance, and robustness to parameter variations in the system, compared to the existing controllers. The Watanabe-modified Smith predictor control technique is then included in the control diagram of the system, tuned, and tested on an industrial thermoforming machine simulator. The performance and robustness of the new control technique is then compared to the existing PI controllers in simulation.	diagram;display lag;input lag;kerrison predictor;simulation;smith predictor	Rahi Modirnia;Benoit Boulet	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;temperature;temperature measurement;engineering;plastic;control theory;thermoforming;model predictive control;mechanical engineering	Robotics	57.74813982787033	-7.508334581281674	9319

Kalman filters are optimal state estimators in that they minimize the estimation error variance for given measurements. The focus of this paper is the achievement of additional minimization of the error variance by also optimizing over the sensor design. The optimal sensor design problem is thus incorporated into the estimation problem. Not only the sensor location but also other factors such as sensor shape and the effect of the sensors on system dynamics are included in the optimization criteria. The problem is first stated formally, and then it is shown to be well-posed and to possess an optimal solution. Applications to a one-dimensional diffusion equation and also to a two-dimensional wave equation are given. A computational framework for calculation of optimal shape is described.	approximation algorithm;computation;filter design;kalman filter;linear system;mathematical optimization;order of approximation;sensor;steady state;system dynamics;well-posed problem;whole earth 'lectronic link	Shu-Xia Tang;Kirsten A.

fcb62c27529aa53dedeb6979d532f7e6a67cdfc7	topological analysis of electron density in depleted homopolar chemical bonds	electron density;electron localization function	Except for the case of van der Waals interactions, homopolar bonds are covalent and therefore a concentration of the electron density is expected at the bond midpoint. Many experimental and theoretical studies have reported standard deformation density maps and molecular density minus spherical atoms densities, which show a depletion of electron density between formally covalently bonded atoms. For example, electron deficits are found in the theoretical map of the FF bond in F2, in the experimental map of the NN bond in carbonohydrazide, and in the experimental and theoretical maps of the OO bond in 1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11-tetraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane. Other partitioning schemes, such as subtraction of valence state atoms rather than spherical atoms from the total density, have been proposed to interpret these unexpected features. In the present work we examine these electronically depleted covalent bonds on the basis of the topological analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) of theoretically calculated electron densities. The attractors of ELF determine basins that are either core or valence basins. The valence basins are characterized by the number of core basins with which they share a common boundary, and this number is called the synaptic order. Disynaptic valence basins have been found for the FF bond in F2, for the NN bond in carbonohydrazide and for the OO bond in 1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11- tetraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane. In the case of F2, polarization functions increase the V(F, F′) basin population, whereas accounting for the Coulomb correlation lowers this basin population. The results calculated for F2 are compared with those obtained for other diatomic molecules, such as N2 and O2, and the ELF picture of the bond compared with the molecular orbital analysis. In the case of carbonohydrazyde, the V(N, N′) basin population is the lowest among all the populations of the disynaptic valence basins present in the molecule, in good agreement with the experimental observations. Analogous results are obtained for the V(O, O′) basin population in 1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11- tetraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane. Population fluctuation analysis indicates a strong delocalization of the electron density toward lone pairs and adjacent bonds. ©1999 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 20: 1517–1526, 1999	electron	Rosa Llusar;Armando Beltrán;Juan Andrés;Stéphane Noury;Bernard Silvi	1999	Journal of Computational Chemistry	10.1002/(SICI)1096-987X(19991115)20:14%3C1517::AID-JCC4%3E3.0.CO;2-	atomic physics;chemistry;electron localization function;computational chemistry;physics;electron density	Comp.	97.5272779236507	-5.620276929021952	9352

For this purpose, a study is described, during which participants drove through a course consisting of 14 sub-sections. The predictive validity of the participants' wheelchair driving behavior on their precision, tremor, wrist-finger velocity, arm-hand velocity and aiming capability was analyzed. The results demonstrate impressively (1) that some course sections can better be used in order to derive variables allowing a reasoning on the users' motor ability level than other sections and (2) that especially the precision ability can be predicted e.g. on the basis of the distances driven in the forward mode. Implications on how an adaptive assistance system for powered wheelchair could be implemented are discussed as is the impact of such a system on the wheelchair market.	velocity (software development)	Meike Jipp;Christian Bartolein;Essameddin Badreddin	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346347	embedded system;simulation;predictive validity;adaptive control;computer science;artificial intelligence;automation;control theory;accuracy and precision;software testing;correlation;model predictive control;statistics	Robotics	69.0466083454974	-26.457968610878474	9356

It improves on previous Path Following Control (PFC) methods by minimising large excursions of the tractor unit. A preview distance is integrated into the MSPC algorithm to predict future vehicle states and feed them back into the control system to compensate state errors. The relationship between the length of preview distance and maximum lateral offsets is investigated, which can be used to optimise the preview distance. The relationship between maximum lateral offsets and the corresponding weights in the control cost function is also established in this preliminary study.	algorithm;autonomous robot;consortium;control system;control theory;lateral thinking;loss function;powerbuilder foundation classes;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering	Xuanzuo Liu;David Cebon	2018	2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2018.8500417	control theory;reversing;axle;tractor;computer science;control system	Robotics	66.3253720123711	-18.811337605586676	9377

Transmission scheduling of the control inputs has to be performed so that only one input signal is transmitted through the channel at one time. We aim at finding the minimum channel capacity rendering state feedback stabilization possible. The main novelty of this work lies in the idea of scheduling/control co-design which suggests that the transmission scheduling should be designed simultaneously with the controller design. By virtue of such co-design, a nice analytic solution is obtained for the minimum channel capacity required for stabilization given in terms of the topological entropy of the plant. A numerical example is provided to illustrate how the scheduling/control co-design is carried out to stabilize the networked system.	channel capacity;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing);topological entropy	Wei Chen;Jing Yao;Li Qiu	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6761037	control engineering;fair-share scheduling;entropy;real-time computing;stability;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;networked control system;engineering;control theory;mathematics;gain scheduling;scheduling;channel capacity;statistics	Robotics	65.73593327791123	1.3159915456536426	9384

Advances in each of these two communities are often complementary but sometimes overlooked. One example is the manipulation of waves, known as anomalous diffraction via the use of metamaterials. This is achieved by controlling the surface impedance of each pixel at the interface of two different materials or alternately the phase and magnitude of the wave diffracted off the pixel. In this paper, a review of developments in wave manipulation from microwave to optical frequencies is presented, together with our new results in the terahertz regime. Generation of phase curves for pixel design requires a priori information on material properties at terahertz frequencies. Fabrication of terahertz devices entails micromachining in the clean room while their experimental validation demands both amplitude and phase information. Through judicial selection of practices in microwave and photonic communities, we can further the exploration of wave phenomena at terahertz frequencies.	bridging (networking);characteristic impedance;cleanroom;microwave;pixel;transmitter	Shiwei Qu;Huan Yi;Bao Jie Chen;Kung Bo Ng;Chi Hou Chan	2017	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2017.2688319	surface micromachining;metamaterial;electronic engineering;transformation optics;electronics;surface wave;terahertz gap;optoelectronics;plasmonic metamaterials;terahertz metamaterials;acoustic metamaterials;optics;diffraction;metamaterial cloaking;split-ring resonator;radio frequency;physics;seismic metamaterials	Visualization	90.27384116658754	-16.132033097389098	9409

In the work proposed, linearity performance of dual material gate (DMG) AlGaN/GaN HEMT has been analyzed and compared with the corresponding performance of Single Material Gate (SMG) AlGaN/ GaN HEMT using ATLAS device simulation. Specifically, we investigate the linearity of DMG and conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMT based on the linearity metrics such as gm, gm2 , gm3 , VIP2, VIP3, IIP3, IMD3 and 1-dB compression point. The impact of various device parameters on the device linearity such as the channel length, doping and thickness of the barrier and spacer layer, Al mole fraction and the work function difference of the two gate metals has also been investigated. It is observed that a suitably designed DMG AlGaN/GaN HEMT can considerably improve the linearity performance and minimize intermodulation distortion due to reduced drain induced barrier lowering and high-field effect; and a more uniform electric field for applications in 3-G mobile communication and low noise amplifiers. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm accepts scalar or multi-variant data sampled on a regular grid as input. The input data is converted into a compressed hierarchical wavelet representation in a pre-processing step. During rendering, the wavelet representation is decompressed on-the-fly and rendered using hardware texture mapping. The level-of-detail used for rendering is adapted to the estimated screen-space error. To increase the rendering performance additional visibility tests, such as empty space skipping and occlusion culling, are applied. Furthermore we discuss how to render the remaining multi-resolution blocks efficiently using modern graphics hardware. Using a prototype implementation of this algorithm we are able to perform a high quality interactive rendering of large data sets on a single off-the-shelf PC.	ati radeon r300 series;algorithm;blue (queue management algorithm);computer data storage;display resolution;geforce 9 series;glossary of computer graphics;graphics hardware;hidden surface determination;level of detail;out-of-core algorithm;preprocessor;prototype;real-time clock;regular grid;texture mapping;volume rendering;wavelet	Stefan Guthe;Wolfgang Straßer	2004	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/j.cag.2003.10.018	texture mapping;computer vision;tiled rendering;image-based modeling and rendering;hidden surface determination;fragment processing;3d rendering;computer hardware;rendering;computer science;level of detail;parallel rendering;real-time rendering;texture memory;alternate frame rendering;graphics hardware;volume rendering;software rendering;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	67.92470502637974	-51.327745369404745	9500

We introduce the idea of “evaluating the frontalness” by computing how close the object's surface normal aligns with the optical axis of a camera. The unique and novel aspect of our method is that unlike previous planar object pose estimation methods, our method does not require the true frontal image as a reference. The intuition is that a true frontal image can be used to produce other non-frontal images by perspective projection, while the non-frontal images have limited ability to produce other non-frontal images. We show that this intuition of comparing ‘frontal’ and ‘non-frontal’ can be extended to comparing ‘more frontal’ and ‘less frontal’ images. Based on this observation, our method estimates the relative frontalness of an image by exploiting the objective space error. We also propose the usage of K-invariant space to evaluate the frontalness even when the camera intrinsic parameters are unknown (e.g., images/videos from the web). We show that our method outperforms the homography decomposition-based method which also does not require reference images. In addition, a qualitative evaluation is carried out to show that our method can be applied in selecting the most frontal characters from a set of images captured in various viewpoints.	3d projection;apache axis;camera resectioning;computation;homography (computer vision);mobile device;normal (geometry);reference model;time complexity;video clip	Sungmin Eum;David S.

5f0e7bfdc156eed36d23de19b7587700fc7b97a6	iterative null space projection method with adaptive thresholding in sparse signal recovery		Adaptive thresholding methods have proved to yield high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and fast convergence for sparse signal recovery. Recently, it was observed that the robustness of a class of iterative sparse recovery algorithms such as Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding (IMAT) outperforms the well-known LASSO algorithm in terms of reconstruction quality, convergence speed, and the sensitivity to the noise. In this paper, we introduce a new method towards sparse signal recovery from random samples (RS) of the sensing matrix or its generalized version Compressed Sensing (CS) problem. The logic of this method is based on iterative projections of the thresholded signal onto the null-space of the sensing matrix. The simulations results reveal that the proposed method has the capability of yielding noticeable output SNR values when the number of samples approaches twice the sparsity number, while other methods fail to recover the signals when approaching this number. We have also extended our algorithm to Matrix Completion (MC) scenarios and compared its efficiency to other well-known approaches for MC in the literature.	adaptive filter;algorithm;compressed sensing;detection theory;heuristic;iterative method;kernel (linear algebra);lasso;loss function;openmp;optimization problem;projection method (fluid dynamics);pseudo-random number sampling;reed–solomon error correction;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry;thresholding (image processing);whole earth 'lectronic link	Ashkan Esmaeili;Ehsan Asadi Kangarshahi;Farrokh Marvasti	2018	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2016.0626	mathematical optimization;kernel (linear algebra);projection method;mathematics;thresholding	ML	78.76350505874562	-6.11637381654615	9536

In conventional CBE imaging, tracking and compensation of the echo shift due to temperature increase need to be done. Moreover, the CBE image does not enable visualization of the temperature distribution in tissues during nonuniform heating, which limits its clinical application in guidance of tissue ablation treatment. In this study, we investigated a CBE imaging method based on the sliding window technique and the polynomial approximation of the integrated CBE (ICBEpa image) to overcome the difficulties of conventional CBE imaging. We conducted experiments with tissue samples of pork tenderloin ablated by microwave irradiation to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. During ablation, the raw backscattered signals were acquired using an ultrasound scanner for B-mode and ICBEpa imaging. The experimental results showed that the proposed ICBEpa image can visualize the temperature distribution in a tissue with a very good contrast. Moreover, tracking and compensation of the echo shift were not necessary when using the ICBEpa image to visualize the temperature profile. The experimental findings suggested that the ICBEpa image, a new CBE imaging method, has a great potential in CBE-based imaging of hyperthermia and other thermal therapies.	ablation;aliasing;approximation;body tissue;experiment;fever;heating;imagery;medical ultrasound;microwave;polynomial;scanner device component;therapeutic procedure;ultrasonics (sound)	Jingjing Xia;Qiang Li;Hao-Li Liu;Wen-Shiang Chen;Po-Hsiang Tsui	2013		10.1155/2013/682827	medical imaging;human body temperature;radiology;medicine;temperature measurement;microwave;optics	Visualization	94.11004080340463	-21.865748959666515	9539

The design approach rests upon a two-step procedure: first, a constraintfree motion controller is determined that satisfies the required dynamic specifications; second, this controller is replaced with an equivalent controller satisfying the discrete action constraint. The first step is implemented by means of a heuristic 3-D extension of a well-proven 2-D controller, the second step by applying recent sliding mode results. Numerical simulations illustrate the properties of the resulting feedback system under both nominal and perturbed operating conditions.	bang file;computational fluid dynamics;heuristic;motion controller;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);simulation	R.

However, a piecewise time series model of the BSS is an advance configuration of it. An aim of our control study was to determine if a high-order statistic can detect in real-time a piecewise time change occurrence in the mixing matrix in BSS problem. A preprocess and a postprocess were incorporated with a conventional ICA. The objective of preprocess is to detect the change and of the postprocess is to track over consistency of the permutation and phase shift. Those were achieved by using high-order statistic-kurtosis values. The method was applied to a Laplacian PDF (a synthesised speech) signal and Gaussian PDF note signal which mixed with a mixing matrix having a jump in its intensity and phase values. Results indicated that it could be used in real-time BSS problem when a sudden change is occurred in the recording transmission path and it is formulated in jumps in the entries of the mixing matrix. Still, the algorithm must be improved in order to deal with a slight change in the mixing matrix.	algorithm;real-time clock;time series	Zvi Markowitz;Harold Szu	1999		10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831097	speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;time series;mathematics;speech synthesis;statistics	ML	82.66166802942577	-35.28233438235209	9562

We formulate the geometrically nonlinear (Euler) problem with nonzero preferred curvature, and show that it may be written as a three-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system. We focus on the special case of an initially straight rod subject to body forces derived from a quadratic potential uniform in one direction; in this case the system reduces to two degrees of freedom. We find two classes of trivial (straight) solutions and study the primary non-trivial branches bifurcating from one of these classes, as a load parameter, or the rod's length, increases. We show that the primary branches may be followed to large loads (lengths) and that segments derived from primary solutions may be concatenated to create secondary solutions, including closed loops, implying the existence of disconnected branches. At large loads all finite energy solutions approach homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits to the other class of straight states, and we prove the existence of an infinite set of such `spatially chaotic' solutions, corresponding to arbitrary concatenations of `simple' homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits. We illustrate our results with numerically computed equilibria and global bifurcation diagrams.	buckling;euler	Philip Holmes;Gábor Domokos;Geertje Hek	2000	J.

The compositional safety verification enables the verification of an interconnection of subsystems. The idea behind the compositional analysis is to allow the verification of systems with a high dimension, by the verification of multiple lower dimensional subproblems. In the compositional safety analysis, a particular structure is imposed on the barrier certificate, restricting the applicability of the method. We show an example of a system that cannot be verified using the compositional method, but can be verified using a centralized method. This example highlights how not to decompose systems, and should be used to guide the decomposition of a system into appropriate subsystems. Finally, we provide a second condition for the compositional safety analysis that enables the verification of the counterexample, by imposing a less restrictive structure of the barrier function. This shows that the counterexample can be solved with a compositional method, but at an increased computational complexity.	algorithmic efficiency;barrier function;centralized computing;computation;computational complexity theory;dynamical system;interconnection;linear system;verification and validation	Christoffer Sloth;Rafael Wisniewski;George J.

The basic idea is to account for the uncertainty in the traffic environment by a small number of future scenarios, which is intuitive and computationally efficient. These scenarios can be generated by any model-based or data-based approach. The paper discusses the SCMPC design procedure, which is simple and can be generalized to other control challenges in automated driving, as well as the controller's robustness properties. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SCMPC algorithm and its performance in lane change situations on highways.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;autonomous car	Gianluca Cesari;Georg Schildbach;Ashwin Carvalho;Francesco Borrelli	2017	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine	10.1109/MITS.2017.2709782	control theory;simulation;robustness (computer science);engineering;hidden markov model;trajectory;stochastic process;control engineering;model predictive control;small number	Robotics	60.16612178705011	-15.74768905328303	9631

Interactive volume rendering incorporated with advanced lighting has been achieved with GPU acceleration for regular-grid volume data, making volume visualization even more appealing as a tool for 3D data exploration. This paper presents an interactive illumination strategy, which is specially designed and optimized for volume visualization of unstructured-grid data. The basis of the design is a partial differential equation based illumination model to simulate the light propagation, absorption, and scattering within the volumetric medium. In particular, a two-level scheme is introduced to overcome the challenges presented by unstructured grids. Test results show that the added illumination effects such as global shadowing and multiple scattering not only lead to more visually pleasing visualization, but also greatly enhance the perception of the depth information and complex spatial relationships for features of interest in the volume data. This volume visualization enhancement is introduced at a time when unstructured grids are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of scientific simulation applications.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive mesh refinement;algorithm;computational physics;data visualization;gpu cluster;global illumination;gradient;graphics processing unit;ibm notes;interactivity;level of detail;list of common shading algorithms;numerical analysis;phong shading;positive feedback;precomputation;preprocessor;refinement (computing);regular grid;resampling (statistics);scientific visualization;simulation;software propagation;subsurface scattering;turbulence;unstructured grid;volume rendering;vortex	Min Shih;Yubo Zhang;Kwan-Liu Ma	2015	2015 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)	10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2015.7156383	computer vision;scientific visualization;image-based modeling and rendering;rendering;computer science;volumetric lighting;parallel rendering;real-time computer graphics;multimedia;computer graphics;volume rendering;software rendering;3d computer graphics;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	64.54589537514978	-50.939071755786095	9632

An optimal state-feedback law is determined so that a receding-horizon performance index with a moving terminal time is minimized. It is shown that the receding-horizon control problem can be converted to an initial-value problem for an ordinary differential equation that can be solved numerically without recourse to iterative methods. The proposed solution technique is applied to a control experiment on a simplified space-vehicle model. The penalty-function approach is employed in the performance index so that the space-vehicle model attains the objective state, avoiding an obstacle. The model is controlled successfully at the sampling frequency of 30Hz in the hardware experiment.	algorithm;feedback;iterative method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;real-time clock;real-time transcription;sampling (signal processing)	Toshiyuki Ohtsuka;Hironori A.

A calculation software was developed in order to determine the actual acceleration of the lifted mass and the dynamic overload inside the rope during the lifting phase. In the final part of the article an application example is presented, with the aim of showing the correlation between the magnitude of the stress and the type of the employed motion command.	elasticity (cloud computing);lambda lifting;lifting scheme	Luigi Solazzi;Giovanni Incerti;Candida Petrogalli	2014		10.7148/2014-0309	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;marine engineering	Robotics	72.77444316065841	-15.595097035704041	9635

8c73f1c93155aff1130a5972e4f74d5850031360	h2 gain-scheduled filtering for discrete-time lpv systems using estimated time-varying parameters		This paper investigates the problem of gain-scheduled filtering for discrete-time LPV systems where the scheduling parameters cannot be measured, but only estimated. Differently from the existing methods that are suitable to deal with inexact measures, the design of the gain-scheduled filter is guided by some information provided by the estimation algorithm. As a consequence, the proposed procedure puts in evidence a trade-off that must be evaluated by the designer involving: guarantee of stability, performance and the required on-line computational effort. The overall result is a better evaluation of the true improvement that can be achieved by the gain-scheduled filters with respect to the robust filters (where the real-time availability of the scheduling parameters is not necessary). Some technical contributions to reduce the conservativeness of the synthesis conditions, given in terms of LMI relaxations, are also provided as well a case study to illustrate the approach.

For the description of waves in a block medium with thick interlayers the orthotropic couple-stress continuum theory, taking into account the symmetry of elastic properties relative to the coordinate planes, can be applied. By comparing the elastic wave velocities in the framework of piecewise-homogeneous model and continuum model, the simple method is obtained to estimate mechanical parameters of an orthotropic Cosserat continuum, modeling a block medium. In two-dimensional formulation of the orthotropic model, the computational algorithm and the program system are worked out for the analysis of propagation of elastic waves. The comparison showed good qualitative agreement between the results of computations of waves, caused by localized impulses, by the model of a block medium with compliant interlayers and the model of an orthotropic Cosserat continuum.	triune continuum paradigm	Oxana V.

The correction factors are derived from the increase in the spatial average electric field strength distribution, which is dependent on the building materials. The spatial average electric field strength is calculated using relative complex dielectric constants of building materials.

Especially in the nuclear reactions, where relativistic ion beams (RIBs) are used, these neutrons are serious problem. They have to be rejected in order to obtain clearer gamma-ray peaks. In this study, the radiation energy and three criteria which were previously determined for separation between neutron and gamma-rays in the HPGe detectors have been used in artificial neural network (ANN) for improving of the decomposition power. According to the preliminary results obtained from ANN method, the ratio of neutron rejection has been improved by a factor of 1.27 and the ratio of the lost in gamma-rays has been decreased by a factor of 0.50.	artificial neural network;evaporation;interaction;rejection sampling;semiconductor detector;sensor	Serkan Akkoyun;Tuncay Bayram;S.

The main objective of the paper is to develop a model that is well suited for control design and stability analysis for swimming snake robots. The proposed model is notably less complex than the existing models, while significant parameters such as added mass effects, linear drag forces, torques due to the added mass and linear drag forces, are all taken into account in the modeling. An extensive analysis of a previously proposed complex model of underwater snake robots ([1]) is presented, and from this analysis a set of essential properties that characterize the overall motion of underwater snake robots is derived. The proposed control-oriented modeling approach captures these essential properties, resulting in a less complex model that is well suited for control design, and at the same time has the same essential properties as the complex model. A qualitative validation of this is given by simulations that present a comparison of representative parameters of the complex and the control-oriented models for lateral undulation and eel-like motion.	chemical database;essence;lateral thinking;nonlinear system;robot;simulation;time-scale calculus;undulation of the geoid	A.

The detection of early reflections can be hampered by increasing reflection width, as the direct sound undergoes reflection and by overlapping of the reflections, as the reflection density grows. This paper investigates the use of Dynamic Time Warping upon a direct sound pulse to estimate the temporal distribution of arrivals in room impulse responses. Bounded Dynamic Time Warping is performed, after an initial correlation of the direct sound with the remaining signal, to further refine the arrival's location and duration and to find arrivals which may otherwise not correlate well with the un-warped direct sound due to a change in the reflection's shape. Dynamic Time Warping upon concatenated versions of the direct sound is also used to help find overlapping reflections which may otherwise go undetected. Warping is performed via a set of warp matrices which can be combined together and can also be inverted via a quickly calculated left pseudo-inverse. The algorithm presented is compared to two current methods of arrival detection and is shown to detect a lesser number of spurious arrivals than either of these algorithms.	algorithm;amiga reflections;concatenation;diffuse reflection;dynamic time warping;mike lesser;reflection (computer graphics);sensor;speech synthesis	Ian J.

The aim of the approach is to achieve calibration accuracies comparable with state-of-the-art methods, while requiring less initial information about the system being calibrated and thus being more suitable for use by end users. The method operates by utilizing the motion of the system being calibrated. By estimating the motion each individual sensor observes, an estimate of the extrinsic calibration of the sensors is obtained. Our approach extends standard techniques for motion-based calibration by incorporating estimates of the accuracy of each sensor's readings. This yields a probabilistic approach that calibrates all sensors simultaneously and facilitates the estimation of the uncertainty in the final calibration. In addition, we combine this motion-based approach with appearance information. This gives an approach that requires no initial calibration estimate and takes advantage of all available alignment information to provide an accurate and robust calibration for the system. The new framework is validated with datasets collected with different platforms and different sensors' configurations, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches.	calibration (statistics);camera resectioning;global positioning system;inertial navigation system;multimodal interaction;sensor	Zachary Taylor;Juan I.

Computationally the smoothest field is found via a sparse eigenvalue problem involving a matrix similar to the cotan-Laplacian.

dc9a788327ca7984b17563c504f5586f72622497	a modeling framework and flux controller for free molecular flow deposition processes		In this paper, we introduce a modeling framework for free molecular flow (FMF) processes (such as, deposition processes under an ultra-high vacuum condition) that is suitable for model-based control design. The generic dynamical model is comprised of four important elements present in such processes: (i) particle transfer, which is modeled based on the well-known Knudsen cosine law; (ii) particle leakage; (iii) adsorption and desorption described by a (nonlinear) sticking function; and (iv) control input particle flux. As a starting point for obtaining accurate control on the deposition process in FMF regime, we propose a control design method for stabilization with guaranteed transient behavior for fluxes. It is based on a point-wise min-norm control approach, employing both control Lyapunov and control barrier functions. Lastly, we validate our model, applied to a cylindrical geometry, with existing results in the literature and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control method for controlling the fluxes.	automata theory;chemical vapor deposition;control engineering;control theory;dynamical system;hybrid automaton;lyapunov fractal;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;optimal control;physical vapor deposition;simulation;spectral leakage;whole earth 'lectronic link	M.

In this paper, a guideline for choosing two feasible or achievable specifications, and a new FOPI/IOPID controller synthesis are proposed for all the stable FOPTD systems. Using this synthesis scheme, the complete feasible region of two specifications can be obtained and visualized in the plane. With this region as the prior knowledge, all combinations of two specifications can be verified before the controller design. Especially, it is interesting to compare the areas of these two feasible regions for the IOPID and FOPI controllers. This area comparison reveals, for the first time, the potential advantages of one controller over the other in terms of achievable performances. A simulation illustration is presented to show the effectiveness and the performance of the designed FOPI controller comparedwith the optimized integer order PI controller and the IOPID controller designed following the same synthesis for the FOPI in this paper. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The formulation involves recasting the error dynamics, which comprise of the tracking error and error of the controller parameters, into a Takagi-Sugeno model. Instead of using a single adaptation gain, multiple adaptation gains are employed. A sufficient condition is derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of the system for both state and output feedback cases. The adaptive control problem is formulated as a minimization of the L2 gain. The optimal adaptation gains are obtained by solving a linear matrix inequality problem. A numerical example compares the proposed approach with the standard MRAC. Moreover, the proposed approach is applied to control a real printing system to improve the printing quality where large parameter variations, owing to different print jobs, and disturbances are presence.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;controller (control theory);job stream;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;printing;social inequality	Mohamed Ezzeldin;Siep Weiland;P.

In classical game theory algorithms, each player employs the knowledge of both the functional form of its payoff and the other players' actions. The proposed algorithm, in which the players only measure their own payoff values, is based on the so-called “extremum seeking” approach, which has previously been developed for standard optimization problems and employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the gradient. We consider static games where the players seek to maximize their non-quadratic payoff functions. Since non-quadratic payoffs create the possibility of multiple, isolated Nash equilibria, our convergence results are local. Specifically, the attainment of any particular Nash equilibrium is not assured for all initial conditions, but only for initial conditions in a set around that specific stable Nash equilibrium. For non-quadratic payoffs, the convergence to a Nash equilibrium is not perfect, but is biased in proportion to the perturbation amplitudes and the third derivatives of the payoff functions.

Extracting frequency parameters directly from the compressed files to represent music greatly benefits processing speed when working on a large database. In this study, we focused on advanced audio coding (AAC) files and analyzed the disparity in frequency expression between discrete Fourier transform and discrete cosine transform, considered the frequency resolution to select the appropriate frequency range, and developed a direct chroma feature-transformation method in the AAC transform domain. An added challenge to using AAC files directly is long/short window switching, ignoring which may result in inaccurate frequency mapping and inefficient information retrieval. For a short window in particular, we propose a peak-competition method to enhance the pitch information that does not include ambiguous frequency components when combining eight subframes. Moreover, for chroma feature segmentation, we propose a simple dynamic-segmentation method to replace the complex computation of beat tracking. Our experimental results show that the proposed method increased the accuracy rate by approximately 7 % in Top-1 search results over transform-domain methods described previously and performed nearly as effectively as state-of-the-art waveform-domain approaches did.	advanced audio coding;binocular disparity;chroma feature;computation;cross-correlation;database;discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;distortion;frequency band;householder transformation;information retrieval;interpolation;sampling (signal processing);waveform	Tai-Ming Chang;Chia-Bin Hsieh;Pao-Chi Chang	2014	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-014-2031-1	speech recognition;advanced audio coding;computer science;operating system;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Web+IR	78.09252715179127	-33.27208222656555	9893
29eaeb5aba8f3fce90ce20369d36062267c5c0c9	efficient active slam based on submap joining, graph topology and convex optimization		The active SLAM problem considered in this paper aims to plan a robot trajectory for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) as well as for an area coverage task with robot pose uncertainty. Based on a model predictive control (MPC) framework, these two problems are solved respectively by different methods. For the uncertainty minimization MPC problem, based on the graphical structure of the 2D feature-based SLAM, a non-convex constrained least-squares problem is presented to approximate the original problem. Then, using variable substitutions, it is further transformed into a convex problem, and then solved by a convex optimization method. For the coverage task considering robot pose uncertainty, it is formulated and solved by the MPC framework and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. In the whole process, considering the computation complexity, we use linear SLAM, which is a submap joining approach, to reduce the time for planning and estimation. Finally, various simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	aerial photography;approximation algorithm;computation;convex optimization;experiment;file spanning;graphical user interface;least squares;mathematical optimization;optimality criterion;real-time clock;regular expression;robot;sequential quadratic programming;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping;topological graph theory;uncertainty principle;unmanned aerial vehicle	Yongbo Chen;Shoudong Huang;Robert Fitch;Jianqiao Yu	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460864	task analysis;mathematical optimization;control theory;computation;simultaneous localization and mapping;convex optimization;model predictive control;sequential quadratic programming;engineering;topological graph theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	60.96550876210305	-20.295659616390562	9904

By combining microfluidic chip and micororobotics, the flow in a channel can be actively controlled and we achieved successive operations of 1) loading oocyte, 2) control cutting volume and 3) removing nucleus, 4) dispensing enucleated oocyte immediately. After enucleation process, enucleated oocyte could be ejected to the culture well immediately, and ejected oocytes are neatly arranged in the culture array, this shows great ease of single oocyte operation. The magnetically actuated microrobot can control local fluid flow by changing its position like gate valve and control fluid force distributions in a microchip which govern oocyte movement in a chip. The optimally designed microchannel for enucleation enables continuous operation and cutting bovine oocyte with smooth manner by hydrodynamic force. Removed nucleus is thrown away from withdrawal microchannel, however the remaining part of oocyte dispensed from the nozzle hole is collected by a culture array.	continuous operation;integrated circuit;microbotics	Lin Feng;Masaya Hagiwara;Akihiko Ichikawa;Y.

The proposed algorithm seeks to prevent permutations by frequency oversampling, and then exploiting the induced correlation between bins. Any remaining permutation is then corrected by beam pattern estimation. Cascade initialization is shown to improve system performance while decreasing processing time, while frequency oversampling is shown to increase performance with slight increases in computational time. The algorithm is proven robust against isotropic noise, producing a SIR improvement of 12.9 dB when the reverberation time is 260 ms, and the signals at the input are only 5 dB above the noise floor.	algorithm;blind signal separation;computation;noise floor;oversampling;radiation pattern;source separation;time complexity	Christopher Osterwise;Steven L.

Helical wrapping of the sensing fiber directly around the pipeline is used to increase the system sensitivity for detection of weak leak-induced vibrations. DAS measurements are supplemented with reference accelerometer data to facilitate analysis and interpretation of recorded vibration signals. The results reveal that a DAS system using direct fiber application approach is capable of detecting pipeline natural vibrations excited by the broadband noise generated by the leaking medium. In the performed experiment, pipeline vibration modes with acceleration magnitudes down to single μg were detected. Simple leak detection approach based on spectral integration of time-averaged DAS signals in frequency domain was proposed. Potential benefits and limitations of the presented monitoring approach were discussed with respect to its practical applicability. We demonstrated that the approached is potentially capable of detection and localization of gas pipeline leaks with leak rates down to 0.1% of the pipeline flow volume and might be of interest for monitoring of short- and medium-length gas pipelines.	acoustic cryptanalysis;conceptualization (information science);data curation;digital curation;excitation;eye;gases;kilohertz;neurofibromatosis 2;normal mode;optical fiber;pipeline (computing);sensor;tissue fiber;vibration - physical agent;wrapping (graphics);accelerometers;amsonic acid;benefit	Pavol Stajanca;Sebastian Chruscicki;Tobias Homann;Stefan Seifert;Dirk Schmidt;Abdelkarim Habib	2018		10.3390/s18092841		Mobile	93.76441846210992	-21.545016183963828	9959

Each robot is setup with a single eye camera to capture the image of a guiding robot or obstacle. The image between them is converted to a gray form, and then to the gradient for each pixel of Gaussian pyramid level to estimate the motion parameters, disturbances, or obstacles. Successive images for a moving object are used to estimate or recognize the foreground, guiding robot, and obstacles by calculating the gravity of the moving object, and then the following mobile robot will follow the trajectory of the guiding one. On the contrary, the following mobile robot turns out to serve as a guiding one when there is no gravity. Furthermore, the elliptic collision-free path will be used for obstacle gravity and keep going until the final destination is achieved. Finally, experimental results will be used to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	control theory;gaussian blur;gradient;mobile robot;pixel	Wen-Shyong Yu;Chih-Hao Lin	2012	The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252564	mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;video tracking;motion estimation;control theory;gaussian process;estimation theory	Robotics	54.91507085935408	-34.07517505288906	10027
74c243dc07667377b911ebfc4040d5eea86f51e1	gsr hand: linear-parallel and self-adaptive hand with gear and sliding-rod mechanisms		Circular parallel hands require manipulators to cooperate with hands while grasping objects, so that their control methods are complicated. This paper introduces a linear pinch into self-adaptive grasping and proposes a novel hybrid grasping mode, a linear-parallel and self-adaptive (Linear-PASA) mode. This paper designs a new robot hand for Linear-PASA mode (GSR Hand). The GSR Hand has three double-joint GSR fingers. Each finger is driven by one motor, through gear and sliding-rod mechanisms and an idle-stroke kinematic pair and double spring-limit. To achieve the Linear-PASA function: According to different shapes and locations of objects, the GSR finger can maintain the posture of the second phalange and move the second phalange to clamp the object grasped parallel and linearly, it can also rotate the second phalange to envelope grasp the object self-adaptively when the first phalange is blocked by the object. The result of the simulation and experiment indicate that GSR hand can realize Linear-PASA mode.	clamping (graphics);displacement mapping;poor posture;robot;safety data sheet;simulation;thermal copper pillar bump;workbench	Handong Hu;Wenzeng Zhang;Xiangrong Xu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324745	control engineering;control theory;clamp;rotation;kinematic pair;engineering;grasp	Robotics	72.27783690199439	-22.817102619127343	10032

To this end, we first exploit the symmetrically structured power spectral density of the clutter to transfer data from the complex to the real domain. Then, the spillover of target energy is incorporated into the design criteria to come up with two architectures capable of guaranteeing improved detection performances and range estimation. The performance assessments, conducted on both simulated data and real recorded datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed detectors compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts, which ignore either the clutter spectral symmetry or the energy spillover.	clutter;knowledge spillover;performance;radar;sensor;spectral density	Shefeng Yan;Davide Massaro;Danilo Orlando;Chengpeng Hao;Alfonso Farina	2017	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2017.2756076	mathematics;pattern recognition;covariance matrix;computer vision;spectral density;radar;clutter;exploit;artificial intelligence;constant false alarm rate;gaussian;detector	Vision	79.35633411675872	-47.947093499977726	10068

We focus on the local sparsities of speech signals in contrast to the conventional beamforming and blind source seperation methods. The technique utilizes the difference of local structures in temporary-frequency domain between the target speech and interfering signals for enhancing the target speech. We first estimate the local structures of the speech and noise signals at each time-frequency bin to form a local dictionary, and then recover the clean speech via sparse coding. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement and requires no prior knowledge of speech and noise. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can suppress interferer and meantime preserve target speech more than some conventional methods.	algorithm;beamforming;dictionary;neural coding;sparse matrix;speech enhancement	Zhiyuan Zhou;Zhaogui Ding;Weifeng Li;Zhiyong Wu;Longbiao Wang;Qingmin Liao	2014			artificial intelligence;local time;pattern recognition;speech recognition;speech enhancement;neural coding;computer science;communication channel	ML	83.8496288888599	-35.9247309662762	10072

The simulators examined cover a wide spectrum of vehicles including unmanned aerial vehicles, both full scale and micro size; unmanned surface and subsurface vehicles; and unmanned ground vehicles. The majority of simulators use simple numerical simulation and simplistic visualization using custom OpenGL code. An emerging trend is to used modified commercial game engines for physical simulation and visualization. The game engines that are commercially available today are capable of physical simulations providing basic physical properties and interactions between objects. Newer and/or specialized engines such as the flight simulator X-Plane or Ageia PhysX and Havok physics engines, are capable of simulating more complex physical interactions between objects. Researchers in need of a simulator have a choice of using game engines or available open source and commercially available simulators, allowing resources to be focused on research instead of building a new simulator. We conclude that it is no longer necessary to build a new simulator from scratch.	aerial photography;computer simulation;dynamical simulation;flight simulator;full scale;fundamental interaction;game engine;havok technology suites;image plane;numerical analysis;open-source software;opengl;physx;physics engine;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jeff Craighead;Robin R.

The deformation technique derives a -continuous and one-to-one warp from a set of point pairs overlaid on two images. The resulting inbetween image precisely reflects the correspondence of features specified by an animator. We also control the transition behavior in a metamorphosis sequence by taking another deformable surface model, which is simpler and thus more efficient than the deformation technique for a warp. The proposed method separates transition control from feature interpolation and is easier to use than the previous techniques. The multigrid relaxation method is employed to solve a linear system in deriving a warp or transition rates. This method makes our image morphing technique fast enough for an interactive environment.	algorithm;computation;computer vision;edge detection;image analysis;image warping;inbetweening;interpolation;linear programming relaxation;linear system;morphing;multigrid method;numerical analysis;numerical method;one-to-one (data model);relaxation (approximation);relaxation (iterative method);time complexity;warp (information security)	Seungyong Lee;Kyung-Yong Chwa;James K.

The results indicate that POFBG has higher (almost twice as much) bend sensitivity than SOFBG. Based on the difference between the bend and temperature sensitivity of POFBG and SOFBG, a new method of measuring vector bend and temperature simultaneously was proposed by using a hybrid sensor head with series connection of one POFBG and one SOFBG with different Bragg wavelengths. It provides high sensitivity and resolution for sensing bend and temperature changes simultaneously and independently. The proposed sensor can find some applications in the fields where high sensitivity for both bend and temperature measurements are required.	artificial intelligence;british informatics olympiad;conceptualization (information science);conflict (psychology);decompression sickness;natural science disciplines;optical fiber;polymer;sensor;series and parallel circuits;silicic acid;silicon dioxide;tissue fiber;negative regulation of protein depolymerization;wavelength	Binbin Yan;Guoqiang Liu;Jun He;Yanhua Luo;Liwei Yang;H.

Different from the developable surfaces, a flattenable mesh surface is more flexible to model objects with complex shapes (e.g., cramped paper or warped leather with wrinkles). Modelling a flattenable mesh from a given input mesh surface can be completed under a constrained nonlinear optimization framework. In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of estimation error. Therefore, the shape of a flattenable mesh can be computed by the least-norm solutions faster. Moreover, the method for adding shape constraints to the modelling of flattenable mesh surfaces has been exploited.

27672d57889c597c6d8e8770f539ffffbf949eec	new stability analysis for discrete time-delay systems via auxiliary-function-based summation inequalities		For the stability analysis of discrete time-delay systems, Jensen inequality has been widely used as the method supporting inequalities for summation quadratic functions. It not only requires a smaller number of decision variables than other approaches but also achieves identical or comparable performance behavior. Based on the analysis for the conservatism of Jensen inequality, however, this paper suggests a new summation inequality  say  an auxiliary-function-based summation inequality. It is verified that the proposed inequality is a generalized form of the novel summation inequality reported recently. Also, an application to stability analysis for discrete time-delay systems is provided.		Poogyeon Park;Seok Young Lee;Won Il Lee	2016	J.

Systems with static input or output non-linearities are very common in many engineering applications. Such models are known as block-oriented models in the existing literature. The Hammerstein model is a special kind of block-oriented model, where a non-linear block is followed by a linear system. This study investigates the identification of Hammerstein systems with asymmetric two-segment piecewise-linear non-linearities. The basic idea is to employ a key-term separation technique and a corresponding auxiliary model initially. Then, the identification problem of non-linear system is changed into a non-linear function optimisation problem over parameter space. Further, the estimates of all the parameters of the non-linear block, the linear subsystem and the noise part are obtained based on an improved particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Finally, simulation examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed identification scheme.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;separation principle	Xiaoping Xu;Feng Wang;Guangjun Liu;Fucai Qian	2013	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2013.0042	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	ML	60.11987013865681	-5.457747137870261	10157

The algorithm is motivated by the work of Hastie and follows the main idea of tracking the optimality conditions of the SVM solution for ascending value of C . It differs from Hastie's approach in that the tracked path is not assumed to be 1-D. Instead, a multidimensional feasible space for the optimality condition is used to solve the tracking problem. Such a treatment allows the algorithm to properly handle data sets which Hastie's approach fails. These data sets are characterized by the presence of linearly dependent points (in the kernel space), duplicate points, or nearly duplicate points. Such data sets are quite common among many real-world data, especially those with nominal features. Other contributions of this paper include a unifying formulation of the tracking process in the form of a linear programming problem, update formula for the linear programs, considerations that guard against accumulation of errors resulting from the use of incremental updates, and routines to speed up the algorithm. The algorithm is implemented under the Matlab environment and is available for download.

Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) has been emerged as one of the promising actuator system, since it provides various benefits such as safety, force sensing, energy storing with its inherent compliance. While the SEA contributes not only to the human interacting robot but also to wide robotics area, there is still limitation in performance that is caused by non-linearity and discontinuous power transfer. The cause of these influence is arisen from the electric devices (e.g., sensor, motor) and mechanical characteristics (e.g., friction, gear backlash), since SEA consists of a motor, a spring and a gear reducer to amplify the output torque. We focus on improvement of maximum force control performance (i.e., control bandwidth) taking into consideration saturation characteristic of the motor drive. Especially velocity limitation which interrupts spring deformation tracking performance is concentrated in this research; the spring in SEA transforms displacement to output force and its performance depends on the position control performance of the SEA. A novel index called Maximum Torque Transmissibility (MTT) is defined to assess the ability to fully utilize maximum continuous motor torque input which is saturated by velocity output limitation condition. Novel and practical frequency bandwidth can be found based on the proposed MTT.	actuator device component;bandwidth (signal processing);barium enema;concentrate dosage form;displacement mapping;friction;interaction;interrupt;mathematical model;maximum force;nonlinear system;psychologic displacement;robot;robotics;torque;transmissibility (structural dynamics);usb hub;velocity (software development);benefit;bismuth subsalicylate 35 mg/ml oral suspension	Chan Lee;Wiha Choi;Sehoon Oh	2016	2016 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2016.7496322	control engineering;torque sensor;stall torque;engineering;electrical engineering;friction torque;control theory;coupling;torque motor;direct torque control	Robotics	74.93606993735553	-20.152768864305642	10262

This paper describes the possibility of integrating these technologies for the development of a positive interacting system with disabled drivers. In this context, we suggest a new solution for a braking device that aims at helping paraplegic drivers: Integrated in a steer-by-wire handwheel, the driver has only to press on the handwheel to brake the vehicle. The device is equipped with automatic releasing of the handwheel movement when braking is no longer required. The proposed solution brings many advantages in terms of safety and ergonomics. Indeed, this device will enable the driver to brake and to accelerate while continuously keeping the hands on the handwheel. This gives the driver a significant gain in braking time. The use of an active braking feedback also provides a progressive and intuitive proportioning brake. This concept opens prospects to active braking assistance. To concretize this idea, theoretical and simulation studies are carried out for the main processes of the device. A prototype has also been developed.	feedback;human factors and ergonomics;interaction;prototype;simulation	Kamel Messaoudene;Naima Ait Oufroukh;Saïd Mammar	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2010.2050609	control engineering;simulation;innovation management;engineering;automotive engineering;emergency brake assist;cadence braking;brake	HCI	74.1051015331814	-17.287746163496518	10269

To achieve this aim, this study examines adopting a spinal structure with variable viscoelasticity and multiple joints. In order to investigate the effect of this spinal structure, a physical model of the spinal structure and a quadruped robot incorporating this design were developed, and the relationship between the gait pattern of the legs of the robot and viscoelasticity as a source of passive oscillation of the spinal structure was observed. The experimental results indicate that there are several interactions between the gait pattern and the viscoelasticity that can achieve one of various types of successful locomotion. These results suggest that the proposed spinal structure is a suitable body design for facilitating multi-modal locomotion at low computational costs.	interaction;modal logic;robot;robotics	Takashi Takuma;Masahiro Ikeda;Tatsuya Masuda	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5649134	control engineering;torso;physical model;engineering;trajectory;viscoelasticity;control theory;efficient energy use;oscillation;force;quantum mechanics	Robotics	68.23943287070806	-24.405431804050245	10291
0c8b4c996eca0eb7d9a95ec26bfd9493f5e1707e	the hegselmann-krause dynamics for equally spaced agents		We consider the Hegselmann-Krause bounded confidence dynamics for n equally spaced opinions on the real line, with gaps equal to the confidence bound r, which we take to be 1. We prove rigorous results on the evolution of this configuration, which confirm hypotheses previously made based on simulations for small values of n. Namely, for every n, the system evolves as follows: after every 5 time steps, a group of 3 agents become disconnected at either end and collapse to a cluster at the subsequent step. This continues until there are fewer than 6 agents left in the middle, and these finally collapse to a cluster, if n is not a multiple of 6. In particular, the final configuration consists of 2bn/6c clusters of size 3, plus one cluster in the middle of size n (mod 6), if n is not a multiple of 6, and the number of time steps before freezing is 5n/6 + O(1). We also consider the dynamics for arbitrary, but constant, inter-agent spacings d ∈ [0, 1] and present three main findings. Firstly we prove that the evolution is periodic also at some other, but not all, values of d, and present numerical evidence that for all d something “close” to periodicity nevertheless holds. Secondly, we exhibit a value of d at which the behaviour is periodic and the time to freezing is n + O(1), hence slower than that for d = 1. Thirdly, we present numerical evidence that, as d → 0, the time to freezing may be closer, in order of magnitude, to the diameter d(n− 1) of the configuration rather than the number of agents n.	numerical analysis;quasiperiodicity;simulation	Peter Hegarty;Edvin Wedin	2014	CoRR		combinatorics;mathematical analysis;calculus;mathematics	Theory	83.00869390989342	2.9038558743454446	10292
e893872b85e50645d2e29b60a01acd67c8911968	a new approach for the tissue-blood partition coefficients of neutral and ionized compounds	partition coefficient	A nonlinear model equation based on tissue composition (a content of lipids, proteins, and water) for the tissue-blood partition coefficients of compounds was further developed in this paper to account for the neutral and ionized forms of the compounds. The nonlinear model equation may be considered as the expressive form of the Hansch equation in nonlinear spaces (or multiphase system). Based on this model our nonlinear regression analysis for neutral and ionized compounds partitioning into kidney, brain, muscle, lung, liver, heart, and fat resulted in equations with high fitting power (training set: n=201, r=0.905, s=0.291, Q=0.890) and strong predictive power (test set: n=64, r=0.906, s=0.247). These results showed that the equilibrium distribution of a compound in a variety of tissues is essentially the equilibrium distribution of the compound in tissue (chemical) compositions. Neutral and ionic forms of a compound as well as in different tissue (chemical) compositions have a different mechanism of action in vivo.

The joint compatibility test is commonly regarded as the true solution to the problem. However, traditional joint compatibility tests are computationally expensive, are sensitive to linearization errors, and require the knowledge of the full covariance matrix of state variables. The paper proposes a posterior-based joint compatibility test scheme to conquer the three problems mentioned above. The posterior-based test naturally separates the test of state variables from the test of observations. Therefore, through the introduction of the robot movement and proper approximation, the joint test process is sequentialized to the sum of individual tests; therefore, the test has O(n) complexity (compared with O(n2) for traditional tests), where n denotes the total number of related observations. At the same time, the sequentialized test neither requires the knowledge to the full covariance matrix of state variables nor is sensitive to linearization errors caused by poor pose estimates. The paper also shows how to apply the proposed method to various simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both simulated data and popular datasets show the proposed method outperforms some classical algorithms, including sequential compatibility nearest neighbor (SCNN), random sample consensus (RANSAC), and joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB), on precision, efficiency, and robustness.	analysis of algorithms;approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;correspondence problem;experiment;internationalization and localization;joint compatibility branch and bound;mathematical optimization;random sample consensus;robot;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping	Yangming Li;Shuai Li;Quanjun Song;Max Q.-H.

Built upon quantitative feedback theory, the proposed controller is designed according to stability and tracking specifications, considering actuator internal leakage as one of the uncertain phenomena. The controller is also augmented with a friction compensator to alleviate the parasitic effect of dry friction in the hydraulic cylinder and further improve the tracking performance. The ability of the augmented controller in maintaining the actuator position within acceptable response envelopes is demonstrated in both simulations and experiments.

To ensure the low degree condition, quadratic B-splines are used to approximate the given curve via orthogonal projection in Sobolev spaces. Adaptive knot removal, which is based on spline wavelets, is used to reduce the number of segments. The spline segments are implicitized. After multiplying the implicit spline segments by suitable polynomial factors the resulting bivariate functions are joined along suitable transversal lines. This yields a globally C bivariate function.

This study presents a novel pose estimation method for sweet pepper detachment. In this method, the normal to the local plane at each point in the sweet-pepper point cloud was first calculated. The point cloud was separated by a number of candidate planes, and the scores of each plane were then separately calculated using the scoring strategy. The plane with the lowest score was selected as the symmetry plane of the point cloud. The symmetry axis could be finally calculated from the selected symmetry plane, and the pose of sweet pepper in the space was obtained using the symmetry axis. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by simulated and sweet-pepper cloud dataset tests. In the simulated test, the average angle error between the calculated symmetry and real axes was approximately 6.5°. In the sweet-pepper cloud dataset test, the average error was approximately 7.4° when the peduncle was removed. When the peduncle of sweet pepper was complete, the average error was approximately 6.9°. These results suggested that the proposed method was suitable for pose estimation of sweet peppers and could be adjusted for use with other fruits and vegetables.	apache axis;axis vertebra;bell pepper;experiment;fruit;genus axis;hidden surface determination;internationalization and localization;least squares;least-squares analysis;machine vision;manuscripts;natural science disciplines;obstruction;optic axis of a crystal;peduncle - plant part;point cloud;prospective search;retinal detachment;robot end effector;score;seizures;silo (dataset);vegetables	Hao Li;Qibing Zhu;Min Huang;Ya Guo;Jianwei Qin	2018		10.3390/s18093083	engineering;pose;computer vision;electronic engineering;pepper;artificial intelligence	Vision	60.066634403295	-36.803858985767086	10371

This paper proposes a method to learn and to model the velocity profile that the driver follows as the vehicle decelerates towards a stop intersection. Gaussian Processes (GP), a machine learning method for non-linear regressions are used to model the velocity profiles. It is shown that GP are well adapted for such an application, using data recorded in real traffic conditions. GP allow the generation of a normally distributed speed, given a position on the road. By comparison with generic velocity profiles, benefits of using individual driver patterns for ADAS issues are presented.	architecture design and assessment system;gaussian process;machine learning;mathematical optimization;noise shaping;nonlinear system;sensor;velocity (software development)	Alexandre Armand;David Filliat;Javier Ibanez Guzman	2013	16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2013)	10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728466	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	60.70737892607357	-14.982104857751105	10377

In most cases, however, its transmission requirements are extremely demanding compared to the available bandwidth. One possible solution to this problem could be to transmit a reference channel and recreate the remaining channels at the receiving end. In this paper such a method is proposed by taking advantage of spectral conversion techniques that have been successfully applied to speech processing. Applications of the proposed system include transmission of multichannel audio over the current Internet infrastructure and, as an extension of the methods proposed here, remastering of existing monophonic and stereophonic recordings for multichannel rendering.	internet;multiresolution analysis;requirement;software remastering;speech processing;surround sound	Athanasios Mouchtaris;Shrikanth (Shri) Narayanan;Chris Kyriakakis	2002		10.1109/ICME.2002.1035574	signal reconstruction;the internet;speech recognition;audio signal processing;computer science;speech processing;audio signal flow;bandwidth	Mobile	84.51388393308417	-31.354195677691024	10384

These vessels require a detailed inspection program, using several nondestructive testing techniques. A robotic crawler designed to perform such inspections is presented here. Locomotion over the hull is provided through magnetic tracks, and the system is controlled by two networked PCs and a set of custom hardware devices to drive motors, video cameras, ultrasound, inertial platform, and other devices. Navigation algorithm uses an extended-Kalman-filter (EKF) sensor-fusion formulation, integrating odometry and inertial sensors. It was shown that the inertial navigation errors can be decreased by selecting appropriate Q and R matrices in the EKF formulation.	algorithm;displacement mapping;encoder;extended kalman filter;inertial navigation system;mobile robot;odometry;personal computer;real life;sensor;software inspection;velocity (software development);web crawler	Luciano Luporini Menegaldo;Gustavo Ferreira;Melquisedec Francisco Santos;Rodrigo Siqueira Guerato	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2025716	mobile robot;embedded system;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;control system;artificial intelligence	Robotics	57.721378637194874	-34.906664713531434	10385

Key process variables (KPVs), i.e., contact force, tool path, and feed rate, of the manual operator performing the task are captured with a “sensorized” hand-held belt grinder, while the changes to the work-piece geometry is captured using a 3-D scanner. The entire manual tool-path strategy is segmented into its primitives or primary strategies before programming an equivalent robotic tool-path and strategy. The manual tool-path primitives are imported into computer-aided-manufacturing software where boundary splines are created to generate the robotic tool-paths. An analytical material removal rate (MRR) model is used to scale the extracted manual KPVs such that the parameters can be executed by the robotic platform, while still maintaining an equivalent material removal profile. In the first experimental trial with the designed robotic finishing strategy using this approach, the work-piece could be finished to within 0.7 mm of the desired shape.	algorithm;belt machine;bridging (networking);conformance testing;finalize (optical discs);grinder (biohacking);industrial robot;iteration;mathematical optimization;mobile device;programmer;self-replicating machine;sensor;spline (mathematics)	Wu Xin Ng;Hau Kong Chan;Wee Kin Teo;I-Ming Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2015.2474708	robot;computer vision;simulation;shape;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;engineering drawing;force;mechanical engineering	Robotics	69.90770597490946	-33.00938532503409	10429

Since the dynamics based method such as the point-contact method utilizes the inherent dynamics of the robot, an efficient walking can be realized compared with the model based method. However, the stable range of the point-contact method is small and the robustness of the walking is not large enough for practical use. In order to increase robustness of the point-contact method, this paper proposes a swing leg retraction and a double support phase for the point-contact method. The swing leg retraction enhances the convergence range of the walking system; also, by use of the double support phase, the robot dynamics converges to a stable orbit even if a disturbance happens at a foot-contact. Finally, the proposed biped walking algorithm is verified by experiments.	algorithm;experiment;robot	Tadayoshi Aoyama;Kousuke Sekiyama;Zhiguo Lu;Taisuke Kobayashi;Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Toshio Fukuda	2012	2012 12th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids 2012)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2012.6651557	robust control;simulation;gait analysis;convergence;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control	Robotics	66.36271352984717	-17.46418306385028	10430

The authors reported poor performance from H-PMHT and described several deficiencies of the algorithm. This note highlights unnecessary assumptions made in the assessment of H-PMHT and repeats two of the simulation examples after relaxing them. We demonstrate a substantial improvement in performance compared with the originally published results. The simulation example is also shown to be a relatively high signal to noise problem and good performance is obtained from a conventional detect-then-track algorithm.		Samuel J.

Previous works in teleoperated robotic surgery do not consider the real behavior of the environment, which was supposed to be only elastic. However, new surgical procedures in which the environment dynamics plays a crucial role start emerging as a result of technological progress. In robotic assisted beating-heart surgery, for instance, the dynamics of the contact between surgical tools and soft tissues has an impact not only in the performance of the force control task but also in the performance of the teleoperation control scheme in terms of transparency and stability. Therefore, a more realistic description of the environment has to be adopted in order to safely operate during robot-patient interaction. For this purpose, a viscoelastic contact model is introduced into the bilateral teleoperation scheme, and a performance study is provided. The obtained results show the advantages of the selected approach when targeting teleoperated surgical interventions in which the interaction dynamics has become a significant issue.	algorithm;bilateral filter;frequency analysis;haptic technology;mathematical model;robot;simulation	L.

The VRCC has a simple structure to change the position of compliance center and to lock the VRCC. The VRCC consists of a top plate, a bottom plate and two modified elastomer shear pads (ESP). The modified ESP has a hole in its stiffness axis, and a stiffness adjusting rod (SAR) is inserted into the hole of the ESP. The stiffness of the modified ESP can be adjusted according to the insertion depth of the SAR so that the compliance center of the VRCC, which depends on the stiffness of the ESP, can be adjusted freely. Furthermore, by passing the SAR through the modified ESP, the VRCC can be locked easily. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed VRCC, a prototype VRCC is made and the variation of the compliance center is measured according to the insertion depth of the SAR. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated to reduce the number of machine tools which were used in connecting electric plugs in factory. But, this work is also applied to assembly machines which require inserting a round peg into a round hole. The existing machine tool can connect only one electric peg with fixed length, so various machine tools are needed according to the lengths of plugs. The proposed idea shows the way to solve this problem. By extending working capacity of the machine tool, it is possible that electric plugs with various lengths are connected by one machine tool and, consequently, the changing time and cost of machine tools can be reduced. The developed method removes changing of the machine tool. However, manual adjustment of the proposed machine tool is still needed to connect electric plugs with various lengths. Therefore, in the future research, motorized adjusting structure will be added to the proposed idea to improve manual adjustment of the machine tool.	contact pad;esp game;optic axis of a crystal;prototype;remote center compliance;robot	Sangcheol Lee	2005	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2005.844437	structural engineering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;operating system;elastomer;robotics;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	Robotics	80.84259499978714	-20.043236776814457	10506

Although the stabilisation by nondelay feedback controls for such equations has been discussed by several authors, there is so far little on the stabilisation by delay feedback controls and our aim here is mainly to close the gap. To make our theory more understandable as well as to avoid complicated notations, we will restrict our underlying hybrid stochastic differential equations to a relatively simple form. However our theory can certainly be developed to cope with much more general equations without any difficulty.	feedback;time complexity	Xuerong Mao;James Lam;Lirong Huang	2008	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2008.05.002	markov chain;mathematical optimization;stochastic differential equation;linear matrix inequality;calculus;delay differential equation;control theory;brownian motion;mathematics;distributed parameter system;exponential stability;differential equation;statistics	AI	73.99459092191873	-1.0198988659102064	10523

Using triangular waveform voltage as the excitation signal, the response current during one duty cycle is sampled to construct a measurement vector. The measurement matrix is then constructed by the measurement vectors obtained from different measurements. After being processed by PCA, the changing information of solution impedance is contained in the loading vectors while the response current and noise information is contained in the score vectors. The measurement results of impedance variation by the proposed signal processing method are independent of the equivalent impedance model. The noise-induced problems encountered during equivalent impedance calculation are therefore avoided, and the real-time variation information of noise in the electrode-electrolyte interface can be extracted at the same time. Planar-interdigitated electrodes are experimentally tested for monitoring the KCl concentration variation process. Experimental results indicate that the measured impedance variation curve reflects the changing process of solution conductivity, and the amplitude distribution of the noise during one duty cycle can be utilized to analyze the contact conditions of the electrode and electrolyte interface.	characteristic impedance;contain (action);duty cycle;equivalent circuit;excitation;experiment;extraction;interface device component;kcl compound;nominal impedance;optical line termination;principal component analysis;principal component analysis;quantitative impedance;real-time clock;sampling - surgical action;sed;signal processing;sly 3: honor among thieves;solutions;waveform;electrode;voltage	Shanzhi Xu;Yonggui Dong	2016		10.3390/s16040576	impedance matching;wave impedance;electronic engineering;chemistry;damping factor;engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry;image impedance;conductivity;dual impedance;quarter-wave impedance transformer;impedance bridging;physical chemistry;input impedance;output impedance;voltage source;negative impedance converter;characteristic impedance;principal component analysis	EDA	90.6959139913547	-18.78656062214615	10526

The active site of plastocyanin is described as an entatic state whereby its structure represents a compromise between the structures favored by the oxidized and reduced forms. In this study, the nature of the entatic state is investigated through density functional theory-based hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations. The strain energy is computed to be 12.8 kcal/mol and 14.5 kcal/mol for the oxidized and reduced forms of the protein, indicating that the active site has an intermediate structure. It is shown that the energy gap between the oxidized and reduced forms varies significantly with the fluctuations in the structure of the active site at room temperature. An accurate determination of the reorganization energy requires averaging over conformation and a large region of the protein around the active site to be treated at the quantum mechanical level. © 2016 The Authors.

We consider a network of agents whose mission is to estimate a parameter from the time series locally observed by the agents. Our estimator works online and asynchronously: it starts processing data as they arrive with no need of a reference clock, common to all the agents. Agents update some local summary statistics using recent data (E-step), then share these statistics with theirs neighbors in order to eventually reach a consensus (gossip step), and finally use them to generate individual estimates of the unknown parameter (M-step). Our algorithm is shown to converge under mild conditions on the gossip protocol, freeing the network from feedback communications; hence making this DEM algorithm particularly well suited to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).	clock signal;converge;data model;expectation–maximization algorithm;gossip protocol;online and offline;time series	Gemma Morral;Pascal Bianchi;Jérémie Jakubowicz	2012	2012 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)	10.1109/SSP.2012.6319689	mathematical optimization;gossip protocol;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing	ML	53.808552485513864	3.6973638955133272	10535

The proposed embedded system is not based on dedicated and expensive motor controllers but on a general purpose embedded board equipped with a 32bit microcontroller. For each motor the embedded system can selectively operate in three different control modes: torque, speed and position, to control concurrently at least three DC motors with different control tasks. Each motor is simply equipped with a rotary encoder and a low-cost current sensor which provide measurements of velocity and current as feedback signals. The experimental results show that the embedded controller is able to regulate the motor variables as expected by simulation results. Although the embedded controller was designed for the proposed robotic application, it is applicable to other systems where the concurrent control of several DC-motors is required.	32-bit;embedded controller;embedded system;encoder;microcontroller;robot leg;rotary woofer;sensor;simulation;velocity (software development)	Andrea Bonci;Sauro Longhi;Massimiliano Pirani;Giuseppe Antonio Scala	2015	2015 12th International Workshop on Intelligent Solutions in Embedded Systems (WISES)		control engineering;embedded system;computer science;control system;electrical engineering;dc motor;robotics;scientific control;direct torque control	Robotics	72.29399193173721	-24.81088045795988	10574

By employing impulsive control theory and some analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions ensuring μ-stability, including uniform stability, (global) asymptotical stability, and (global) exponential stability, are derived. It is shown that an unstable delay neural network, especially for the case of unbounded time-varying delays, can be stabilized and has μ-stability via proper impulsive control strategies. Three numerical examples and their simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.	artificial neural network;asymptote;computer simulation;control theory;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;time complexity	Xiaodi Li;Shiji Song;Jianhong Wu	2017	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-017-9097-1	mathematical optimization;control theory;artificial neural network;mathematics;exponential stability	ML	72.65313660464983	1.8020949411368319	10598

In other environments, speakers must use an oxygen face mask. In both situations, the intelligibility of encoded speech falls below an acceptable level. We have developed a technique for improving speech quality in these situations. Previous speech improvement methods have focused on processing the corrupted signal after it has been induced by the microphone. These methods have not performed adequately. In our technique, speech anomalies are attenuated by a microphone array before speech and noise become mixed into a signal. Our microphone array prototype has shown excellent performance. In an example of speech taken aboard an E2C aircraft, this noise-canceling microphone array improved the speech-to-noise ratio by as much as 18 dB. When the same technique is used in a face mask, muffled speech was almost completely restored to high quality speech.	acoustic cryptanalysis;display resolution;intelligibility (philosophy);microphone;prototype;speech enhancement	George S.

Morgansen Aeronautics and Astronautics Collision avoidance is an important aspect of multivehicle coordination because it prevents vehicles from disrupting or destroying each other. The work contained in this dissertation concerns a novel approach to the n-vehicle collision avoidance problem. The vehicle model used here allows for three-dimensional movement and represents a wide range of vehicles. The algorithm works in conjunction with any desired controller to guarantee all vehicles remain free of collisions while attempting to follow their desired control. This algorithm is reactive and distributed, making it well-suited for real-time applications, and explicitly accounts for actuation limits. A robustness analysis is presented which provides a means to account for delays and unmodeled dynamics. Robustness to an adversarial vehicle is also presented.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;collision detection;real-time clock	Emmett Lalish;Kristi A. Morgansen	2012	Auton.

The basic principle is that induced eddy currents are used to heat a ferromagnetic material as it passes through a series of coils. Because of the importance of such systems, there has been on-going interest in their design and operation. Past work includes model development from physical principles and optimal design of operational practices. However, previous work has invariably been based on open-loop strategies. Our work is aimed at the design of a closed-loop control strategy incorporating feedback from the available measurements. This paper reports initial work including model development and calibration together with preliminary control system design.

The key to achieve a high resolution is to keep a constant resistance between the other end of the specimen contacting to the sliding probe. To achieve this objective, we have developed several important techniques including multipoint continuous sliding, flexible probes, and specimen-shape adapting based on nanorobotic manipulation inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). With a copper-nanowire-tipped probe, we have shown that a flexible probe facilitates the contact force control. The adapting of the shape of a probe tip is significant for keeping a constant contact area between the probe and the specimen. This can be implemented by using a soft probe or a tip with a shape resembling the profile of the specimen. Here we show that by flowing copper from a nanotube probe against the specimen, it is possible to make a well adapted shape of the tip to the specimen after the copper cooled down. By avoiding stick-slip motion and controlling the contact force and area, it will be possible to keep a constant contact resistance between the sliding probe and the specimen, hence significantly improve the measurement resolution. Sliding probe methods are an in situ technique characterized by higher resolution and simplicity in setup as compared with conventional two- and four-terminal methods, respectively. Furthermore, it is superior for local property characterization, which is of particular interest for hetero-structured nanomaterials and defect detection.	biological specimen;electron;multipoint ground;software bug	Zheng Fan;Xinyong Tao;Xiaodong Li;Lixin Dong	2011	2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2011.6094678	carbon;electrical resistance and conductance;transmission electron microscopy;image resolution;nanostructure;contact resistance;contact area;conductivity;nanotechnology;copper;resistance;nanowire	Robotics	89.40026388302239	-14.013997788655319	10643

The implementation in the SWAs of the transition regime coagulation kernel and associated majorant rates is described. The silica particle model of Shekar et al. (2012, J. Aerosol Sci. 44 83–98) was used in conjunction with this coagulation kernel to study the convergence properties of SWAs with a multidimensional particle model. High precision solutions were calculated with two SWAs and also with the established Direct Simulation Algorithm. These solutions, which were generated using large number of computational particles, showed close agreement. It was thus demonstrated that SWAs can be successfully used with complex coagulation kernels and high dimensional particle models to simulate real-world systems.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;central processing unit;computation;converge;kernel (operating system);numerical analysis;numerical partial differential equations;numerical stability;particle system;simulation;variance reduction;world-system	William J.

Coexistence of multiple stable equilibria and chaotic dynamics are demonstrated in this discrete dynamical system. Specifically, 2m stable stationary solutions and their basins of attraction are found for a loop with m-neurons network. The theory is established by formulating parameter conditions according to a geometric observation. The networks are further confirmed to exhibit chaotic dynamics when the magnitudes of inhibitory self-feedback weights are large enough.

Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can perform numerous tasks fearless of unnecessary loss of human life. Lately, to enhance UAV control performance, system identification and states estimation has been an active field of research. This work presents a simulation study that investigates unknown dynamics model parameters estimation of a Quadrotor UAV under presence of noisy feedback signals. The latter constitute a challenge for UAV control performance especially with the presence of uncertainties. Therefore, estimation techniques are usually used to reduce the effect of such uncertainties. In this paper, three estimation methods are presented to estimate unknown parameters of the """"OS4"""" Quadrotor. Those methods are Iterative Bi-Section Shooting method """"IBSS"""", Artificial Neural Network method """"ANN"""", and """"Hybrid ANN_IBSS"""", which is a novel method that integrates ANN with IBSS. The """"Hybrid ANN_IBSS"""" is the main contribution of this work.Percentage error of the estimated parameters is used to evaluate accuracy of the aforementioned methods. Results show that IBSS and ANN are capable of estimating most of the parameters even with the presence of noisy feedback signals. However, their performance lacks accuracy when estimating small-value parameters. On the other hand, Hybrid ANN_IBSS achieved higher estimation accuracy compared to the other two methods. Accurate parameter estimation is expected to enhance reliability of the """"OS4"""" dynamics model and hence improve control quality."""	aerial photography;artificial neural network;estimation theory;iterative method;shooting method;unmanned aerial vehicle	Khaled S.

This study investigates the performance of a soft biologically-inspired artificial fingertip in active exploration tasks. The fingertip sensor replicates the mechanisms within human skin and offers a robust solution that can be used both for tactile sensing and gripping/manipulating objects. The softness of the optical sensor's contact surface also allows safer interactions with objects. High-level tactile features such as edges are extrapolated from the sensor's output and the information is used to generate a tactile image. The work presented in this paper aims to investigate and evaluate this artificial fingertip for 2D shape reconstruction. The sensor was mounted on a robot arm to allow autonomous exploration of different objects. The sensor and a number of human participants were then tested for their abilities to track the raised perimeters of different planar objects and compared. By observing the technique and accuracy of the human subjects, simple but effective parameters were determined in order to evaluate the artificial system's performance. The results prove the capability of the sensor in such active exploration tasks, with a comparable performance to the human subjects despite it using tactile data alone whereas the human participants were also able to use proprioceptive cues.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);compliance behavior;emulator;epidermis;expectation propagation;extrapolation;fingertip dosing unit;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;haptic technology;image sensor;inspiration function;interaction;large;papilla of tongue;performance;physical object;proprioception;proprioceptive disorders;real-time clock;real-time locating system;robotic arm;robotics;robustness (computer science);science;while	Tareq Assaf;Calum Roke;Jonathan Rossiter;Anthony G.

It starts with high fidelity modeling of the robot including nonlinear dynamics, motor model, and impact dynamics. Human data is then used by an optimization algorithm to produce a human-like gait that can be implemented on the robot. To realize the bipedal walking, first a PD controller is utilized to track the optimized trajectory. Next, impedance control parameters are estimated from the experimental data. Finally, the unified PD, impedance torque control law is experimentally realized on the bipedal robot AMBER2. Through the evidence of sustainable and unsupported walking on AMBER2 showing high consistency with the simulated gait, the feasibility of AMBER2 walking scheme will be verified.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;experiment;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot	Wen-Loong Ma;Huihua Zhao;Shishir Kolathaya;Aaron D.

3fe602c569db5a1c0cd73c3f1ccd0329d153c6fd	robot-assisted navigation for a robotic walker with aided user intent		This paper presents an approach to robot-assisted navigation on a mobility assistance context, by learning from the user while helping him navigate efficiently and safely in complex environments. Assistive robots such as robotic walkers provide the ability to support a user's body weight on the upper limbs while walking. However, walkers can add an extra layer of distress due to their specific manipulation constraints. For the users of such devices, lack of dexterous upper limb control can be a considerable problem as it means they may be unable to operate these devices efficiently; users may also have visual impairments that reduce their navigational efficiency. The proposed approach uses a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model and a dynamic window-based local motion planning algorithm. It aims to learn needed corrections in the motion command based on the surrounding environment and the user's intent. The proposed solution handles corrections and guides the user through the environment without collisions while learning and aiding the user when he is unable to operate the device efficiently. The RL based approach was tested in indoor scenarios with a robotic walker platform showing preliminary promising results.	algorithm;amiga walker;assistive technology;automated planning and scheduling;human body weight;information systems research;inventory;motion planning;real life;reinforcement learning;robot	Luis Garrote;João Paulo;Joao Perdiz;Paulo Peixoto;Urbano Jose C.

We design a linear quadratic optimal controller to stabilize ZMP. The two kinds of ZMP stabilization strategies (Fixed ZMP and Relaxed ZMP) are proposed. The highly geared manipulator is controlled by a Cartesian computed torque (CCT) control for compliant motion. A rapid mobile manipulator called KDMR-1 has been developed for its application.

This paper presents a peculiar strategy of application of the impedance control based on kinematic and dynamic models of the manipulator's sections. The control approach is able to deal with unpredicted contacts which can occur in unknown locations along the whole manipulator while the resulting contact forces don't need to be measured or estimated. The control concept is applied to a single section of the Bionic Handling Assistant, but its application can be extended to all the continuum robots modeled with the piecewise constant curvature approach.	characteristic impedance;control theory;mathematical model;nonlinear system;robot;triune continuum paradigm	Lorenzo Toscano;Valentin Falkenhahn;Alexander Hildebrandt;Francesco Braghin;Oliver Sawodny	2015	2015 6th International Conference on Automation, Robotics and Applications (ICARA)	10.1109/ICARA.2015.7081215	dynamics;parallel manipulator;simulation;electrical impedance;control theory;force	Robotics	66.64371326624338	-20.51545091801883	10807

816abfe75bf104db50c1bb825504d4d3a2095ecd	synthesis of cylindrical gears with optimum rolling fatigue strength		This paper presents a procedure for the geometric synthesis of heavy-duty, cylindrical gear drives. Particularly tooth profile forms were generated here which have almost constant contact stresses along their entire line of engagement. The synthesis is based on analysing the properties of the entire meshing zone in detail. The concept of the synthesis is developed by analysing various methods for increasing the load-carrying capacity of gear drives through optimised gear geometries, by analysing and selecting quality criteria for evaluating gears as well as examining the zone of meshing. Based on the concept of synthesis, a method of interactive synthesis is finally worked out with which especially the geometry of cylindrical gear drives can be optimised with regard to their load-carrying capacity or contact strength. The maximum or rather demanded load-carrying capacity or contact strength are used as reference parameters here.

An appendant demarcation device provide for the proper abutting and spacing of each independent print character to prevent or minimize any perceived banding in the printed image. The apparatus includes a device for transporting the medium along a path orthogonal to the print head, a recording station in the path and having a translating head for inking, pring, or otherwise suitable device, for producing single lines or swaths of print in conjunction with the indexed advance of the medium relative to the print head. The transport device is operative to advance a first print line or swath through the recording station to form a first print line, to identify and store the position coordinates of each print line or swath, and to advance the recording medium for successive line or swath printing. The direct position feedback control apparatus also includes demarcation sensing and printing device for relative positioning, whereby the distance between the location of any sensed or printed demarcation reference and the next successive print line is controlled such that each print line will neglect the positioning error in any previous print line or swath.	feature extraction	Shiva Kumar Korikana;V.

In contrast to time-optimal path following, small deviations from a predefined path are acceptable and can be exploited to further reduce the overall motion time. In this paper, we present a new method to compute time-optimal motions around a path. By employing an appropriate change of variables for the robot dynamics to path coordinates, geometric constraints enter the optimal control formulation in a convenient way. The reformulation of the robot dynamics and the path constraints is illustrated with numerical examples.	computation;control theory;exploit (computer security);motion planning;numerical analysis;numerical method;online and offline;optimal control;real life;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot;robot end effector;simulation;testbed	Robin Verschueren;Niels van Duijkeren;Jan Swevers;Moritz Diehl	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525227	control engineering;mathematical optimization;dynamics;vehicle dynamics;optimal control;any-angle path planning;computer science;control theory;mathematics;robot kinematics	Robotics	62.40534371351641	-20.523669295104284	10882

This paper proposes a new methodology named “key joint method” for reducing the energy cost by adjusting an internal stress inside a closed chain. Firstly, we analyze the internal stress theoretically taking the degrees of freedom (DOF) and the number of position actuated joints into consideration, then a practical key joint method is proposed by changing a suitable redundant position controlled joint to be force control. After that, a parametric family is introduced for representing various of possible motions subjected to the robot dynamics and other constraints. Finally, a general optimization method is proposed for planning an energetically efficient multi-contact robot motion taking the motion trajectories and internal stress into consideration. As an example, the pace gait ladder decent motion is taken to explain the principle and realization of the proposed method. As experimental evaluation shows, the key joint method is effective for reducing the energy cost in the multi-contact motion.	angularjs;ladder-des;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;motion planning;optimal control;simulation;velocity (software development)	Zhiguo Lu;Kousuke Sekiyama;Tadayoshi Aoyama;Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Taisuke Kobayashi;Toshio Fukuda	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385887	control engineering;motion control;mobile robot;robot end effector;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning;torque	Robotics	66.1148036183955	-20.92664331846897	10911

Inscription images in general have no distinction between the text layer and background layer due to absence of color difference and possess highly correlated signals and noise. The proposed technique provides a suitable method to separate the text layer from the historic inscription images by considering the problem as blind source separation which aims to calculate the independent components from a linear mixture of source signals, by maximizing a contrast function based on higher order cumulants. Further, the results are compared with existing ICA based techniques like NGFICA and Fast-ICA.	binary image;blind signal separation;fast fourier transform;fastica;independent computing architecture;source separation	N.

Model synthesis extends the 2D texture synthesis problem into higher dimensions and can be used to model many different objects and environments. The user only needs to provide an appropriate example model and does not need to provide any other instructions about how to generate the model. Model synthesis can be used to create symmetric models, models that change over time, and models that fit soft constraints. There are two important differences between our method and existing texture synthesis algorithms. The first is the use of a global search to find potential conflicts before adding new material to the model. The second difference is that we divide the problem of generating a large model into smaller subproblems which are easier to solve.	3d modeling;algorithm;finite difference;texture synthesis	Paul Merrell	2007		10.1145/1230100.1230119	computer vision;simulation;user modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;procedural modeling;texture synthesis	Graphics	65.17620273740795	-47.03403613495792	11072

The characteristics of a shaking system are considered to be nonlinear and variable because of the influence of the test piece. In order to compensation for this problem, the influence of the disturbance force needs to be suppressed. The controller is designed using µ-synthesis by considering the uncertainty of the shaker. Furthermore, since the control performance is improved, an explicit receding horizon control controller is introduced to the 2DOF controller using Multi-Parametric Toolbox. A reference signal which is limited by the system specifications can be partly employed. Finally, a good performance can be realized, as confirmed by experiments conducted using actual equipment.	cocktail shaker sort;displacement mapping;experiment;feedforward neural network;nonlinear system;waveform	Yasuhiro Uchiyama;Takeshi Hatanaka;Masayuki Fujita	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611148	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.99901610043138	-12.548356556288814	11081

The algorithm is adapted to detect plumes of high concentration instead of independent particles. Direct numerical simulation is used to test this adapted search algorithm by detection of high concentration levels in turbulent channel flows with a Schmidt number ScSc of 1.0 and Reynolds numbers ReRe of 5600 and 28000.#R##N##R##N#For the direct numerical simulation with the adapted algorithm, there is a positive relation between the initial distances to the source and the running time, which holds for Re=5600Re=5600 but which is not observed at Re=28000Re=28000. This is caused by the low Schmidt number and the high velocity, which leads the searcher to the source very fast after the first detection of a high concentration level.#R##N##R##N#The search algorithm is also tested in reverse to detect whether a fluid is well-mixed. The time required for a detection of a too high or low concentration and the number of detections are used as measures for success. By applying the algorithm to some prescribed concentration distributions in two dimensions, it is found that the method is very sensitive to the threshold values for the mixing indicators.	turbulence	A.

The potentiality of the proposed methodology and the feasibility of constructing the rotor system in SimMechanics are also investigated in this paper.	computer-aided design;fault tolerance;finite element method;linear matrix inequality;mathematical model;modal logic;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;simulink	Gang Li;Rui Pan;Qing Zhao	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526727	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.70774489803703	-8.362289779491933	11166

A shoe for everyone: it is a change in the production model in which each individual’s foot is the main focus, replacing traditional size systems based on population means. This paradigm shift represents a major effort for the industry, for which the design and not production becomes the main bottleneck. It is therefore necessary to accelerate the design process by improving the accuracy of current methods. The starting point for making a shoe that fits the client’s foot anatomy is scanning the surface of the foot. Automated foot model reconstruction is accomplished through the use of the self-organising growing neural gas (GNG) network, which is able to topographically map the low dimension of the network to the high dimension of the manifold of the scanner acquisitions without requiring a priori knowledge of the structure of the input space. The GNG obtains a surface representation adapted to the topology of the foot, is accurate, tolerant to noise, and eliminates outliers. It also improves the reconstruction in “dark” areas where the scanner does not obtain information: the heel and toe areas. The method reconstructs the foot surface 4 times more accurately than other well-known methods. The method is generic and easily extensible to other industrial objects that need to be digitized and reconstructed with accuracy and efficiency requirements. ã 2015 Elsevier B.V.

89b8b781e8fc1370c95d3a267cd3ef7e5a62a49d	a performance oriented multi-loop constrained adaptive robust tracking control of one-degree-of-freedom mechanical systems: theory and experiments	input saturation;motion control;computacion informatica;constrained control;adaptive control;grupo de excelencia;linear motors;ciencias basicas y experimentales	A performance oriented multi-loop approach to the adaptive robust tracking control of one-degreeof-freedom mechanical systems with input saturation, state constraints, parametric uncertainties and input disturbances is presented. The control system contains three loops. In the outer loop, constrained optimization algorithms are developed to generate a replanned trajectory on-line at a low sampling rate so that the converging speed of the overall system response to the desired target is maximized while not causing input saturation and the violation of state constraints. In the inner loop, a constrained adaptive robust control (ARC) law is synthesized and implemented at high sampling rate to achieve the required robust tracking performanceswith respect to the replanned trajectory evenwith various types of uncertainties and input saturation. In the middle loop, a set-membership identification (SMI) algorithm is implemented to obtain a tighter estimate of the upper bound of the inertia so that more aggressive replanned trajectory could be used to further improve the overall system response speed. Interaction of the three loops is explicitly characterized by a set of inequalities that the design variables of each loop have to satisfy. It is theoretically shown that the resulting closed-loop system can track feasible desired trajectories with a guaranteed converging time and steady-state tracking accuracy without violating the state constraints. Experiments have been carried out on a linear motor driven industrial positioning system to compare the proposed multi-loop constrained ARC algorithm with some of the traditional control algorithms. Comparative experimental results obtained confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over existing ones. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the heterogeneity in data representation or data configuration, it is difficult to efficiently render multiple medical objects in high quality. In this paper, we present a novel intermixing scheme for fusion rendering of multiple medical objects while preserving the real-time performance. First, we present an in-slab visibility interpolation method for the representation of subdivided slabs. Second, we introduce virtual zSlab, which extends an infinitely thin boundary (such as polygonal objects) into a slab with a finite thickness. Finally, based on virtual zSlab and in-slab visibility interpolation, we propose a slab-based visibility intermixing method with the newly proposed rendering pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more effective multiple-object renderings in terms of rendering quality, compared to conventional approaches. And proposed intermixing scheme provides high-quality intermixing results for the visualization of intersecting and overlapping surfaces by resolving aliasing and z-fighting problems. Moreover, two case studies are presented that apply the proposed method to the real clinical applications. These case studies manifest that the proposed method has the outstanding advantages of the rendering independency and reusability.

A force field for the water-acetone interaction is presented. To this purpose we have considered four interaction centers on the acetone molecule and only one on the small water molecule. Then, the non electrostatic intermolecular interaction between pairs of interaction centers placed on different molecules has been modeled adopting Improved Lennard-Jones (ILJ) functions, which sum has been combined with the electrostatic interaction contribution (derived from the charge distributions on the molecules). The potential model has been used to perform some preliminary Molecular Dynamic simulations of the density at 298.15 K of temperature and 1 atm of pressure for two different values of the acetone molar fractions, xacet = 0.745 and 0.986. The systems, formed by 1000 molecules, were previously thermalized at the selected temperature using the NVT ensemble. Production runs have been performed from the equilibrated systems using the NpT ensemble.	computation;computational science;ensemble kalman filter;force field (chemistry);jones calculus;lennard-jones potential;neural ensemble;simulation	Giuseppe Borruso;Carmelo Maria Torre;Ana Maria A.

It is proposed that a formulation of thermodynamics as an action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a new investigation of these matters. This paper formulates the thermodynamics of ideal gases in a constant gravitational field in terms of the Gibbsean action principle. This approach, in the simplest cases, does not deviate from standard practice, but it lays the foundations for a more systematic approach to the various extensions, such as the incorporation of radiation, the consideration of mixtures and the integration with general relativity. We study the interaction between an ideal gas and the photon gas and the propagation of sound in a vertical, isothermal column. We determine the entropy that allows for the popular isothermal equilibrium and introduce the study of the associated adiabatic dynamics. This leads to the suggestion that the equilibrium of an ideal gas must be isentropic, in which case, the role of solar radiation would be merely to compensate for the loss of energy by radiation into the cosmos. An experiment with a centrifuge is proposed, to determine the influence of gravitation on the equilibrium distribution with a very high degree of precision.	action (physics);calculus of variations;comment (computer programming);essence;experiment;gradient;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);markov chain;maxima and minima;numerical relativity;persistence (computer science);radiation hardening;software propagation;stellar (payment network);variational principle;velocity (software development)	Christian Frønsdal	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16031515	classical mechanics;photon gas;thermodynamic equilibrium;theoretical physics;sunlight;general relativity;mathematics;atmosphere;thermodynamics;physics;quantum mechanics	Vision	91.05253679402576	0.863056225502506	11244

The GC-O technique is already widely used for the evaluation of food aromas and its application in environmental fields is increasing, thus moving the odor emission assessment from the solely olfactometric evaluations to the characterization of the volatile components responsible for odor nuisance. The aim of this paper is to describe the state of the art of gas chromatography-olfactometry methodology, considering the different approaches regarding the operational conditions and the different methods for evaluating the olfactometric detection of odor compounds. The potentials of GC-O are described highlighting the improvements in this methodology relative to other conventional approaches used for odor detection, such as sensoristic, sensorial and the traditional gas chromatographic methods. The paper also provides an examination of the different fields of application of the GC-O, principally related to fragrances and food aromas, odor nuisance produced by anthropic activities and odorous compounds emitted by materials and medical applications.	anosmia;complex mixtures;conflict (psychology);emoticon;evaluation;flatulence;gas chromatography;halitosis;odors;perfume;mixture	Magda Brattoli;Ezia Cisternino;Paolo Rosario Dambruoso;Gianluigi de Gennaro;Pasquale Giungato;Antonio Mazzone;Jolanda Palmisani;Maria Luisa Tutino	2013		10.3390/s131216759	chromatography;olfactometer;chemistry;analytical chemistry;environmental chemistry;olfaction	SE	96.31699326699659	-18.78365552274192	11263

The result is a set of two parameters, the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio, that can be used for more complex simulations, or force feedback applications like virtual surgery, for example.

Moreover, multichannel speech presence probabilities are also estimated within a unified framework. A number of experimental results show that the proposed spectro-temporal filtering method improves the performance of multichannel speech enhancement.	algorithm;computation;interdependence;microphone;noise power;noise reduction;self-propelled particles;short-time fourier transform;spectral density;speech enhancement;unified framework	Yu Gwang Jin;Jong Won Shin;Nam Soo Kim	2014	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2014.2302897	fourier transform;speech recognition;computer science;mathematics	Vision	82.84443126583191	-36.07595070449805	11328

The basic principle is to entangle two or multiple stable linear subsystems by entanglement functions to form an artificial chaotic system such that each of them evolves in a chaotic manner. Firstly, a new attractor, entangling a two-dimensional linear subsystem and a one-dimensional one by sine function, is presented as an example. Dynamical analysis shows that both entangled subsystems are bounded and all equilibra are unstable saddle points when chaos entanglement is achieved. Also, numerical computation shows that this system has one positive Lyapunov exponent, which implies chaos. Furthermore, two conditions are given to achieve chaos entanglement. Along this way, by different linear subsystems and different entanglement functions, a variety of novel chaotic attractors have been created and abundant complex dynamics are exhibited. Our discovery indicates that it is not difficult any more to construct new artificial chaotic systems/networks for engineering applications such as chaos-based secure communication. Finally, a possible circuit is given to realize these new chaotic attractors.	chaos theory;complex dynamics;computation;computer simulation;control theory;digraphs and trigraphs;dynamical system;linear system;lyapunov fractal;nl-complete;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;quantum entanglement;secure communication	Hongtao Zhang;Xinzhi Liu;Xuemin Shen;Jun Liu	2013	I.

An integrated approach that combines data-based fault identification and stability-based fault accommodation is developed on the basis of a suitable reduced-order model of the infinite-dimensional system. A moving-horizon parameter estimation scheme is developed to estimate on-line the size and location of the faults using the sampled output and input data. Once the location and magnitude of the fault are identified and communicated to the controller, fault accommodation takes place by means of adjusting the controller and estimator design parameters, and/or adjusting the control actuator locations. The selection of the appropriate strategy is made based on the estimated fault size and the characterization of the networked closed-loop stability region. The results are illustrated using a simulated diffusion-reaction process example.	distributed computing;estimation theory;fault tolerance;online and offline;sensor	Di Peng;Nael H.

I n particular, teleoperated mobile robots are needed t o have some kinds of backup system when the operator is blind for remote situation owing to the failure of vision system. I n the previous work [l], the idea of artificial force reflection was proposed to enhance the reliablity of operation when the mobile robot travels on the plain ground. I n this paper, we extend previous results to help the teleoperator even when the robot climbs stairs. The extended artificial force reflection method has two modes: traveling on the plain ground and climbing stairs. When traveling on the plain ground, the force information is artificially generated by using the range data f rom the environment while generating the impluse force when climbing stairs. To verify the validity of our algorithm, we develop the simulator which consists of the joystick and the visual display system. Through some experiments using this system, we confirm the validity and effectiveness of our new idea of artificial force reflection in the teleoperated mobile robot. 0-7803-5184-3/99/$10.00	3d scanner;algorithm;backup;experiment;feedback;joystick;mobile robot;telerobotics	Sun-Gi Hong;Ju-Jang Lee;Seungho Kim	1999		10.1109/IROS.1999.811726	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;machine vision;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	62.60868022720875	-30.376198105160643	11487

To obtain the maximum yield in a bioprocess, it is important to measure key variables, such as enzymatic activity. The conventional method for monitoring hydrolytic activity is to take out a sample from the bioreactor to be analyzed off-line at the laboratory. The disadvantage of this approach is the long time required to recover the information from the process, hindering the possibility to develop control systems. New strategies to monitor lipase/esterase activity are necessary. In this context and in the first approach, we proposed a lab-made sequential injection analysis system to analyze off-line samples from shake flasks. Lipase/esterase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as the substrate. The sequential injection analysis allowed us to measure the hydrolytic activity from a sample without dilution in a linear range from 0.05-1.60 U/mL, with the capability to reach sample dilutions up to 1000 times, a sampling frequency of five samples/h, with a kinetic reaction of 5 min and a relative standard deviation of 8.75%. The results are promising to monitor lipase/esterase activity in real time, in which optimization and control strategies can be designed.	ansi escape code;analyzer device component;biochemical reaction;bioreactors;butyrates;calb1 gene;control system;enzymes;esterases;kinetics;lipase;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mixer device component;noise-induced hearing loss;one thousand;online and offline;sampling (signal processing);standard deviation;esterase activity	Jorge Pliego;Juan Carlos Mateos;Jorge Rodriguez;Francisco Valero;Mireia Baeza;Ricardo Femat;Rosa Camacho;Georgina Sandoval;Enrique J.

095c7d72c76cef055d3b5f2df26e3f8d8882a4a0	on simplifying deformation of smooth manifolds defined by large weighted point sets		We present a simple and efficient algorithm for deformation between significantly different objects, which does not require any forms of similarity or correspondence. In our previous work, the algorithm, which is called general skin deformation, requires a complexity of Om 2 n 2. In this paper, we improve the complexity from Om 2 n 2 to Om 2+n 2 by proposing a simplified deformation process. This improvement greatly reduces the program running time and unnecessary topology changes. Moreover, it makes some impossible deformation with large input sets to become possible.

cd3bb54f6f2064a258068b71729b6f8f604ea2a1	live user-guided intrinsic video for static scenes		We present a novel real-time approach for user-guided intrinsic decomposition of static scenes captured by an RGB-D sensor. In the first step, we acquire a three-dimensional representation of the scene using a dense volumetric reconstruction framework. The obtained reconstruction serves as a proxy to densely fuse reflectance estimates and to store user-provided constraints in three-dimensional space. User constraints, in the form of constant shading and reflectance strokes, can be placed directly on the real-world geometry using an intuitive touch-based interaction metaphor, or using interactive mouse strokes. Fusing the decomposition results and constraints in three-dimensional space allows for robust propagation of this information to novel views by re-projection. We leverage this information to improve on the decomposition quality of existing intrinsic video decomposition techniques by further constraining the ill-posed decomposition problem. In addition to improved decomposition quality, we show a variety of live augmented reality applications such as recoloring of objects, relighting of scenes and editing of material appearance.

This bio-inspired actuation concept enables an ultra lightweight and highly safe robot design that is very well suited for physical human-robot interaction. However, the high elasticity in the joint actuation imposes challenges on robot control, especially for the usual case that no joint torque measurements are available. In this paper, a trajectory tracking controller for this highly compliant robot is presented which does not need explicit joint torque measurements as required by related approaches for robots with elastic joints. A control concept is proposed which aims to be robust against inaccuracies in various model parameters (like robot dynamics, position initialization, drive train stiffness, transmission ratio and friction). It compensates for changes in robot dynamics by equilibrium controlled stiffness. The proposed controller is successfully applied and evaluated in simulated and physical experiments with the robot.	angularjs;british informatics olympiad;elasticity (data store);experiment;human–robot interaction;motion compensation;network switch;pid;robot control;robot end effector;robotic arm;sensor;settling time;simulation;yaws	Jerome Kirchhoff;Oskar von Stryk	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2016.7576949	control engineering;robot end effector;simulation;articulated robot;engineering;arm solution;control theory;robot control;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	67.76588207072989	-19.527734774712844	11550

Classic façade concepts usually work with static elements like glass, metal or composite panels that primarily provide protection against the elements, and an additional layer of active systems that manage dynamic tasks like light protection or thermal regulation. Kinematic shell elements offer new ways to incorporate multiple dynamic functionalities into cladding elements, and thus can help to generate new active, efficient and aesthetic envelopes.

The target for the surgery is a prenatal temporary tracheal occlusion, which enlarges the fetal lungs, and is a promising procedure for severe cases. A balloon is supposed to be inserted for tracheal occlusion using the manipulator. We propose a novel robotic manipulator for intrauterine fetal surgery for tracheal occlusion. In this study, the 3-unit robotic manipulator with ball joint-shaped arthroses and a shaft diameter of 2.4 mm using a wire-driven mechanism has been developed to approach the fetal trachea without the risk of damage to fetal tissue. The robotic manipulator has a thin structure and 7 degrees of freedom to avoid damage to the fragile fetal cells. However, the positioning control of the robotic manipulator is very difficult. In this paper, the mechanism of the robotic manipulator positioning control was confirmed by measuring the motion of each unit through the experiment. Additionally, a simulation was developed to estimate the mechanism of the robotic manipulator positioning control, and an approach method was considered. The results of the evaluation experiment suggested that the robotic manipulator could approach the fetal trachea through the mouth, and that the contact force was controlled to under 0.05 [N].	computational diffie–hellman assumption;robot;simulation	Bo Zhang;Yoshinari Maeda;Toshio Chiba;Yo Kobayashi;Masakatsu G.

There are a lot of different approaches tackling this problem; however, there is no general solution. The complexity and the skill of a possible grasping motion depend hardly on a particular robot. In this paper we analyze the kinematic and sensory grasping abilities of the humanoid robot Nao. Its kinematic constraints and hand’s mechanical structure represent an interesting case of study due to lack of actuators for fingers and the limited computation power. After describing the platform and studying its capabilities, we propose some simple controllers and we present a benchmark based on some experimental data.	adaptive filter;benchmark (computing);computation;humanoid robot;nao (robot);robustness (computer science);sensor	Heinrich Mellmann;Giuseppe Cotugno	2011	Fundam.

The predictive functional control with small on-line computation can arrive to enhance the precision of the flatness control. The simulation results of the flatness control system indicate that the system’s dynamic response performance is advanced observably, and it also has more favorable characteristics than using conventional PID controller.	control system	Tian-wu Liu;Quan Yang;Anrui He;Xiao-zhong Du;Wen-quan Sun;Xiaodong Wang;Yun Zhang	2010		10.1109/CASoN.2010.113	computer science;control system;control theory;feedback	Robotics	61.46304212221359	-10.624225385884197	11580

About 60% of surface mount assembly defects can be attributed to the solder paste stencil printing process. This paper proposes a neurofuzzy-based quality-control system for the fine pitch stencil printing process. The neurofuzzy approach is used to model the nonlinear behavior of the stencil printing process. Eight control variables are defined for process planning and control, including stencil thickness, component pitch, aperture area, snap-off height, squeegee speed, squeegee pressure, solder paste viscosity, and solder paste particle size. The response variables are the volume and height of solder paste deposited. The values of the response variables provide indicators for identifying potential quality problems. A 38–3 fractional factorial experimental design is conducted to collect structured data to augment those collected from the production line for neurofuzzy learning and modeling. Visual basic programming language is then used for both rule retrieval and graphical-user-interface modeling. The effectiveness of the proposed system is illustrated through a real-world application.	control system;stencil printing;surface-mount technology	Taho Yang;Tsung-Nan Tsai	2004	J.

The present work developed a detection and characterization method of shrinkage characteristic based on computer vision. Effect of types and dimensions of tobacco lamina on the shrinkage characteristic were investigated and shrinkage rate variation at different drying stages was also analyzed by this method. The results show that percentage reduction of area, which is obtained by detecting tobacco lamina area before and after drying, can be used to reflect the shrinkage characteristic of tobacco lamina. RSD of measurement results by this method is less than 6% under test conditions. Compared with upper tobacco leaf, middle tobacco leaf shows the higher shrinkage rate of 14.3%. Dimensions of tobacco lamina also have significant effect on its shrinkage characteristic. The larger size (up 30mm mesh) tobacco lamina shows a higher shrinkage rate. Shrinkage rate of tobacco lamina is closely related to moisture content variation during drying. The shrinkage of tobacco lamina during drying mainly occurs within the moisture content range of 20% to 14%.	computer vision	Wenkui Zhu;Zhaogai Wang;Delong Xu;Jinsong Du	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-54344-9_37	materials science;structural engineering;composite material;forensic engineering	Vision	88.42674594492146	-12.684557967869448	11631

A novel algebraic approach, based on a sequence of matrices and formulated using the Gauss-Jordan (G-J) elimination algorithm (stable and efficient in memory usage), was proposed and compared to a native iterative procedure using soil C data from 13 European grassland sites. The advantage of the algebraic approach over the iterative method is an enhanced accuracy of C allocation to soil pools and a faster convergence (6-20 times). Its value was discussed in the context of SOM research and modelling.

The model comprises the coupled processes of mixture evaporation, multi-component flow with composition-dependent fluid properties and thermal effects. Based on representative examples of water–glycerol and water–ethanol droplets, regular and chaotic examples of solutal Marangoni flows are discussed. Furthermore, the relevance of the substrate thickness for the evaporative cooling of volatile binary mixture droplets is pointed out. It is shown how the evaporation of the more volatile component can drastically decrease the interface temperature, so that ambient vapor of the less volatile component condenses on the droplet. Finally, results of this model are compared with corresponding results of a lubrication theory model, showing that the application of lubrication theory can cause considerable errors even for moderate contact angles of 40°.	evaporation;finite element method	Christian Diddens	2017	J.

Developed sensors integrated in implants require adequate energy supply, which in most cases is achieved by inductive coupling and complex data telemetry. In order to avoid a telemetric apparatus, we developed a passive concept of a novel in vivo method to improve diagnostic investigations of total hip replacement loosening. A mechano-acoustical sensor, attached on small membranes inside the femoral hip stem, is proposed and enables osseous anchorage detection. The sensor is excited and detected by extracorporeal coils. First functional models show significant differences between different material layers located at the membrane. The novel in vivo sensor system has a promising potential to detect implant loosening.	best, worst and average case;inductive coupling;loading coil;mathematical optimization;radio frequency;sensor;video-in video-out	Cathérine Ruther;Daniel Kluess;Andreas Fritsche;Wolfram Mittelmeier;Rainer Bader;Hartmut Ewald	2011			engineering;biomedical engineering	Robotics	94.74019341307503	-21.45374800620816	11666

This work represents a major extension of Galatea, our system for graphics-assisted 2D motion analysis. 3D Galatea permits reconstruction of 3D time-dependent positions from 2D entries in two or more perspective views.  The system supports a general approach for calibrating perspective views. This method, based on work of Sutherland, uses a known 3D reference object to calibrate completely arbitrary perspective projections. A somewhat restricted class of perspective views may be calibrated without an explicit calibration object using another approach developed from photogrammety.  In 2D Galatea, we have used an animated graphics overlay onto the source image to give the analyst feedback regarding current and previous data entries. This capability is extended in 3D Galatea by overlaying auxiliary lines, which are the backprojections of previous 2D entries from one view into other views. This concept amounts to a fourth interpretation of the well-known Roberts homogeneous matrix equation describing perspective projections of 3D space into a 2D image. The auxiliary line is useful in locating a point which is obscured in one of the images, or in determining the correspondence of projected points as seen in different views, which may be ambiguous or easily confused.	computer animation;galatea;graphics;whole earth 'lectronic link	Steven A.

Dynamic instability evaluation is based on the on-line estimation and prediction of the Lateral Load Transfer (LLT) from a vehicle model based on two 2D representations. As off-road vehicles are considered, grip conditions have a large influence. They are here estimated relying on observation theory. Nevertheless, two main behaviours (over/under-steering) may be encountered pending on grip and vehicle configuration. Since only a low cost perception system can be considered in ATV applications, these two opposite dynamics cannot be explicitly discriminated. As a result, two observers are designed, according to the vehicle behaviour, to estimate on-line the terrain properties (grip conditions, global sideslip angle and bank angle) and a “supervisor” selects on-line the right observer. Next, a predictive control algorithm, based on the extrapolation of rider's action and the selected estimated dynamical state, allows the rollover risk to be anticipated, enabling to warn the pilot and to consider the implementation of active actions. Simulations and full-scale experimentations are presented to discuss the efficiency of the proposed solution.	algorithm;archaeopteryx;computation;computer simulation;experiment;extrapolation;full scale;global positioning system;instability;online and offline;race condition;sensor;stepping level	Mathieu Richier;Roland Lenain;Benoit Thuilot;Christophe Debain	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385652	acceleration;control engineering;estimation;simulation;risk analysis;stability;network switch;engineering;control theory;extrapolation;force;model predictive control;statistics	Robotics	62.553765039271276	-15.45685990692905	11724

Due to its high computational expense, most computer games do not provide accurate fracturing features. Those that do typically pre-calculate cracks ahead of time in order to process the break instantaneously, but then only a small number of possible outcomes are available, regardless of how the object is hit. The ideal fracture model for computer games should be fast (things should break instantaneously when there is a collision) and respond to user actions somewhat realistically (if a ball hits the corner of a brick wall, the corner should break off, but not the center of the wall). Most existing fracture modeling techniques were designed for non-real-time computer animations (e.g. [O’Brien and Hodgins August 1999; Smith et al. 2001]) and are both too expensive and too realistic than necessary for computer games. Our model adds a novel multi-stage dynamic refinement scheme to Smith et al. [2001] to reduce the computational cost while retaining the realism of fracture.	algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;computation;interactivity;pc game;real-time transcription;refinement (computing);subdivision surface	Ohan Oda;Stephen Chenney	2005		10.1145/1186954.1187083	geometric algebra	Graphics	68.44534222852629	-48.45249097170653	11736

Reverse engineering of reliefs—extracting existing reliefs from input surfaces—makes it possible to apply them to new items; relief editing tools allow modification of reverseengineered reliefs. This paper presents a novel approach to relief extraction based on differential coordinates, which offers advantages of speed and precise extraction. It also gives the first method in the literature specifically designed for relief editing. The base surface is estimated using normal smoothing and Poisson reconstruction, allowing a relief (which may lie on a smooth or textured input surface) to be automatically extracted by height thresholding. We also provide a range of relief editing tools, also using differential coordinates, permitting both global transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) of the whole relief, as well as local modifications to the relief.

This study employed ISO approach for camera pose determination with the objective of investigating the impact of a good sensor pre-calibration on a poor acquisition geometry. Within the presented works, several flights were conducted on a dike by a small UAV embedded with a metric camera and a GNSS receiver. The multi-lever-arm estimation within the BBA procedure makes it possible to merge image blocks of different configurations such as nadir and oblique images without physical constraints on camera and GNSS antenna positions. The merged image block achieves a better accuracy and the sensor self-calibrated well. The issued sensor calibration is then applied to a less preferable acquisition configuration and the accuracy is significantly improved. For a corridor acquisition scene of about 600 m , a centimetric accuracy is reached with one GCP. With the provided sensor pre-calibration, an accuracy of 3.9 c m is achieved without any GCP.	aerial photography;antenna device component;bachelor of business administration;cns disorder;calibration;drug vehicle;embedded system;embedding;games computers play;merge;numerous;oblique projection;satellite navigation;sensor;unmanned aerial vehicle	Yilin Zhou;Ewelina Rupnik;Suyun Chen;Marc Pierrot Deseilligny	2018		10.3390/s18092783		Vision	57.56477879347227	-39.64172048610409	11751

Iterated function systems (IFS) theory provides a convenient way to describe and classify deterministic fractals in the form of a recursive definition. As a result, it is conceivable to develop image representation schemes based on the IFS parameters that correspond to a given fractal image. In this paper, we consider two distinct problems: an inverse problem and an approximation problem. The inverse problem involves finding the IFS parameters of a signal that is exactly generated via an IFS. We make use of the wavelet transform and of the image moments to solve the inverse problem. The approximation problem involves finding a fractal IFS-generated image whose moments match, either exactly or in a mean squared error sense, a range of moments of the original image. The approximating measures are generated by an IFS model of a special form and provide a general basis for the approximation of arbitrary images. Experimental results verifying our approach will be presented.	approximation algorithm;fractal;image moment;iterated function system;mean squared error;recursion;recursive definition;verification and validation;verifying specimen;wavelet transform	Roberto Rinaldo;Avideh Zakhor	1994	IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society	10.1109/83.336249	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;image processing;inverse problem;signal processing;mathematics;statistics;wavelet transform	Vision	75.47431138907503	-41.68148566979364	11756

1f27b2ac50e9dbe84cb7d040b936c76a48c67fc6	using auction-based task allocation scheme for simulation optimization of search and rescue in disaster relief		Abstract In order to improve the efficiency of search and rescue (SAR) in disaster relief, we optimize the SAR through agent-based simulation in this paper. The Truncated Levy walks model is adopted to simulate rescuers’ search behaviors, and we improve it to fit the disaster environment. An auction-based task allocation scheme is used to develop a cooperative rescue plan. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we illustrate it with the case of landslide disaster relief, and simulate it in three scenarios (fatal, serious and normal). We compare it with non-cooperative rescue plan and the rescue plan based on well-known F-Max-Sum. The simulation results indicate that the cooperative rescue plan could improve the rescue efficiency significantly, and it performs somewhat better than the F-Max-Sum-based approach in regard to some indicators. Furthermore, its low complexity has made it more appropriate for the cooperation among rescue teams than F-Max-Sum. The robustness analysis shows that search radius can affect the rescue efficiency significantly, while the scope of cooperation has little effect on the rescue efficiency. The sensitivity analysis shows that the two parameters, the time limit for completing rescue operations in one buried site and the maximum turning angle for next step, both have great influence on rescue efficiency, and there exist optimal value for both of them in view of rescue efficiency.	mathematical optimization;simulation	Jian Tang;Kejun Zhu;Haixiang Guo;Chengzhu Gong;Can Liao;Shuwen Zhang	2018	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2017.12.014	computer science;search and rescue;time limit;simulation;robustness (computer science);real-time computing;emergency management	AI	55.02091056709396	-25.690179524747755	11797

The proposed method relies on finding a linear ordinary system that possesses the same stability property as the fractional order system. In this way, instead of performing the stability analysis on the fractional order systems, the analysis is converted into the domain of ordinary systems which is well established and well understood. As a useful consequence, we have extended two general tests for robust stability check of ordinary systems to fractional order systems. © 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

6f86e1af269c22e2598dfe53c9ef51a435db3fa2	hybrid iterated kalman particle filter for object tracking problems		Particle Filters (PFs), are widely used where the system is non Linear and non Gaussian. Choosing the importance proposal distribution is a key issue for solving nonlinear filtering problems. Practical object tracking problems encourage researchers to design better candidate for proposal distribution in order to gain better performance. In this correspondence, a new algorithm referred to as the hybrid iterated Kalman particle filter (HIKPF) is proposed. The proposed algorithm is developed from unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) to generate the proposal distribution, which lead to an efficient use of the latest observations and generates more close approximation of the posterior probability density. Comparing with previously suggested methods(e.g PF, PF-EKF, PF-UKF, PF-IEKF), our proposed method shows a better performance and tracking accuracy. The correctness as well as validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through numerical simulation and experiment results.	algorithm;approximation;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);extended kalman filter;iterated function;iteration;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;particle filter	Amr M.

In this work an analysis of the 28nm FDSOI resilience to heavy-ion impacts is undertaken at different temperature and buried oxide (BOX) thickness using TCAD tools. The results show that BOX thickness variation has a low impact on the collected charge (CC) produced by the heavy ion when it funnels through the device, as the CC value varies only by 1.14%. Over a 400K temperature range, the maximum CC variation due to the heavy-ion impact is nearly 18%.	cmos;cyber resilience;die shrink;silicon on insulator;thickness (graph theory);topological insulator;traffic collision avoidance system	Walter E.

In these schemes, however, it is not clear how the information gathered from the training trajectories can be used to synthesize controllers for more general trajectories. Recently, the efficacy of deep learning in inferring helicopter dynamics has been shown. Motivated by the generalization capability of deep learning, this paper investigates whether a neural network based dynamics model can be employed to synthesize control for trajectories different than those used for training. To test this, we learn a quadrotor dynamics model using only translational and only rotational training trajectories, each of which can be controlled independently, and then use it to simultaneously control the yaw and position of a quadrotor, which is non-trivial because of nonlinear couplings between the two motions. We validate our approach in experiments on a quadrotor testbed.	artificial neural network;deep learning;experiment;exploit (computer security);iterative method;nonlinear system;reinforcement learning;testbed;yaws	Somil Bansal;Anayo K.

e22ab8343d4562cbfd95c53c39c78421600214de	object modeling and recognition from sparse, noisy data via voxel depth carving		In this work, we make the case for using volumetric information for shape reconstruction and recognition from noisy depth images. We provide an efficient algorithm, Voxel Depth Carving, which accomplishes this goal. Real-world experiments with lasers, RGBD cameras, and simulated sensors in both 2D and 3D verify the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison to traditional point-cloud based methods. 1 Motivation and Problem Statement 3D sensors are cheaper and more readily available than ever before. Commercial depth sensors, such as Microsoft’s Kinect or the Asus Xtion Pro provide inexpensive, low-latency, colored depth data. However, this comes at the expense of significant noise and missing data [15]. The rise of cheap 3D sensing presents the challenge of using noisy, incomplete depth data for robotic manipulation. Here, we focus on two key perception challenges: shape reconstruction and object recognition, which are necessary for robotic manipulation of everyday objects. Many previous works on object recognition [11] and reconstruction [18] use a point cloud, a set of 3D points which encode data from the sensor. Unfortunately, point clouds throw away important information encoded in depth images: locality of adjacent depth pixels, the implicit ray from the focal point of the depth camera to each point in the cloud, and, importantly, the implicit volumetric information implied by the ray passing through empty space from the camera to the scene. Consequently, corruption from noise and missing data can severely distort a point cloud, reducing its usefulness. Our work aims to exploit and recover the implicit volumetric information encoded in noisy, incomplete depth images. As a result, we are able to reconstruct and recognize objects even in extremely noisy conditions – where the corresponding point cloud is so distorted as to be unrecognizable (Fig.1).	algorithm;cloud computing;distortion;encode;experiment;focal (programming language);image noise;kinect;locality of reference;missing data;outline of object recognition;pixel;point cloud;robot;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse;voxel	Matthew Klingensmith;Martin Herrmann;Siddhartha S.

The initial tool position is traditionally located to contact with two directrices of a ruled surface. The swept profile of the tool is then determined based on the tool motion. By comparing the swept profile with the ruled surface, the tool position is corrected to avoid machining errors. The cutter's swept envelope is further constructed by integrating the intermediate swept profiles, and applied to NC simulation and verification. This paper presents the explicit solution for the swept profile of a taper-end cutter in five-axis ruled surface machining. The relation of the ruled surface geometry, the tool motion and the machining errors is developed. Therefore, the error sources can be detected early and prevented during tool path planning. The explicit swept envelope indicates that the machined surface is not a ruled surface in five-axis ruled surface machining. Manufacturing industries should take extra care in high precision ruled surface machining. Computer illustrations and example demonstrations are shown in this paper. The results reveal that the developed method can accurately position tool location and reduce machining errors for five-axis ruled surface machining.	optic axis of a crystal	John C. J.

a7d76d2ba916d5e57dad70ae8a1b37a204cd6858	navigation of an autonomous tractor for a row-type tree plantation using a laser range finder - development of a point-to-go algorithm	control algorithm;and navigation paths;positioning;point to go;landmarks	It is challenging to develop a control algorithm that uses only one sensor to guide an autonomous vehicle. The objective of this research was to develop a control algorithm with a single sensor for an autonomous agricultural vehicle that could identify landmarks in the row-type plantation environment and navigate a vehicle to a point-to-go target location through the plantation. To enable such a navigation system for the plantation system, a laser range finder (LRF) was used as a single sensor to detect objects and navigate a full-size autonomous agricultural tractor. The LRF was used to control the tractor as it followed a path, and landmarks were detected “on-the-go” in real time. The landmarks were selected based on data for their distances calculated by comparison with the surrounding objects. Once the landmarks were selected, a target point was calculated from the landmarks, and the tractor was navigated toward the target. Navigation experiments were successfully conducted on the selected paths without colliding with the surrounding objects. A real time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS) was used to compare the positioning between the autonomous control and manual control. The results of this study showed that this control system could navigate the autonomous tractor to follow the paths, and the vehicle position differed from the manually driven paths by 0.264, 0.370 and 0.542 m for the wide, tight, and U-turn paths, respectively, with directional accuracies of 3.139°, 4.394°, and 5.217°, respectively, which are satisfactory for the autonomous operation of tractors on OPEN ACCESS Robotics 2015, 4 342 rubber or palm plantations. Therefore, this laser-based landmark detection and navigation system can be adapted to an autonomous navigation system to reduce the vehicle`s sensor cost and improve the accuracy of the positioning.	algorithm;autonomous robot;control system;experiment;global positioning system;real time kinematic;real-time computing;real-time operating system;robotics;usb on-the-go	Pawin Thanpattranon;Tofael Ahamed;Tomohiro Takigawa	2015	Robotics	10.3390/robotics4030341	computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	57.46262224871513	-29.035658127368155	11978

Conventional tomographic reconstruction systems (catscan) have traditionally employed x-rays to obtain 3D images of tissues. The use of x-rays assures excellent resolution and penetration characteristics. The disadvantages of using x-rays include the ionizing nature of the radiation employed for imaging as well the relatively low contrast obtained between healthy and cancerous tissue. A number of studies carried over the past several years have shown that the significant differences in the electrical properties associated with certain types of malignant tumors and normal tissue can be exploited as a basis for imaging tissue. The differences in electrical properties can also be utilized to selectively focus microwaves on the malignant tissue to raise its temperature as part of a hyperthermia treatment protocol, or possibly even to induce necrosis of the tissue. Most tomographic reconstruction systems also involve measurement of a series of projections obtained by rotating a source-detector pair around the patient. This requires the patient to be confined inside a tube during the scanning process. Confinement within a tube can sometimes be a challenge when the patient is too young or is claustrophobic. This talk will present a novel system which avoids the use of the traditional rotational scanning scheme and utilizes, instead, a set of electronically programmable mirrors to deflect microwaves. Microwaves deflected by the mirrors and scattered by the tissue are measured and processed to obtain a 3D image reconstruction of the tissue. The same system can be employed to as a therapy tool where the mirrors can be programmed to focus microwaves on the cancerous tissue to elevate it temperature. The talk will describe the system integration issues associated with a prototype system that is being built to validate the concept.	3d scanner;ct scan;iterative reconstruction;microwave;prototype;system integration;tomographic reconstruction	Satish S.

863c7723996520467fdff29aa0b12a2acf543a69	transients extraction based on averaged random orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for machinery fault diagnosis		Sparse representation based on matching pursuit (MP) algorithm is one of the effective methods for the extraction of weak feature contaminated by heavy noise. However, the optimal iterative threshold and iterations of MP algorithm are difficult to be determined and the sparsest representation is difficult to obtain for pursuit algorithms. In order to reduce the influence of the threshold and iterations on the performance of MP and obtain appropriate results without seeking the sparsest representation, a new transient feature extraction technique named averaged random orthogonal MP (AROMP) algorithm is proposed. In the proposed method, random orthogonal MP algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm to match the atoms with probability, is utilized repeatedly to generate a group of competitive representations for the mechanical vibration signal. Then by averaging these solutions, the estimated representation vector can be obtained to represent the vibration signal and then transients can be extracted from the noisy signal. The simulation study and experimental analysis show that transients can be extracted effectively from the noisy vibration signal. And comparison results between the proposed method and orthogonal MP show that the proposed algorithm is less dependent on iterations and can obtain a better performance for transients extraction. Comparisons between the proposed algorithm and spectral kurtosis also show the superiority of the proposed method.	dictionary;feature extraction;greedy algorithm;iteration;matching pursuit;openmp;ski combinator calculus;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;transient (computer programming)	Lin Lin Wang;Gaigai Cai;Wei You;Weiguo Huang;Z.

An anytime path planning algorithm in unstructured environments using the Fast Marching Method is presented in this work. Anytime algorithms have been successfully applied to robotics races with real cars and other robotic tasks in order to quickly generate a first path and to improve it in an incremental way when time is available. When the mobile robot is in an unstructured environment, it is necessary to include real-time information about its surroundings to obtain safer paths. This information is acquired by the robot by using a laser range finder. One important characteristic that this type of algorithms must satisfy is that the path must be generated in real time. The proposed method works in two steps. First, a smooth and safe global path is generated. This path is divided in multiple subpaths separated by equidistant nodes (defined by topological or metric constraints). After that, the obstacles information is added and a different path is calculated only when the original path is unreachable. The recalculation of the path is made up to the next node, which reduces the computational time. Different tests have been carried out in an indoor environment. The most important advantage with respect to similar approaches is that sub-paths are always efficiently generated in one execution cycle in terms of smoothness and safeness. Besides, the computational cost is low enough to use the algorithm in real time.	algorithmic efficiency;anytime algorithm;atomic-force microscopy;automated planning and scheduling;computation;distance transform;fast marching method;fast multipole method;mobile robot;motion planning;real-time computing;real-time data;real-time locating system;robotics;sensor;time complexity;unreachable memory	César Arismendi;Fernando Martín Monar;Santiago Garrido;Luis Moreno	2013	Eurocon 2013	10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625250	mobile robot;computer vision;mathematical optimization;simulation;fast path;any-angle path planning;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;motion planning	Robotics	54.206942388640336	-33.04768583891435	12029

The issues discussed are (i) If multiple obstacles are appeared in the environment with equal distances as perceived from multiple sensors of robot, then the corresponding multiple obstacles are treated as a whole and the robot deviate from obstacles widely and avoid then reaching to the target. As a result of the wide deviation, the robot takes long time and long path to reach the target position. (ii) Behavior rule selection when multiple obstacles are appeared in the environment with equal distances from robot. The robot navigation with optimal path, time and rule selection are more important and critical task, whenever the mobile robots are engaged to search the lives in the event of natural disaster like earthquake etc. A new methodology is proposed and used for resolving the above issues and discussed in this paper.

The outgoing radiance from cloth fabrics in the microcylinder model is calculated by integrating the product of the distant environment lighting, the visibility function, the weighting function that includes shadowing/masking effects of threads, and the light scattering function of threads. The radiance calculation at each shading point of the cloth fabrics is simplified to a linear combination of triple product integrals of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function, multiplied by precomputed spherical Gaussian convolutions of the weighting function. We propose an efficient calculation method of the triple product of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function by using the gradient of signed distance function to the visibility boundary where the binary visibility changes in the angular domain of the hemisphere. Our GPU implementation enables interactive rendering of static cloth fabrics with dynamic viewpoints and lighting. In addition, interactive editing of parameters for the scattering function (e.g. thread’s albedo) that controls the visual appearances of cloth fabrics can be achieved.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;computer graphics;convolution;eurographics;global illumination;gradient;graphics processing unit;interactivity;john d. wiley;precomputation;quadruple-precision floating-point format;shading;suicidegirls;weight function;xfig	Kenichiro Iwasaki;Koichi Mizutani;Y.

c9e45b0d7b567579bde64e4553114d3c5875b9db	thermal sensor circuit using thermography for temperature-controlled laser hyperthermia		Laser hyperthermia is a powerful therapeutic modality that suppresses the growth of proliferative lesions. In hyperthermia, the optimal temperature range is dependent on the disease; thus, a temperature-driven laser output control system is desirable. Such a laser output control system, integrated with a thermal sensor circuit based on thermography, has been established. In this study, the feasibility of the developed system was examined by irradiating mouse skin. The system is composed of a thermograph, a thermal sensor circuit (PC and microcontroller), and an infrared laser. Based on the maximum temperature in the laser-irradiated area acquired every 100ms during irradiation, the laser power was controlled such that the maximum temperature was maintained at a preset value. Temperature-controlled laser hyperthermia using the thermal sensor circuit was shown to suppress temperature fluctuations during irradiation (SD ∼ 0.14C) to less than 1/10 of those seen without the thermal sensor circuit (SD ∼ 1.6C). The thermal sensor circuit was able to satisfactorily stabilize the temperature at the preset value. This system can therefore provide noncontact laser hyperthermia with the ability to maintain a constant temperature in the irradiated area.	control system;microcontroller;modality (human–computer interaction);sensor;skin (computing)	Shinsuke Nomura;Masashi Arake;Yuji Morimoto;Hironori Tsujimoto;Hiromi Miyazaki;Daizoh Saitoh;Nariyoshi Shinomiya;Kazuo Hase;Junji Yamamoto;Hideki Ueno	2017	J.

The formation shape and the avoidance of collisions between robots are obtained by exploiting the properties of weighted graphs. Since mobile robots are supposed to move in unknown environments, the presented approach to multi-robot coordination has been extended in order to include obstacle avoidance. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been demonstrated by means of analytical proofs. Moreover, results of simulations and experiments on real robots are provided for validation purposes.	algorithm;analytical engine;consensus dynamics;control theory;experiment;graph theory;intelligent agent;matlab;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;simulation;simulink;sion's minimax theorem	Riccardo Falconi;Lorenzo Sabattini;Cristian Secchi;Cesare Fantuzzi;Claudio Melchiorri	2015	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574714000368	robot;collision;control engineering;engineering;obstacle avoidance;mobile robot;distributed computing;graph	Robotics	58.43151690583571	-23.045189189233906	12148
1420c6364bda8ecada2b0f504fc91399d47b198b	design of a pma-driven bionic neck robot with a spring spine		Bionic Neck Robot (BNR) is a kind of robot that mimics the locomotion and structure of the human neck joint. The human neck is a complex component, which provides dexterous mobility in a very compact and lightweight form. Therefore, it is difficult to imitate the human neck in all aspects. In this paper, a novel PMA (Pneumatic Muscle Actuator) driven bionic neck robot with a spring spine is proposed. This design has a noticeable human similarity. The PMA and the spring connect the moving platform and the robot base platform. The spring works as the cervical spine to support the head and generates desired head movements. The PMAs, like the human muscles can generate linear contract force and drive the robot in all directions. By building the forward and inverse kinematic model, an optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal physical parameters that can meet the given range of motion. A rapid prototyping system was developed. Simulations and experimental results verify the workspace of the robot with optimized parameters.	computer simulation;dendritic spine;inverse kinematics;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;rapid prototyping;robot;workspace;phpmyadmin	Yingmin Zhou;Hongtai Cheng;Hongfei Jiang;Lina Hao	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Cyborg and Bionic Systems (CBS)	10.1109/CBS.2017.8266125	actuator;workspace;simulation;robot;kinematics;rapid prototyping;head movements;optimization problem;computer science	Robotics	68.40458251029538	-23.645389251022802	12153

In these dilated MIs, system matrices are separated from Lyapunov matrices to allow the use of different Lyapunov matrices in multi-objective and robust problems. To demonstrate the benefit of these new dilated MIs over conventional ones, they are used in solving controller synthesis problem for systems with bounded actuator in disturbance attenuation. It is shown that for the resulting multi-objective saturation problem, the new form of dilated MIs achieves an upper bound for L2 gain that is less than or equal to the upper bound estimate achieved by conventional method.

These include not only models of shape, but also reflectance, contact forces, and sound. Such realistic models are crucial in many applications, including telerobotics, virtual reality, computer-assisted medicine, computer animation, computer games, and training simulators. The Active Measurement Facility (ACME) is an integrated robotic facility designed to acquire a rich set of measurements from objects of moderate size, for building accurate physical models. ACME can provide precise motions of a test object; acquire range measurements with a laser range finder; position a 3-CCD color video camera, a trinocular stereo vision system, and other sensors around the object; probe the test object with a robot arm equipped with a force/torque sensor; and acquire registered measurements from all these sensors. ACME is a telerobotic system with fifteen degrees of freedom. Everything in ACME, from force controlled probing to camera settings and lighting, is under computer control. We have also developed an extensive teleprogramming system for ACME. ACME is designed to be a shared resource, and can be controlled from any remote location on the Internet.	computational model;computer control company;computer animation;internet;pc game;robot;robotic arm;sensor;simulation;stereopsis;telerobotics;virtual reality	Dinesh K.

Degradations due to channel effect and significant attenuation of low frequency components <;300 Hz create challenges for the epoch extraction from telephone quality speech. An epoch extraction method is proposed that considers the vertical striations present in the time-frequency representation of voiced speech as the representative candidates for the epochs. Time-frequency representation with better localized vertical striations is estimated using single pole filter based filter bank. The time marginal of time-frequency representation is computed to locate the epochs. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the database of five speakers, which provide simultaneous speech and electroglottographic recordings. Telephone quality speech is simulated using G.191 software tools. The identification rate of the state-of-the-art methods degrades substantially for the telephone quality speech whereas that of the proposed method remains the same, comparable to that of clean speech.	algorithm;electroglottograph;epoch (reference date);filter bank;inverse filter;marginal model;switch;time–frequency representation;tract (literature);zero suppression	M.

The impulsive effects considered can be not only nonidentical in different dimensions of the system state but also various at distinct impulsive instants. Hence, the impulses here can encompass several typical impulses in NNs. The aim of this paper is to derive stability criteria such that stochastic NNs with local impulsive effects are exponentially stable in mean square. By means of the mathematical induction method, several easy-to-check conditions are obtained to ensure the mean square stability of NNs.

Among different approaches developed recently to capture these non-local interactions, the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) developed in the groups of Langreth and Lundqvist is becoming increasingly popular. It does not rely on empirical parameters, and has been successfully applied to molecules, surface systems, and weakly-bound solids. As the vdW-DF requires the evaluation of a six-dimensional integral, it scales, however, unfavorably with system size. In this work, we present a numerically efficient implementation based on the Monte-Carlo technique for multi-dimensional integration. It can handle different versions of vdW-DF. Applications range from simple dimers to complex structures such as molecular crystals and organic molecules physisorbed on metal surfaces.	dna integration;density functional theory;direction finding;functional theories of grammar;interaction;monte carlo integration;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerous;tnip1 gene;version;solid substance	Dmitrii Nabok;Peter Puschnig;Claudia Ambrosch-Draxl	2011		10.1016/j.cpc.2011.04.015	van der waals force;text mining;computer science;nanotechnology;mathematics;density functional theory;physics;quantum mechanics	Graphics	94.67867327242311	0.3212401190875473	12333
e1e409a1a13b1c7f9213eadbc13100ac3a05e3cc	video object segmentation : driving active contours based on watershed boundaries	institutional repositories;fedora;vital;vtls;ils	Object segmentation is nowadays a vital component of special effect creation. In order to add virtual object or a virtual background in a video sequence a mask needs to be constructed. This mask makes the delineation between the parts that must remain in the final sequence and the parts where we can add the special effects. Such a mask can easily be constructed by filming people in front of a blue or green screen. The main topic of this thesis is the conception of an automatic method to find out such a mask without any blue or green screen. We first suggest a segmentation framework based on the watershed transform. However, the mask boundaries generated with this method are not smooth over time. This results in a temporal flickering, which is very annoying from a visual point of view. To remove this flickering, we then use active contours. Watershed boundaries are then seen as magnets that attract active contours. Active contours have the particularity to be smooth both from the spatial and from the temporal point of view. The mask resulting from the combination of watersheds and active contours has therefore the advantages of both methodologies. It is spatially accurate thanks to the watersheds and temporally stable thanks to the active contours.	watershed (image processing)	Cédric De Roover	2006			computer vision;geography;cartography;computer graphics (images)	Vision	64.00136841522635	-48.42607075612347	12352

A Lagrangian formulation of the equations of motion leads to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) coupled to an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) [H. Lamb, Hydrodynamics, 6th ed., Dover, New York, 1932]. Here, using a variational approach, an approximated solution for the PDE is presented, and the problem is reduced to the study of a system of ODEs. As a consequence one can get approximate forces and torques due to hydrodynamic interaction of rigid bodies of arbitrary shapes. Some examples are discussed at the end.	approximation algorithm;biological system	Clodoaldo Grotta Ragazzo	2003	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S003613990139427X	classical mechanics;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;mathematics;geometry	Theory	87.20911548463833	3.7663298737165474	12353
98c7e2f8a0f3535e2221aeb0e26cd67d3e47ff7d	message from the editor-in-chief		In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective method for isotropic meshing relying on Euclidean distance transformation based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT). Our approach improves the performance and robustness of computing CVT on curved domains while simultaneously providing high-quality output meshes. While conventional extrinsic methods compute CVTs in the entire volume bounded by the input model, we restrict the computation to a 3D shell of user-controlled thickness. Taking voxels which contain surface samples as sites, we compute the exact Euclidean distance transform on the GPU. Our algorithm is parallel and memory-efficient, and can construct the shell space for resolutions up to 20483 at interactive speed. The 3D centroidal Voronoi tessellation and restricted Voronoi diagrams are also computed efficiently on the GPU. Since the shell space can bridge holes and gaps smaller than a certain tolerance, and tolerate non-manifold edges and degenerate triangles, our algorithm can handle models with such defects, which typically cause conventional remeshing methods to fail. Our method can process implicit surfaces, polyhedral surfaces, and point clouds in a unified framework. Computational results show that our GPU-based isotropic meshing algorithm produces results comparable to state-of- the-art techniques, but is significantly faster than conventional CPU-based implementations.	algorithm;central processing unit;centroidal voronoi tessellation;computation;diagram;distance transform;effective method;electron shell;euclidean distance;glossary of computer graphics;graphics processing unit;implicit surface;isotropic position;parallel computing;point cloud;polyhedron;thickness (graph theory);unified framework;voxel	Yuen-Shan Leung;Xiaoning Wang;Ying He;Yong-Jin Liu;Charlie C.

We do this by describing, in great detail, an elementary example of reduction of a lightly dissipative system modeling crawling-type locomotion in three dimensions. The symmetry group SE(2) is the set of rigid transformations of the horizontal (ground) plane. Given a time-periodic perturbation, the system will admit a relative limit cycle whereupon each period is related to the previous by a fixed translation and rotation along the ground. This toy model identifies how symmetry reduction and dissipation can conspire to create robust behavior in crawling, and possibly walking, locomotion.	dissipative system;limit cycle;systems modeling	Jaap Eldering;Henry O.

RRSs are often weak in these scenarios, due to the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves that propagate through debris. Thus, detecting RRSs under low signal-to-noise ratio is a key challenge in this application. In this study, RRS detection in additive white Gaussian noise was investigated from a statistical signal processing viewpoint, and a modified generalised-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) was derived. With proper parameter settings, the modified GLRT (MG) could achieve a notable detection gain over the periodogram test and the harmogram test, two classical periodic signal detectors. Thus, the proposed MG could be used to improve the detection performance of the life-detection radar systems used in disaster rescue applications.	sensor	Xin Li;Ye Li	2016	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2016.0085	additive white gaussian noise;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;mathematics;statistical signal processing;statistics	ML	82.08105558451857	-42.36060864726825	12462

In order to perform safe driving with autonomous driving control, it is necessary to consider unexpected disturbances when the vehicle is moving and that tire forces have limitations. We propose autonomous driving control combining Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). In this paper, we employ MPC in order to consider the maximum tire forces. SMC is employed to deal with unexpected disturbances that the model has not anticipated. Furthermore, we confirmed that path following control is possible by practical inspection using a small front-wheel steering vehicle that is susceptible to unexpected disturbances.	autonomous car;autonomous robot;drug vehicle;experiment;hardware acceleration;mesenchymal stem cells;steering wheel	Manabu Shinohara;Takatsugu Oda;Kenichiro Nonaka;Kazuma Sekiguchi	2016	2016 IEEE 14th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2016.7496330	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	62.27111337986385	-16.37574605675722	12494

First, the problem of consensus under input constraint is investigated where the MAS is reformulated as a network of Lur'e systems. As a result, a sufficient condition for consensus and the design of consensus controller gain are derived from solutions of a distributed LMI convex problem. Next, the problem of consensus with state constraint is transformed into an equivalent problem of consensus under input constraint. Therefore, a similar method to the previous problem can be employed for this scenario, however an additional LMI constraint should be satisfied. Finally, a numerical example is introduced to illustrate the proposed theoretical approach.	consensus (computer science);convex optimization;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;numerical analysis	Dinh Hoa Nguyen;Tatsuo Narikiyo;Michihiro Kawanishi	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810340	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.02933833116752	3.1887049363337363	12499
bde15cd28dfaa67d43cb269b250cfba4a9f320d7	rapid-manufacturing-process for elastomeric components		The Selective Laser Sintering Process of thermoplastics (SLS) enables the manufacturing of components with complex shape in a short time period without the manufacturing of a specific mold. However, this manufacturing process is limited by the restricted range of materials. In contrast to this primary shaping process, vacuum casting allows a quick, inexpensive and highly accurate process but it is limited to the reproduction of already existing models. In a novel rapid tooling method, these two processes are combined. Thus, silicone parts can be manufactured using SLS molds. Design/methodology/approach The manufacturing of elastomeric parts in the vacuum casting process using SLS molds is being investigated. Therefore, the adhesion of silicone to the SLS mold, as well as the resulting mechanical properties of the elastomeric parts are investigated. Findings The combination of the SLS process and the vacuum casting process allows the rapid manufacturing of complex elastomeric parts with sufficient mechanical properties. Research limitations/implications The surface roughness of the SLS mold influences the adhesion of the casting material to the mold, as well as the mechanical properties of the manufactured elastomeric components. Originality/value The synergy of using selective laser sintered molds with the vacuum casting technique displays a novel rapid manufacturing method.	3d printing;noise shaping;rapid tooling;standard sea level;structured-light 3d scanner;synergy	Martin Launhardt;Maximilian Drexler;Dietmar Drummer	2015	iJES		vacuum casting;computer science;casting;real-time computing;rapid tooling;elastomer;surface roughness;composite material;adhesion;selective laser sintering;silicone	Robotics	89.55290191716823	-17.62429171845085	12520

Desired inertia can be precisely emulated through this control strategy so that guaranteed performance is ensured. A typical frequency response model with parametrical inertia is set to be the reference model. A measurement at a specific location delivers the information of disturbance acting on the diesel-wind system to the reference model. The objective is for the speed of the diesel-wind system to track the reference model. Since active power variation is dominantly governed by mechanical dynamics and modes, only mechanical dynamics and states, i.e., a swing-engine-governor system plus a reduced-order wind turbine generator, are involved in the feedback control design. The controller is implemented in a three-phase diesel-wind system feed microgrid.

This paper tackles the problem of creating 3D models of animals from a single, side-view sketch. We use the a priori assumptions of smoothness and structural symmetry of the animal about the sagittal plane to inform the 3D reconstruction. Our contributions include methods for identifying and inferring the contours of shape parts from the input sketch, a method for identifying the hierarchy of these structural parts including the detection of approximate symmetric pairs, and a hierarchical algorithm for positioning and blending these parts into a consistent 3D implicit-surface-based model. We validate this pipeline by showing that a number of plausible animal shapes can be automatically constructed from a single sketch. & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The polynomial fuzzy model is a more effective representation than the T-S fuzzy model. In addition, the stability conditions of polynomial fuzzy control in terms of sum of square (SOS) are more general than the stability conditions of T-S fuzzy control in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). This paper provides two extended control designs of polynomial fuzzy control to deal with the issues about how to make the system response converge quickly and how to restrict the system output. To make the system response converge faster, the authors used the concept of decay rate into the polynomial Lyapunov function, and then the new stability conditions are derived. To restrict the system output, the authors proposed the output constraints in terms of SOS via polynomial Lyapunov function. The control feedback gains of polynomial fuzzy controllers can be obtained by solving the above SOS conditions and constraints via SOSTOOLS.	converge;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;polynomial;social inequality	Gwo-Ruey Yu;Lun-Wei Huang;Chih-Yung Cheng	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378113	kharitonov's theorem;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;stability;defuzzification;stable polynomial;fuzzy number;bismuth;fuzzy measure theory;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy associative matrix;square-free polynomial;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system;statistics;polynomial	Robotics	67.26710167249045	-1.203251866205499	12662

This specification discloses an apparatus and method for controlling the air fuel ratio in an internal combustion engine. The instantaneous air fuel ratio is compared with the inverse of a prior art fuel ratio to determine if an adjustment is necessary. If the inverted prior state of the air fuel ratio is the same as the present state, no change to the air fuel ratio will occur. If the inverted prior state is not the same as the present state, a control correction in the air fuel ratio will occur. The system will not change control voltage if the predicted stated and the actual state of the air fuel ratio agree.

The presented approach generates continuous velocity profiles that avoid collisions and minimize the completion time for the robots. The approach identifies collision segments along each robot’s path and then optimizes the motions of the robots along their collision and collision-free segments. For each path segment for each robot, the minimum and maximum possible traversal times that satisfy the dynamics constraints are computed by solving the corresponding twopoint boundary value problems. Then the collision avoidance constraints for pairs of robots can be combined to formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since this nonconvex MINLP model is difficult to solve, we describe two related mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations that provide schedules that are lower and upper bounds on the optimum; the upper bound schedule is a continuous velocity schedule. The approach is illustrated with robots modeled as double integrators subject to velocity and acceleration constraints. An implementation that coordinates 12 nonholonomic car-like robots is described.	algorithm;closing (morphology);collision detection;complex dynamics;computation;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;optimal control;robot;setpoint (control system);tree traversal;uniform resource identifier;velocity (software development)	Jufeng Peng;Srinivas Akella	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1242222	control engineering;motion control;mobile robot;mathematical optimization;integer programming;optimal control;nonlinear programming;boundary value problem;computer science;linear programming;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;robot kinematics;satisfiability	Robotics	62.7667083124314	-20.502822880371884	12692

The developed approach is designed to enable the manipulator to conserve the joint configuration in cyclic trajectories and to avoid the joint limits. Since the inverse kinematics in this problem has an infinite number of joint angle vectors, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is designed to provide an approximate value for that vector. Feeding this vector as an additional hint input vector to the NN limits and guides the output of the NN within the self-motion. The derivation of the Lyapunov function which is designed to achieve both of the tasks, leads to a computationally efficient online learning algorithm of the NN.

Initially, the concepts of stochastic finite-time boundedness and stochastic finite-time H∞H∞ stabilization are presented. Then, by using stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived such that the resulting close-loop system is stochastically finite-time bounded and satisfies a prescribed H∞H∞ disturbance attenuation level in a given finite-time interval. Furthermore, sufficient criteria on stochastic finite-time H∞H∞ stabilization using a fuzzy state-feedback controller are provided, and the controller is designed by solving an optimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two numerical examples are exploited to show the validity of the proposed design techniques.		Yingqi Zhang;Peng Shi;Sing Kiong Nguang;Hamid Reza Karimi;Ramesh K. Agarwal	2014	J.

We propose in this paper an original flexible distributed algorithm allowing to reorganize a set of modular micro-robot into a desired target shape. The efficiency of such algorithm is assessed on the basis of the memory requirements, communication load and the amount of performed movements to reach the final shapes. The proposed algorithm shows a great flexibility concerning the range of target shapes, partly thanks to the no need for an explicit description of the final shape. To assess the computational performances of the algorithm, we proposed a linear programming model of the shape-shifting problem giving the lower bounds of optimized criteria.

b834c347ad0ce5df536ccae600aa981280e4cdd8	simulation of hybrid trickle bed reactor-reverse osmosis process for the removal of phenol from wastewater		Abstract Phenol and phenolic derivatives found in different industrial effluents are highly toxic and extremely harmful to human and the aquatic ecosystem. In the past, trickle bed reactor (TBR), reverse osmosis (RO) and other processes have been used to remove phenol from wastewater. However, each of these technologies has limitations in terms of the phenol concentration in the feed water and the efficiency of phenol rejection rate. In this work, an integrated hybrid TBR–RO process for removing high concentration phenol from wastewater is suggested and model-based simulation of the process is presented to evaluate the performance of the process. The models for both TBR and RO processes were independently validated against experimental data from the literature before coupling together to make the hybrid process. The results clearly show that the combined process significantly improves the rejection rate of phenol compared to that obtained via the individual processes.	reactor (software);simulation	M. A.

The fuzzy system is viewed as an interconnection of subsystems some of which are strongly connected, while others being weakly connected. The necessary theory is developed so that one can associate this fuzzy system with another one in a higher dimensional space, the so-called expanded space, design decentralized parallel distributed compensators in the expanded space, then contract the solution for implementation on the original fuzzy system. In this respect, connective stability of the open loop and closed loop of the interconnected system is analyzed via the concepts of vector Lyapunov functions and M-matrices. Different Lyapunov functions generate different results for the discrete-time fuzzy system, quadratic Lyapunov generating the superior of the two. Following a similar approach, stabilization of the closed-loop fuzzy system using local parallel distributed compensators is investigated.	fuzzy control system	Mehmet Akar;Ümit Özgüner	2000	IEEE Trans.

38f0358e344ee62a2bbd9669fd4ef1bd58f4d938	a discrete analysis of metal-v belt drive		The metal-V belt drive includes a large number of parts which interact between them to transmit power from the input to the output pulleys. A compression belt composed of a great number of struts is maintained by a tension flat belt. Power is them shared into the two belts that moves generally in opposite directions. Due to the particular geometry of the elements and to the great number of parts, a numerical approach achieves the global equilibrium of the mechanism from the elementary part equilibrium. Sliding arc on each pulley can be thus defined both for the compression and tension belts. Finally, power sharing can be calculated as differential motion between the belts, is defined.

Each of the upper and lower casings has an engagement portion for telescopically engaging with each other. The stiffness of the upper casing is increased by making at least three corner portions close to the engagement portion. Crescent-shaped portions, curved surfaces, an apex portion and crest lines are also provided for the upper casing. This specific structure of the upper casing may be made also for the lower casing, and when both of the upper and lower casings have such construction, the corner portions of the upper casing and the corner portions of the lower casing are arranged alternatively so that the vibrating modes of respective casings offset each other.

In order to estimate the reliability of the head materials, the corona discharge using multi-pin electrodes was studied. The multi-pin electrodes were configured with maximum 15 pins. Each pin was distanced 5mm from neighbors and placed at 11mm over the Al plate. At negative voltage, the discharge started with isolated pulses. As the voltage increasing over -7kV, DC component appeared and increased. At positive voltage, the discharge was isolated pulses up to +10kV and DC component did not appeared. At 15-pins electrode, the period between the pulses was random and the peak values varied. Therefore, the corona discharges from the multi-pin electrodes occurred individually at each electrode. The mean current of 15-pins increased approximately five times at negative voltage and twenty times at positive voltage compared with that of single-pin.	discharger;giant magnetoresistance;negative feedback	Yutaka Soda;Tsutomu Ko Dama;Tetsuji Oda	2012	2012 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2012.6373979	materials science;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;analytical chemistry	EDA	89.29754825600038	-12.577443467025057	12900

For objects observed by a normal lens system, and centered in the image, shape parameters can be reliably extracted and compared to reference models by a number of well-known techniques. In many applications, it appears desirable to mount the camera very close to the workspace, and to use a wide angle lens. This overcomes problems caused by congested manufacturing workstations, and allows a wide field of vision. Unfortunately, the shapes of objects in the peripheral area of camera images have a distortion, inherent to planar projective mapping, which increases with increasing angles measured from the optical axis. A significant portion of the image area from a wide angle lens falls in this category. When the objects contain depth, this distortion alters angles and sizes of solid objects. This paper presents a transformation that corrects the image shape of any selected object or region in a wide angle digital image. It performs the transformation by defining a virtual camera to """"take a picture"""" of the image with the desired orientation. A new, simulated, image is formed with correct shapes and angles making shape recognition easier. Examples of the implementation of this algorithm are presented."""	digital image	J. H. Graham;T. G.

Previous research in graphics and vision has leveraged such nearest-neighbor searches to provide a variety of high-level digital image editing tools. However, the cost of computing a field of such matches for an entire image has eluded previous efforts to provide interactive performance. Our algorithm offers substantial performance improvements over the previous state of the art (20-100x), enabling its use in interactive editing tools. The key insights driving the algorithm are that some good patch matches can be found via random sampling, and that natural coherence in the imagery allows us to propagate such matches quickly to surrounding areas. We offer theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm, as well as empirical and practical evidence for its high quality and performance. This one simple algorithm forms the basis for a variety of tools -- image retargeting, completion and reshuffling -- that can be used together in the context of a high-level image editing application. Finally, we propose additional intuitive constraints on the synthesis process that offer the user a level of control unavailable in previous methods.	image editing;patchmatch;randomized algorithm	Connelly Barnes;Eli Shechtman;Adam Finkelstein;Dan B.

In this paper we show that for injective controllable linear time-invariant systems a suitable choice of weighting matrix yields a minimum variance controller which stabilizes the system. Moreover, a weighting matrix is constructed which yields a minimum variance controller which drives any initial state to zero in finite time. By means of a simulation study the influence of the choice of the weighting matrix on the controller and the closed loop behaviour is illustrated.	memory controller	Jacob Engwerda;Pieter W.

Due to the size of heliostat, it is difficult to measure the orientation of the optical axis directly during the tracking process. With a computer-vision based measuring system, the center of reflecting beam of a heliostat can be detected, but the result is disturbed by internal and external interferences. This paper presents a method to estimate the orientation of optical axis of a tracking heliostat using unscented kalman filter based on the measured beam center data.

In the linear case there is an analogue of the Hille-Yosida theorem for semigroups. The class of equations we are dealing with arises from the study of the shallow water equation. While it proved impossible for us to check the existence theorem stated by Pruess, we are able, using some properties of the equation at hand to derive the result with a completely different method.

This gripper was designed as an alternative to the very complex and expensive anthropomorphic grippers, which often show a low liability and which are not available for current gripping applications in robotic manipulation operations. In order to determine the structural and functional characteristics of the gripper, we carried out a multi-criteria analysis of 16 known anthropomorphic grippers. After completing the structural-kinematic diagram, we went on with the kinematic and static analysis, upon which the CAD project was drawn, then followed the functional simulation and the prototype. The prototype was tested on an experimental stand, while gripping different shaped objects, with all sorts of physical-mechanical characteristics. A further version will allow the installation and testing of the gripper on an industrial robot.	computer-aided design;diagram;industrial robot;logic simulation;prototype;robot end effector;static program analysis	Marian Bolboe;Ionel Staretu	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD)	10.1109/RAAD.2014.7002280	control engineering;simulation;engineering;engineering drawing	Robotics	72.55823314220657	-22.229761859264112	12973

We use the real flying robot to evaluate the GA's individuals rather than an artificially consistent simulator. By doing so we avoid the “reality gap”, taking the controller from the simulator to the real world. In this paper we analyze the evolutionary aspects of this technique and discuss the issues that need to be considered for it to perform well and result in robust controllers.	course (navigation);genetic algorithm;simulation;software release life cycle	Mario A.

Our approach is based on several works of digital topology and discrete geometry: representation of digital surfaces, bel adjacencies and digital surface tracking, 2D tangent computation by discrete line recognition, 3D normal estimation from slice contours. The main idea is to notice that each surface element is the crossing point of n - 1 discrete contours lying on the surface. Each of them can be seen as a 4-connected 2D contour. We combine the directions of the tangents extracted on each of these contours to compute the normal vector at the considered surface element. We then define the surface area from the normal field. The presented geometric estimators have been implemented in a framework able to represent subsets of n-dimensional spaces. As shown by our experiments, this generic implementation is also efficient.

We study (i) traveling wave solutions, (ii) the formation and spatial spread of synchronous oscillations, and (iii) the effects of variations of threshold in a system of integro–differential equations which describe the activity of large scale networks of excitatory neurons on spatially extended domains. The independent variables are the activity level u of a population of excitatory neurons which have long range connections, and a recovery variable v. In the integral component of the equation for u the firing rate function is the heaviside function, and the coupling function w is positive. Thus, there is no inhibition in the system. There is a critical value of the parameter β (β∗ > 0) that appears in the equation for v, at which the eigenvalues μ of the linearization of the system around the rest state (u, v) = (0, 0) change from real to complex. We focus on the range β > β∗ where μ are complex, and analyze properties of wave fronts, 1-pulse and 2-pulse waves when the connection function w is asymmetric. For wave fronts we demonstarte how an initial stimulus evolves into two solutions which propagate in opposite directions with different speeds and shapes. For 1-pulse waves our main theoretical result (Theorem 4.2) shows that there is a range of β > β∗ where two families of waves exist, each consisting of infinitely many solutions. The waves in these two families also propagate in opposite directions with different speeds and shapes. There is a critical value θ > 0 such that if θ > θ then 1-pulse waves can only propagate in one direction. In addition, there is a second critical β value, β > β∗, where bulk oscillations come into existence and the system becomes bistable. When β ≥ β∗ we show how an initial stimulus evolves into a solution with large amplitude oscillations that spread out uniformly from the point of stimulus. The asymmetry in w causes the rate of spread of the ‘region of synchrony’ to be more rapid to the right of the point of stimulus than to the left. When θ > θ we construct a ’uni-directional’ circuit where synchronization in one region can trigger synchronization in a distant, second region. However, when synchronization is initially triggered in the second region, it cannot spread to the first region.	aharonov–bohm effect;bifurcation theory;bistability;brent's method;coexist (image);dynamical system;emoticon;excitable medium;experiment;ibm notes;maximal set;neuron;numerical analysis;software propagation;spatial variability	William C.

The paper defines the topology and addresses the modelling of the closed-loop control system. It presents a modelling framework to design the controller, the transfer network, and the receiving network systems. Also, the paper discusses a design procedure of using shared network systems for a closed-loop control system with multiple plant and controller systems. The design procedures utilize LMI-based algorithms and deliver an internally stable closed-loop control system whose inputs and outputs satisfy an ℓ2 - ℓ∞ performance criterion. The practicality of the design procedures is demonstrated using an illustrative example.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;control system;control theory;linear matrix inequality	Ahmad W.

The formation problem is firstly converted into a stability control problem, and then a distributed iterative learning scheme is developed for networks with switching topology. Based on the 2-D analysis approach, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the boundedness of formation errors during the whole motion process, and feedback matrix of the proposed iterative scheme can be further determined by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Repeated drop events can lead to solder joint failure and malfunction of these products. Hence board-level reliability drop testing is a useful way to characterize the drop durability of the printed circuit board with different soldered assemblies. Lead-free (or Pb-free) solders are replacing lead-based solders. Surface mounted electronic packages are getting smaller and with higher density (I/Os). In this study, Plastic Ball Grid Array (PBGA), Quad Flat No-lead (VQFN) and PQFP solder joint reliability characterization by drop impact testing was investigated for lead-based (62Sn-36Pb-2Ag) and lead-free (Sn-4Ag-0.5Cu) soldered assemblies. The influence of different package types and the impact of PCB surface finishes for OSP and ENIG (electroless nickel immersion gold) were studied. The drop test results showed that leadfree solder joints with ENIG finish have weaker drop reliability performance than the case for OSP surface finish. The different solder alloy-to-surface finish type combination results in different intermetallics formed and contributed to different failure sites and mode of failure. The formation of the brittle intermetallics (Cu-Ni-Sn) for Pb-free solder (Sn-4Ag-0.5Cu) with ENIG pad led to detrimental interfacial fracture of the PBGA solder joints. For both lead-based and Pb-free solders with copper-pad and OSP surface finish, the formation of Cu6Sn5 intermetallics resulted in a different failure site and mode. The failures migrated to the PCB copper traces and resin layers. The small size (VQFN) package is most resistant to drop impact failures, due to it’s small size, weight and larger solder volume. The compliant leads for the PQFP is more resistant to drop failures compared to the PBGA solder joints.	ball grid array;desoldering;divergence-from-randomness model;dual in-line package;durability (database systems);electrical connection;electroless nickel immersion gold;emoticon;error-tolerant design;experiment;failure cause;finite element method;immersion (virtual reality);integrated circuit packaging;interconnection;mp3;memory controller;mobile phone;numerical analysis;organic solderability preservative;password cracking;personal digital assistant;printed circuit board;printing;quad flat no-leads package;quad flat package;resin;soldering;steam rupture;thermal grease;tracing (software);triangulated irregular network;via (electronics);vii	Desmond Y.

The noisy speech signal is filtered within the range of fundamental frequency. Normalized autocorrelation function (NACF) is computed from the pre-filtered noisy speech signal. The NACF is decomposed by EMD to generate a finite number of band limited signal called Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF). DFT is applied to NACF to determine the dominant frequency of the analyzing speech frame. The IMF with fundamental period closest to that of the dominant frequency is selected as the target IMF containing the fundamental period. The performance of the proposed pitch estimation method is compared in terms of gross pitch error (GPE) with the recent algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed one performs better for noisy and clean speech signals.	autocorrelation;bandlimiting;discrete fourier transform;hilbert–huang transform;hybrid algorithm;newton's method;pitch detection algorithm	Sujan Kumar Roy;Md.

The devices under test are optical microresonators made of silicon nitride on silicon oxide, which differ in their sidewall inclination angle. In our approach, these microresonators are vertically coupled to a buried waveguide with the aim of creating integrated and cost-effective devices. Device modeling shows that the optimization of the device is a delicate balance of the resonance quality factor and evanescent field overlap with the surrounding environment to analyze. By numerical simulations, we show that the microdisk thickness is critical to yield a high figure of merit for the sensor and that edge inclination should be kept as high as possible. We also show that bulk-sensing figures of merit as high as 1600 RIU(-1) (refractive index unit) are feasible.	device under test;evanescent field;finite thickness;floppy disk;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;refractometric;relative biological effectiveness;resonance;resonator device component;simulation;thickness (graph theory);waveguide device component;sensor (device);silicon nitride	Davide Gandolfi;Fernando Ramiro-Manzano;Francisco Javier Aparicio Rebollo;Mher Ghulinyan;Georg Pucker;Lorenzo Pavesi	2015		10.3390/s150304796	figure of merit;chemistry;detection limit;refractometry;optoelectronics;whispering-gallery wave;optics;silicon;physics	EDA	92.04751324649581	-15.246259831978982	13115

The motivating goal is to get a quantitative measure on the importance of phase in automatic speech recognition by studying the effects of phase uncertainty on human perception. Listening tests were conducted for 18 listeners under different phase uncertainty and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. These results indicate that a small amount of phase error or uncertainty does not affect the recognition rate, but a large amount of phase uncertainty significantly affects the recognition rate. The degree of the importance of phase also seems to be an SNR-dependent one, such that at lower SNRs the effects of phase uncertainty are more pronounced than at higher SNRs. For example, at an SNR of -10 dB, having random phases at all frequencies results in a word error rate (WER) of 63% compared to 24% if the phase was unaltered. In comparison, at 0 dB, random phase results in a 25% WER as compared to 11% for the unaltered phase case. Listening tests were also conducted for the case of reconstructed phase based on the least square error estimation approach. The results indicate that the recognition rate for the reconstructed phase case is very close to that of the perfect phase case (a WER difference of 4% on average)	broadcast delay;experiment;in-phase and quadrature components;microphone;noise figure;phase noise;sigmoid function;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial variability;speech enhancement;speech recognition;word error rate	Guangji Shi;Maryam Modir Shanechi;Parham Aarabi	2006	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TSA.2005.858512	speech recognition;word error rate;computer science;artificial intelligence;speech processing	Mobile	81.6691321838877	-32.48231700338291	13120

Unlike previous work on non-Euclidean force-directed methods, ours is not limited to special classes of graphs, but can be applied to arbitrary graphs. The method relies on extending the Euclidean notions of distance, angle, and force-interactions to smooth non-Euclidean geometries via projections to and from appropriately chosen tangent spaces. In particular, we formally describe the calculations needed to extend such algorithms to hyperbolic and spherical geometries. We also study the theoretical and practical considerations that arise when working with non-Euclidean geometries.		Stephen G. Kobourov;Kevin Wampler	2005	IEEE Trans. Vis. Comput.

Two basic approaches will be considered, these apply differential algebraic and differential geometric tools. In the differential algebraic approach the state elimination methods will be used to derive nonlinear parity relations. In the specific case when a reconstruction of the fault signal is needed the dynamic inversion based approach will be investigated. This approach will also be studied from geometric point of view. The geometric approach, as proposed by Isidori and De Persis, is suitable to extend the detection filter and unknown input observer design approaches (well elaborated for LTI systems) to affine nonlinear systems. Beyond the development of the theory of fault detection and identification it is equally important to offer computable methods and to analyze the robustness properties against uncertainties. Both the observer based and the inversion based approaches will be elaborated for LPV systems that may offer computational tools inherited from linear systems and also allow to design for robustness utilizing results from H1 robust filtering and disturbance attenuation. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite that, engineers have been using approximated energy-like functions to obtain good estimates of the critical clearing time (CCT) in transient stability analysis of power systems. These approximated energy-like functions are not Lyapunov functions, and are usually obtained by an integration process followed by an approximation of the integration path. Therefore, the good CCT estimates obtained with these functions are not supported by a sound theory. Nevertheless, it is shown in this paper, for a particular approximated energy-like function, a theoretical approach to support these good estimates. The approximated energy-like function studied in this paper is well known in the literature, and was proposed by Athay et al. in the COA formulation. It is shown that this approximated energy-like function is neither a Lyapunov function in the usual sense, nor an extended Lyapunov function, when the transfer conductances are taken into account. In spite of that, a function attending the requirements of the extension of the Invariance Principle, that is, an extended Lyapunov function, can be obtained by smooth perturbations on that energy-like function. This perturbed function can be used to estimate the attraction area without approximations or conjectures. Indeed, the difference between the proposed extended Lyapunov function and the approximated energy-like function has the order of a smooth perturbation. This fact supports the good CCT estimates that have been obtained using these approximated energy-like functions, and encourages engineers to keep using them for CCT estimates.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;ibm power systems;lossy compression;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;requirement	Flávio H.

It is not easy to model objects with free-form surfaces in a conventional solid modeling system. Such objects can be defined arbitrarily, but then operations on them are not transparent and complications occur. A method for achieving free-form effect is to define regular objects or surfaces, then deform them. This keeps various properties of the model intact while achieving the required visual appearance. This paper discusses a number of geometric modeling techniques with deformations applied to them in attempts to combine various approaches developed so far.	solid modeling	Ugur Güdükbay;Bülent Özgüç	1990	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/0097-8493(90)90071-5	simulation;computer aided design;solid modeling;computer graphics;mechanical engineering	Graphics	66.64712285879209	-41.66654786932978	13218
a089c4633c302040a80cfb69e6cc6087a6219178	indoor scene reconstruction from a sparse set of 3d shots		The use of cost-efficient and portative devices, such as the Ki-nect, has facilitated the reconstruction of indoor scenes, which has become a field of interest to many. While a large number of applications have been developed for the accurate reconstruction of a scene through efficient registration of multiple scans, the scanning of the scene by the user remains a time-consuming process. This is particularly the case when the scan must not contain any missing data. In this paper, we propose a method requiring only a few shots without any overlapping requirement, which makes the scanning process very simple and light. Given a set point clouds (shots) sparsely taken from an indoor scene, our method seeks for transformations that align the shots together, creating an alignment graph at the same time. It then searches within this graph for the set of transformations corresponding to a possible solution, providing a reconstruction of the scene. Since our method allows missing views and can find all plausible solutions, it can be used to create new scenes by assembling shots obtained from different real or virtual scenes.	align (company);cost efficiency;missing data;point cloud;sparse language;sparse matrix;virtual reality	Cédric Bobenrieth;Hyewon Seo;Arash Habibi;Frédéric Cordier	2017		10.1145/3095140.3095167	computer science;artificial intelligence;computer vision;3d reconstruction;point cloud;missing data;graph	Graphics	55.500211010316114	-45.97535281869987	13241

On-line control regulation in terms of optimal braking torque allocation is computed at each time increment by solving efficiently an Algebraic Riccati Equation.

The navigation method has been developed while using appearance-based Visual-Teach-andRepeat (VT&R) technique. In a teaching phase, a quadrotor is manually navigated along a desired route to collect a set of reference images. In a repeating phase, the quadrotor is able to autonomously follow the desired route using these reference images. Self-localization is developed to determine the current segment of the desired route by a number of SpeededUp Robust Features (SURF), matched between the current image and the reference images. In this paper, three methods of self-localization are proposed and T. Nguyen ( ) · G. K. I. Mann · R. G. Gosine · A.

After performing self-localization, the quadrotor computes appearance-based motion control commands (desired yaw and height) for the next movement in order to keep track of the desired route. This computation is developed on Funnel Lane theory, which was originally proposed in Chen and Birchfield (IEEE Trans. Robot. 25(3), 749–754 (2009)) for 2D navigation of a ground vehicle. The paper extends this theory to 3D navigation of a quadrotor. The proposed self-localization methods are tested with several image databases. Finally, an online experiment of proposed VT&R technique is demonstrated using Ar.Drone quadrotor model.	aerial photography;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;autonomous robot;circuit complexity;computation;computational complexity theory;database;email;entity–relationship model;global positioning system;memory management;motion planning;nl (complexity);obstacle avoidance;omnidirectional camera;on-board data handling;robot;self-similarity;sensor;speeded up robust features;unmanned aerial vehicle;yaws	Trung Nguyen;George K.

Recently, many sparse source separation approaches with time-frequency masks have been proposed. However, most of these approaches require information on the number of sources in advance. In our proposed method, we model the phase difference of arrival (PDOA) between microphones with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a Dirichlet prior. Then we estimate the model parameters by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation based on the EM algorithm. In order to avoid one cluster being modeled by two or more Gaussians, we utilize a sparse distribution modeled by the Dirichlet distributions as the prior of the GMM mixture weight. Moreover, to handle wide microphone spacing cases where the spatial aliasing problem occurs, the indeterminacy of modulus 2πk in the phase is also included in our model. Experimental results show good performance of our proposed method.	aliasing;blind signal separation;bruce ellis;dirichlet kernel;expectation–maximization algorithm;google map maker;hidden markov model;independent computing architecture;instantaneous phase;lecture notes in computer science;machine learning;markov chain;microphone;mixture model;modulus robot;nondeterministic algorithm;p (complexity);pattern recognition;software propagation;source separation;sparse matrix;springer (tank)	Shoko Araki;Tomohiro Nakatani;Hiroshi Sawada;Shoji Makino	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-00599-2_93	mathematical optimization;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics	AI	83.31287942572487	-37.15665799611765	13258

The proposed method consists of a simple atom-based, flexible alignment. The optimization procedure used in the alignment is based on a recently published variant of the simulated annealing whereby nonlinear constraints are accommodated using Lagrangian multipliers. It differs from other published superposition algorithms in that any number of nonlinear constraints can be readily imposed on the structural alignment directly through the objective function without assuming an a priori trade-off between competing conditions. These can include equality and equality constraints on distances, angles, and energy states. Examples illustrating the use of the proposed approach are also provided.		John W. Raymond;Daniel D.

The sensor is composed of two fibers: the active fiber and the passive fiber. Localized strain makes light couple from the active fiber to the passive fiber. The output of the active fiber is used for strain value sensing, whereas the double-ended outputs of the passive fiber are used for strain position sensing. Distributed sensing is realized based on the attenuation of the passive fiber, which has a greater attenuation coefficient than the active fiber. Since light emission and detection are performed by light-emitting diodes and photodiodes with a common preamp circuit, the entire system is realized with an extremely low cost, compared with other distributed optical fiber sensor systems. The theoretical model and limit parameter analysis, including the maximum length and the spatial resolution, are proposed with the experimental prototype model sensor that has been developed and tested. The performance of sensor is confirmed by a theoretical analysis and experimental results.	coefficient;diode;fiber optic sensor;optical fiber;passive optical network;preamplifier;prototype;theory	Chuantong Wang;Katsunori Shida	2007	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2007.899832	electronic engineering;fiber optic splitter;distributed acoustic sensing;optoelectronics;fiber optic sensor;polarization-maintaining optical fiber;optical time-domain reflectometer;optics;plastic optical fiber;multi-mode optical fiber;physics;fiber bragg grating;mode volume;light-emitting diode	Robotics	91.97010137451434	-20.048820051685713	13337

f789e9e56c9c5302f179f44ff10a7fd844d33a78	a model of open-loop control of equilibrium position and stiffness of the human elbow joint	sarcomere length;musculoskeletal model;low frequency;equilibrium point;article letter to editor;range of motion	According to the equilibrium point theory, the control of posture and movement involves the setting of equilibrium joint positions (EP) and the independent modulation of stiffness. One model of EP control, the α-model, posits that stable EPs and stiffness are set open-loop, i.e. without the aid of feedback. The purpose of the present study was to explore for the elbow joint the range over which stable EPs can be set open-loop and to investigate the effect of co-contraction on intrinsic low-frequency elbow joint stiffness (K ilf). For this purpose, a model of the upper and lower arm was constructed, equipped with Hill-type muscles. At a constant neural input, the isometric force of the contractile element of the muscles depended on both the myofilamentary overlap and the effect of sarcomere length on the sensitivity of myofilaments to [Ca2+] (LDCS). The musculoskeletal model, for which the parameters were chosen carefully on the basis of physiological literature, captured the salient isometric properties of the muscles spanning the elbow joint. It was found that stable open-loop EPs could be achieved over the whole range of motion of the elbow joint and that K ilf, which ranged from 18 to 42 N m·rad−1, could be independently controlled. In the model, LDCS contributed substantially to K ilf (up to 25 N m·rad−1) and caused K ilf to peak at a sub-maximal level of co-contraction.	basal ganglia diseases;body position;elbow joint structure;encapsulated postscript;expectation propagation;file spanning;isometric projection;kind of quantity - equilibrium;maximal set;microfilaments;modulation;muscle contraction;poor posture;sarcomeres;stiffness;temporomandibular joint disorders	Dinant A.

This probe consists of three identical copper toroids placed around a high-voltage electrode, where all are coaxially assembled in a large earthed cylinder. The probe was first simulated by a finite-element package to optimize the assembly and reduce the electric field inside it. This was confirmed by an alternating current test to ensure a corona-free design. Simultaneous impulse voltage measurements were done using the designed D-dot probe - two commercial mixed resistive-capacitive (RC) probes and a damped capacitive voltage divider. The linearity of the D-dot probe was checked under unloaded and loaded conditions. Results reveal that the larger the toroid separation and/or the lower the attenuator capacitance is, the higher the measured voltage from the middle “signal” toroid will be. The residual voltage waveforms for an 11-kV SA, measured by two commercial mixed RC probes and the damped capacitive voltage divider, showed an initial inductive overshoot superimposed on the waveform and a significant decay, even before the current peak instant. On the contrary, the voltage measured by the designed D-dot probe gave a voltage waveform that looked like that of the current and slightly led the latter. For the damped capacitive voltage divider and the two commercial mixed RC probes, neither the peak voltage nor the voltage at peak current gave the correct current-voltage characteristics. This confirms the contradiction of some published SA models in the high-conduction regime because most models were based on measurements done by different and large-impulse capacitive or resistive voltage dividers with improper compensation.	capacitive sensing;characteristic impedance;copper–tungsten;cylinder seal;high impedance;nonlinear system;optical attenuator;overshoot (signal);voltage divider;waveform	Ibrahim A.

We introduce the concept of reduced redundancy in a dependent set of projective Lines and argue that reduced redundancy in the axes of a body position increases injury risk.

So far, there have been various useful collision avoidance algorithms and path planning schemes. However, those algorithms possess fundamental limitations in that the robot can avoid only ldquovisiblerdquo ones among surrounded obstacles. In a real environment, it is not possible to detect all the dynamic obstacles around the robot. There are many occluded regions due to the limited field of view. In order to avoid collisions, it is desirable to exploit visibility information. This paper proposes a safe navigation scheme to reduce collision risk considering occluded dynamic obstacles. The robot's motion is controlled by the hybrid control scheme. The possibility of collision is dually reflected to path planning and speed control. The proposed scheme clearly indicates the structural procedure on how to model and to exploit the risk of navigation. The proposed scheme is experimentally tested in a real office building. The experimental results show that the robot moves along the safe path to obtain sufficient field of view. In addition, safe speed constraints are applied in motion control. It is experimentally verified that a robot safely navigates in dynamic indoor environment by adopting the proposed scheme.	algorithm;experiment;mobile robot;motion planning;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system	Woojin Chung;Seokgyu Kim;Minki Choi;Jaesik Choi;Hoyeon Kim;Chang-bae Moon;Jae-Bok Song	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2025293	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	59.580405650685655	-23.131412190360074	13471
fff273e91df9709c135878aafef59c03e9b8dc2c	design of a leak sensor for operating water pipe systems		Water pipe leakage is a common and significant problem around the world. In recent years, an increasing amount of effort has been put into developing effective leak detection solutions for water pipes. Among them, the pressure gradient based method developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology excels for its sensitivity in low pressure, small diameter pipes. It can also work in both plastic and metallic pipes carrying gas or water. However, the method was only verified in static fluid pipes, and the previous sensor designs were unable to detect leaks when there is a significant water flow in the pipe. This is undesired as the inspection can only be performed when water service is shut down. A modeling analysis shows that fluid dynamic effects in the water pipe make the original sensors dynamics too slow to react to leaks. Moreover, this leak detection method is prone to false alarms such as obstacles in the pipes, but there is a lack of studies on this topic. In this paper, we present three things: the design of a new leak sensor that is fast enough to detect leaks in dynamic fluid environments, a prototype for 52mm-inner-diameter pipeline tested in an industrial facility, and a method to differentiate leaks from false alarms supported by the test results.	gradient;maxima and minima;named pipe;prototype;sensor;spectral leakage;water cooling	You Wu;Kristina Kim;Michael Finn Henry;Kamal Youcef-Toumi	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8206506	pressure gradient;industrial facility;control engineering;computer science;water pipe;leakage (electronics);marine engineering;leak;flow (psychology)	Robotics	89.94319442583752	-21.145786534281566	13479
a1fe293090c3faf9cb8725a565118415083d87f6	a power series based inverse-kinematics solution of humanoid robot finger with coupled joints		Inverse-kinematics is an emphasis and difficulty in the design and application of the humanoid robot hand with coupled joints because of nonlinearity induced by trigonometric transcendental function. In this paper, a power series based inverse-kinematics algorithm is presented, by which the transcendental equation including trigonometric function can be converted into an algebraic equation. An approximate solution is derived first by means of power series expansions; with 1D linear interpolation for errors compensating, the final solution with small error can then be achieved. For robot with linearly coupled joints, the algorithms based on power series expanded to quadratic and quartic terms are used to calculate the accurate joint angles. For robot with nonlinearly coupled joints, the specific procedures are proposed to select appropriate transmission ratio. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed inverse kinematics method.	humanoid robot;inverse kinematics	Li Jiang;Bingqian Sun;Haiwei Gu	2018	I. J.

The main contribution of the paper is a new vertex result that drastically reduces the number of extreme realizations required to check robust feasibility. This vertex result allows one to solve, in a deterministic way and without introducing conservatism, the corresponding robustness problem for small and medium size problems. For example, consider quadratic stability of an autonomous nx dimensional system. In this case, instead of checking equation vertices, we show that it suffices to check 22nx specially constructed systems. This solution is still exponential, but this is not surprising because the problem is NP-hard. Finally, vertex extensions to multiaffine interval families and some sufficient conditions (in LMI form) for robust feasibility are presented.

This map-based user interface does not give fine control over the height profile of the generated terrain. We propose a new texture-based terrain synthesis framework controllable by a terrain sketching interface. We enhance the realism of the generated landscapes by using a novel patch merging method that reduces boundary artefacts caused by overlapping terrain patches. A more constrained synthesis process is used to produce landscapes that better match user requirements. The high computational cost of texture synthesis is reduced with a parallel implementation on graphics hardware. Our GPU-accelerated solution provides a significant speedup depending on the size of the example terrain. We show experimentally that our framework is more successful in generating realistic landscapes than current example-based terrain synthesis methods. We conclude that texture-based terrain synthesis combined with sketching provides an excellent solution to the user control and realism challenges of virtual landscape generation.	algorithmic efficiency;blackwell (series);computer graphics;eurographics;experiment;feature extraction;feature model;flight simulator;graphics hardware;graphics processing unit;heightmap;preprocessor;requirement;simulation;speech synthesis;speedup;terrain rendering;texture synthesis;user interface;user requirements document;virtual reality	Flora Ponjou Tasse;James E.

16aaee8bab4bbb5142415bb0beee57ec4fcc5d5f	qp-based adaptive-gains compliance control in humanoid falls	humanoid robot;adaptive qp;safe fall;active compliance	We address the problem of humanoid falling with a decoupled strategy consisting of a pre-impact and a postimpact stage. In the pre-impact stage, geometrical reasoning allows the robot to choose appropriate impact points in the surrounding environment and to adopt a posture to reach them while avoiding impact-singularities and preparing for the postimpact. The surrounding environment can be unstructured and may contain cluttered obstacles. The post-impact stage uses a quadratic program controller that adapts on-line the joint proportional-derivative (PD) gains to make the robot compliant-to absorb impact and post-impact dynamics, which lowers possible damage risks. This is done by a new approach incorporating the stiffness and damping gains directly as decision variables in the QP along with the usually-considered variables of joint accelerations and contact forces. Constraints of the QP prevent the motors from reaching their torque limits during the fall.

This is understandable given the huge success of the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) theory and applications for the past half-century. It is not an exaggeration to say that the entire aerospace industry, from the Apollo moon landing to the latest global positioning system (GPS), owe a debt to this control-theoretic development in the late 1950s and early 1960s. As a result, the curse of dimensionality notwithstanding, finding the optimal control law for more general dynamic systems remains an idealized goal for all problem solvers. We continue to hope that with each advance in computer hardware and mathematical theory, we will move one step closer to this ultimate goal. Efforts such as feedback linearization and multimode adaptive control can be viewed as such successful attempts. It is the thesis of this note to argue that this idealized goal of control theory is somewhat misplaced. We have been seduced by our early successes with the LQG theory and its extensions. The simple but often not emphasized fact is this: It is extremely difficult to specify and impossible to implement a general multivariable function even if the function is known.	centralized computing;computer hardware;control theory;curse of dimensionality;dynamical system;feedback;global positioning system;optimal control	Yu-Chi Ho	2005	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2005.844898	control engineering;simulation;adaptive control;aerodynamics;engineering;control system;control theory;feedback;mathematics	Theory	70.13520129689172	-9.971110142821862	13604

When cutting tubing, the device receives the tubing so that each of the blades cuts at an angle less than 90 degrees with respect to the tangent line of the tubing at the point where each contacts the tubing. This device may be used in a method for cutting tubing comprised of securing a section of tubing, receiving the tubing with the engaging surface of the device, contacting an end of the tubing with at least one blade wherein the blade is positioned at an angle less than 90 degrees with respect to the tangent line of the tubing at the point where the blade contacts the tubing, and cutting the tubing by pulling the block longitudinally along the tubing. This device and method present an easier way for longitudinally cutting tubing and allow multiple cuts to be made simultaneously.	decision support system	Chun-Hsien Li;Hung-Wen Chiu;Cyun-Yao Su;Chien-Yeh Hsu	2009			emergency department;medical emergency;medicine;mechanical engineering	Robotics	83.23831269933362	-19.45789412855522	13617

Real images of a rigid object acquired under a simple but controlled environment are used to recover the three dimensional geometry and the surface appearance. Based on a multi-image calibration method, an algorithm to extract the rotation axis of a turn-table has been developed. Furthermore, this can be extended to estimate robustly the initial bounding volume of the object to be modeled. The coarse volume obtained, is then carved using a stereo correction method which removes the disadvantages of silhouette based reconstruction by photoconsistency. The concept of surface particles is adapted in order to extract a texture map for the model. Some metrics are defined to measure the quality of the reconstructed models.	algorithm;apache axis;bounding volume;camera resectioning;graphics pipeline;texture mapping	Ulas Yilmaz;Adem Yasar Mülayim;Volkan Atalay	2002		10.1109/TDPVT.2002.1024117	image texture;computer vision;mathematics;geometry;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.06963987404627	-50.020758279934334	13620

When an electric field is applied across the insulating membrane, the ionic current through the nanopore reports on polymer translocation, unzipping, dissociation, and so forth. We present a new model that can be applied in molecular dynamics simulations of NFS. Although simplified, it does reproduce experimental trends and all-atom simulations. The scaled conductivities in bulk solution are consistent with experimental results for NaCl for a wide range of electrolyte concentrations and temperatures. The dependence of the ionic current through a nanopore on the applied voltage is symmetric and, in the voltage range used in experiments (up to 2 V), linear and in good agreement with experimental data. The thermal stability and geometry of DNA is well represented. The model was applied to simulations of DNA hairpin unzipping in nanopores. The results are in good agreement with all-atom simulations: the scaled translocation times and unzipping sequence are similar.	atom;dna microarray;dimensions;experiment;force field (chemistry);ionic;martini;molecular dynamics;polymer;simulation;sodium chloride;tissue membrane;x-ray emission spectroscopy;voltage	Anna Stachiewicz;Andrzej Molski	2015	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.23874	crystallography;nanopore;molecular dynamics;chemistry;computational chemistry;nanotechnology;dna;physics	Comp.	95.91640016412123	-5.546206812184325	13637

For realizing model matching with a reference model, the asynchronous machine must have additional reachability to deal with transitions by uncontrollable inputs. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an appropriate controller are given in terms of a reachability relation between the machine and the model.

e7e58f0b2f0f2b101fe9c3a43ad6d90fba5925c9	the impact of high-frequency haptic device behavior on perception		Haptic rendering is typically done through either impedance or admittance devices, which exist at opposite ends of a spectrum from light direct-drive to non-backdrivable highly geared. The device hardware necessarily influences what the user will feel, particularly at high frequencies. While human motion is generally limited to 10Hz, virtual environments with contact transitions have the potential to excite a wider frequency spectrum. We employ the effective impedance decomposition to discuss the effects of hardware and controller selection outside of the rendering bandwidth. We also introduce an analysis of the admittance and impedance controllers with respect to sensitivity to load cell noise. Using a reconfigurable admittance/impedance device and a perceptual experiment, we explore these effects. We find that higher effective mass outside the rendering bandwidth leads to more confusion in discriminating springs in an admittance device than an impedance device.	characteristic impedance;excite;haptic technology;kinesiology;simulink;spectral density;virtual reality	Emma Treadway;R.

Although interesting results about modeling of heat exchanger by linear parameter varying (LPV) can be found in   [25]  , several problems remain to be solved such as the structure estimation or a proper initial MISO model for the optimization algorithms. This paper introduces a new model structure called quasi LPV model which simulates accurately the temperature and flow transients in a counter flow heat exchanger (COFHX). The quasi LPV model is compared to a realistic numerical model of a counter flow heat exchanger adjusted with the test rig heat exchanger of the University of Valenciennes in France. Comparisons indicate that the developed quasi LPV model is capable of predicting the transient performance of the heat exchangers satisfactorily.	system analysis;system identification	Seif Eddine Chouaba;Afzal Chamroo;Régis Ouvrard;Thierry Poinot	2012	Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory	10.1016/j.simpat.2011.12.007	identification;control engineering;simulation;interpolation;computer science;engineering;control theory	Vision	56.4859639017474	-6.454819400561078	13692

In its basic form, the technique supports a single layer of wiring on a flexible substrate. This can be a valuable tool for pervasive computing research because it allows simple electronic circuits and devices to be built and iterated quickly, in an analogous manner to the use of 3D printers for prototyping mechanical structures. It is possible to rapidly create touch- and proximity-sensitive surfaces, to cut and fold the printed conductive patterns, and to augment them with off-the-shelf electronic components and custom-made subcircuits. The authors present the possibilities enabled by conductive inkjet printing, bringing together their previously published results and presenting their latest insights and findings. They consider these printing and fabrication techniques as a suite of tools for researchers and practitioners who wish to fabricate a variety of functional device prototypes. They aim to enable others to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of conductive inkjet printing across a range of pervasive computing applications.

1bcd54b44b2f0cf235cb7b1a54f988fd9eb87752	a variable gain model-independent algorithm for rendezvous of euler-lagrange agents on directed networks		A variable-gain model-independent control law is proposed to solve the problem of rendezvous to a leader for a directed network of Euler-Lagrange agents. A sufficiency condition for stability is developed, requiring centralised design of the two control gains. Compared to existing results which use constant-gain model-independent controllers for directed networks, our work has two key differences. Firstly, the damping term may begin at zero, and increases only if rendezvous has not been achieved. Constant-gain controllers use conservative gain values which negatively impact convergence speed. Secondly, we introduce a novel method of analysing the Lyapunov derivative, which provides useful and unique insight into analysis of variable-gain controllers for multi-agent systems. Simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the controller.	algorithm;centralisation;computer simulation;constant folding;euler;euler–lagrange equation;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;optimal control;regular language description for xml;stationary process;variable-gain amplifier	Mengbin Ye;Brian D.

Unlike the iterative level set methods in the literature, we present a novel numerical method to compute the H-infinity norm. This method requires solving one eigenvalue problem of at most twice the size of the eigenvalue problem in every iteration of a level set method, but in practice often considerably lower. We first show that the computation of extrema of the transfer function can be turned into the computation of the imaginary axis zeros of a transcendental function. We compute these zeros by a predictor–corrector type algorithm. It is known that the H-infinity norm of delay differential algebraic systems, which can model both retarded and neutral type systems, might be sensitive with respect to arbitrarily small delay perturbations. This recently led to the concept of strong H-infinity norms, which explicitly take into account such small delay perturbations. We present a direct numerical method to compute the strong H-infinity norm of SISO time-delay systems. Our algorithm is applicable to the closed-loop system of interconnections (series, parallel, feedback, junctions) of time-delay systems and/or controllers.	computation;maxima and minima;soft-in soft-out decoder	Suat Gumussoy;Wim Michiels	2015	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2015.02.003	robust control;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Theory	70.06904377053614	-0.8446249276144323	13759

It is shown that the closed-loop system's gain can be assigned arbitrarily by an appropriate choice of certain weighting function of the projection-based force reflection algorithm. In particular, this allows to achieve stability of the force-reflecting teleoperator system in presence of time-varying irregular delays for arbitrarily large force-reflecting gain and arbitrarily low damping and stiffness of the master. The proposed approach solves, to some extent, the trade-off between stability, manoeuvrability, and high force reflection gain in force-reflecting teleoperator system with network-induced communication constraints.	algorithm;bilateral filter;telerobotics;television;weight function	Ilia G.

6c124a51f4d2d6783b9474b85ae0dad4501bd01c	influence of the spatial dimensions of ultrasonic transducers on the frequency spectrum of guided waves	mfc transducer;excitability function;frequency response;structural health monitoring;ultrasonic guided wave excitation	Ultrasonic guided wave (UGW)-based condition monitoring has shown great promise in detecting, localizing, and characterizing damage in complex systems. However, the application of guided waves for damage detection is challenging due to the existence of multiple modes and dispersion. This results in distorted wave packets with limited resolution and the interference of multiple reflected modes. To develop reliable inspection systems, either the transducers have to be optimized to generate a desired single mode of guided waves with known dispersive properties, or the frequency responses of all modes present in the structure must be known to predict wave interaction. Currently, there is a lack of methods to predict the response spectrum of guided wave modes, especially in cases when multiple modes are being excited simultaneously. Such methods are of vital importance for further understanding wave propagation within the structures as well as wave-damage interaction. In this study, a novel method to predict the response spectrum of guided wave modes was proposed based on Fourier analysis of the particle velocity distribution on the excitation area. The method proposed in this study estimates an excitability function based on the spatial dimensions of the transducer, type of vibration, and dispersive properties of the medium. As a result, the response amplitude as a function of frequency for each guided wave mode present in the structure can be separately obtained. The method was validated with numerical simulations on the aluminum and glass fiber composite samples. The key findings showed that it can be applied to estimate the response spectrum of a guided wave mode on any type of material (either isotropic structures, or multi layered anisotropic composites) and under any type of excitation if the phase velocity dispersion curve and the particle velocity distribution of the wave source was known initially. Thus, the proposed method may be a beneficial tool to explain and predict the response spectrum of guided waves throughout the development of any structural health monitoring system.	aluminum measurement;complex systems;computer simulation;dimensions;dispersive partial differential equation;estimated;excitation;fourier analysis;frequency response;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;numerical analysis;numerous;sensor;software propagation;transducer;transducers;ultrasonics (sound);ultrasonography, prenatal;velocity (software development);wave packet;anatomical layer;fiberglass	Vykintas Samaitis;Liudas Mazeika	2017		10.3390/s17081825	electronic engineering;wave packet;wave propagation;single-mode optical fiber;engineering;acoustics;frequency response;phase velocity;dispersion (optics);optics;particle velocity;guided wave testing	EDA	91.70705495924743	-21.480594360245256	13796

In this paper, a design framework is presented that does not rely on passivity considerations. A number of results are given that deal with stability and transparency properties of the tele-rehabilitation system in the case of intrinsically non-passive behaviour of the therapist. In particular, a stabilization scheme for the networked tele-rehabilitation system is proposed which guarantees stability regardless of the specific actions of the therapist.

It is shown, that flatness for this class of systems is equivalent to the fact, that the unique decomposition of the pull back of the Pfaffian system to a certain jet space into a horizontal and vertical part, has a trivial horizontal part only. We present an algorithm to construct the required jet space, as well as the decomposition. It uses the fact, that a flat Pfaffian system must admit a certain affine input representation after a possible extension by contact forms. Since this representation is not unique, a branching point may appear and all branches have to be checked. This applies also to the decomposition of the system in AI representation into a horizontal and a vertical part. It is shown, how the number of branches can be reduced significantly. The algorithm requires the solution of non linear algebraic equations and the determination of flows generated by distributions. It is worth mentioning, that the presented approach degenerates to the well known one for input to state linearizable system by static feedback. Finally, the application of the algorithm to three examples, all are not input to state linearizable by static feedback, is shown.	algebraic equation;algorithm;control system;linearizability;matrix multiplication;nonlinear system;whole earth 'lectronic link	Kurt Schlacher;Markus Schöberl	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760270	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;pfaffian constraint;engineering;control theory;feedback;mathematics;flatness	Robotics	70.20570840123487	-1.86675715036937	13805

The aim of this research is to establish the heavy metal soil contamination degree using modern research methods namely spectrometric and stripping methods. The results pointed out very high exceeding values, especially in the case of lead and copper, in the studied area. Moreover, the mobility and the availability of heavy metals decreases when pH increases.

The algorithm uses Voronoi vertices to remove triangles from the Delaunay triangulation. We prove the algorithm correct by showing that for densely sampled surfaces, where density depends on a local feature size function, the output is topologically valid and convergent (both pointwise and in surface normals) to the original surface. We briefly describe an implementation of the algorithm and show example outputs.		Nina Amenta;Marshall W.

They consist of geometric proxy planes augmented with detailed displacement maps and combine the generality of geometry-based 3D video with the regularization properties of image-based 3D video. 3D video billboards are an image-based representation placed in the disparity space of the acquisition cameras and thus provide a regular sampling of the scene with a uniform error model. We propose a general geometry filtering framework which generates time-coherent models and removes reconstruction and quantization noise as well as calibration errors. This replaces the complex and time-consuming sub-pixel matching process in stereo reconstruction with a bilateral filter. Rendering is performed using a GPU-accelerated algorithm which generates consistent view-dependent geometry and textures for each individual frame. In addition, we present a semi-automatic approach for modeling dynamic three-dimensional scenes with a set of multiple 3D video billboards clouds.	3d film;algorithm;bilateral filter;binocular disparity;coherence (physics);computer stereo vision;correspondence problem;displacement mapping;graphics processing unit;hough transform;level of detail;map;pixel;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;signal processing;video	Michael Waschbüsch;Stephan Würmlin;Markus H.

Due to the micro-fabrication process used, the bimorph actuators can be designed to move in both: Counter Clockwise (CCW) and Clockwise (CW) directions with a resolution of up to 110 μm/V, with smallest step in the range of nanometers. Thermal and electrical characterization of the thermal bimorph actuators showed low influence in the platforms temperature and low power consumption (<; 35μW) mainly due to the natural isolation of the structure. Tip displacements larger than 500μm were achieved. The precise angle adjustment achieved through these mechanisms makes them optimal for a range of different MEMS applications, like optical benches and low frequency sweeping sensors and antennas.	bulk copy program;channel i/o;microelectromechanical systems;pitch (music);ring counter;semiconductor device fabrication;sensor;transducer	David Conchouso;Arpys Arevalo;David Castro;Ian G.

The control structure consists of a feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) to approximate the manipulator's inverse dynamics online, a feedback radial basis function (RBF) neural network to compensate for the residual errors, and a reference model that defines the desired error dynamics. The online adaptation of the RBF neural network is is accomplished through two methods: (i) the least mean squares (LMS), and (ii) the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms. A comparison study is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of both algorithms on the tracking ability of the proposed control scheme. Simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed control structures in compensating for the highly nonlinear unknown dynamics of the manipulator and its robustness in the presence of model imperfections.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;control flow;control theory;feedforward neural network;inverse dynamics;least mean squares filter;multilayer perceptron;nonlinear system;quad flat no-leads package;radial (radio);radial basis function;recursion;recursive least squares filter;reference model;simulation	Hicham Chaoui;Wail Gueaieb;Mustapha Chérif-Eddine Yagoub	2007	2007 International Workshop on Robotic and Sensors Environments	10.1109/ROSE.2007.4373967	control engineering;computer science;machine learning;control theory	Robotics	63.22064374189557	-10.930373645347288	13925

Almost 40 protein-ligand complexes were employed for a continuum approach, which considers the protein and the peptide at the atomic level, but includes solvent as a polarizable continuum. Five protein-ligand complexes were employed for an all-atom approach that relies on a combination of the double decoupling method with thermodynamic integration and molecular dynamics. These affinities were also computed by means of the linear interaction energy method. Although it generally proved rather difficult to predict the absolute free energies correctly, for some protein families the experimental ranking order was correctly reproduced by the continuum and all-atom approach. Considerable attention has also been given to correctly analyze the affinities of charged peptides, where it is required to judge the effect of one or more ions that are being decoupled in an all-atom approach to preserve electroneutrality. The various methods are further judged upon their merits.		Serena Donnini;André H.

Measurement methods, such as optical tracking systems, are useful for measuring the performance of mobile manipulators, although at a much higher relative cost as compared to artifacts. The concept of using test artifacts demonstrates to potential manufacturers and users of mobile manipulator systems that relatively low cost performance measurement methods exist. This paper discusses the concept of reconfigurable mobile manipulator artifacts that were designed and built. An artifact was then used through experimentation to measure the performance of a mobile manipulator to demonstrate the feasibility of the test method. Experimental results show a promising test method to measure the performance of mobile manipulators that are to be used for manufacturing assembly tasks, where at least the mobile manipulator tested has the capability to perform assembly to 1 mm positional accuracy or	coat of arms;image resolution;mobile manipulator;repeatability;robot;sensor;tracking system	Roger Bostelman;Sebti Foufou;Steven A.

The tasks are attempted using hybrid “in materio” computation: a technique that uses machine search to configure materials for computation. The SWCNT / polymer composite materials are configured using static voltages so that voltage output readings from the material predict which class the data samples belong to. Our initial results suggest that the configured SWCNT materials are able to achieve good levels of predictive accuracy. However, we are in no doubt that the time and effort required to configure the samples could be improved. The parameter space when dealing with physical systems is large, often unknown and slow to test, making progress in this field difficult. Our purpose is not demonstrate the accuracy of configured samples to perform a certain classification, but to showcase the potential of configuring very small material samples with analogue voltages to solve stand alone computation tasks. Such SWCNT devices would be cheap to manufacture and require only low precision assembly, yet if correctly configured would be able to function as multipurpose, single task computational devices.	computation;computer science;experiment;high-level programming language;james massey;niche blogging;polymer;sensor;sound quality	Kester Dean Clegg;Julian Francis Miller;Mark K.

13246bd8a199135f17094ca982196de65564160b	nonlinear fractional-order estimator with guaranteed robustness and stability for lithium-ion batteries		This paper proposes a new estimator design algorithm for state-of-charge (SoC) indication of lithium-ion batteries. A fractional-order model-based nonlinear estimator is first framed including a Luenberger term and a sliding mode term. The estimator gains are designed by Lyapunov's direct method, providing a guarantee for stability and robustness of the error system under certain assumptions. This generic estimation algorithm is then applied to lithium-ion batteries. A fractional-order circuit model is adopted to predict battery dynamic behaviours. Assumptions based on which the estimation algorithm is developed are justified and remarked. Experiments corresponding to electric vehicle applications are conducted to parameterize the battery model and demonstrate the estimation performance. It shows that the proposed approach is able to estimate SoC with errors less than 0.03 in the presence of initial deviation and persistent noise. Furthermore, the benefits of using the proposed estimator relative to other estimators are calculated over different cycles and conditions.	direct method in the calculus of variations;experiment;genetic algorithm;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;state of charge	Changfu Zou;Xiaosong Hu;Lei Zhang;Xiaolin Tang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2782691	engineering;control engineering;control theory;robustness (computer science);estimator;nonlinear system;battery (electricity);lyapunov function;electric vehicle;lithium-ion battery;lithium	Robotics	67.04689549003102	-5.677675688691927	14212

Joiner, which joints pieces of woods and has complex process of jointing, is analyzed and modeled for visualization using homotopy theory and attaching maps. Joining the two pieces of woods changes their structures differently, which depends on jointing techniques. The paper describes difference between the tenon-mortise and lap joints in the fundamental group of homotopy. As the properties of the fundamental group are invariants, they are preserved through modeling from the abstract level to the specific one. When describing the process of jointing, two piece of woods are indirectly connected through a virtual attaching space using an attaching map, which avoids unnecessary consideration of piece relations. Using these concepts of homotopy, the process of jointing two pieces of woods are modeled from the abstract level in homotopy to the middle level of cellular structured spaces, to the specific one of physical presentation.	entity;invariant (computer science);lifting scheme;map;turing completeness;virtual world	Kenji Ohmori;Tosiyasu L.

The vehicle's nominal velocity is also assumed to be known. An observability analysis is performed and an observer is designed. The proposed approach departs from alternative ones and leads to the definition of a linear time-invariant state equation with a linear time-varying output. The localization problem is solved using a novel outlier robust predictor-corrector state estimator. Numerical simulation examples are described to illustrate the performance of the method compared with a standard Kalman filter.	estimation theory;filter design;global positioning system;kalman filter;kerrison predictor;linear time-invariant theory;predictor–corrector method;programming paradigm;robotics;simulation;time complexity;time-invariant system;velocity (software development)	Giovanni Indiveri;Daniela De Palma;Gianfranco Parlangeli	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2015.2512879	kalman filter;control engineering;mathematical optimization;navigation;observability;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;robustness	Robotics	63.44986652892782	-14.625107181050286	14301

VISM has been implemented thinking that the immediate visual feedback greatly improve complex surface modelling and also creativity. The proposed new tools are progressive skinning (PS) and curve-over-surface shaping (COSS), both implemented on a bimanual virtual environment. PS lets the designer generate a new surface by interactively and automatically adding section curves to a non-uniform rational B-spline surface. COSS is based on curve-over-a-surface progressive constraining in order to deform an area of an existent surface. Efficient numerical solutions are proposed to achieve true interactive modelling sessions.	computer-aided design;enriques–kodaira classification;geometric modeling;interactivity;modeller;noise shaping;non-uniform rational b-spline;numerical analysis;online and offline;progressive enhancement;real-time clock;real-time locating system;software development;stereopsis;stereoscopy;virtual reality	Alfredo Liverani;Serena Morigi	2004	The Visual Computer	10.1007/s00371-004-0258-y	computer vision;simulation;computer science;virtual machine;virtual reality;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	69.34874560928024	-48.54407522899549	14310

One of the most practical methods which remove large debris, such as non-functioning satellite, is attaching a propulsion system for reentry. However, it exists difficulty to attach the system because non-cooperative satellites are expected to have no fixture specialized for grasping purpose. Furthermore, the dynamic parameters of the target need to be determined to realize stabilization when they are unknown. Accordingly, multipoint contact is introduced for stabilization of push-only control and estimate parameters. This paper describes the estimation method of the dynamic parameters using an unscented Kalman filter based on multipoint contact information and attitude stabilization using push-only (without pull operation) control based on feedback linearization and receding horizon with input constraints.	angularjs;estimation theory;kalman filter;multipoint ground;nonlinear system;simulation;test fixture	Tomohiro Narumi;Naohiro Uyama;Shinichi Kimura	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7354151	kalman filter;control engineering;simulation;aerodynamics;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;attitude control;extended kalman filter;force;satellite	Robotics	64.28473264126362	-16.222802853132496	14357

In general, the W-disjoint orthogonality assumption is used for blind source separation using multi-microphones.

6f6c70d22e377264f6b57b074ff8d7a3c33ce5da	evaluation and enhancement of common simulation methods for robotic range sensors	distance measure;simulation methods;autonomous robot	Distance sensors are an important class of external sensors used in many autonomous robots. Thus it is of importance to provide proper simulation for these sensors to enable software-in-the-loop testing of a robot’s control software. Two different methods for distance calculation are commonly applied for the simulation of such sensors, namely reading back the depth buffer from 3D renderings and the calculation of ray-object-intersections. Many simulators impose restrictions on either method, none of the widely used robot simulators reviewed in this paper currently considers material dependent simulation of the distances measured. In this paper extended versions of both methods are presented which provide additional information on the object perceived by distance sensors. Several methods for incorporating distanceand object-information into a complete distance-sensor simulation-module are discussed. Implementations of either method are compared for their performance depending on the sensor resolution on different computer systems. These measurements show, that the break even of the methods strongly depends on the hardware, thus stressing the importance of providing either method in a robot simulation in a transparent way in order to obtain optimal performance of the simulation.	autonomous robot;computer;sensor;simulation;z-buffering	Martin Friedmann;Karen Petersen;Oskar von Stryk	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-17319-6_9	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	60.34774841855357	-37.80322737879904	14434

The recent trend in such construction, i.e., the image-based rendering (IBR) approach, focuses on more convenient handling of the real space, but the obtained space is usually constrained by the difficulty in image analysis. In this paper, aiming at relaxing the modeling cost of the real space and the accessing cost on WWW, we propose a simple approach where we use scenic images such as those taken by a digital camera or a video camera without distorting them. By enlarging or shrinking an avatar image and pasting it on a background scenic image according to the user's input, we can visualize the depth of the scene as pseudo 3D space. We call the method the image-based nonrendering (IBNR), intended as an antithesis to IBR. In our system, we emphasize on two points: the scene independency, i.e., each scene is more independent of other scenes, and the platform independency, i.e., usual WWW browsers can be used in the walk-through of the space without extra plug-ins.	2.5d;www	Masahiko Tsukamoto	2000		10.1007/3-540-46422-0_23	computer vision;image analysis;visualization;image processing;computer science;virtual reality;multimedia;computer graphics (images)	Visualization	62.27366543312287	-48.39221986027849	14446

Biomimetics is the applied science that, through the imitation of Nature, finds the solution to a human problem. The unfolding of a beetle wing and the blooming of a swirl flower were recognised as having outstanding features to be mimicked for the creation of deployable canopies. This paper focuses on the analysis methodology of the two biomimetic, deployable structures with multiple degrees of freedom. The general validity of a pseudo-static analysis was proved based on time-stepping the geometry at set deployment stages with optimisation of multiple, potential deployment sequences.	biomimetics;net (polyhedron)	Giulia Evelina Fenci;Neil Currie	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22979-9_11	structural engineering;botany;engineering;ecology	Robotics	77.27599204254801	-23.47368863126552	14459

Unfortunately, the planned path can be significantly different from the real path due to the presence of uncertainty on the available data, with the consequence that some constraints may be not fulfilled by the real path even if they are satisfied by the planned path. In this paper we address the problem of performing robust path-planning, i.e. computing a path that satisfies the required constraints not only for the nominal model as in traditional path-planning but rather for a family of admissible models. Specifically, we consider an uncertain model where the point correspondences between the initial and desired views and the camera intrinsic parameters are affected by unknown random uncertainties with known bounds. The difficulty we have to face is that traditional path-planning schemes applied to different models lead to different paths rather than to a common and robust path. To solve this problem we propose a technique based on polynomial optimization where the required constraints are imposed on a number of trajectories corresponding to admissible camera poses and parameterized by a common design variable. The planned image trajectory is then followed by using an IBVS controller. Simulations carried out with all typical uncertainties that characterize a real experiment illustrate the proposed strategy and provide promising results.	camera resectioning;computer simulation;correspondence problem;mathematical optimization;motion planning;polynomial;uncertain data;visual servoing;workspace	Graziano Chesi	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152226	mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;uncertainty;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;motion planning;silicon;visual servoing;computational model;specification;statistics;robustness;polynomial;satisfiability	Robotics	60.225614220765394	-32.09036383235856	14477

As we probably know, the inversion of Jacobian matrix is required in the pseudo inverse method when solving the problem, which is computationally intensive, especially for complex mobile robot systems. Besides, to take full advantage of the mutual coordination effect between a mobile platform with two omni-directional driving wheels and a six-joint manipulator, an integrated kinematics of the TWMRS is derived and developed to coordinate the motions of the platform and the manipulator. In addition, such an inverse-free solution with different values of design parameter and the conventional pseudo inverse solution are performed for comparison based on the TWMRS for specific path-tracking tasks. The illustrative and comparative simulation results show that the mobile platform and the manipulator coordinate well during the whole process with the aid of the integrated kinematics, and then substantiate the efficacy, accuracy as well as superiority of the proposed inverse-free solution to inverse kinematics of the TWMRS.	gradient;inverse kinematics;jacobian matrix and determinant;mobile device;mobile operating system;mobile robot;moore–penrose pseudoinverse;simulation;wheels	Yunong Zhang;Huan-Chang Huang;Xiaogang Yan;Hongzhou Tan;Sheng Wu	2016	2016 3rd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI)	10.1109/ICSAI.2016.7810942	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;inverse kinematics;control theory;mathematics;robot kinematics	Robotics	64.99354373618529	-22.16348271910819	14548
121f7ec49db580bfeb712af7950d7f388955f3b1	position control of stewart manipulator using a new extended adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller and observer (e-afsmco)		Abstract Previously proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AFSMC) and adaptive fuzzy sliding mode observer (AFSMO) methods are mixed and extended for the case of affine systems in which the input gain matrix is state-dependent, non-diagonal and non-positive definite. The proposed Extended AFSMCO (E-AFSMCO) method is then applied for position control of a Stewart Manipulator (SM), whose parameters are strongly state-dependent and complex and not suitable for practical control purposes. A robust observer-based control method which can work with a simplified model of the plant, and at the same time can preserve the stability and performance of the overall complex system is of great need. In this study, the SM dynamic model is simplified by removing the dynamic effects of the legs and the neglected terms are considered as un-modeled dynamics, for which the upper bound of the uncertainty is progressively estimated using the proposed adaptation rules. The final controller is comprised of a fuzzy controller in parallel with a robust switching controller. The second Lyapunov theorem is used to prove the closed-loop asymptotic stability. The proposed E-AFSMCO method is verified numerically and experimentally, depicting the effectiveness of the method for real-time industrial applications.

afa59aa634d96624dc7d4bbb5d160f302e5a8e39	controlling the strong field fragmentation of clcho+ using two laser pulses -an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation	born-oppenheimer molecular dynamics;strong field chemistry;aligned molecules;mode selective chemistry;wavelet analysis	For a single, intense 7 μm linearly polarized laser pulse, we found that the branching ratio for the fragmentation of ClCHO+ → Cl + HCO+ , H + ClCO+ , HCl+ +CO depended strongly on the orientation of the molecule (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3 2541). The present study explores the possibility of controlling the branching ratio for fragmentation by using two independent pulses with different frequencies, alignment and delay. Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations in the laser field were carried out with the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory using combinations of 3.5, 7 and 10.5 μm sine squared pulses with field strengths of 0.03 au (peak intensity of 3.15×1013 W/cm2 ) and lengths of 560 fs. A 3.5 μm pulse aligned with the C-H bond and a 10.5 μm pulse perpendicular to the C-H bond produced a larger branching ratio for HCl+ +CO than a comparable single 7 μm pulse. When the 10.5 μm pulse was delayed by one quarter of the pulse envelope, the branching ratio for the high energy product, (HCl+ +CO 73%) was a factor of three larger than the low energy product (Cl + HCO+ , 25%). By contrast, when the 3.5 μm pulse was delayed by one quarter of the pulse envelope, the branching ratio was reversed (HCl+ +CO 38%; Cl + HCO+ , 60%). Continuous wavelet analysis was used to follow the interaction of the laser with the various vibrational modes as a function of time. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

c3bfc7e3c73342da22faec465c8574b7f33cf24b	new method for constructing a visibility graph-network in 3d space and a new hybrid system of modeling		This paper describes a new method for constructing a visibility graph in 3D space. We use a method for predicting porosity of hardened specimens. We also use an intelligent system method to predict porosity of hardened specimens. Visibility graphs have many applications, one of which is the analysis of trend lines of market graphs. It is possible to use 2D visibility graphs for such analysis and the construction for 2D visibility graphs is well known; however, in this paper, we will present a new method for the construction of 3D visibility graphs. 3D visibility computations are central to any computer graphics application. Drawing graphs as nodes connected by links in 3D space is visually compelling but computationally difficult. Thus, the construction of 3D visibility graphs is highly complex and requires professional computers or supercomputers. This article describes a new method for analysing 3D visibility graphs. We develop new method for draws 3D visibility graphs for analysing microstructure pictures of robot laser-hardened specimens. The microstructure of robot laser-hardened specimens is very complex; however, we can present it using 3D visibility graphs. New method for the construction of 3D visibility graphs is very useful in many cases, including: illumination and rendering, motion planning, pattern recognition, computer graphics, computational geometry and sensor networks and the military and automotive industries. We use this new algorithm for determination complexity of porosity of the microstructure of robot laser-hardened specimens. For predicting surface porosity of hardened specimens we use neural network, genetic algorithm and multiple regression. With intelligent system we increase production of process of laser hardening, because we decrease time of process and increase topographical property of materials. Hybrid evolutionary computation is a generic, flexible, robust, and versatile method for solving complex global optimization problems and can also be used in practical applications. This paper explores the use of an intelligent system with such a hybrid method to improve existing hybrids. It describes a new hybrid method based on the cycle integration method.	hybrid system;visibility graph	Matej Babic;Ladislav Hluchý;Peter Krammer;Branko Matovic;Ravi Kumar;Pavel Kovac	2017	Computing and Informatics		global optimization;rendering (computer graphics);theoretical computer science;visibility;computer science;computer graphics;visibility graph;computational geometry;hybrid system;motion planning	Robotics	65.03923876492881	-38.70581237592662	14651

The proposed approach is based upon precomputing the global topology of a robot's free space, and consists of an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, a C-space obstacle database (COD) for a given robot is developed in which the C-space obstacle (C-obstacle) maps are stored and indexed by the cells of the workspace; in the online phase when the same robot is operated in a real environment, those maps whose indices match the real obstacle cells are identified and then extracted from the COD. The superposition of these maps forms forbidden region in operation. This proposed approach is a generic one and can be applied to manipulators with arbitrary kinematic structures and geometries. The construction of the COD, which is generally the most time-consuming step, is implemented in the offline phase, and the online computing only involves the identification of the components matching the COD indices. Therefore, this proposed approach for C-space construction can be realized in a real-time online fashion and is especially suitable for robot manipulation under dynamic operations. We carry out analyses on several types of manipulators to verify and demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach.	discretization	Xingjiao Wu;J. Tang;K. H.

The design of industrial products constituted by free form surfaces is done by using CAD systems representing curves and surfaces by means of NURBS functions, which are usually defined by low level entities that are not intuitive and require some knowledge of the mathematical language. Similarly to the feature-based approach adopted by CAD systems for classical mechanical design, a set of high level modelling entities which provides commonly performed shape modifications has been identified. Particularly, the paper suggests a classification of the so-called detail featuresfor an aesthetic and/or functional characterization of predefined free form surfaces. Feature types are formally described by means of an analytical definition of the surface modification through deformation and elimination laws. A topological classification is then given according to the application domain of such laws. A further sub-classification of morphological types is then suggested according to geometric properties of weak convexity and concavity for the resulting modified shape, leading to a taxonomy of simple free form features meaningful for aesthetic design.	application domain;computer-aided design;concave function;entity;feature model;high-level programming language;non-uniform rational b-spline	Marzia Fontana;Franca Giannini;Maria Meirana	1999	Comput.

db0efffeb89043826e49e7c231e4115e60058c2e	a new concept of modular kinematics to design ultra-high precision flexure-based robots	kinematics blades joints fasteners prototypes service robots;flexure hinges;high precision robotics;flexure torsion pivot;kinematics;parallel robotics;modularity;wire edm	This work deals with the kinematic conception and the mechanical design of ultra-high precision robots, which are at present costly to develop, both in time and money. The aim of this paper is thus to introduce a new modular concept of kinematics which allows to significantly reduce the time-to-market and a new double-stage flexure-based pivot. Regarding the modular concept of kinematics, this ‘robotic Lego’ consists in a finite number of building bricks allowing to rapidly design a high precision machine and to easily modify its mobility. The realised mock-up of a 4-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robot, transformable into a 5-DOF one, validates this concept and the mechanical design of its bricks. Flexure hinges are used to achieve the aimed sub-micrometer precision; however, existing flexure-based rotary joints are not able to fulfil the requirements of some applications, as they present a too low angular stroke and a parasitic motion of their centre of rotation. Thus, this paper also introduces a new double-stage pivot based on blades working in torsion; experiments performed on a prototype allow to validate its principle and the simulation model used for its development.	angular momentum operator;angularjs;experiment;mock object;prototype;requirement;robot;rotary woofer;simulation;torsion (gastropod)	Murielle Richard;Reymond Clavel	2010			kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;modularity;electrical discharge machining;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	Robotics	72.33834658383121	-21.378573389888732	14694

The properties of the eigenfunctions φν(r) and eigenvalues αν corresponding to zero, small, and large absolute values of energy E < 0 are analyzed. Expansion in the set {φν(r)} is used to develop a regular perturbation theory (for E < 0), and a general expression is found for the Green function associated with the time-independent Schr ödinger equation. A similar method is used to solve several physical problems: the polarizability of a bound quantum-mechanical system, the two-center problem, and the elastic scattering of slow particles. The proposed approach is advantageous in that it does not require the use of continuum states (for E > 0).	bellman equation;perturbation theory;polarizability;quantum mechanics;triune continuum paradigm	Tadeusz Bancewicz	2010	J.

We first establish the existence condition of a general linear filter when the unknown inputs are partially observed. Thenwe examine the optimality of the Kalman filter with partially observed inputs. Finally, on the basis of the established existence condition and optimality result, we investigate asymptotic stability of the filter for the corresponding time-invariant systems. It is shown that the results on existence and asymptotic stability obtained in this paper provide a unified approach to accommodating a variety of filtering scenarios as its special cases, including the classical Kalman filter and state estimation with unknown inputs. © 2014 The Authors.

167e505b1c4c17874d56f5c4872ebbabf8965f68	comparison of fem and bem for interactive object simulation	physically based;stiffness matrix;boundary element method;boundary element;mass spring system;real time;finite element method;matrix computation;computational complexity;free form deformation;linear boundary elements;constant boundary elements	There are two major approaches for real-time object simulation namely, the geometry (non-physically) based and the physically based approaches. Geometry based approaches such as free-form deformation (FFD) employ purely geometric techniques to model deformation. Physically based approaches usually adopt mass–spring system, finite element method (FEM) or boundary element method (BEM) for simulation. The mass–spring system is simple and only gives a coarse estimation of object deformation. Recently, FEM and BEM have been extensively used in object simulation because of the demand for more realistic simulation. However, a major drawback of FEM and BEM is their difficulty to achieve real-time deformation. In this article, we compare two different physically based approaches, FEM and BEM, according to their accuracy and computational complexity. Several experiments were conducted to compare the time required for the pre-computation process and the deformation process. In addition, the BEM with linear boundary elements is implemented and tested. At the current state of investigation, for the meshes with triangular elements, BEM with linear boundary elements is significantly faster than BEM with constant boundary elements under most of the circumstances. With the band matrix of FEM, the pre-computation process is faster than the BEM for a model with small mesh size. However if the mesh size of the model is large, the pre-computation process of BEM with linear boundary elements is the fastest. c © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional tumble deburring processes have been used for years in the surface finishing industries. The manual process is tedious, inconsistent and inaccurate. Automation in the finishing process has been proved very beneficial. Integration of robots in the process provides more flexible and convenient process. We investigate the off-line simulation of finishing edges using the Product Life Cycle tool DELMIA®. The process extracts the feature to generate a part finishing process plan. Collisions with the environment are detected and avoided through the simulation of cutting the path before the path is downloaded to the actual hardware. Either the tool or the part is being fixed on the robot’s end effector and simulated with respect to the defined path. This study presents the complete off-line simulation of the Part in Hand as well as Tool in Hand approaches for the deburring process.	automation;online and offline;robot end effector;robotics;simulation	Mohammad Mohammad;Vipul Babariya;Tarek M.

The heterogeneity of human and robot functions can be characterized by the fact that humans are intelligent while robots are fast, powerful and accurate. Humans can use their knowledge and experience to quickly respond to unexpected events, which makes it easy for humans to deal with unstructured environments. In contrast, robots can easily enhance the mechanical power of humans and the ability of humans to work remotely. Therefore, robots are capable of performing precise and repetitive tasks at high speed or in a hazardous environment. The important issue, in light of human/robot heterogeneity, is how to plan and control a robotic operation such that the human and the robot can cooperate in a complementary manner. Thus, a task which cannot be done by either human or robot alone can be performed efficiently and robustly by both. This paper introduces a new paradigm for human/robot interactive systems, heterogeneous function-based human/robot cooperation. A new perceptive action reference frame has been developed in the paper. It matches human perception and robot sensory measurement, and provides a platform for modeling the human/robot cooperative operations. The theoretical results presented in the paper have laid down a foundation for stability analysis as well as a planning and control system design of human/robot integrated systems. The implementations and experimental results have clearly demonstrated the advantages of proposed methods.

The magnetized T. pyriformis cells are generated by adding iron-oxide spherical particles into the cells. We control the cells' moving direction by changing the magnetic field direction. Based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm, we define a cost function which is composed of the target cost function and the obstacle potential function. The target cost function is to measure the sum of differences between cells' predicted positions and their target positions. The obstacle potential function is used to measure the repulsive force of the obstacle. The input variables of the cost function are the sequence of control signals. We use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to find a cost value which is close to the global minimum of the cost function. In the experimental result section, we show the control of three m3pi robots to move from their initial positions to their target positions with avoiding the obstacle. Since the similar control strategy has successfully controlled one T. pyriformis cell in our previous work, we believe our PSO-MPC algorithm is applicable on the multiple T. pyriformis cells' control task.	algorithm;control theory;loss function;maxima and minima;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;robot	Yan Ou;Peter Kang;MinJun Kim;Anak Agung Julius	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139684	control engineering;simulation;prediction;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;magnetic resonance imaging;control theory;steady state;particle swarm optimization;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.24643982658783	-25.33810934436666	14749

A side effect of the development of such models is that it constrained regularization only to those cases, rather than allowing for arbitrary region regularization. Directed Acyclic Graphical MaxFlow (DAGMF) segmentation overcomes these limitations by allowing for the algorithm designer to specify an arbitrary directed acyclic graph to structure a max-flow segmentation. This allows for individual ‘parts’ to be a member of multiple distinct ‘wholes.’	algorithm;cuda;concurrency (computer science);directed acyclic graph;discrete mathematics;extensibility;graphics;ishikawa diagram;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;maximum flow problem;parallel computing;potts model;solver;video card	John S.

These new automation designs promise great exibility, speed, and dexterity|we believe they may be employed to orient, singulate, sort, feed, and assemble parts. However, since they have only recently been invented, programming and controlling them for manipulation tasks is challenging. When a part is placed on our devices, the programmed vector eld induces a force and moment upon it. Over time, the part may come to rest in a dynamic equilibrium state. We demonstrate lower bounds (i.e., impossibility results) on what the devices cannot do, and results on a classi cation of control strategies yielding design criteria by which well-behaved manipulation strategies may be developed. We suggest sufcient conditions for programmable elds to induce well-behaved equilibria on every part placed on our devices. We de ne composition operators to build complex strategies from simple ones, and show the resulting elds are also well-behaved. We discuss whether elds outside this class can be useful and free of pathology. Using these tools, we describe new manipulation algorithms. In particular, we improve existing planning algorithms by a quadratic factor, and the plan-length by a linear factor. Using our new and improved strategies, we show how to simultaneously orient and pose any part, without sensing, from an arbitrary initial con guration. We relax earlier dynamic and mechanical assumptions to obtain more robust and exible strategies. Finally, we consider parts feeders that can only implement a very limited \vocabulary"""" of vector elds. We discuss the tradeo between mechanical complexity and planning complexity.

To do so, we exploit an intermediate implicit feature complex which reconstructs piecewise smooth multi-material boundaries made of surface patches, feature edges and corner vertices. Futhermore, we design specific feature-aware local remeshing rules which, combined with a moving least square projection, result in high quality isotropic meshes representing the input mesh at a user defined resolution while preserving important features. Our algorithm uses only topology-aware local operations, which allows to process difficult input meshes such as self-intersecting ones. We evaluate our approach on a collection of examples and experimentally show that it is fast and scales well.	algorithm;computer graphics (computer science);display resolution;experiment;iterative method;smoothing	Noura Faraj;Jean-Marc Thiery;Tamy Boubekeur	2016	Computers & Graphics	10.1016/j.cag.2016.05.019	mathematical optimization;computer science;volume mesh;geometric modeling;mathematics;geometry;computer graphics	Visualization	68.67075726925626	-44.74489190020235	14759

Our strategy exploits foot contact event estimated by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and can detect user intention as well as reflect user preference. In our strategy, a gait cycle is divided into 4 phases and the transitions between the phases are based on events that are unavoidable and can be detected reliably using the sensors available for our exoskeleton. The proposed strategy presents criteria for the initiation and termination of assistance by recognizing user intention, as well as methods to adjust the timing and the amount of assistance corresponding to user preference. When each step starts, the duration of assistance is determined and the torque profile for the whole step is planned ahead. We demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy for stair ascent and examine its effects on hip joint angle trajectory through experimental results.	electromyography;experiment;newman's lemma;real-time clock;robot;sensor;times ascent	Junwon Jang;Kyungrock Kim;Jusuk Lee;Bokman Lim;Youngbo Shim	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759832	simulation;exoskeleton;engineering;sensor;torque;foot	Robotics	69.14238194351576	-30.64843382682394	14794

In the literature, many sensorless schemes have been presented, in which the accurate estimation of rotor flux magnitude, position, and speed is guaranteed by detecting the back electromotive force (EMF). However, these schemes show great sensitivity to stator resistance mismatch and system noise, particularly, during low-speed operation. In this paper, an indirect-rotor-field-oriented-control scheme for sensorless speed control of a PMSM is proposed. The rotor-flux position is estimated by direct integration of the estimated rotor speed to reduce the effect of the system noise. The stator resistance and the rotor-flux speed and magnitude are estimated adaptively using stable model reference adaptive system estimators. Simple stability analysis and design of the estimators are performed using linear-control theory applied to an error model of the PMSM in a synchronous rotating reference frame. The convergence of rotor position- and speed-estimation errors to zero is guaranteed.

038fc4d46ad321b2aff71554d2c584ebaef556c6	distributed decision making and control for cooperative transportation using mobile robots		This paper introduces a distributed control scheme tailor-made to the task of letting a swarm of mobile robots push an object through a planar environment. Crucially, there is no centralized control instance or inter-robot hierarchy, and therefore, all decisions are made in a distributed manner. For being able to cooperate, the robots communicate, although the communication sampling time may be several times longer than the control sampling time. Most characteristic for the approach, distributed model predictive controllers are used to achieve a smooth transportation performance with the predicted control errors utilized to plan a suitable object trajectory. Challenging simulation scenarios show the applicability of the approach to the transportation task.	mobile robot	Henrik Ebel;Peter Eberhard	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93818-9_9	swarm behaviour;robot;distributed element model;sampling (statistics);mobile robot;hierarchy;trajectory;distributed computing;computer science	Robotics	57.65398049449781	-22.45203712660503	14840

We show in this article that this control strategy can in principle also be applied to balance control of humanoid robots. In contrast to existing approaches, this control strategy reduces the need to carry out complex computations in real time (replacing the iterated solution of quadratic optimization problems by a simple linear controller), and it does not require knowledge of a dynamic model of the robot. Therefore it can handle unforeseen changes in the dynamics of the robot that may arise for example from wind or other external forces. We demonstrate the feasibility of this novel approach to humanoid balance control through simulations of the humanoid robot HOAP-2 for tasks that require balance control under disturbances by unknown external forces.	computation;control flow;control theory;hoap;humanoid robot;iteration;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;programming paradigm;simulation;synergy	Helmut Hauser;Gerhard Neumann;Auke Jan Ijspeert;Wolfgang Maass	2007	2007 7th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2007.4813851	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;quadratic programming	Robotics	65.59461920742834	-24.58910213137306	14865

The proposed integrative method fusing the OFA and the HTGA can be viewed as one of the hard-computing-assisted soft-computing category, where the OFA belongs to the hard computing constituents and the HTGA is one of the soft computing constituents.

24bd4e2e308cf0efcc3f803d24944f400a013ec3	geobrush: interactive mesh geometry cloning	geometric algorithms languages and systems;1 3 5 computer graphics computational geometry and object modeling	We propose a method for interactive cloning of 3D surface geometry using a paintbrush interface, similar to the continuous cloning brush popular in image editing. Existing interactive mesh composition tools focus on atomic copy-and-paste of pre-selected feature areas, and are either limited to copying surface displacements, or require the solution of variational optimization problems, which is too expensive for an interactive brush interface. In contrast, our GeoBrush method supports real-time continuous copying of arbitrary high-resolution surface features between irregular meshes, including topological handles. We achieve this by first establishing a correspondence between the source and target geometries using a novel generalized discrete exponential map parameterization. Next we roughly align the source geometry with the target shape using Green Coordinates with automaticallyconstructed cages. Finally, we compute an offset membrane to smoothly blend the pasted patch with C1 continuity before stitching it into the target. The offset membrane is a solution of a bi-harmonic PDE, which is computed on the GPU in real time by exploiting the regular parametric domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoBrush with various editing scenarios, including detail enrichment and completion of scanned surfaces.	align (company);clone tool;computation;cut, copy, and paste;gene ontology term enrichment;graphics processing unit;image editing;image resolution;mathematical optimization;paintbrush;quantum cloning;real-time clock;scott continuity;smoothing;surface detail;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods;variational principle	Kenshi Takayama;Ryan Schmidt;Karan Singh;Takeo Igarashi;Tamy Boubekeur;Olga Sorkine-Hornung	2011	Comput.

This real time system is designed to infer user's sketching intentions, to segment sketched input and generate corresponding geometric primitives: straight lines, circles; arcs, ellipses, elliptical arcs, and B-spline curves. Topology information (connectivity, unitary constraints and pairwise constraints) is received dynamically from 2D sketched input and primitives. From the 2D topology information, a more accurate 2D geometry can be built up by applying a 2D geometric constraint solver. Subsequently, 3D geometry can be received feature by feature incrementally. Each feature can be recognised by inference knowledge in terms of matching its 2D primitive configurations and connection relationships. The system accepts not only sketched input, working as an automatic design tool, but also accepts user interactive input of both 2D primitives and special positional 3D primitives. This makes it easy and friendly to use. The system has been tested with a number of sketched inputs of 2D and 3D geometry.	online and offline	Sheng Feng Qin;David K. Wright;Ivan N.

Those power assist systems that handle a heavy object directly by the manual actuating force often use a force sensor to detect the moving direction. However, the force sensor has problems, including one that it is susceptible to noise. In the circumstances, this paper proposes a motor-driven device for supplying constant torque and its application to direct-handling type power assist systems. First, this paper overviews a passive dynamic control (PDC), on which this system is based. Second, this paper shows the principle of detecting the direction of movement not by using force but by using the displacement from the balancing state realized by spring action, which is assumed as the basic state. Third, this paper describes the development of the constant torque device based on this principle of detection, and demonstrates its effectiveness as a power assist system by basic experiments. Since this system may satisfy the fail-safe conditions, it is expected to be used as a high-safety device to make up for the deficits of DD motors.	dd (unix);displacement mapping;experiment;fail-safe;image noise;programme delivery control;sensor	Yasuhiro Minamiyama;Takanori Kiyota;Takahiro Mori;Noboru Sugimoto	2014	2014 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics	10.1109/AIM.2014.6878077	control engineering;damping torque;torque sensor;stall torque;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;coupling;torque motor;direct torque control	Robotics	74.33502586608023	-20.012601839431472	14954

It is assumed that the Markov chain is not measured. The concept of feasible control is applied to compute a discrete-time linear optimal controller structure such that both time-domain and frequency-domain constraints are satisfied. The controller is parametrised by a diagonal state weighting matrix Q. A standard mathematical programming algorithm is used to compute the state weighting matrix Q such that the specifications are met. The synthesis procedure consists of the iterative solution of an equation where at each iteration step a discrete-time linear optimal control problem is solved.	control system;control theory;data domain;iteration;iterative method;markov chain;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;nelder–mead method;norm (social);optimal control;penalty method;search algorithm;simulation	C.

The semi-BSS technique is necessary for double-talk free robot audition systems in order to utilize known sound source signals such as self speech, music, or TV-sound, through a line-in or ubiquitous network. Unlike the conventional semi-BSS with ICA, we use the time-frequency domain convolution model to describe the reflection of the sound and a new mixing process of sounds for ICA. In other words, we consider that reflected sounds during some delay time are different from the original. ICA then separates the reflections as other interference sources. The model enables us to eliminate the frame size limitations of the frequency-domain ICA, and ICA can separate the known sources under a highly reverberative environment. Experimental results show that our method outperformed the conventional semi-BSS using ICA under simulated normal and highly reverberative environments.	artificial general intelligence;blind signal separation;convolution;covox speech thing;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;interference (communication);reflection (computer graphics);robot;semiconductor industry;source separation;time–frequency analysis;ubiquitous computing	Ryu Takeda;Kazuhiro Nakadai;Kazuhiro Komatani;Tetsuya Ogata;Hiroshi G.

A new multirate switching model is constructed to describe the feature of this single input multiple output linear system. According to the difficulty of controller design under multi-constraints in multirate switching model, this model can be converted to a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model. By designing a multirate parallel distributed compensation, a sufficient condition is established to ensure this closed-loop fuzzy control system to be globally exponentially stable. The solution of the multirate parallel distributed compensation gains can be obtained by solving an auxiliary convex optimisation problem. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show, compared with solving switching controller, multirate parallel distributed compensation can be obtained easily. Furthermore, it has stronger robust stability than arbitrary switching controller and single-rate parallel distributed compensation under the same conditions.

93e3f02a6ad6b819ef3831020b4d1275edf9474a	linear and nonlinear stiffness and friction in biological rhythmic movements	oscillations;nonlinear elasticity;human subjects;multiple regression	Biological rhythmic movements can be viewed as instances of self-sustained oscillators. Auto-oscillatory phenomena must involve a nonlinear friction function, and usually involve a nonlinear elastic function. With respect to rhythmic movements, the question is: What kinds of nonlinear friction and elastic functions are involved? The nonlinear friction functions of the kind identified by Rayleigh (involving terms such as $$\dot \theta ^3 $$ ) and van der Pol (involving terms such as $$\theta ^2 \dot \theta $$ ), and the nonlinear elastic functions identified by Duffing (involving terms such as $$\theta ^3 $$ ), constitute elementary nonlinear components for the assembling of self-sustained oscillators. Recently, additional elementary nonlinear friction and stiffness functions expressed, respectively, through terms such as $$\theta ^2 \dot \theta ^3 $$ and $$\theta \dot \theta ^2 $$ , and a methodology for evaluating the contribution of the elementary components to any given cyclic activity have been identified. The methodology uses a quantification of the continuous deviation of oscillatory motion from ideal (harmonic) motion. Multiple regression of this quantity on the elementary linear and nonlinear terms reveals the individual contribution of each term to the oscillator's non-harmonic behavior. In the present article the methodology was applied to the data from three experiments in which human subjects produced pendular rhythmic movements under manipulations of rotational inertia (experiment 1), rotational inertia and frequency (experiment 2), and rotational inertia and amplitude (experiment 3). The analysis revealed that the pendular oscillators assembled in the three experiments were compositionally rich, braiding linear and nonlinear friction and elastic functions in a manner that depended on the nature of the task.	comparison of archive formats;experiment;friction;movement;nonlinear system;oscillator device component;quantitation;rayleigh–ritz method;stiffness	P.

It is based on an error function that uses connectivity between nodes and information about their maximum velocity and that is solved by iterative minimization using unconstrained optimization. The resultant trajectories are evaluated with respect to the localization solution space (LSS), a multi-dimensional space consisting of all solutions that satisfy completely the conditions of the problem. The algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations in scenarios with different levels of connectivity and under regular and irregular conditions in the communications. The complementarity with other localization algorithms is presented by using their results as initialization stage for this algorithm. Finally, it is applied to a real database that provides information about Bluetooth-based connectivity and motion of people in an office scenario, rendering satisfactory results and hence, validating the practicability of the proposed algorithm as a framework to obtain localization traces.	algorithm;tracing (software)	José María Cabero;Ignacio Olabarrieta;Sergio Gil-Lopez;Javier Del Ser;José Luis Martín	2014	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2014.03.004	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;error function;human behavior;statistics	Robotics	53.96417801567536	-19.462128502135297	15117

One of these strategies proposed in the literature is external force feedback loop control. It fully employs the available sensor measurements by operating the control action in a full dimensional space without using selection matrices. The performance of this control strategy is affected by uncertainties in both the robot dynamic model and environment stiffness. The purpose of this paper is to improve controller robustness by applying a neural network technique in order to compensate the effect of uncertainties in the robot model. We show that this control strategy is robust with respect to payload uncertainties, position and environment stiffness, and dry and viscous friction. Simulation results for a three degrees-of-freedom manipulator and various types of environments and trajectories show the effectiveness of the suggested approach compared with classical external force feedback loop structures.	apache axis;artificial neural network;cartesian closed category;control flow;control theory;feedback;haptic technology;mathematical model;neural oscillation;programmable universal machine for assembly;robot;robot end effector;sensor;simulation;velocity (software development)	Farid Ferguene;Redouane Toumi	2009	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science	10.2478/v10006-009-0011-9	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;haptic technology;feed forward	Robotics	67.58709986715348	-15.702150649768718	15159

c3a3e0f0edd03e5220292c9cbbccb740b31ee420	a bias fault estimation of actuators and sensors by optimization with ℓ0 norm constraint		This paper proposes a bias fault estimation method by a single observer, which is based on the compress sensing. Fault-tolerant control of systems becomes increasingly important to keep safety of systems. The bias fault estimation is one of the most important technologies in fault-tolerant control theory, especially for passive fault-tolerant servo systems. For the bias fault estimation problem, the disturbance observer approach has been proposed. However, this approach cannot be applied to the estimation of all faults at both actuators and sensors by a single observer. In this paper, a bias fault estimation method based on the compress sensing is proposed. Under the assumption that only one device fault occurs at a time, the bias fault estimation method by a single observer can be formulated as an optimization problem with l0 norm constraint. This paper gives a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method.	control theory;fault tolerance;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;newton's method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;rate of convergence;sensor;servo;taxicab geometry	Mai Ichikawa;Noboru Sebe;Koichi Suyama;Katherin Indriawati	2017	2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287385	fold (higher-order function);observer (quantum physics);actuator;computer science;optimization problem;servomechanism;control theory	Robotics	63.68906948190692	-4.776777796036196	15198

ABSTRACT This paper presents a novel automatic method for view synthesis (or image transfer) from a number of uncalibrated images based on edge transfer. The edge-based technique is of general practical relevance because it overcomes most of the problems encountered in other approaches that either rely upon dense correspondence, work in projective space or need explicit camera calibration. The method has been used to generate immersive video objects which we call 3D video sprites. They consists of a number of synchronous video streams and mark up information that allows virtual viewpoints with respect to a live action video to be rendered and combined with traditional 3D virtual environments.	360-degree video;camera resectioning;computer vision;immersion (virtual reality);linpack benchmarks;relevance;sparse matrix;sprite (computer graphics);streaming media;video clip;view synthesis;virtual reality	Stephen Pollard;Sean Hayes	1998		10.1145/293701.293713	computer vision;projective space;camera resectioning;computer science;video tracking;multimedia;morphing;epipolar geometry;computer graphics (images)	Vision	58.08392217919982	-49.98842852106782	15214

To overcome the problems, we propose a new Jacobian free CFastSLAM algorithm. The main contribution of this work lies in the utilization of Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), which calculate Gaussian Weight Integral based on Cubature Rule, to design an optimal proposal distribution of the particle filter and to estimate the environment feature landmarks. On the basis of Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, proposed algorithm is comprised by two main parts: in the first part, a Cubature Particle Filter (CPF) is derived to localize the robot; in the second part, a set of CKFs is used to estimate the environment landmarks. The performance of the CFastSLAM is investigated and compared with that of FastSLAM2.0 and UFastSLAM in simulations and experiments. Results verify that the CFastSLAM improves SLAM performance.	algorithm;coalition for patent fairness;degeneracy (graph theory);experiment;jacobian matrix and determinant;kalman filter;numerical integration;particle filter;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping;tree accumulation	Yu Song;Qingling Li;Yifei Kang;Yongduan Song	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2012.6224822	kalman filter;monte carlo localization;computer vision;mathematical optimization;ensemble kalman filter;particle filter;auxiliary particle filter;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;simultaneous localization and mapping	Robotics	54.74150425546262	-38.633870812501335	15250

Completing in 5th place in the navigational challenge and 10th in the autonomous challenge in its first competition has proven our vehicle to be a strong competitor in this competition. The vehicle has many interesting features that allow it to achieve its success. The vehicle’s 300 lb. capacity allows for two onboard full-sized computers and two 12 V marine batteries that power the computers for up to 2 h. The vision system is not a simple reactive system but rather it classifies its view into objects and builds a map of the territory as it learns of its features while traveling. Two transformations and the location data from the GPS and other sensors are used to associate the locations in the image to locations in the map. The operations of the vehicle are modeled after the typical operations of a ship. We have programs that perform the functions of the captain, the helm, the navigator, and the engineer. In addition we have a program performing sensor data fusion from the GPS, compass, and wheel encoder data. The navigation uses an adapted two-dimensional approximate cell decomposition method that satisfies the nonholononic constraints of our vehicle and allows it to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding all obstacles. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	approximation algorithm;autonomous robot;computer;encoder;functional design;global positioning system;hierarchical editing language for macromolecules;high- and low-level;john d. wiley;requirement;robotics;robustness (computer science);sensor;shortest path problem;subroutine	Fernando G.

Obviously, the grasping orientations and placement of the two arms are crucial to maximising the distance and workspace. To date, these factors have been ignored. This problem is much more difficult than that for a single arm and many methods for a single arm are no longer applicable, due to many extra constraints, variables and joint configurations. Here, a new approach to this problem is proposed. The problem is formulated as a multivariable nonlinear constrained optimisation problem and it is solved using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). With this method, the optimal grasping with optimal placement of the two arms, the extreme joint configurations and the maximum extreme distance can be obtained The computational results show that the distance takes its maximum where a small number of joint configurations are at their singularities, which is quite different from the situations of a single arm and from intuition. This method is illustrated using an example, where a rod is held by the two-finger grippers of two SCARA-type robot arms. Objects of different shapes, such as a plate, can be treated as special cases of the rod.	coat of arms;object-based language;robot;workspace	Bailin Cao;Gordon I. Dodds;George W.

Tactile information is quite valuable while performing tasks such as object recognition, grasping, or surface exploration. A systematic presentation of the robotic tactile perception capability should include discussion of two important issues. The first one is associated with the tactile sensor hardware; and the second one deals with the computational approaches for extracting useful information from tactile sensors. In this chapter, the emphasis is on the second aspect. The chapter discusses about the issues involved in endowing tactual or touch sensing capability to robots. The chapter reviews some of the issues affecting tactile sensing, the choice of techniques, and the extent of processing required. Static or passive tactile sensing approach is elaborated. The chapter discusses the active tactile sensing approach or dynamic sensing that is more common to humans. The chapter presents some experimental results showing the effectiveness of tactile sensing for object recognition.	computation;information processing	Hrishikesh P.

To overcome this limitation, we present a novel method for determining atomic charges for a molecule in a crystal based on a fit to the electric field at points on a surface around the molecule. Examples of fits to the electric field at points on a Hirshfeld surface, using crystal Hartree-Fock electron densities computed with a DZP basis set are presented for several organic molecular crystals. The field-derived charges for common functional groups are transferable, and reflect chemical functionality as well as the subtle effects of intermolecular interactions. The charges also yield an excellent approximation to the electric field surrounding a molecule in a crystal for use in cluster calculations on molecules in solids.	approximation;basis set (chemistry);crystal;electroconvulsive therapy;electron;fits;fock space;hartree–fock method;interaction;partial charge;density;solid substance	Andrew E.

A multi-layer Perceptron network is used as the process model and is adapted on-line using the extended Kalman filter to learn changes in process dynamics. In this way, the adaptive model will learn the post-fault dynamics caused by actuator or component faults. Then, the inversion of the neural model is used as a controller to maintain the system stability and control performance after fault occurrence. The convergence of the model inversion control is proved using Lyapunov method. The proposed method is applied to the simulation of a two-input two-output continuous-stirred tank reactor to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Several actuator and component faults are simulated on the continuously stirred tank reactor process when the system is under the proposed fault tolerant control. The results have shown a fast recovery of tracking performance and the maintained stability. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A Flying boat with good sea-keeping ability can reduce impacts from waves and runs safely and smoothly under a certain sea state. However, sea-keeping ability is still the key problem that hinders its development and application. In this paper, based on the mathematical model of a flying boat, a simulation system predicting the motions of the flying boat on an irregular wave is built, and a controller deduced by active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and Tagaki-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy reasoning is applied to improve the sea-keeping ability. The simulation results show that the flying boat has good performances for tracking the surface of waves, reducing impact from water, and making the flying boat take off on three water conditions safely (calm water, water with regular wave and water with irregular wave respectively).

554314c4a7d01e26e85870b77513a499fe9552c9	cooperative adaptive cruise control for string stable mixed traffic: benchmark and human-centered design		With the emergence of vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) cars can be expected in the near future. In this paper, novel criteria for string stability are proposed for mixed traffic platoons that consist of both automated and manual driving cars. A mixed traffic string stability definition is proposed to guarantee the boundedness of the motion states fluctuation upstream as well as the safety of the entire platoon. With proper arrangements of the platoon sequence as well as mild restrictions on the leading car’s velocity overshoot, the proposed mixed traffic string stability can be realized via some suitable controller design for the automated cars. The benchmark controller with feedback and feedforward path is first used to verify the above results with rigorous proof. Furthermore, a human-centered CACC system is designed to improve both physical and psychological comfort of a driver under the guarantee of mixed traffic string stability. The action-point car-following model is adapted to quantify the driver’s psychological comfort in combination with the quantification of physical comfort based on jerk. A model predictive control-like blending ratio controller is developed to obtain the optimal time headway in the feedback controller for tradeoffs among driver comfort, fuel efficiency, and traffic throughput under string stability constraints. Finally, a seven-car CACC mixed traffic platoon scenario is simulated. Compared with the benchmark CACC controller design, the human-centered CACC design is shown to largely improve the driving comfort.	algorithm;alpha compositing;benchmark (computing);blu-ray;control theory;emergence;feedforward neural network;kerrison predictor;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);platoon (automobile);quantum fluctuation;simulation;throughput;user-centered design;vehicle-to-vehicle;velocity (software development)	Fangjian Li;Yue Wang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2017.2760805	simulation;control theory;throughput;headway;engineering;feed forward;jerk;cooperative adaptive cruise control;control engineering;platoon;control theory;cruise control	Embedded	65.8785939232099	-9.685312557401447	15432

The results from these LIE calculations using our earlier parameterization give relative free energies of binding that agree remarkably well with the experimental data. However, the absolute energies are too positive for all three force fields, and it is clear that an additional constant term (gamma) is required in this case. Out of five examined LIE models, the same one emerges as the best for all three force fields, and this, in fact, corresponds to our earlier one apart from the addition of the constant gamma, which is almost identical for the three force fields. Thus, the present free energy calculations clearly indicate that the coefficients of the LIE method are independent of the force field used. Their relation to solvation free energies is also demonstrated. The only free parameter of the best model is gamma, which is found to depend on the hydrophobicity of the binding site. We also attempt to quantify the binding site hydrophobicity of four different proteins which shows that the ordering of gamma's for these sites reflects the fraction of hydrophobic surface area.

In this paper, the integration of fuzzy set theory and wavelet neural networks (WNNs) is proposed to alleviate the problem. The proposed fuzzy WNN is constructed on the base of a set of fuzzy rules. Each rule includes a wavelet function in the consequent part of the rule. The parameter update rules of the system are derived based on the gradient descent method. The structure is tested for the identification and the control of the dynamic plants commonly used in the literature. It is seen that the proposed structure results in a better performance despite its smaller parameter space.	artificial neural network;control system;fuzzy set;gradient descent;knowledge base;set theory;wavelet	Rahib Hidayat Abiyev;Okyay Kaynak	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.924018	control engineering;fuzzy classification;computer science;control system;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system;statistics	DB	62.467568558354486	-7.404283842587132	15439

The robot grasps one end of the object and helps the human operator to carry at the other end. Such cooperative manipulation in a horizontal plane is considered here. The control method proposed uses a virtual nonholonomic constraint. The movement of the object is constrained as if it were being carried on a wheel attached to the object. This method can prevent the object from slipping sideways and simplify the carrying operation. The experimental results show that an operator can easily handle a long object when aided by the robot.

The proposed algorithm belongs to the family of bug like path planning algorithms and has the capability to take under consideration the real dynamics of the articulated vehicle. Based on: a) an a priori knowledge of the current and the goal points, and b) a partial sensory based awareness of the surrounding environment, the algorithm is able to tune online the articulated steering angle in order to drive the front and the rear parts of the vehicle from avoiding collision with obstacles, while converging to the goal point. The proposed path planning algorithm is able to produce on-line the next reference way-point, solving the local and sub-optimal problem, while in the sequel a Model Predictive Controller is being utilized for creating the proper control signal, the rate of the articulated angle based on an error dynamics kinematic model of the vehicle. Multiple simulation results are being presented that prove the efficiency of the suggested scheme.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;converge;emoticon;motion planning;online and offline;simulation;waypoint	Thaker Nayl;George Nikolakopoulos;Thomas Gustafsson	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2013.6662843	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;engineering	Robotics	60.5971507283323	-22.074891362760674	15479

The procedure for creating a branching object involves two steps. First, the skeleton of an object is constructed. The skeleton consists of geometrical and topological information about the segments of the object. Secondly, cubic Hermite curves are used to deform and join consecutive segments in the skeleton in order to form the body of the object with C1 continuity. Cubic Hermite curves are also used to deform partial segments which allow an object to grow with desirable continuity in space and time. The techniques are easily implemented on any computer and allow the user to create a branching object using objects which have diverse shapes as segments.	cubic hermite spline;cubic function;hermite interpolation	Midori Kitagawa de Leon	1991	Journal of Visualization and Computer Animation	10.1002/vis.4340020207	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;fractal;hermite interpolation;cubic hermite spline;mathematics;geometry;algebra	Visualization	67.96024425290341	-41.984616288395706	15482

The quantized output letter at time i is fed back to the encoder, which then moves to a new state at time i+1 which is a function of the state at time i and the encoder output at time i . In an earlier paper a stochastic stability result was obtained for a class of feedback quantization schemes which includes delta modulation and some adaptive quantization schemes. In this paper a similar result is obtained for a class of feedback quantization schemes which includes linear DPCM and some ADPCM encoding schemes. The type of stochastic stability obtained gives almost-sure convergence of time averages of functions of the joint input-state-output process. This is stronger than the type of stochastic stability obtained previously by Gersho, Goodman, Goldstein, and Liu, who showed convergence in distribution of the time i input-state-output as i \rightarrow \infty .

A concept for such a robotic system has been proposed previously based on using a large number of simple binary actuators. Previous researchers have addressed some of the issues brought up by robots with a few binary actuators. This paper examines the computational feasibility of controlling and planning such binary robotic systems with a large number of actuators, including computation of their workspace, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics and trajectory following. Methods are proposed and evaluated by simulation. Detailed error analysis and computational requirements are presented. An example of the planning for a binary walking robot is presented.	computation;error analysis (mathematics);forward kinematics;inverse kinematics;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;reconfigurable computing;requirement;simulation;starflight;workspace	Matthew D.

The developed device's diameter is 8 cm and the intervals among each face are 36°. Microphones can be installed on ten faces except the top and bottom faces, and 16 holes exist on each face. Our proposed method solves the permutation problem, which is frequency-domain independent component analysis's difficult problem, with acoustic pressure distribution that was observed in the device's faces and the normalized relative phases at each microphone in the high and low frequency ranges, respectively. In our experiments, three kinds of mixture signals were used. The separation performances were evaluated by the signal-to-interference rate improvement score and compared with the conventional method and the ideal condition. The results indicate that the proposed method using the developed device is effective.	acoustic cryptanalysis;blind signal separation;covox speech thing;dodecahedron;experiment;independent component analysis;interference (communication);microphone;performance;source separation	Motoki Ogasawara;Takanori Nishino;Kazuya Takeda	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;mathematics	Robotics	86.52315493568122	-35.642705595617045	15518

Linear interconnections, whose topologies are defined by an unweighted Laplacian matrix, and persistent input disturbances are considered in this development. On the ground of the incrementally accumulative quadratic constraint presented previously, the time-domain robust stabilizability conditions for nonlinear interconnected systems are developed in this work. To deal with multiple coupling delays, the accumulative dissipativity criteria for subsystems are derived for use with the accumulatively asymptotic dissipativity constraint (aADC) in the stabilizability conditions. aADC is an asymptotic constraint on the accumulation of supply rates over the window of delay time interval. A compound output in the supply rate is deployed such that the dissipativity criterion can be rendered in linear matrix inequalities. A convex stability constraint for the local optimization of the model predictive control in a fully decentralized architecture is then derived for implementations. Numerical simulation for a petrochemical process is provided to illustrate the theoretical developments.	control theory;coupling (computer programming);decentralised system;extensibility;laplacian matrix;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;memory management;nonlinear system;plug and play;quadratically constrained quadratic program;recursion;simulation;tree accumulation	Tri Tran;Quang Phuc Ha	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2013.6653925	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.61447341014666	-0.1788419814853143	15602

Additionally, we test the quantitative accuracy of the inverse MC model for extracting the biologically relevant parameters of hemoglobin saturation and total hemoglobin concentration. We also test the effect of double-absorber phantoms (hemoglobin and crocin to model the absorption of hemoglobin and beta carotene, respectively, in the breast) for a range of absorption and scattering properties. We include an assessment on which reference phantom serves as the best calibration standard to enable accurate extraction of the absorption and scattering properties of the target sample. We found the best reference-target phantom combinations to be ones with similar scattering levels. The results from these phantom studies provide a set of guidelines for extracting optical parameters from clinical studies.	% total hemoglobin;absorber device component;beta carotene;calibration;fiberoptic device component;instrument - device;leucaena pulverulenta;monte carlo method;optical fiber;oxygen saturation measurement;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;scalability;uv-vis spectrum;video-in video-out	Janelle E.

Within this scheme, bottom-up methods fulfil the requirements of providing a concise image description suitable for symbolic reasoning and of providing an initial set of hypotheses to 'bootstrap' the top-down processes. The nature of the imagery does not lend itself easily to the derivation of precise 3-D structural information by optical-flow or stereo techniques. This leads us to call upon a range of static segmentation techniques , each individually capable of capturing some aspect of the diffuse information present in our images. For example, surface, texture and colour homogenity, and boundary smoothness and continuity.	alvey;bottom-up proteomics;boundary element method;image segmentation;optical flow;outline of object recognition;requirement;scott continuity;symbolic computation;texture mapping;top-down and bottom-up design	R.

By contrast with most of the contributions available in the literature, we do not assume that all the subsystems of the switched system we consider are stable when the delay is present. Through a Lyapunov approach, we derive sufficient conditions in terms of size of the delay ensuring the global exponential stability of the switched system. Moreover, under appropriate conditions, the input-to-state stability of the system with respect to an external disturbance is established.	nonlinear system	Yue-E Wang;Ximing Sun;Frédéric Mazenc	2016	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2016.02.015	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	68.36764261629018	-0.8512614192990211	15626

Here we outline an approach which extends graph-theoretical methodology to structures embedded in 3-D space. Derived descriptors are sensitive to the 3-D characteristics of a molecular structure and change with variations in molecular conformations. We illustrate the approach by examining conformations of smaller alkanes, including selected conformations of cyclohexane, methyl-cyclohexanes and cyclooctane. In particular, we report the atomic path numbers and atomic ID numbers (i.e. local descriptors), and molecular path numbers and molecular ID numbers (i.e. global descriptors). The path numbers were weighted so that a path of length 1 corresponds io the molecular connectivity index x. This paper should correct the widely held misconception that graph-theoretical analysis is not applicable to 3-D molecular structures, and at the same time should alert those interested in SPR and SAR to the availability of 3-D structural invariants of potential use in QSPR and QSAR models. The examples given and the computational background suffice to inform a potential user to write her/his own software, or lo modify the existing ALL PATH program in order to obtain the novel 3-D molecular invariants. The computations were performed on an Apple IIe personal computer (with a program written in BASIC).	basic;computation;embedded system;graph theory;molecular descriptor;molecular graph;personal computer;quantitative structure–activity relationship;topological index;tree rearrangement	Milan Randic;Borka Jerman-Blazic;Nenad Trinajstic	1990	Computers & Chemistry	10.1016/0097-8485(90)80051-3	three-dimensional space;topology;mathematics;geometry;quantum mechanics	Comp.	100.32758384385217	-5.135802376542662	15647

e7d73e96cf54237b76d743daa3475dfd87d3a83a	a dynamic subgrid scale model for large eddy simulations based on the mori-zwanzig formalism		The development of reduced models for complex systems that lack scale separation remains one of the principal challenges in computational physics. The optimal prediction framework of Chorin et al. [1], which is a reformulation of the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z) formalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, provides a methodology for the development of mathematically-derived reduced models of dynamical systems. Several promising models have emerged from the optimal prediction community and have found application in molecular dynamics and turbulent flows. In this work, a novel M-Z-based closure model that addresses some of the deficiencies of existing methods is developed. The model is constructed by exploiting similarities between two levels of coarse-graining via the Germano identity of fluid mechanics and by assuming that memory effects have a finite temporal support. The appeal of the proposed model, which will be referred to as the ‘dynamic-τ’ model, is that it is parameter-free and has a structural form imposed by the mathematics of the coarse-graining process (rather than the phenomenological assumptions made by the modeler). Additionally, a numerical procedure is presented to compute the resulting model form within a predictive simulation. This procedure helps bypass the tedious error-prone algebra that has proven to be a hindrance to the construction of M-Z-based models for complex dynamical systems. While the new formulation is general in nature, demonstrations are presented in the context of LES closures for Burgers’ equation, decaying homogeneous turbulence, and turbulent channel flow. The performance of the model and validity of the underlying assumptions are investigated in detail.	approximation;closure (computer programming);closure problem;cognitive dimensions of notations;complex dynamics;complex systems;computational physics;computer simulation;discrepancy function;dynamical system;formal system;large eddy simulation;mathematical model;molecular dynamics;numerical analysis;reynolds-averaged navier–stokes equations;semantics (computer science);simultaneous equations model;stationary process;stationary state;t-model;turbulence;variational principle	Eric J.

The relations of the initial leakage, the shape of the I(t)-trace and the voltage dependence of the components are discussed. Clear voltage and area dependence could be found. The TDDB lifetime itself and also the transition point of the two I(t)trace components describes the TDDB voltage acceleration very well. Additionally the review of the breakdown charge gives evidence that only one component is responsible for the TDDB breakdown behavior. This empirical evaluation delivers a different view on the I(t)-trace shapes leading to better understanding of its contributions to the TDDB behavior. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In our previous paper, we proposed servo control with input constraint by introducing input difference between present input and final input. However, it is difficult to constrain both of state of the nonlinear systems and the control input at the same time since time-derivatives of state are used. In this paper, we construct the nonlinear error system based on error vector between state and the target point for servo control. By employing the error system representation and the input difference, servo control with constraints on both of inputs and states can be achieved. We derive LMI conditions for designing servo controller and for constraining control inputs and states. Servo controller with constraints is designed by simultaneously solving servo controller design condition and the constraint conditions. A design example illustrates the utility of this approach.	linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;servo	Hiroshi Ohtake;Kazuo Tanaka;Hua O.

The distortions considered are bounded operators and can include convolutions, rotations, spatial and spectral truncations, projections or combinations of these. Likewise the signal and noise are very general being modeled as anisotropic stochastic processes on the 2-sphere. In both the distortion model and signal model the findings in this paper are significantly more general than results that can be found in the literature. The MMSE equalizer is shown to reduce to the ZF equalizer when the distortion operator has an inverse and there is an absence of noise. The ability of the MMSE to recover a Mars topography map signal from a projection operator, which fails to have a ZF solution, is given as an illustration.	convolution;detection theory;distortion;equalization (communications);mean squared error;stochastic process;topography;zermelo–fraenkel set theory;zero-forcing precoding	Parastoo Sadeghi;Rodney A.

This paper describes our approach of robotic fingers positions calculation using supervised Artificial Neural Network. User has to show a gesture to the system without any limitation or restriction. Hand cropping gives the region of interest and made the algorithm faster by processing smaller image. The gesture would be extracted from the input image and after detecting fingertips in the region of interest, fingers bending angles would be calculated using ANN.

The sensor is intended to aid in the autonomous navigation of a micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Inspired by the manner in which bats use ultrasound to sense and navigate their environments, the sensor transmits a single ping and uses an array of small ultrasonic microphones to detect echoes. The incident angle of returning echoes is determined using spatiotemporal filtering and a simple classifier. The distal range of the sensor is a critical design constraint due to the high attenuation of ultrasound in air, therefore the ability of the sensor to handle weak signals (a low signal to noise ratio) is of utmost concern. The sensor is shown to have an RMS error of 1.10 over the range [−600 600] for non-overlapping signals with SNR of 10dB. Overlapping signals are detected with only a minor decrease in accuracy.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;design closure;erewhon;low-power broadcasting;microphone;ping (networking utility);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sonar;statistical classification;unmanned aerial vehicle	Garrick Orchard;Ralph Etienne-Cummings;Jamal Molin	2009	2009 43rd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2009.5054768	filter;remotely operated underwater vehicle;mobile robot;computer vision;computer science;noise;ultrasound;band-pass filter;signal-to-noise ratio;computational model;sonar	Robotics	85.5984323576667	-41.859778306449904	15833

In this paper, through extremely simple replacement reaction approach, we synthesized various copper nanostructures under ambient atmosphere at room temperature. Pure copper, with splendid structures at nanoscale, was acquired by dipping iron plate into solution with copper ions. With different reactant, copper chloride, copper sulfate, copper nitrite and copper acetate, different copper nanostructures are obtained. Using copper chloride, dendrite structure is prepared; and copper sulfate leads to sponge-like structure; while both copper nitrite and copper acetate result into no copper structure. What's more, we discovered that enough long reaction time will lead to the transformation of dendrite copper into sponge-like copper, no matter what copper salt is employed. Addition of silver ions into the reaction system demonstrated the significant influence of copper salt into the synthesis of dendrite silver structures. Finally, the mechanism of the nanostructures formation is investigated thoroughly.	copper–tungsten	Fanan Wei;Longhai Li;Lianqing Liu	2015	10th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2015.7147400	materials science;single displacement reaction;chemistry;cuprate;copper plating;inorganic chemistry;metallurgy	Robotics	93.69066062339003	-13.09152278480807	15834

61679d6cbd80794caee7483ab09e70314d2847b1	automation of prosthetic upper limbs for transhumeral amputees using switch-controlled motors		The issues of “research required in the field of bio-medical engineering” and “externally-powered prostheses” are attracting attention of regulatory bodies and the common people in various parts of the globe. Today, 90% of prostheses used are conventional body-powered cablecontrolled ones which are very uncomfortable to the amputees as fairly large amount of forces and excursions have to be generated by the amputee. Additionally, its amount of rotation is limited. Alternatively, prosthetic limbs driven using electrical motors might deliver added functionality and improved control, accompanied by better cosmesis, however, it could be bulky and costly. Presently existing proposals usually require fewer bodily response and need additional upkeep than the cable operated prosthetic limbs. Due to the motives mentioned, proposal for mechanization of bodypowered prostheses, with ease of maintenance and cost in mind, is presented in this paper. The prosthetic upper limb which is being automated is for Transhumeral type of amputees i.e., amputated from above elbow. The study consists of two main portions: one is lifting mechanism of the limb and the other is gripping mechanism for the hand using switch controls, which is the most cost effective and optimized solution, rather than using complex and expensive myoelectric control signals.	automation;british informatics olympiad;lambda lifting;neuroprosthetics	Fahad Moazzam Dar;Umer Asgher;Daniyal Malik;Emmad Adil;Hassan Shahzad;Anees Ali	2013	CoRR	10.7321/jscse.v3.n3.90	simulation	HCI	72.70867708729564	-25.637386172048732	15853

In this paper, we present a visual navigation system as an alternative pose estimation method for environments and situations in which GPS is unavailable. The developed visual odometer is an incremental procedure that estimates the vehicle's ego-motion by extracting and tracking visual features, using an onboard camera. For more robustness and accuracy, the visual estimates are fused with measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Pressure Sensor Altimeter (PSA) in order to provide accurate estimates of the vehicle's height, velocity and position relative to a given location. These estimates are then exploited by a nonlinear hierarchical controller for achieving various navigation tasks such as take-off, landing, hovering, target tracking, etc. In addition to the odometer description, the paper presents validation results from autonomous flights using a small quadrotor UAV.	algorithm;autonomous robot;global positioning system;machine vision;nonlinear system;polar surface area;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Farid Kendoul;Kenzo Nonami	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354730	computer vision;simulation;computer science;pressure sensor;remote sensing	Robotics	54.44836038657896	-36.22346482178916	15879
ae4f9c9bad0f7b0764e9f7d6d79b7cf1c356a79c	time-domain adaptive harmonic control for rejection of sinusoidal disturbances acting on an unknown discrete-time system		We consider the problem of rejecting sinusoids with known frequencies that act on a completely unknown multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant system. First, we present a new time-domain harmonic control (TD-HC) approach, which is effective for rejecting sinusoids with known frequencies but requires an estimate of the control-to-performance transfer function evaluated at the disturbance frequencies. We analyze the stability of TD-HC, and perform a numerical comparison between TD-HC and an existing control approach (i.e., higher harmonic control), which requires exactly the same model information. This comparison shows that TD-HC offers reduced convergence times. Second, we address the problem of uncertainty in the model information required to implement TD-HC. We present a new time-domain adaptive harmonic control (TD-AHC) algorithm, which is effective for rejecting sinusoids with known frequencies that act on an unknown multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant system.

This mechanism is a key enabling design feature of a recently developed two-armed reaction wheel stabilized monopod, that is capable of conventional wheeled roving, continuous hopping, and self-uprighting. The mechanism is shown to behave essentially as a digressive-rate torsional spring placed between the two arms, in series with a weaker progressive-rate torsional spring tied to the leg/central body. This makes it well-suited to recovering substantial energy from hopping motion, whilst presenting negligible resistance to antisymmetric motions used to maintain side-to-side stability. Furthermore, by storing energy purely in tension, the problem of buckling encountered with compression springs is avoided, and, the effective torsional spring constant may be varied by adjusting the spring pretension. Finally, the mechanism is self-latching near maximum deflection, allowing the vehicle to fold into a compact roving configuration, and enabling “running jumps” via the release of this gradually accumulated spring energy.	arm architecture;buckling;coat of arms;control theory;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;multimodal interaction;prototype;robot;series and parallel circuits;underactuation;while	Christopher Schmidt-Wetekam;Thomas R.

2849c34c08eebef78c3d6646c02db25b54f09feb	tensor-guided hex-dominant mesh generation with targeted all-hex regions		In this paper, we present a method for generating hex-dominant meshes with targeted all-hex regions over closed volumes. The method begins by generating a piecewise-continuous metric tensor field over the volume. This field specifies desired anisotropy and directionality during the subsequent meshing stages. Meshing begins with field-guided tiling of individual structured hexahedral fronts wherever suitable and in regions of interest (ROI). Then, the hexahedral fronts are incorporated into an existing hex-dominant meshing procedure, resulting in a good quality hex-dominant mesh. Presently, many successful hex meshing methods require significant preprocessing and have limited control over mesh directionality and anisotropy. In light of this, hex-dominant meshes have gained traction for industry analyses. In turn, this presents the challenge of increasing the hex-to-tet ratio in hex-dominant meshes, especially in ROI specified by analysts. Here, a novel three-part strategy addresses this goal: generation of a guiding tensor field, application of topological insertion operators to tile elements and grow fronts towards the boundary, and incorporation of the fronts into a hex-dominant meshing procedure. The field directionality is generated from boundary information, which is then adjusted to specified uniform anisotropy.

To further investigate biologically inspired human-like robotic movement and imitation, we have constructed a framework based on three key features of human movement and planning: optimality, modularity and learning. In this paper we focus on the application of optimality principles to the production of human-like movement by a robot arm. Among computational theories of human movement, the signal-dependent noise, or minimum variance, model was chosen as a biologically realistic control scheme to produce human-like movement. A well known optimal control algorithm, the linear quadratic regulator, was adapted to implement this model. The scheme was applied both in simulation and on a real robot arm, which demonstrated human-like movement profiles in a point-to-point reaching experiment.	algorithm;computational model;humanoid robot;optimal control;point-to-point protocol;robotic arm;simulation;theory	Gavin Simmons;Yiannis Demiris	2004	2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (IEEE Cat.

478951089d5fdc4b68c21c92af8deae158ae4aff	simulation-ready hair capture		Physical simulation has long been the approach of choice for generating realistic hair animations in CG. A constant drawback of simulation, however, is the necessity to manually set the physical parameters of the simulation model in order to get the desired dynamic behavior. To alleviate this, researchers have begun to explore methods for reconstructing hair from the real world and even to estimate the corresponding simulation parameters through the process of inversion. So far, however, these methods have had limited applicability, because dynamic hair capture can only be played back without the ability to edit, and solving for simulation parameters can only be accomplished for static hairstyles, ignoring the dynamic behavior. We present the first method for capturing dynamic hair and automatically determining the physical properties for simulating the observed hairstyle in motion. Since our dynamic inversion is agnostic to the simulation model, the proposed method applies to virtually any hair simulation technique, which we demonstrate using two state-of-the-art hair simulation models. The output of our method is a fully simulation-ready hairstyle, consisting of both the static hair geometry as well as its physical properties. The hairstyle can be easily edited by adding additional external forces, changing the head motion, or re-simulating in completely different environments, all while remaining faithful to the captured hairstyle.	algorithm;cg (programming language);computation;computer graphics;dynamical simulation;elastic net regularization;estimation theory;eurographics;gene expression programming;iteration;john d. wiley;machine learning;phase-shift oscillator;strand (programming language);thread (computing);time complexity	Liwen Hu;Derek Bradley;Hao Li;Thabo Beeler	2017	Comput.

We present a neural controller that can adapt the compliance of the robot arm in four directions using as input the tactile information from an artificial skin and as output the estimated torque for admittance control-loop reference. This adaption is done in a self-organized fashion with a neural system that learns first the topology of the tactile map when we touch it and associates a torque vector to move the arm in the corresponding direction. The artificial skin is based on a large area piezoresistive tactile device (ungridded) that changes its electrical properties in the presence of the contact. Our results show the self-calibration of a robotic arm (2 degrees of freedom) controlled in the four directions and derived combination vectors, by the soft touch on all the tactile surface, even when the torque is not detectable (force applied near the joint). The neural system associates each tactile receptive field with one direction and the correct force. We show that the tactile-motor learning gives better interactive experiments than the admittance control of the robotic arm only. Our method can be used in the future for humanoid adaptive interaction with a human partner.	artificial neural network;artificial skin;experiment;humanoid robot;robotic arm;self-organization;tactile graphic	Ganna Pugach;Artem Melnyk;Olga Tolochko;Alex Pitti;Philippe Gaussier	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759519	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;robotic arm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;skin;admittance;robot kinematics	Robotics	64.4081259059683	-25.89520396295568	16011

One well researched topic is the localization of sound sources from Time Differences Of Arrival (TDOAs) measurements. Typically, the propagation speed of sound is considered a known constant. However due to temperature variations its value is known only up to some uncertainty. This paper exploits TDOA-based localization techniques in order to estimate accurately the actual speed of sound. Experimental results using both simulated and real data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. Furthermore, the practical validation of this work considers two distinct experiments that are aimed at inferring information about enclosed sound fields. The first experiment concerns the calculation of the air temperature from the estimated speed of sound. The second experiment highlights the effects of temperature variations on the inference of the physical location of reflective boundaries of the acoustic enclosure. In the latter case it is shown that the position estimates of the reflective surfaces in a room can be improved when the correct propagation speed is first estimated using this method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;emoticon;experiment;internationalization and localization;matrix multiplication;microphone;mobile device;multilateration;sensor;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;the matrix;time of arrival;user interface	Paolo Annibale;Jason Filos;Patrick A.

Rev. E, 69, 032602, 2004]. We have examined the static and dynamic interfacial behaviors by means of the bubble and capillary wave tests and found that both the Laplace equation of capillarity and the dispersion relation were satisfied. Dynamic contact angles followed the general trend of contact line velocity observed experimentally and can be described by Blake's theory. The velocity fields near the interface were also obtained and are in good agreement with fluid mechanics and molecular dynamics studies. Our simulations demonstrated that incorporating interfacial effects into the lattice Boltzmann model can be a valuable and powerful alternative in interfacial studies.	computer simulation;experiment;lattice boltzmann methods;lattice gas automaton;molecular dynamics;velocity (software development)	Junfeng Zhang;Daniel Y.

So, the tracking control objective is reduced to disturbance rejections. This work falls within the scope of the so-called flat systems, a subset of nonlinear systems.

In order to translate the Poisson equation into a conservation law equation, the source term and diffusion term are changed into divergence forms. By using the Chapman-Enskog expansion and the multi-scale time expansion, a series of partial differential equations in different time scales and several higher-order moments of equilibrium distribution functions are obtained. Thus, by rebuilding the divergence of the source and diffusion terms, the Laplace equation and the Poisson equation with the second accuracy of the truncation errors are recovered. In the numerical examples, we compare the numerical results of this scheme with those obtained by other classical method for the Green-Taylor vortex flow, numerical results agree well with the classical ones.	lattice boltzmann methods;lattice gas automaton	Huimin Wang;Guangwu Yan;Bo Yan	2011	J.

The spatial decomposition relies on the fact that for short-ranged fluids, such as the cut and shifted Lennard-Jones potential used in this work, atoms separated by a greater distance than the reach of the potential act independently, and thus different processors can work concurrently in regions of the same system which are sufficiently far apart. The time decomposition is an exactly parallel approach which employs simultaneous (GCMC) simulations, one per processor, identical in every respect except the initial random number seed, with the thermodynamic output variables averaged across all processors. While scaling characteristics for the spatial decomposition are presented for 8-1024 processor systems, the comparison between the two decompositions is limited to the 8-128 processor range due to the warm-up time and memory imitations of the time decomposition. Using a combination of speed and statistical efficiency, the two algorithms are compared at two different state points. While the time decomposition reaches a given value of standard error in the system’s potential energy more quickly than the spatial decomposition for both densities, the warm-up time demands of the time decomposition quickly become insurmountable as the system size increases.	central processing unit;computer simulation;image scaling;jones calculus;lennard-jones potential;monte carlo method;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;random number generation;random seed;uptime	Grant Heffelfinger;Martin E.

Using the UAV, a ground image can be obtained from the aerial vision, which is then processed with image denoising, image correction, and obstacle recognition to construct the ground map automatically. Image correction is used to help the UGV improve the recognition accuracy of obstacles. Based on the constructed ground map, a hybrid path planning algorithm is proposed to optimize the planned path. A genetic algorithm is used for global path planning, and a local rolling optimization is used to constantly optimize the results of the genetic algorithm. Experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach can obtain a much less costly path compared to the traditional path planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm and the A-star algorithm and can run in real-time to support the UAV/UGV systems.	a* search algorithm;aerial photography;automated planning and scheduling;consensus dynamics;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;motion planning;noise reduction;real-time clock;unmanned aerial vehicle	Jianqiang Li;Genqiang Deng;Chengwen Luo;Qiuzhen Lin;Qiao Yan;Zhong Ming	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2623666	mobile robot;simulation;genetic algorithm;aerospace engineering;computer science;engineering;aeronautics	Robotics	54.49640673283479	-25.850075386907868	16174

The methodology, used to define the limit of the device safe operating area, consists in applying accelerated DC step stresses with bias conditions that can be reached by the Vds and Vgs sweeps in overdrive operation. The identified parameter drifts of the MESFET are rather less related to hot electron effects than the PHEMT ones as the stress bias conditions correspond to a conduction regime where the impact ionization rate is weaker for the MESFET than for the PHEMT. Specific DC life-tests summarised in this work have allowed to orientate the technology choice for overdrive operating conditions in a satellite mission, preferably towards the MESFET instead of the PHEMT under test.	pentium overdrive;safe operating area	N.

For standard wheels, the instantaneous center of rotation is defined as the intersection point of all wheel axes. We present a novel approach to deal with the problem of continuously shifting the center of rotation of a pseudo-omnidirectional rover from an initial to a demanded position in the Cartesian plane. The main contribution is the consideration of substantial velocity and acceleration limits on the steering units, as well as mechanical constraints and noise affected sensor measurements. We solve this problem by deriving a relationship between the steering accelerations of the single wheels and the acceleration of the center of rotation. We furthermore provide a contribution to the tracking of the ICR in the presence of significant sensor noise. Our results are evaluated by tests on the rover breadboard developed during the activities for the ExoMars mission.	algorithm;breadboard;esa;extended kalman filter;fastest;image noise;intelligent character recognition;robot;rough set;rover (the prisoner);simulation;steerable filter;steering wheel;velocity (software development);wheels	Ulrich Schwesinger;Cédric Pradalier;Roland Siegwart	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385644	control engineering;synchronization;simulation;computer science;engineering;torque steering;control theory	Robotics	63.751550357763996	-27.581924048059054	16195
1aecd6be6f438a3d9fde8059b83dda308335ba03	design and kinematic analysis of a novel flight simulator mechanism		In this paper, a novel flight simulator mechanism is proposed. By using a new parallel manipulator with redundant structure, a mechanism with larger rotational motions is obtained, which makes the flight simulator more feasible to simulate more complicated flight actions. First, the flight simulator mechanism is introduced and the kinematics is studied. Then, the workspace of the mechanism is analyzed. Finally, a model of this flight simulator mechanism is simulated under the virtual environment. It shows the design can well meet the needs of flight action with large angle requirements.	flight simulator	Sheng Guo;Dian Li;Huan Chen;Haibo Qu	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-13966-1_3	engineering;flight simulator;control engineering;workspace;kinematics;parallel manipulator;virtual machine	Robotics	69.12260928762032	-22.546680903986086	16207

A Kalman filter estimator is implemented and tested for this purpose. The focus of this paper is to examine the effect on localization accuracy of the number N of participating robots and the accuracy of the sensors employed. More specifically, we investigate the improvement in localization accuracy per additional robot as the size of the team increases. Furthermore, we provide an analytical expression for the upper bound on the positioning uncertainty increase rate for a team of N robots as a function of N , the odometric and orientation uncertainty for the robots, and the accuracy of a robot tracker measuring relative positions between pairs of robots. The analytical results derived in this paper are validated both in simulation and experimentally for different test cases.	aerial photography;autonomous robot;cooperative mimo;dead reckoning;experiment;internationalization and localization;kalman filter;landmark point;mobile robot;propagation of uncertainty;provable security;sensor;simulation;software propagation;test case;tree accumulation	Stergios I.

c1d52721118c4c4a952207bae774e146bd3f1d3c	endoscopic tactile instrument for remote tissue palpation in colonoscopic procedures		Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant medical threat and it represents in Europe the second and third most common cancer for women and men, respectively. Early detection of CRC is a key-aspect to improve survival rate. Specifically, the survival rate at five years decreases with the pathological progress of the cancer, up to 11% in case of cancer stage IV. Common diagnostic techniques for the detection of cancerous tissue in CRC screening have a miss rate in the order of 14% to 32%, thus resulting as not reliable and accurate solutions for screening. In this paper, we present the design and preliminary results of an innovative force-sensing instrument for remote palpation of the inner colonic wall. The instrument is equipped with three optical fibres having each one a fibre Bragg grating sensor with a dimension compatible with standard colonoscope operating channels.	cyclic redundancy check;optical fiber;stand up to cancer;virtual screening	Federico Bianchi;Enrico Trallori;Domenico Camboni;Calogero Maria Oddo;Arianna Menciassi;Gastone Ciuti;Paolo Dario	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Cyborg and Bionic Systems (CBS)	10.1109/CBS.2017.8266109	cancer;fiber bragg grating;palpation;radiology;cancer stage;colorectal cancer;survival rate;colonic wall;medicine	Robotics	94.68800315365772	-21.822213803598782	16270

We consider a zone-controlled guidepath network where a set of intelligent vehicles (agents) has to autonomously reach a consensus about the distribution of a set of tasks, i.e., a set of zones to be reached. To this aim the agents apply a discrete consensus algorithm in order to locally minimize the global cost for reaching the destination zone. Moreover, we present a decentralized coordination protocol that is based on a zone-controlled approach with the aim of avoiding deadlock and collisions.	autonomous car;autonomous robot;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;collision detection;control theory;deadlock;distributed control system;integer programming;linear programming;systems management	Maria Pia Fanti;Agostino Marcello Mangini;Giovanni Pedroncelli;Walter Ukovich	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7171094	control engineering;layout;communications protocol;simulation;decentralised system;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;distributed computing	Robotics	57.10946537174134	-24.556107231936714	16284

Algorithms based on Taylor's expansion are developed for realizing NURBS curve interpolator that takes into account the feed rate adjustment to the curvature radius of NURBS curves. By means of the flexible acceleration/deceleration (ACC/DEC) planning, the velocity profile can be chosen dynamically to meet the requirements of the machining process. In addition, a new strategy based on the geometrical properties of NURBS curves is suggested to predict the deceleration point. Therefore, the process of acceleration and deceleration is so smooth that can satisfy the need of machining tool dynamic properties. This NURBS interpolator has been validated on a CNC system, which improves the machining accuracy for both position and velocity control.	non-uniform rational b-spline;real-time transcription	Liyan Zhang;Kuisheng Wang;Yuchao Bian;Hu Chen	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87442-3_131	real-time computing;non-uniform rational b-spline;interpolation;machine tool;numerical control;satisfiability	Robotics	69.41087407981298	-37.792940491344375	16320

A novel method of measuring the capacitance and phase angle of a parallel-plate system is described. The measured values were used in an empirical equation to estimate the moisture content (mc) of the sample. The estimated values were in good agreement with the mc values that are obtained by a standard air-oven method. This method can be used to estimate the mc in other types of nuts and grain by calibrating the instrument with samples of these materials with known mc values. This instrument would be useful in grain industries for quick and nondestructive mc measurement.	characteristic impedance;electronic circuit;radio frequency	Chari V. K. Kandala;Chris L.

This mea ns that the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is no greater than th at of a pure localization algorithm using a single map and the same numbe r of particles. We also present a hierarchical extension of DP-SLAM th at uses a two level particle filter which models drift in the particle fi ltering process itself. The hierarchical approach enables recovery from th e inevitable drift that results from using a finite number of particles in a particle filter and permits the use of DP-SLAM in more challenging domains, w hile maintaining linear time asymptotic complexity.	amortized analysis;computation;computational complexity theory;davis–putnam algorithm;explicit modeling;iteration;map;particle filter;population;sampling (signal processing);simultaneous localization and mapping;time complexity	Austin I.

The proposed technique is based on the combination of a quadratic embedding of the uncertainty, and the S-procedure. This formulation leads to convex optimization problems that can be essentially solved in O(n)—n being the size of unknown vector—by means of suitable interior point barrier methods, as well as to closed form results in some particular cases. We further show that the uncertain linear equations paradigm can be directly applied to various state-bounding problems for dynamical systems subject to set-valued noise and model uncertainty. ? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, actuator failures may lead to performance deterioration or system dysfunction. To guarantee the desired system performance, the remaining actuators should be able to coordinate with each other to compensate for the damaging effects caused by the failed actuator in a timely manner. Further, in the networked control environment, timing issues such as sampling jitter and network-induced delay should be considered in the controller design. In this study, a timing compensation approach is implemented in an adaptive actuator failure compensation controller to maintain the fairing system performance by also considering the detrimental effects from real-time constraints. In addition, time-delay compensation in the networked control system is discussed, which is able to reduce damaging effects of network-induced delays.	algorithm;central processing unit;centralized computing;control point (mathematics);control system;data aggregation;embedded system;matlab;network packet;overhead (computing);piezoelectricity;point of view (computer hardware company);process state;real-time control system;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time operating system;real-time transcription;requirement;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);simulation;simulink;transponder timing	Zhiqiang Wang;Bin Huang;Kay Chen Tan	2004	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2004.837889	control engineering;fault tolerance;real-time computing;adaptive control;computer science;networked control system;engineering;control theory	Embedded	65.34957312918077	-7.849083604174805	16348

27bab38e4ea3bc419f835c6f1d11c83126c15863	adaptive-gain fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode for position control of a piezo positioning stage		This article proposed a variable gain fast terminal sliding mode controller with an estimator of the uncertainty model for a piezo positioning stage system. The designed terminal sliding mode control has some advantages over the linear sliding mode control such as fast convergence and chattering reduction while maintains its robustness to the uncertainties. Next, an indirect technique is developed to enable the elimination of the singularity problem corresponding to initial terminal sliding mode control. In addition, a cerebellar model articulation controller is carried out to estimate the nonlinear dynamics of the piezo positioning stage. To deal with unknown bounds of uncertainties and disturbances, the proposed scheme consists of using online tuning control gains that ensure the establishment of a real terminal sliding mode in a finite time. Moreover, a fuzzy logic scheme is presented to smooth out the discontinuity part of the control signal, hence improve the control performance.

The system consists of throttle and brake controllers. We first designed and tested a throttle-only fuzzy system on a validated car model and then with a real car on highway I-15 in California. We used this controller to drive the “smart” car on the highway in a two-car platoon. Then we designed a throttle and brake controller. The combined system controls the platoon on downhill parts of the freeway and as it decelemtes to slower speeds. We modeled the brake controller using the real test data from the bmke system. A logic switch for throttle and bmke decides which system to use. The gap controller uses only data from its own sensors and there is no communication among cars. The simulation results show that follower cars with a combined bmke/throttle controller can maintain a constant gap when the platoon goes down hills and slows. An adaptive throttle controller uses a neuml system to learn the fuzzy rules for different vehicle types.	additive model;freeway;fuzzy control system;no-communication theorem;platoon (automobile);sensor;simulation;test data;velocity (software development)	Hyun Mun Kim;Julie A.

However, unless we are able to guarantee that the system is in thermal equilibrium before performing the measurement, the result is not consistent with the definition of thermal impedance. This work presents a method to extend the validity of a measurement made under non-equilibrium conditions to fit the real value of thermal impedance, under the assumption that the system is linear or has negligible nonlinearity, i.e. the parameters involved can be considered nearly independent of temperature.	characteristic impedance;thermal grease	F.

6fd291ee2e439d1754cd55676b1e1650592f1cfa	reduction of impact force by model prediction and final-state control for a high precision catapult stage		The catapult stage is a high-precision dual stage with a new structure which, by allowing contact between fine and coarse parts, is compatible with increasing size and acceleration. Impact force occurs in acceleration and deceleration regions, and may degrade a stage. This paper thus proposes a control method to reduce the impact force that considers the thrust limitation by combining model prediction and final-state control. In the proposed method, the timing to activate the fine stage is automatically determined by solving an optimization problem. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the method can significantly reduce the impact force between the fine and coarse parts.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quadratic programming;robot;simulation;thrust;velocity (software development)	Yuma Yazaki;Hiroshi Fujimoto;Koichi Sakata;Atsushi Hara;Kazuaki Saiki	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793026	control engineering;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	71.65859264079056	-17.131854709837175	16399

This paper focuses on the Harmonic Transform (HT) and its fast implementation using interpolation of the signal to approximate pulse-train spectrum. The HT requires a priori knowledge of fundamental frequency change. Estimation of this change has been addressed in several papers using spectral flatness. Interpolation in the fast implementation adds noise to the signal and spectral flatness no longer leads to correct estimation of the fundamental frequency change. This is addressed in the paper using gathered log-spectrum and grid search.	aliasing;approximation algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;hermite spline;interpolation;map;spectral flatness;spline interpolation	Michal Trzos;Harshal Ladhe	2013	2013 36th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2013.6613982	mathematical optimization;speech recognition;interpolation;mathematics;spectral density estimation;frequency domain;statistics;approximation theory	Robotics	81.37569070780991	-34.45548345681544	16401

In time delay system, feedback including time delay sometimes makes transient response of a system worse. In the worst case, the system becomes unstable. As time delay compensation method, various methods have been proposed, for example, smith predictor, communication disturbance observer, and so on. In particular, communication disturbance observer is superior than smith predictor in terms of no using a time delay model. However, if an error in plant model exists or disturbance is applied to the system, steady-state error occurs. As disturbance rejection method, communication disturbance observer with an disturbance observer and an integrator in outer loop was proposed in conventional research. But using this method, time delay compensation and disturbance rejection can not be designed independently. Therefore, in this paper, an integrator is not used and two degrees of freedom control is conducted by communication disturbance observer and disturbance observer. For eliminating disturbance, a novel filter design method is proposed. Using proposed filter, the effect of disturbance is suppressed. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by simulation results.	best, worst and average case;broadcast delay;control theory;filter design;kerrison predictor;rejection sampling;simulation;smith predictor;steady state	Eiichi Saito;Seiichiro Katsura	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/ISIE.2012.6237338	control engineering;real-time computing;control theory	Embedded	67.42754526774782	-6.364873742477768	16406

Until recently, no motion capture system using optical and gyro-accelerometer approaches allowing parallel measurement of kinematic parameters of the vestibular system during gait was presented. The results have shown a possibility of estimating linear acceleration through a derivation of optical position markers.

At first, the B-spline neural network-based square-root model is used to represent the output probability density functions. The mean controller design of the output distribution is then studied by transferring the design procedure to a solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. The Levenberg–Marquardt modification for gradient search approach is adopted in the optimization phase and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis is carried out for the closed loop system. This leads to a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system. Robustness analysis is performed when the system is subjected to random noises and modelling errors. It has been shown that the closed mean control loop system is still locally asym...	stochastic process	Yue Wang;Huaqing Wang;J. Jiao	2004	Int. J.

Our method is based on the photo hull representation, which is the maximal photo-consistent shape. We avoid the explicit reconstruction of photo hulls by adopting a view-dependent plane-sweeping strategy. From the target viewpoint slicing planes are rendered with reference views projected onto them. Graphics hardware is exploited to verify the photo-consistency of each rasterized fragment. Visibilities with respect to reference views are properly modeled, and only photo-consistent fragments are kept and colored in the target view. We present experiments with real images and animation sequences. Thanks to the more accurate shape of the photo hull representation, our method generates more realistic rendering results than methods based on visual hulls. Currently, we achieve rendering frame rates of 2-3 fps. Compared to a pure software implementation, the performance of our hardware-accelerated method is approximately 7 times faster.	algorithm;columbia (supercomputer);concave function;discretization;experiment;global illumination;graphics hardware;hardware acceleration;image editing;image noise;lambertian reflectance;map;maximal set;mipmap;photo-consistency;raster graphics;rasterisation;view synthesis;visual basic[.net]	Ming Li;Marcus A.

Dynamic range in real-world environments often far exceeds the range representable in 8-bit per-channel texture maps. The increased realism afforded by a highdynamic range representation provides improved fidelity and expressiveness for interactive visualization of image-based models. Our technique allows for realtime rendering of scenes with arbitrary dynamic range, limited only by available texture memory. In our technique, high-dynamic range textures are decomposed into sets of 8bit textures. These 8-bit textures are dynamically reassembled by the graphics hardware’s programmable multitexturing system or using multipass techniques and framebuffer image processing. These operations allow the exposure level of the texture to be adjusted continuously and arbitrarily at the time of rendering, correctly accounting for the gamma curve and dynamic range restrictions of the display device. Further, for any given exposure only two 8-bit textures must be resident in texture memory simultaneously. We present implementation details of this technique on various 3D graphics hardware architectures. We demonstrate several applications, including high-dynamic range panoramic viewing with simulated auto-exposure, real-time radiance environment mapping, and simulated Fresnel reflection.	3d computer graphics;8-bit;display device;framebuffer;gamma correction;geforce 2 series;geforce 3 series;graphics hardware;high dynamic range;image processing;interaction technique;interactive visualization;map;overhead (computing);real-time clock;real-time computer graphics;real-time transcription;reflection mapping;sgi octane;simulation;texture mapping;texture memory	Jonathan M.

The light transfer functions and light sources are modeled with  spherical radial basis functions  (SRBFs). A SRBF is a rotation-invariant function that depends on the geodesic distance between two points on the unit sphere. Rotating functions in SRBF representation is as straightforward as rotating the centers of SRBFs. Moreover, high-frequency signals are handled by adjusting the bandwidth parameters of SRBFs. To exploit inter-vertex coherence, the light transfer functions are further classified iteratively into disjoint clusters, and tensor approximation is applied within each cluster. Compared with previous methods, the proposed approach enables real-time rendering with comparable quality under high-frequency lighting environments. The data storage is also more compact than previous all-frequency PRT algorithms.	approximation;precomputation;precomputed radiance transfer;radial (radio);radial basis function	Yu-Ting Tsai;Zen-Chung Shih	2006	ACM Trans.

Three steps are usually included in this process: filtering, registration, and error map generation. For quality control, small defects like dints and dents have to be kept in the point cloud. Therefore, a filtering algorithm is required to automatically remove outliers and keep dints/dents. Many filtering algorithm smooth the point cloud for better display, however, since the measured point cloud is used to represent the shape of the part, modification of any point's coordinates is not allowed because that will modify the error map. A point cloud filtering algorithm is developed using a link clustering algorithm to identify and remove outliers. Point cloud filtering is especially important in an iterative closest point (ICP)-based robot hand- eye calibration method because outliers will bring calibration errors into the calculated transformation matrix. With this technique, the cleaned point clouds can be directly transformed to a world frame for registration. This registration method has two advantages compared to feature-based registration methods: 1) the entire inspection process can be automatically executed, 2) avoid holes in point clouds caused by artificial markers. For error map generation, a point-to-plane distance is used in this paper which calculates the distance of a point to its closest triangle. The introduced automated inspection system had been implemented on a PUMA robot system. Experimental results are described in this paper.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer-aided design;dr. zeus inc.;entity–relationship model;error detection and correction;filter (signal processing);ibm notes;image stitching;iterative closest point;iterative method;point cloud;repeatability;robot;transformation matrix;vii	Quan Shi;Ning Xi	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2008.4543816	computer vision;quality control;simulation;inspection;data processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;point cloud;engineering drawing;robot kinematics;iterative closest point	Robotics	60.4603446401319	-40.07936138924227	16449

Different from the existing results, the exosystem considered in this paper is a switched system, which can greatly enrich the reference signals. However, the switched exosystem brings about two technical difficulties. First, due to the switching of the exosystem, asymptotic leader-following consensus cannot be achieved. To address this issue, we define a so-called dynamic leader-following consensus in the sense that the tracking errors are bounded and decay to zero in a piecewise way. Second, the switched exosystem leads to a nonlinear switched closed-loop system. In order to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system, we have given an explicit lower bound on the dwell time of the switching signal.	consensus (computer science);euler;euler–lagrange equation;initial condition;nonlinear system	He Cai;Guoqiang Hu	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264659	mathematical optimization;euler's formula;computer science;piecewise;control theory;nonlinear system;dwell time;bounded function;consensus;exponential stability;upper and lower bounds	Robotics	69.11449492323258	0.07295347304117512	16466

Model validation indicates that there are dynamics that the model does not capture, and hence, we use real data of excess AlF3 and bath temperature to estimate AlF3 and energy disturbances, respectively. The estimation results show that the energy disturbance is the dominating disturbance. Hence, the proposed control strategy is based on an almost constant AlF 3 input close to average consumption and energy manipulations to compensate for the disturbances. This requires the possibility for the resistance reference to be reduced without decreasing the current efficiency. Compared to present control strategies, this introduces an additional degree of freedom in the controller. The proposed control strategy may imply a significant economic potential through increased and stabilized current efficiency, reduced and stabilized energy consumption, reduced consumption of expensive additives, and prolongation of cell life.	control theory;mathematical model;offset binary	Tormod Drengstig;Dag Ljungquist;Bjarne A.

Firstly, the SMF technique is proposed to improve the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) by using the power factor. The properties of the transmitting signal, the target echoes and the interference and noise are considered during the power factor generation. The amplitude coherent accumulation technique that extracts the coherent amplitude information of echoes after being processed by the SMF, is used to improve the SINR based on multiple measurements. Finally, the bi-directional difference technique is proposed to distinguish the target echoes and the interference/noise. Simulations and experiments are conducted to validate and demonstrate that small moving targets can be detected with high probability using the proposed method in urban environments, even with just one measurement.	abbreviations;acclimatization;acoustic lobing;algorithm;american cryptogram association;brachydactyly, type d;binary decision diagram;blood glucose self-monitoring;coalition for patent fairness;coherence (physics);coherent;computer simulation;conflict (psychology);cubic function;echo (command);experiment;interference (communication);matlab;manuscripts;matched filter;modulation;nr5a2 wt allele;natural science disciplines;sensor;short-time fourier transform;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical interference;structure of anterior cerebral artery;test data;transmitter;tree accumulation;universities;wavelet analysis;wavelet transform;wigner distribution function;wigner quasiprobability distribution;window function;with high probability	Shitao Zhu;Xiaoming Chen;Xuehan Pan;Xiaoli Dong;Hongyu Shi;Anxue Zhang;Zhuo Xu	2018		10.3390/s18103177	electronic engineering;engineering;matched filter	Robotics	83.1519071203743	-43.10164158460896	16475

In order to investigate the influence of cutting parameters on distortion, external longitudinal turning experiments were conducted. After machining the ring geometry and the residual stresses around the rings’ circumference were measured. The residual stresses were then released by a subsequent heat treatment. After the heat treatment the ring geometry was measured again. The results show that the residual stresses induced by the machining process correlate well with the dimensional changes after heat treatment. The cutting parameters that have the highest influence on the dimensional changes are the feed rate and the depth of cut. Residual stresses induced by soft-machining lead to an increase of the ring diameter, depending on the machining parameters.	distortion	Lutz Nowag;Jens Sölter;Ekkard Brinksmeier	2007	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-007-0009-9	structural engineering;distortion;engineering;residual stress;heat treating;scheduling;forensic engineering;engineering drawing;metallurgy	HCI	86.16742691659648	-12.905354265862982	16503

However, the accuracy and response characteristics of these sensors is poorly documented. In this study, inexpensive Shinyei PPD42NS and PPD60PV sensors were evaluated using a novel laboratory evaluation method. A continuously changing monodisperse size distribution of particles was generated using a Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator. Furthermore, the laboratory results were validated in a field experiment. The laboratory tests showed that both of the sensors responded to particulate mass (PM) concentration stimulus, rather than number concentration. The highest detection efficiency for the PPD42NS was within particle size range of 2.5-4 µm, and the respective optimal size range for the PPD60PV was 0.7-1 µm. The field test yielded high PM correlations (R² = 0.962 and R² = 0.986) for viable detection ranges of 1.6-5 and 0.3-1.6 µm, when compared to a medium cost optical dust monitor. As the size distribution of atmospheric particles tends to be bimodal, it is likely that indicatively valid results could be obtained for the PM10-2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size range 2.5-10 µm) with the PPD42NS sensor. Respectively, the PPD60PV could possibly be used to measure the PM2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size below 2.5 µm).	aerosol dose form;anatomical orifice;complement system proteins;data quality;document completion status - documented;experiment;mass spectrometry;particle size;particulate (substance);patient activity scale;requirement;schematic;aminosalicylic acid;sensor (device)	Joel Kuula;Timo Mäkelä;Risto Hillamo;Hilkka Timonen	2017		10.3390/s17122915	analytical chemistry;body orifice;engineering;field experiment;air quality index;dispersity;aerosol;aerosol generator;particulates;particle size	HCI	96.89034707853429	-18.401329381211532	16506

The technique involves locally heating the work piece by traversing it under a laser beam. Positioning tables with a minimum of x and y axes are used as the means of moving the metal. Control of the laser path is via the table movement and requires programs written in G-Code machine language. This can present problems for the designer but complimented by today’s modern computing methods, there can be some relief from arduous number crunching and it can be possible that an old programming language, comparatively new software and an understanding of three-dimensional space, thermodynamics and design, can be combined for creating designed objects.	g-code;machine code;programming language	Sarah Silve	2006	Digital Creativity	10.1080/14626260600787696	visual arts;three-dimensional space;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;programming language	Theory	77.67338820301066	-22.83581107998263	16582

With the help of image processing techniques such as binarization, Canny edge detection method, and Hough transform, the road lines are thus identified, which means the drivable area can be defined. The proposed control scheme adopts a simple algorithm to guide the vehicle to run inside the drivable area within the road lines. The computation of defining drivable area and control algorithm is operated in a control center which connects the vehicle via WiFi wireless communication system. Similarly, the image information transmits back to the control center. Furthermore, the control center can not only monitor the vehicle inside some certain area but also control the vehicle dynamically in real time. To simplify the experimental setup, the drivable area is defined as the superhighway which allows only cars on the road. Two experimental results, one in a straight road and the other in a curved road, are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance control system.	algorithm;computation;control system;edge detection;hough transform;image processing;webcam	Hou-Tsan Lee	2015	EURASIP J.

7c3d95af3e9237b654aa38239e593c20a6f64275	recovery of perceptual shape organizations from simple closed boundaries		A representation of shape to simulate elementary aspects of human perception is considered. The representation involves an organization of sections of an object's boundary, and objects with different shapes are a~Sbuted different organizations. The boundary sections correspond to vertices, curves and sides, and those with similar curvature are combined under specific conditions to form a particular organization. Global properties indicating figural axes and decompositions of the object into simpler areas are evident in organizations for simple closed boundaries. A program is described for recovering the postulated representation of shape from simple closed boundaries. The results of the program on 12 boundaries are presented and file implications for simulating human shape perception are briefly discussed.	elementary;simulation	J. F.

The robot has three caster wheels with modular wheel angular velocities actuation. The forward dynamics model which is used during the simulation process is discussed along with the robot inverse dynamics solution. The inverse dynamics solution is used to overcome the singularity problem, which is observed from the kinematic modeling. Since both models are different in principle they are analyzed using simulation examples to show the effect of the actuated and non actuated wheel velocities on the robot response. An experiment is used to illustrate the performance of the inverse dynamic solution practically.	angularjs;control flow;experiment;inverse dynamics;inverse kinematics;mobile robot;scroll wheel;simulation;technological singularity;the singularity;velocity (software development);wheels	Ahmed Khamies El-Shenawy;Achim Wagner;Essameddin Badreddin	2007			kinematics equations;mobile robot;inverse kinematics;robot kinematics	Robotics	68.84946534851673	-21.570324091040167	16647

36f47489fd82c1fd8d4defb2288925717c825dcc	haptic feedback for control and active constraints in contactless laser surgery: concept, implementation, and evaluation		Haptics has proven to be highly beneficial in surgical robotics, bringing enhanced safety and precision by complementing the surgeon's visual channel. However, most of the research body in this context is dedicated to applications involving traditional “cold steel” surgical instruments. This paper proposes to bring the benefits of haptics to contactless surgeries, and presents a novel method to achieve this. The specific case of robot-assisted laser microsurgery is investigated. Here, a fictitious force feedback is created through stereoscopic visualization and 3D reconstruction, allowing the surgeon to sense the surgical area haptically while controlling a non-contact surgical laser. This is shown to significantly improve system usability and the accuracy of laser incisions, especially in applications involving several passes of the laser over the same incision line. Validation of the system is performed through two series of experiments involving both naive users and expert surgeons. The obtained results demonstrate that haptics can indeed be introduced in contactless laser surgery, allowing the exploitation of active constraints and guidance techniques that significantly enhance laser control accuracy both in static and dynamic environments. Furthermore, the proposed haptic technology shows good acceptance and high usability, indicating it has great potential to positively impact real surgeries.	3d reconstruction;active set method;contactless smart card;experiment;haptic device component;haptic technology;imagery;instrument - device;laser surgery;microsurgery;operative surgical procedures;robotics;stereoscopy;surgical instruments;surgical incisions;usability;benefit	Emidio Olivieri;Giacinto Barresi;Darwin G.

Two different simplex volume formulas are used in these methods. One requires dimensionality reduction (DR); therefore, it may result in loss of the information of targets classes with a low priori probability, such as that used in N-FINDR. The other one, which is based on Gram determinant, avoids DR but is time consuming. In this letter, we explain a recursion rule of the calculation for the second simplex volume. Based on that rule, this letter presents a fast endmember extraction algorithm named as Fast Gram Determinant based Algorithm (FGDA). The theoretical analysis and experiments on both simulated and real hyperspectral data demonstrate that, compared to other volume-based methods, FGDA can greatly reduce the computational complexity of endmember extraction.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;dimensionality reduction;experiment;fast fourier transform;gramian matrix;logical volume management;recursion	Kang Sun;Xiurui Geng;Panshi Wang;Yongchao Zhao	2014	IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters	10.1109/LGRS.2013.2288093	mathematical optimization;data reduction;determinant;feature extraction;computer science;hyperspectral imaging;machine learning;pattern recognition;probability;mixture model;mathematics;computational complexity theory;statistics	ML	82.35862340909028	-48.50777494071546	16694
8b1f82338668ea55a5146ad251a29e8279365291	quaternion-based local frame alignment between an inertial measurement unit and a motion capture system	angular velocity;inertial measurement unit;local frame alignment;motion capture system;quaternion	Local frame alignment between an inertial measurement unit (IMU) system and an optical motion capture system (MCS) is necessary to combine the two systems for motion analysis and to validate the accuracy of IMU-based motion data by using references obtained through the MCS. In this study, we propose a new quaternion-based local frame alignment method where equations of angular velocity transformation are used to determine the frame alignment orientation in the form of quaternion. The performance of the proposed method was compared with those of three other methods by using data with different angular velocities, noises, and alignment orientations. Furthermore, the effects of the following three factors on the estimation performance were investigated for the first time: (i) transformation concept, i.e., angular velocity transformation vs. angle transformation; (ii) orientation representations, i.e., quaternion vs. direction cosine matrix (DCM); and (iii) applied solvers, i.e., nonlinear least squares method vs. least squares method through pseudoinverse. Within our limited test data, we obtained the following results: (i) the methods using angular velocity transformation were better than the method using angle transformation; (ii) the quaternion is more suitable than the DCM; and (iii) the applied solvers were not critical in general. The proposed method performed the best among the four methods. We surmise that the fewer number of components and constraints of the quaternion in the proposed method compared to the number of components and constraints of the DCM-based methods may result in better accuracy. Owing to the high accuracy and easy setup, the proposed method can be effectively used for local frame alignment between an IMU and a motion capture system.		Jung Keun Lee;W.

This approach solves the problem of fuzzy simulation by determining at each iteration a nested family of intervals, corresponding to different levels of certainty (@a-cuts), that enclose the possible system states using optimisation. The originality of this approach consists in considering uncertain parameters as time-invariant during the simulation process. The optimisation problems associated with the approach proposed must be solved globally in order to guarantee that the minimum volume box enclosing the region of system states for each level of certainty has been derived. Then, a global optimisation algorithm, based on the theory of moments and linear matrix inequality relaxations suitable for the type of problems (polynomial programs) that appear in the fuzzy simulation algorithm, is used. Finally, two real engineering application examples allow assessing the performance of the approach proposed.	dynamical system;linear time-invariant theory;simulation;time complexity;time-invariant system	Vicenç Puig;Jordi Saludes;Joseba Quevedo	2008	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	10.1016/j.fss.2007.11.009	time complexity;discrete time and continuous time;iteration;lti system theory;linear matrix inequality;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;dynamical system;discrete system;condition number;calculus;mathematics;fuzzy set;linear system;initial value problem;algorithm;fuzzy control system;polynomial	Logic	74.55665268914123	-2.6648010565651594	16738

Flying insects feature a panoramic eye which relies on Optical Flow for guidance and obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, flies bear remarkable neural fusing of visual, inertial, and aerodynamic senses. We describe the development of a miniature electrically-powered UAV featuring a neuromorphic electronic eye based on biological motion detection. The system is tethered within the laboratory on a custom-built whirling-arm test bed. The 20-photoreceptor onboard eye signals are processed by 19 custom Elementary Motion Detection (EMD) circuits which are derived from those of the fly. Visual, inertial, and tachymeter signals from the aircraft are scanned by a PC data acquisition board. Flight commands are output via the parallel port to a microcontroller interfacing with a standard radio-control model transmitter. Vision-based flight path trajectories and landings are simulated. This UAV project is at the intersection of neurobiology, robotics, and aerospace. Its purpose is to test biologically-inspired sensory-motor concepts within a challenging environment and to provide principles and technology to assist Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) indoors operations.	neuromorphic engineering;optical flow	Thomas Netter;Nicolas H.

The influence of step parameters namely step angle, size and length on burr size were studied. The results reveal that burr size depends not only on thrust force but also on torque. Optimisation results show that to get minimum burr height on the exit side, step diameter should be approximately 75-85% of drill diameter and step length should be about 50% of drill diameter. Empirical equations for thrust force, torque and burr height were also established in terms of step parameters.		Ch. Ramu;N. K. Mehta;Pradeep Kumar;A. G.

These situations occur as deviations of properties of the objects (manipulated by the robot) from their acceptable values. Hence, they are experienced by the robot as external faults. In this work, we propose a simulation-based approach for avoiding the external faults that occur during the manipulation actions of a robot which involve releasing of objects. With the help of a single example simulation, that shows the behavior of the manipulated object for successful completion of the action, the proposed approach constructs different examples of the object's behavior and labels them as `desired' or `undesired'. These labelled examples are used by an algorithm, which we refer as N-Bins, to suggest a releasing state of the object that avoids the occurrence of external faults. Once exposed to the labelled examples, N-Bins can also be used for predicting the occurrence of external faults for a given releasing state of the object. These abilities of N-Bins are used by the approach to modify the releasing action of the robot for avoiding external faults. We present the approach as a four-step scheme that performs the above mentioned tasks completely autonomously.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;external ray;simulation;vocabulary	Naveed Akhtar;Anastassia Küstenmacher;Paul-Gerhard Plöger;Gerhard Lakemeyer	2013	2013 16th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)	10.1109/ICAR.2013.6766551	control engineering;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	60.75601878679542	-25.410986780535623	16793

After doing appropriate processing to the model and reasonable analysis to the error expression of the system, the observer design conditions are proposed in LMI form based on Lyapunov theory. More important is the introduction of a new decoupling method which can further reduce the conservatism. The idea can eliminate the influence of the unknown inputs, and guarantee the error of the state estimation is bounded when the uncertainties are nonzero.

It is necessary for all robots to adapt to the complex environment during flocking. In this paper, we propose a decentralized flocking algorithm, which can avoid collision between a robot and its neighbors and the collision between robots and obstacles when there are obstacles in the environment. By simulation results, we find this algorithm can effectively achieve the goal of collision avoidance.	algorithm;autonomous robot;collision detection;flocking (behavior);mobile robot;simulation	Yan Yang;Naixue N.

Based on the theory of information fusion estimation, optimal control of nonlinear discrete control system is investigated. All information on control strategy, including ideal control strategy, expected object trajectory and dynamics of system, are regarded as measuring information of control strategy. Therefore, the problem of optimal control is transferred into the one of information fusion estimation. Firstly, the nonlinear information fusion estimation theorems are described. Secondly, an algorithm of nonlinear IFC theory is detailedly deduced. Finally, the simulation results of manipulator shift control are given, which show the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented algorithm.	algorithm;control system;control theory;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation;system dynamics	Zhisheng Wang;Daobo Wang;Ziyang Zhen	2007	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-007-0049-y	optimal control;nonlinear control;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;automatic control;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.31404670992309	-13.25659933901247	16885

This approach provides inherent fault tolerance: if one of the elements fails, the capabilities of the whole actuator may be reduced, but it retains core functionality. Many di erent con gurations are possible, with di erent implications for the actuator capability and reliability. This paper analyses the reliability of the HRA based on the likelihood of an unacceptable reduction in capability. The analysis of the HRA is a highly structured problem, but it does not t into known reliability categories (such as the k-out-of-n system), and a fault tree analysis becomes prohibitively large. Instead, a multi-state systems approach is pursued here, which provides an easy, concise and e cient reliability analysis of the HRA. The resulting probability distribution can be used to nd the optimal con guration of an HRA for a given set of requirements.	academy;approximation;automation;blum axioms;computation;control engineering;control system;dixon's factorization method;electrical engineering;embedded system;expectation propagation;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;fault tree analysis;heidelberg research architecture;lateral thinking;markov chain;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;mechatronics;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;network switch;open road tolling;reliability engineering;requirement;series and parallel circuits;sid meier's alpha centauri;stochastic process;systems design;systems engineering	Thomas Steffen;Frank Schiller;Michael Blum;Roger Dixon	2013	Int.

In many cases, such as real-time orbit determination for communication satellites, it is necessary to refine the position and velocity outputs of a space borne GNSS receiver for improved accuracy and robustness before actually using them. Toward this problem, an efficient algorithm jointly using weighted Runge-Kutta integration and cubic Hermite polynomial interpolation is proposed in this work. Simulations are conducted based on the GNSS data of GRACE-B satellite and LING QIAO satellite, the result of which show the proposed algorithm can effectively eliminate outliers and significantly reduce the root mean square error of GNSS position and velocity outputs.	algorithm;satellite navigation;velocity	Shuhao Chang;Xi Chen;Menglu Wang	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-78130-3_34	interpolation;robustness (computer science);communications satellite;orbit determination;algorithm;satellite;hermite polynomials;mathematics;gnss applications;mean squared error	Robotics	79.57587178203745	-45.82808863566556	16935

At the same time, based on human kinematics and locomotion phase detection, the spatial position and trajectory of a reference point on the body can be determined. Preliminary experimental study has shown that the position error of SLAC can be controlled stairs within less than 2% error of the total distance travelled for a person to walk around a rectangle on the floor and climb up and down stairs. A benchmark study on the accuracy of SLAC was carried out using the camera-based Motion Analysis® system. The localization data obtained from SLAC tally well with that from the commercial system. The positioning accuracy obtained from SLAC is at least an order of magnitude better than that of GPS. Since the sensors can be worn on the human at any time and any place, this method has no restriction to indoor and outdoor applications and is complimentary to GPS applications.	benchmark (computing);control theory;experiment;gnss applications;global positioning system;multi-user;sensor;wearable computer	Qilong Yuan;I-Ming Chen;Shang Ping Lee	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979872	three-dimensional space;computer vision;calibration;simulation;gait analysis;engineering;sensor;trajectory;kinetics;foot;biosensor	Robotics	57.399982959533176	-38.30685512512001	16961

The model is used to design a controller for positioning the magnets for medical navigation applications. An accurate nonlinear model of the structure is obtained as a combination of the rigid-body dynamics of the lumped masses and a finite-element model of the beam using straight-beam elements. These capture both in- and out-of-plane bending and twisting modes and permit large 3-D deformations. The fields and forces of the permanent magnets are approximated by dipoles. The static equilibrium of the structure and the dynamic linear approximation around it are computed. A reduced-order model which captures the first two natural modes is used for controller design. Using H-infinity theory, we design a controller for tracking smooth reference signals, disturbance attenuation, and stability robustness against uncertainties in material properties, the geometry, and neglected high-frequency modes. Simulations using the high-order model indicate the efficacy of this approach to vibration attenuation and tracking.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;linear approximation;nonlinear system;robot	Ilker Tunay;Se-Young Yoon;Kyle Woerner;Raju Viswanathan	2009	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2008.2007651	control engineering;simulation;engineering;finite element method;control theory;robotics;physics	Robotics	71.41543007519923	-15.132154397385133	16967

After a 260 °C Pb-free solder assembly reflow-like exposure, a signal margin of >10 μC/cm2 is achieved at a read voltage of 1 V. Extraction of the Preisach distribution after thermal depolarization and restore exhibits an increase in the positive coercive voltage by 45 % while the negative coercive voltage shows minimal deviation (<7 %). Under accelerated aging via high electric fields (2.4 V), maximum wake-up at 106 cycles followed by fatigue >108 cycles is observed. Asymmetry in coercive voltage is minimized after wakeup and remanent polarization maximized. After fatigue, a signal margin >10 μC/cm2 is maintained for read voltages >0.8 V.	3d film;accelerated aging;cmos;embedded system;embedding;exhibits as topic;extraction;fatigue;imprinting (psychology);microcontroller;onset (audio);polarization (waves);reflow soldering;remanence;anatomical layer;electric field;electrode;orders - hl7publishingdomain;voltage	Grant Walters;Paul Chojecki;Alexandra Garraud;Toshikazu Nishida;S.

d75c43ebc45c39e0e7b43ea55c81137bae0a4b88	vision based robotic control	master thesis	The main objective of this project was to create a visual system for object tracking, and implement this on the new robotic lab at the Department of Production and Quality Engineering. There are used two identical KUKA Agilus manipulators with six rotating axes. The robot kinematics with the corresponding Denavit-Hartenberg representation are presented. The position based visual servoing method, used for robotic control, is shown with control loop and relations between the different coordinate bases and frames in the system. Computer vision is a large part of this thesis. The different camera parameters and how to obtain them are explained. The results show the importance of accurate camera calibration, and that one should avoid the temptation to leave out some parameters from the equation. This can cause large errors in the measurements. The SIFT object detection method is explained, and the performance is compared with another method named SURF. The tests show that while SURF is faster than SIFT, it is outperformed when it comes to the robustness of the algorithm. SIFT was therefore chosen for implementation at the lab. With the object detected, the manipulators movement needs to be calculated in order to position the camera in the desired position, which is 300mm perpendicular to the object. The algorithm calculates the rotational and translational offset between the current camera position and the desired camera pose. A proportional regulator is then applied to calculate the next small step on the desired trajectory for the Agilus manipulator. The practical setup of the robot cell is explained with each step needed in order to have a working vision system. The information flow in the system can be chaotic, and a graphic representation is therefore developed and show all steps from image capturing, to robotic movement, and plotting of the trajectories. Results are presented as plots for both distance calculations and the actual movement of the manipulator. The visual system tracks and follows the object successfully. There are however some issues with variations in the output from the object detection algorithm. This cause variations in the signal used as reference for the robot. A filter was able to reduce these variations, but not eliminate them. Possible solutions are presented and are believed to improve the speed and accuracy of the system if further investigated.	robot	Brian Atkinson;Michael C.

Obtaining 3D model from objects is a challenging problem and has been an important research topic in the areas  of photogrammetry and computer vision for many years. In this paper, a three-dimensional modelling study on spatial object  has been carried out by using the spatial data captured via ground-based 3D laser scanner, and a method of using laser range  images for the reconstruction of 3D scene models is proposed. This approach has been described to implement a collection of  algorithms for 3D reconstruction, known as image segmentation and range registration based on planar features. After acquisition  of range data, images have been segmented to extract planar features and registered to detect the initial configuration between  the sensor’s coordinate system of two views. Finally, triangular meshes are built to generate a three-dimensional surface  model. Through an outdoor experiment of reconstructing a statue, the results of our experiment indicate that the method is  accurate and robust. It will be seen that the potential applications is wide, include facilities management for the construction  industry and creating reality models to be used in general areas of virtual reality, for example, virtual studios, virtualized  reality for content-related applications, social telepresence, architecture and others.  	3d modeling	Lu-Xingchang;Liu-Xianlin	2006		10.1007/978-3-540-36998-1_25	computer vision;simulation;engineering;computer graphics (images)	Vision	57.87912671674496	-47.831489917829984	16995

Sound field decomposition forms the foundation of various acoustic signal processing applications. Our main focus is sound field recording and reproduction for high-fidelity audio systems. To improve the reproduction accuracy above the spatial Nyquist frequency, determined by the intervals between array elements, i.e., super-resolution in recording and reproduction, We have proposed a method based on sparse sound field decomposition. For more accurate decomposition, we propose a method for parametric dictionary learning to adaptively optimize the dictionary parameters using input signals. The proposed method is based on Newton's method including pruning of the columns of a dictionary matrix. Numerical simulation results indicate that more accurate sparse decomposition is achieved by the proposed method. The reproduction accuracy is also improved above the spatial Nyquist frequency.	acoustic cryptanalysis;cholesky decomposition;column (database);computer simulation;dictionary;etsi satellite digital radio;machine learning;microphone;newton;newton's method;nyquist frequency;signal processing;simulation;sparse matrix;super-resolution imaging	Naoki Murata;Shoichi Koyama;Norihiro Takamune;Hiroshi Saruwatari	2015	2015 IEEE 6th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2015.7383738	electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;k-svd;computer science	Visualization	79.24029738429508	-36.43629810075397	17024

It consists of two stages: 1) to estimate anechoic mixing parameters of attenuation and arrival delay and 2) to recover original audio sources based on estimated mixing parameters. When delay is longer than one sample, previous algorithms perform poorly. To address this shortcoming, we estimate the maximum delay and use it to find a proper frequency range that produces no phase ambiguity. Then, we determine mixing parameters with time-frequency points in this range. Finally, mathematical tools are used to solve the underdetermined linear system to recover original audio sources. The effectiveness of the proposed technique on various mixing scenarios with noisy observation of mixtures and different types of sounds is demonstrated by experimental results.	algorithm;ambiguity function;broadcast delay;frequency band;linear system;sensor;source separation	Namgook Cho;C.-C.

Notice that the response is very fast without any initial swinging of the pendulum. The following remarks are in order. • It is clear from the simulations that the stabilization mechanism of our controller consists of spinning-up the disk inertia to lift the pendulum, which might impose some unrealistic values to the disk speed. This should be contrasted with the alternative method of [9]—also studied in [1], [3]—where the energy is first pumped-up through a balancing motion before lifting the pendulum. Two drawbacks of the latter approach are the slow convergence and the need to switch the controller close to the upward position. From the theoretical viewpoint both methods also differ, our controller (as well as the one reported in [8]) stabilizes the equilibrium point, while the energy-pumping methods stabilizes the homoclinic orbit, hence the need for the switching. • Although we have solved the stabilization problem of the system (10) with any prescribed saturation of the control, when we come back to the original disk inertia pendulum (9), we have to add sin(x 1) to the above control. So the above procedure does not give an answer to the problem where the maximal torque that the motor can deliver is smaller than the maximal gravity torque. Simulations and experiments have shown that stability cannot be guaranteed if we impose this saturation limit. REFERENCES [1] K. Astrom and K.

Abstract—In this note, we have extended previous studies of the system stability of buffered ALOHA systems to study an individual queue's stability , i.e., per-queue stability. The main result obtained in this work is a necessary and sufficient per-queue stability condition, which can be computed analytically only for several cases. For other noncomputable cases, we have evaluated several inner and outer bounds.

89127cb56a3d053ee0816f2eab6d9abf1ef672bf	magnetic fluid based squeeze film between porous rough conical plates	rough surfaces and load carrying capacity;conical plates;magnetic fluid;squeeze film	We make an endeavor to study and analyze the effect of surface roughness on the performance of a magnetic fluid based squeeze film between conical plates. The lubricant used here is a magnetic fluid and the external magnetic field is oblique to the lower plate. The bearing surfaces are assumed to be transversely rough. The roughness of the bearing surface is modeled by a stochastic random variable with non-zero mean variance and skew-ness. The associated Reynolds’ equation is solved with appropriate boundary conditions to get the pressure distribution, which is, then used to obtain the expression for load carrying capacity leading to the computation of the response time. The results are presented graphically as well as in tabular form. It is noticed that although the bearing suffers owing to transverse surface roughness, the load carrying capacity registers an increase in the case of negatively skewed roughness. Even the negative variance causes an increase in the load carrying capacity. It is observed that the reduction in the load carrying capacity induced by the porosity and the standard deviation can be neutralized up to certain extent by the positive effect of the magnetization parameter μ∗ with suitable values of the semi-vertical angle ω in the case of negatively skewed roughness. A close scrutiny of some of the results presented graphically makes it clear that the positive effect of variance dominates the effect of the skew-ness whose impact is slightly better than that of the magnetization parameter. It is needless to say that the performance of the rough bearing with the magnetic fluid lubricant is definitely better than the one with conventional lubricant. This article reveals that there is a scope for enhancing the performance of the bearing system considerably by choosing a suitable combination of the magnetization parameter and semi-vertical angle of the cone in the case of negatively skewed roughness especially when negative variance is involved.	computation;earthbound;oblique projection;response time (technology);semiconductor industry;table (information);transverse wave	G.

Earlier approaches to subdivision surface fairing encountered problems with singularities in the parametrization of the surface. We address these issues through the use of the characteristic map parametrization, leading to well defined membrane and bending energies even at irregular vertices. Combining this approach with ideas from data-dependent energy operators we are able to express the associated nonlinear stiffness matrices for Catmull-Clark surfaces as linear combinations of precomputed energy matrices. This machinery also provides exact, inexpensive gradients and Hessians of the new energy operators. With these the nonlinear minimization problem can be solved in a stable and efficient way using Steihaug's Newton/CG trust-region method. We compare properties of linear and nonlinear methods through a number of examples and report on the performance of the algorithm.	algorithm;catmull–clark subdivision surface;data dependency;gradient;linear system;newton;newton's method;nonlinear system;precomputation;trust region	Ilja Friedel;Patrick Mullen;Peter Schröder	2003		10.1145/781606.781635	mathematical optimization;geometric modeling;mathematics;geometry;subdivision surface	Graphics	70.26564641866769	-41.865427968732966	17123

The fluid inside a vertical cylindrical container of radius R and height 2H is water characterized by the kinematic viscosity m and thermal diffusivity j. Initially, its density (temperature) varies linearly with height and is characterized by a constant buoyancy frequency N, which is proportional to the density gradient. The system undergoes an abrupt change in the rotation rate from its initial value Xi, when the fluid is in a solid-body rotation state, to the final value Xf. The aim of this contribution is to show the formation of columnar vortices in a high Rossby number spin-up flow.	gradient;numerical analysis;quantum vortex;simulation	Sergey A. Smirnov;J. R.

Only a subset of agents is informed of the bearing to the target and the desired common arrival time; other agents only rely on local communication with neighboring agents for coordination. A balanced containment control is achieved that restricts the motion of the group within a desired region (i.e., a circular sector) while evenly spacing the agents' orientations. To enable simultaneous arrival, a consensus algorithm is designed for agents to coordinate their arrival time by achieving consensus with the informed agents. Only local feedback (i.e., orientation information and estimated arrival time) from neighboring agents is used to navigate the group, and no position information (either absolute or relative position between agents) is required, allowing the multi-agent system to operate in a GPS denied area. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed approach.	chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;global positioning system;information exchange;interrupt;multi-agent system;network packet;simulation;time of arrival	Zhen Kan;Siddhartha S.

The light field convergency represents the degree of convergence of the light field at each point. The proposed method utilizes local photo consistency, which is one of characteristics of the light field convergency. Around a boundary contour, a point that is visible from viewpoints with a small conver- gence angle is locally consistent. In other words, the local photo consistency is implicitly maintained near the bound- ary contour. We use a light field camera as a camera array with small convergence angles to estimate the surface of the transparent object. Experimental results have demonstrated that the depth of the transparent object is estimated from the captured image by the light field camera.	binocular disparity;light field;mathematical optimization;normal (geometry);object-based language;photo-consistency	Yuta Ideguchi;Yuuki Uranishi;Shunsuke Yoshimoto;Yoshihiro Kuroda;Osamu Oshiro	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)	10.1109/CVPRW.2017.222	photometry (optics);computer vision;artificial intelligence;photo-consistency;light field;light-field camera;mathematics	Vision	54.63677166627803	-51.9889867954891	17247

f675c47a980a2b6697d13fdf67124eb4d5f4694a	near-optimal soc trajectory for traffic-based adaptive phev control strategy		The optimal charge and discharge management of the energy storage system (ESS) has a pivotal role in development of the energy management system for the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). This research aims to estimate a near optimal trajectory of ESS state of charge (SOC) to be employed in traffic-based adaptive PHEV control strategy to enhance fuel economy in various driving cycles. In the first step, several driving cycles are developed based on the real-world driving data. Experimental map-based Pontryagin's minimum principle control strategy is designed to extract the optimal SOC trajectories for different cycles. The achieved optimal data is then used to create the database employed for training a Nero-Fuzzy system. The SOC trajectories, estimated under the light of the obtained fuzzy inference system, are employed as the reference SOC profiles in adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy. The simulation results reveal that the proposed approach provides near optimal SOC trajectory and improves the equivalent fuel economy in various driving cycles. Moreover, this adaptive near optimal control strategy could be applied on-line as it doesn't require the knowledge of the entire driving cycle, and only the trip length and the average speed should be known a priori.	computer data storage;control theory;discharger;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;inference engine;online and offline;optimal control;plug-in (computing);pontryagin's maximum principle;simulation;state of charge	Morteza Montazeri-Gh;Zeinab Pourbafarani	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2757604	pontryagin's minimum principle;driving cycle;computer science;state of charge;energy management system;energy storage;trajectory;optimal control;energy management;control engineering	Robotics	55.99936743015157	-12.026330350654222	17255

A novel structured stepper motor, which contains both the main and auxiliary teeth in the stator, is proposed for the actuator. In a normal permanent magnet (PM) motor coils are generally wound on all the stator teeth, however, in the proposed motor, the winding is only on the main teeth. Because of the absence of coils in the auxiliary teeth, the proposed stepper motor possesses the following advantages: simple structure, lighter weight, smaller volume, and less time consumption. The unique auxiliary poles in the stepper motor supply the flux path to increase the step resolution even without any coils. The characteristics of the proposed stepper motor were investigated using finite element analysis. In particular, the effect of the magnetization distribution of the PM on the motor performance was investigated during the analysis. Cogging torque, which causes noise and vibration issues, was minimized by the tooth-shape optimization. In addition, a micro-step voltage-fed algorithm was implemented for a high-resolution position control. By employing a current close to a sine wave using space vector pulse-width modulation, a high-quality current waveform with a high resolution was obtained. Finally, the proposed prototype was fabricated, and the cogging torque, back-electromotive force, and current characteristics were measured by mounting the prototype on the AGS system. Both the analysis and experimental results validate the performance improvement from the proposed motor and its possible application for the flap control of the AGS system.	aicardi-goutieres syndrome 1;actuator device component;apollo abort guidance system;deciduous tooth;finite element method;flatulence;grill (cryptology);image resolution;magnet <device>;mathematical optimization;motor neuron disease;movie projector;odontogenic tissue;permanent vegetative state;prototype;pulse-width modulation;shape optimization;short interspersed nucleotide elements;shutter device component;small;stepper motor device component;surgical flaps;torque teno sus virus 1b;waveform;algorithm;voltage;width	Se-Hyun Rhyu;Jeong-Jong Lee;Bon-Gwan Gu;Byung-Dae Choi;Jung-Hyuk Lim	2014		10.3390/s140508026	control engineering;universal motor;switched reluctance motor;embedded system;text mining;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;actuator;mechanical engineering	Robotics	75.80650461365215	-20.211248454306794	17276

Such applications in the environmental field include analysis of parameters relating to environmental quality, process control, and verification of efficiency of odor control systems. This article reviews the findings of recent scientific studies in this field, with particular focus on the abovementioned applications. In general, these studies prove that electronic noses are mostly suitable for the different applications reported, especially if the instruments are specifically developed and fine-tuned. As a general rule, literature studies also discuss the critical aspects connected with the different possible uses, as well as research regarding the development of effective solutions. However, currently the main limit to the diffusion of electronic noses as environmental monitoring tools is their complexity and the lack of specific regulation for their standardization, as their use entails a large number of degrees of freedom, regarding for instance the training and the data processing procedures.	conflict (psychology);control system;epistaxis;exposure to humidity;gases;heart rate variability;instrument - device;nose;odors;performance;review [publication type];rhinorrhea;sensor web;solutions;vendor role and responsibility document;sensor (device)	Laura Capelli;Selena Sironi;Renato Del Rosso	2014		10.3390/s141119979	electronic nose;discrimination;transducer;biological classification;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;environmental monitoring;biological engineering;natural environment;air pollution	HCI	96.16411303065493	-19.23036079431046	17334

Research and development budgets are being realigned to provide value by adapting work from others to the demanding environment of subsurface drilling.

In general, the control strategies employed to drive the insertion use simplified kinematic models, providing limited control of the trajectory between an entry site and a deep seated target in cases of unmodelled tissue-needle dynamics. In this work, we present the first Adaptive Path-Following (APF) controller for a bio-inspired multi-part needle, able to steer along three-dimensional (3D) paths within a compliant medium by means of the cyclical motion of interlocked segments and without the need for duty-cycle spinning along the insertion axis. The control strategy is outlined in two parts: a high-level controller, which provides driving commands to follow a predefined 3D path smoothly; and a low-level controller, able to counteract unmodelled tissue-needle nonlinearities and kinematic model uncertainties. A simulation that mimics the needle's mechanical behavior during insertion is achieved by using an Experimental Fitting Model (EFM), obtained from previous experimental trials. The Simulation results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed control strategy.	apache axis;australian privacy foundation;british informatics olympiad;control theory;curve fitting;duty cycle;high- and low-level;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;simulation;smoothing;stationary wavelet transform;unmanned aerial vehicle	Riccardo Secoli;Ferdinando Rodriguez y Baena	2016	2016 6th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob)	10.1109/BIOROB.2016.7523603	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.27295690072862	-23.439435719362507	17351

Test results show that the VTL successfully tracks signals against the near-far problem, one of the major limitations in pseudolite navigation systems, and could improve positioning availability by extending pseudolite navigation coverage.	algorithm;angular defect;experiment;global positioning system;gray platelet syndrome;interference (communication);mental suffering;navigation;picolitre;relocation of home or business;satellite navigation;sensor;simulators;track (course);virtual tape library	Hyoungmin So;Taikjin Lee;Sanghoon Jeon;Chongwon Kim;Changdon Kee;Taehee Kim;Sanguk Lee	2010		10.3390/s100706324	embedded system;computer vision;simulation;global positioning system;engineering;geographic information system;physics	Robotics	56.76797168707803	-37.083846143796244	17359

There is one big problem that when system dispatches the elevator to the button responding floor, but corridor passenger is no there. In this paper, we present a novel elevator group control algorithm based on binocular-cameras corridor passenger detection and tracking, aiming to overcome the difficulty in the conventional elevator group control system. In the above proposed system, the corridor passengers are detected using Haar-like features based on binocular-cameras, and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is introduced to improve robustness and accuracy of corridor passenger motion tracking. A new elevator group control strategy based on corridor passenger detection and tracking is proposed to improve the performance and transport efficiency of the elevator service. Compared with the traditional elevator group control system, the proposed system has potential advantages in minimizing passengers’ waiting time and saving electronic energy. The final experimental results show the validity of our method under simulation and realistic condition.	algorithm;binocular vision;control theory;dynamic dispatch;experiment;group control system;haar wavelet;kalman filter;simulation	Zutao Zhang;Yipeng Zheng;Hong A Xu;Hengjian Li	2013	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-013-1716-1	simulation;haar-like features;computer science;machine learning	Robotics	59.3470598917244	-29.067903319884028	17405

Given a model of the system and a bounded set of possible initial states, the algorithm employs a linear matrix inequality approach to compute both upper and lower bounds on reachable regions. Rather than performing computations in the state-space, this method uses impact maps to find the reachable sets on the switching surfaces of the system. This tool can then be used to deduce safety and performance results about the system.	algorithm;computation;linear matrix inequality;map;reachability;social inequality;state space	Abdullah Omar Hamadeh;Jorge M.

The electrical properties of ZnO are currently being studied. In this work, measurements of the ac conductivity properties of ZnO sandwich structures with silver and platinum electrodes are reported. The frequency dependence of both the ac conductivity and dielectric constant of thin films of ZnO have been investigated in the frequency range 5 kHz–13 MHz. It is shown that the total ac conductivitysðvÞ; obeys the equationsðvÞ 1⁄4 Av where s is an index which increases with frequency and decreases with temperature. It appears that for ZnO films, the conduction mechanism is thermally activated and both the overlap large polaron tunnelling and the correlated barrier-hopping of charge carrier over localized states fit the experimental data. The dielectric constant, 1r; lies in the range 8–9 at room temperature and is independent of the frequency in the dielectric thin films. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper different methods of SNR estimation were compared with the reliability of these estimations from the noisy speech. It was found that segmental SNR seems to be the optimal solution for the measurement of the level of noise in the speech from the point of view reliability of the estimation procedure. The results with arithmetical averaging in segmental SNR evaluation are presented. This algorithm gives values close to standard global SNR and its big advantage is less sensitivity to the error of local SNR estimation.	algorithm;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;speech processing	Petr Pollák	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference	10.5281/zenodo.37748	speech recognition;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;pattern recognition;statistics	Metrics	82.01166771596445	-33.37866857451023	17508

The proposed Luenberger observer for such a kind of systems relies on the switching among different gains. Convergence conditions have been found to ensure the stability of the error dynamics and the related gains may be selected by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, this observer may be improved by suitably updating the estimate using the last measures. This update enables one to reduce the norm of the estimation error and is based on the so-called projection method. Simulation results are reported to show the effectiveness of these methods in the estimation for hybrid discrete-time linear systems.	hybrid system;kalman filter;linear matrix inequality;linear system;mean squared error;simulation	Angelo Alessandri;Paolo Coletta	2001		10.1007/3-540-45351-2_5	discrete time and continuous time;linear matrix inequality;discrete system;calculus;control theory;mathematics;projection method;linear system;state observer;hybrid system	Robotics	72.71426435711152	-3.4044481010147805	17538

However, human supervision is still required to monitor the status of the team to ensure that the mission is being carried out as planned. To reduce information overload on these supervisors, we have developed an application, the Mission Control Center (MCC), that aggregates and abstracts status information from AVs using a plan-based view of the mission. Using this model, the MCC presents mission status at the level of goals and plans and directs operator attention to the AVs that require the most attention.	autonomous robot;autonomous system (internet);information overload;mission control	Gary Look;Howard E.

Planning of periodic motions under a virtual constraints approach is considered prior the controller design in order to achieve our goal. A local H∞ controller is derived by means of a certain perturbation of the differential Riccati equations that appear while solving the corresponding H∞ control problem for the linearised system. Stabilisability and detectability properties of the control system are thus ensured by the existence of the proper solutions of the unperturbed differential Riccati equations, and hence the proposed synthesis procedure obviates an extra verification work of these properties. Due to the nature of the approach, the resulting controller additionally yields the desired robustness properties against unknown but bounded external disturbances. Convergence and robustness of the proposed design are supported by simulation results.	motion planning;nonlinear system;underactuation	Iliana Marlen Meza-Sánchez;Luis T. Aguilar;Anton S.

In particular, this methodology is combined with the digital-system verifier (DSVerifier), which is a verification tool that employs Bounded Model Checking based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories to check the stability of digital control systems with uncertainty. DSVerifier determines the control system stability, considering all the plant interval variation set, together with the Finite Word-length (FWL) effects in the digital controller implementation; DSVerifier checks the robust non-fragile stability of a given closed-loop system. The proposed methodology and respective tool are evaluated considering non-fragile control examples from literature. Experimental results show that the approach used in this study is able to foresee fragility problems in robust controllers, which could be overlooked by other existing approaches due to underestimating of FWL effects.	coefficient;control system;correctness (computer science);formal verification;linear system;model checking;modulo operation;requirement;satisfiability modulo theories;verification and validation	Iury Bessa;Hussama Ismail;Reinaldo Martinez Palhares;Lucas C.

2ffd634b5eac297fb215fad325d39ab54ba8fd05	review: don't cross-thread the screw!		The screw is a geometrical element. As Sir Robert Ball stated a century or more ago, the screw joins the company of point, plane, and line. In mechanics, especially instantaneous kinematics and statics of rigid bodies, angular and translational velocity of a body combine as a twist on a screw; precisely analogously a force and a couple combine as a wrench on a screw. In three dimensions screw theory provides essential and simple insight into the behavior of systems of jointed bodies. And screw theory can also play a leading role in the systematic selection of suitable geometrical patterns that should relate to such jointed systems. Yet the mechanics of robots—the prime example today of systems of jointed bodies—has developed with little respect for the screw, even at the most elementary level. Here I focus mainly on robot performance, the study of which has, to an excessive extent, been proceeding blindly in territory where there is an abundance of screws and systems of screws, all, as it were, shouting to be taken on board to show the way. Failure to recognize the screw, and an unwillingness to use it properly, has led to the screw’s being violently abused—‘‘cross-threaded.’’ There are far too many examples of ‘‘cross-threading’’ that have, regrettably, appeared in recent years in several well-known journals. Offenses have been perpetrated and yet left unchallenged. Here I try to remove any mystery that some may see surrounding, and even concealing, the screw. I then venture to deal critically with a small selection of the many instances of cross-threading. However, this symposium has as a main objective the celebration of a Centenary. So it betokens an element of light-heartedness that I resort to at times within the pages that follow. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.		Kenneth H. Hunt	2003	J.

The tessellated geometries represent smoother surfaces, but also their details can be enhanced with displacement mapping for on-the-fly surface elevation. Each output vertex is relocated based on the height information, which refines the geometric details such as peaks, craters, terrain, and wrinkles.	catmull–clark subdivision surface;computer graphics;displacement mapping;graphics processing unit;phong shading;real-time clock;recursion (computer science);shader	Hyunjin Lee;Yuna Jeong;Sungkil Lee	2013		10.1145/2542302.2542322	3d reconstruction;metropolis–hastings algorithm;computer vision;tessellation;computer science;statistics;computer graphics (images)	Graphics	66.36370368467003	-49.6260410926514	17600

It is found that thermo-mechanical stress is the dominant contribution factor to EM performance in TSV instead of the current density. The predicted failure site is dependent on the process technology, and exhibits asymmetric behavior if different process is used between the top and bottom metallization of a TSV. Modeling is also done for two different coverage patterns of top metallization, namely (i) the metal line covers the via completely, and (ii) the metal line only extends to the centre of the via, covering half of the via. The simulation results of the latter model show the existence of a second EM failure site and worse EM performance is expected. This additional possible EM failure site is further confirmed through dynamic simulation of void growth.	electromigration;through-silicon via	Ying Chuan Tan;Cher Ming Tan;Xiaowu Zhang;Tai Chong Chai;D.

The SVD-PHAT method relies on Singular Value Decomposition of the SRP-PHAT projection matrix. A k-d tree is also proposed to speed up the search for the most likely direction of arrival of sound.

Firstly, the NCS model with random time-delay is transformed into a discrete-time system model with uncertain parameters. Then, the Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach are applied to design a guaranteed cost controller, which results in that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and the systempsilas cost function value is less than a determinate upper bound. Furthermore, the optimal guaranteed cost controller can be obtained through solving the corresponding convex optimization problem. Finally, a simulation example is employed to verify the validity of the proposed control algorithm.	algorithm;control system;convex optimization;discrete-time signal;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;network computing system;nonlinear system;optimization problem;property (philosophy);simulation;social inequality	Yong Zhang	2008	2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation	10.1109/CIMCA.2008.12	mathematical optimization;probability density function;convex optimization;uncertainty;linear matrix inequality;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;matrix	Robotics	66.65304846223884	0.2091497065510992	17780

Recently an extension of the binaural Multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF), namely the MWF-IC, has been presented which aims to preserve the Interaural Coherence (IC) of the noise component. Since for the MWF-IC no closed-form solution exists, in this paper we propose to preserve the IC using the binaural MWF with partial noise estimation (MWF-N), for which a closed-form solution exists. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the trade-off parameter in the MWF-N yielding a predefined IC at the filter output. Experimental results in a diffuse noise scenario show that both the MWF-IC and the MWF-N preserve the IC of the output noise component. However, the MWF-IC yields a better noise reduction performance whereas the MWF-N introduces less speech distortion.	algorithm;binaural beats;cache coherence;distortion;noise reduction;speech enhancement;wiener filter	Daniel Marquardt;Volker Hohmann;Simon Doclo	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178050	estimation;speech recognition;coherence;computer science;speech;mathematics;statistics	EDA	83.7288367871937	-34.89211627802635	17798

This control strategy is based on two stages. The first one consists in using a set of pragmatic rules in order to generate a succession of passive and active phases allowing us to perform the dynamic walking of the robot. This first stage is used as a reference control to learn, by using neural networks, a set of articular trajectories. In the second stage, we use these neural networks to generate the learned trajectories during the first stage. The goal of the use of these neural networks is to increase the robustness of the control of the dynamic walking gait of this robot in the case of external disturbances.	artificial neural network;control theory;one-key mac;process (computing);prototype;robot;robustness (computer science);simulation;succession	Christophe Sabourin;Olivier Bruneau	2005	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2005.02.001	simulation;computer science;artificial neural network;robustness	Robotics	62.17502173075182	-11.703825464397122	17800

Our approach builds on the idea of implicit skinning in which the character is approximated by a 3D scalar field and mesh-vertices are appropriately re-projected. Instead of being bound by an initial skinning solution used to initialize the shape at each time step, we use the skin mesh to directly track iso-surfaces of the field over time. Technical problems are two-fold: firstly, all contact surfaces generated between skin parts should be captured as iso-surfaces of the implicit field; secondly, the tracking method should capture elastic skin effects when the joints bend, and as the character returns to its rest shape, so the skin must follow. Our solutions include: new composition operators enabling blending effects and local self-contact between implicit surfaces, as well as a tangential relaxation scheme derived from the as-rigid-as possible energy to solve the tracking problem.	alpha compositing;approximation algorithm;elasticity (data store);implicit surface;isosurface;linear programming relaxation;norm (social)	Rodolphe Vaillant;Gaël Guennebaud;Loïc Barthe;Brian Wyvill;Marie-Paule Cani	2014	ACM Trans.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is one kind of effectual signal processing technology. Using of this method, the multichannel signals can be separated into some independent components. Because noise and vibration signal are statistical independent to each other, the ICA method is introduced to denoise the structural vibration signals. A noise channel is added to amplify the sensor signals to satisfy the calculation condition of ICA. Because the noise is unknown, the usual method simulating noises by numerical dummy channel needs to adjust the noise type unceasingly to obtain the perfect denoising effect. In this paper, an actual testing noise channel substitutes for the simulating channel. In the laboratory, a sensor, static relatively to the ground, is placed outside the vibration structure and regarded as noise channel. The signals of vibration experiment are processed by ICA. The effect of noise reduction compared with wavelet is satisfied and the denoised signals do not change its dynamic characteristic.	dummy variable (statistics);independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;noise reduction;numerical analysis;simulation;wavelet	Yan Yang;Hai-qing Yuan;Ji Wang	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2008.798	gradient noise;gaussian noise;image noise;effective input noise temperature;noise;electronic engineering;speech recognition;colors of noise;value noise;noise temperature;computer science;noise measurement;noise;noise floor;noise, vibration, and harshness;statistics	EDA	87.69286842021414	-36.77964248611724	17842

The proposed framework unifies threat assessment, stability, and control of passenger vehicles into a single combined optimization problem. A nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) problem is formulated, where nonlinear vehicle dynamics, in closed-loop with a driver model, is used to optimize the steering and braking actions needed to keep the driver safe. A model of the driver's nominal behavior is estimated based on his observed behavior. The driver commands the vehicle, whereas the safety system corrects the driver's steering and braking actions in case there is a risk that the vehicle will unintentionally depart from the road. The resulting predictive controller is always active, and mode switching is not necessary. We show simulation results detailing the behavior of the proposed controller and experimental results obtained by implementing the proposed framework on embedded hardware in a passenger vehicle. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed controller to detect and avoid roadway departures while avoiding unnecessary interventions.	electronic circuit simulation;embedded system;experiment;game controller;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;persistence (computer science)	Andrew Gray;Mohammad Ali;Yiqi Gao;J.

dee9ba5562f826db755fb188ee1771c0abd0f893	optimal and robust control of a class of nonlinear systems using dynamically re-optimised single network adaptive critic design		Following the philosophy of adaptive optimal control, a neural network-based state feedback optimal control synthesis approach is presented in this paper. First, accounting for a nominal system model, a single network adaptive critic (SNAC) based multi-layered neural network (called as NN1) is synthesised offline. However, another linear-in-weight neural network (called as NN2) is trained online and augmented to NN1 in such a manner that their combined output represent the desired optimal costate for the actual plant. To do this, the nominal model needs to be updated online to adapt to the actual plant, which is done by synthesising yet another linear-in-weight neural network (called as NN3) online. Training of NN3 is done by utilising the error information between the nominal and actual states and carrying out the necessary Lyapunov stability analysis using a Sobolev norm based Lyapunov function. This helps in training NN2 successfully to capture the required optimal relationship. The overall architecture is named as ‘Dynamically Re-optimised single network adaptive critic (DR-SNAC)’. Numerical results for two motivating illustrative problems are presented, including comparison studies with closed form solution for one problem, which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit of the proposed approach.	nonlinear system;robust control	Shivendra N.

The novelty in our method lies in (a) a characterization of mesh vertices as hyperbolic or non-hyperbolic based upon their discrete local geometry, (b) the cost function used to select a vertex for decimation, and (c) the heuristics applied to re-triangulate the resulting hole. The algorithm begins by classifying the input mesh vertices as hyperbolic or non-hyperbolic, and then computes a volume cost for each non-hyperbolic vertex, in analogy with spherical volume, to capture the loss of fidelity if that vertex is decimated. Vertices of least volume cost are successively deleted and the resulting hole re-triangulated. Preliminary experiments indicate a performance comparable to that of the best known mesh simplification algorithms.	algorithm;decimation (signal processing);emoticon;experiment;heuristic (computer science);level of detail;loss function;polygon mesh;text simplification;udp hole punching;vertex (geometry);vertex (graph theory)	Chansophea Chuon;Sumanta Guha	2009	2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization	10.1109/CGIV.2009.16	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;geometry;laplacian smoothing;t-vertices	Visualization	70.09360222271488	-43.423828457842305	17950

The optimality criterion is represented by the minimal root-mean-square form of deviation of the plant state vector from some desired vector time function under a limited root-mean-square form of the control vector. The required time function represents the optimal linear estimate of smoothing with constant delay of the state vector of another stochastic plant which is based on imprecise observations. The differential equations of the optimal information and control algorithm were established. A particular case of the general problem formulation, the control of a pilotless flight vehicle in the mode of rounding relief was considered by way of example.	optimal control;smoothing;stochastic process	Vadim A.

Zames[21] presented a compositional behavior-bounding technique for evaluating stability of nonlinear systems based on real intervals representing cones (sectors) that bound possible component behaviors. Many innovations in control theory have developed from his insights. We present a novel use of his sector bound theory to validate the stability of embedded control implementations online. The sector analysis can be implemented as a computationally efficient check of stability for different parts of a control design. The advantage of the online application of this technique is that it takes into account software platform effects that impact stability, such as time delays, quantization, and data integrity.  We present a brief overview of the sector concept, our compatible control design approach, application of the technique to model-based embedded control software design, an example of its use to find design defects, and insights that may be drawn from our investigation so far. In the present work we only consider software (discrete-time) control of nonlinear continuous-time systems without switching.	algorithmic efficiency;content-control software;control engineering;control theory;data integrity;embedded system;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);self-stabilization;software design;web application	Joseph Porter;Graham Hemingway;Nicholas Kottenstette;Gabor Karsai;Janos Sztipanovits	2010		10.1145/1879021.1879026	control engineering;embedded system;discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;simulation;nonlinear system;computer science;software design;operating system;automatic control;data integrity	Embedded	63.96174153255324	-0.3317736653084485	17998

It was demonstrated efficiently in 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) positioning. However, in micro-scale, using only image intensity as a visual feature performs unsatisfactorily in cases where the photometric variation is low, such as motions along vision sensor's focal axis under a high magnification. In order to improve the performance and accuracy in those cases, an approach using hybrid visual features is proposed in this paper. Image gradient is employed as a visual feature on z axis while image intensity is used on the other 5 DoFs to control the motion. A 6-DoF micro-positioning task is accomplished by this hybrid visual servoing scheme. The experimental results obtained on a parallel positioning micro-stage under a digital microscope show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.	angularjs;apache axis;electron;experiment;focal (programming language);image gradient;optic axis of a crystal;video tracking;visual servoing	Le Cui;Éric Marchand;D.

A pre-assigned graph uniquely assigns the pursuer-target pair in a cyclic manner. A quantized control law has been proposed which allows the vehicle to pitch and yaw simultaneously in the required direction and track its target agent. The only measurement required for the proposed control law is the quadrant from which the target vehicle moves out of the field-of-view of the pursuing vehicle. A Lyapunov function is chosen to find a domain for the field-of-view which guarantees rendezvous under the proposed control law. Computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the control law.

The key issues addressed are: (1) the multi-rate sampling of process variables; and (2) the requirement of optimized operation that achieves desired product specifications and also minimizes the operating costs. To this end, we identify data-driven models that capture the temporal dynamics of process measurements sampled at different rates. The resulting multi-rate models are used to design a two-tiered predictive controller that enables achieving the target end-point while minimizing the associated costs. The EMPC is implemented on the EAF process and the closed-loop simulation results illustrate the improvement in economic performance over existing trajectory-tracking approaches.	enterprise architecture framework;limited availability;loss function;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Mudassir M.

The structure for the reactants, transition states and products for the rate-determining step are optimized, and the energy barrier is computed in three different environments: gas phase, water solvent, and ionic liquid. The results are encouraging in describing the energy barrier in the ionic liquid.

The goal of our system is to provide a 3D model of the undersea habitat in a long-term continuous manner. The most important feature of our system is the use of multiple cameras and multiple projectors, which is able to provide accurate 3D models with an accuracy of a millimeter. By introducing projectors in our system, we can use many different structured light methods for different tasks. There are two main advantages comparing our system with using ROVs or AUVs. First, our system can provide continuous monitoring of the undersea habitat. Second, our system has a low hardware cost. Comparing to existing deployed camera systems, the advantage of our system is that it can provide accurate 3D models and provides opportunities for future development of innovative algorithms for undersea research.	3d modeling;3d reconstruction;algorithm;habitat;movie projector;structured light;video projector;virtual camera system	Xida Chen;Steve Sutphen;Paul Macoun;Yee-Hong Yang	2015	CoRR		embedded system;computer vision;simulation	Robotics	54.30090164294416	-44.47592295851052	18067

The longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm is one of the potential techniques to help build generalized task structures from multiple sequences. However the LCS problem is NP hard, so a couple of suboptimal LCS approaches have been adopted in the past, involving a pair-wise comparison of sequences or a search for the common symbols within a small window. This paper argues that an LCS of multiple sequences results in a better generalization than pairwise comparison, and in many practical situations it is feasible to find an LCS of multiple sequences. So a novel LCS finding algorithm is presented for applications in the programming by demonstration domain. The algorithm has been extensively tested for sequences of random symbols and its application in a path planning example is presented.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;encode;longest common subsequence problem;motion planning;np (complexity);np-hardness;programming by demonstration;robotics;run time (program lifecycle phase);spatial variability;topological graph	Tanveer Abbas;Bruce A.

a36a352c305ec49537581d29742d6af9cbeba86b	calibration method for line-structured light multi-vision sensor based on combined target	signal image and speech processing;information systems applications incl internet;communications engineering networks	Calibration is one of the most important technologies for line-structured light vision sensor. The existing calibration methods depend on special calibration equipments, whose accuracy determines the calibration accuracy. It is difficult to meet the requirements of universality and field calibration with those methods. In order to solve these problems, a new calibration method based on the combined target for line-structured light multi-vision sensor is proposed. Each line-structured light multi-vision sensor is locally calibrated by combined target with high precision. On the basis of global calibration principle and the characteristics of the combined target, global calibration and local calibration are unified. The unification avoids the precision decrement caused by coordinate transformation. And the occlusion problem of 3D reference objects can be avoided. An experimental system for 3D multi-vision measurement is set up with two sets of vision sensor and its calibration matrix is obtained. To improve the calibration accuracy, the method of acquiring calibration points with high precision and error factors in calibration are analyzed. After being calibrated, the experimental system is finally tested through a workpiece measurement experiment. The repeatability of this system is 0.04 mm, and it proves that the proposed calibration method can obtain high precision. Moreover, by changing the structure of the combined target, this calibration method can adapt to the different multi-vision sensors, while the accuracy of the combined target is still guaranteed. Thus, this calibration method has the advantages of universality and field calibration.	experimental system;image sensor;increment and decrement operators;repeatability;requirement;structured light;unification (computer science);universality probability	Yin-guo Huang;Xing-hua Li;Pei-fen Chen	2013	EURASIP J.

62d709e025530ff1afac800201f6288c76a95b4f	hybrid adaptive pinning control for function projective synchronization of delayed neural networks with mixed uncertain couplings		This paper presents the function projective synchronization problem of neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and uncertainties asymmetric coupling. The function projective synchronization of this model via hybrid adaptive pinning controls and hybrid adaptive controls, composed of nonlinear and adaptive linear feedback control, is further investigated in this study. Based on Lyapunov stability theory combined with the method of the adaptive control and pinning control, some novel and simple sufficient conditions are derived for the function projective synchronization problem of neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and uncertainties asymmetric coupling, and the derived results are less conservative. Particularly, the controlmethod focuses on how to determine a set of pinned nodes with fixed coupling matrices and strength values and randomly select pinning nodes. Based on adaptive control technique, the parameter update law, and the technique of dealing with some integral terms, the control may be used to manipulate the scaling functions such that the drive system and response systems could be synchronized up to the desired scaling function. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.		T. Botmart;N. Yotha;Piyapong Niamsup;W.

Approximating the external magnetic field by its value at the location of the equivalent magnetic dipoles, the equivalent magnetic dipoles' strengths are linearly proportional to the external magnetic field, for a given time dependence of external magnetic field, and are given by the equivalent dipole polarizability matrix. The polarizability matrix and its associated equivalent dipole location are estimated from magnetic field measurements made with at least three linearly independent polarizations of external magnetic fields at the body. Uncertainties in the polarizability matrix elements and its equivalent dipole location are obtained from analysis of a linearized inversion for polarizability and dipole location. Polarizability matrix uncertainties are independent of the scale of the polarizability matrix. Dipole location uncertainties scale inversely with the scale of the polarizability matrix. Uncertainties in principal polarizabilities and directions are obtained from the sensitivities of eigenvectors and eigenvalues to perturbations of a symmetric matrix. In application to synthetic data from a magnetic conducting sphere and to synthetic data from an axially symmetric elliptic conducting body, the estimated polarizability matrices, equivalent dipole locations, and principal polarizabilities and directions are consistent with their estimated uncertainties.	approximation algorithm;image scaling;inverse transform sampling;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;polarizability;propagation of uncertainty;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;transmitter;uncertainty principle	J.

Although the exact nature of such biological motor controllers is not known, existing literature suggests that they maintain metastable interactions with dynamic objects based on prediction rather than reaction. Most robotic gripper controllers find such tasks very challenging mainly due to hard constraints imposed on the stability of closed-loop control and inadequate rates of convergence of adaptive controller parameters. This paper presents experimental and numerical simulation results of a control law based on a relaxed stability criterion of reducing the probability of failure to maintain a stable grip on a soft object that undergoes temporal variations in its internal impedance. The proposed controller uses only three parameters to interpret the probability of failure estimated using a history of grip forces to adjust the grip on the dynamic object. Here, we demonstrate that the proposed controller can maintain smooth and stable grip tightening and relaxing when the object undergoes random impedance variations, compared with a reactive controller that involves a similar number of controller parameters.	characteristic impedance;control theory;humans;interaction;metastability in electronics;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;optimal control;output impedance;robot;simulation;stiffness	Thrishantha Nanayakkara;Allen Jiang;Maria del Rocio Armas Fernandez;Hongbin Liu;Kaspar Althoefer;João Bimbo	2016	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2016.2549545	robot;control engineering;simulation;uncertainty;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;electrical impedance;control theory;robotics;force	Robotics	68.31152447068516	-18.331921195010203	18196

d8369963ad05486ffecd5e6cbb3d1c2fa2b3ce06	application of computer algebra system and the mean-value theory for evaluating electrostatic potential and its associated field for nontrivial configurations		Evaluation of electrostatic potential at an arbitrary point within a two dimensional region free of electric charge containing geometrically dispersed nontrivial configurations electrified to constant potentials applying the standard classic approach, i.e. Laplace equation is challenging. The challenge stems from the fact that the solution of the Laplace equation needs to be adjusted to the boundary conditions imposed with the configurations. Numeric solution of the latter is challenging as it lacks generalities. There exist an alternative numeric method which is based on the application of The Mean-Value Theory. The latter is a pure numeric approach; although the output of its iterated refined version is successful, it is cumbersome. In this investigation utilizing the powerful features of Computer Algebra Systems, specifically Mathematica by a way of example we show an innovative approach. Our approach is based on a combination of numeric aspect of The Mean-Value Theory on one hand and Mathematica features on the other hand. This semi numeric-symbolic approach not only provides the desired output, but it also generates information beyond the scope of the standard classic method. By way of example we present the intricacies of our approach, showing (1) how the potential is evaluated and (2) how corollary essential information not addressed in classic cases such as electric field is calculated as well. Our method is applied to a two-dimensional case; its three dimensional version may easily be applied to cases of interest.	computer algebra system;graphics;iteration;keyboard shortcut;numerical analysis;regional lockout;semiconductor industry;wolfram mathematica	Haiduke Sarafian	2017	Mathematics in Computer Science	10.1007/s11786-017-0304-6	discrete mathematics;pure mathematics;mathematics;algebra	AI	97.99521922048478	3.1737648122053157	18259

Delays and system latencies substantially affect the performance of visually guided systems. In this paper we discuss ways to cope with delays while improving system performance. Model predictive control strategies are proposed to compensate for the mechanical latency in visual control of motion.	algorithm;control flow;video tracking	João Pedro Barreto;Jorge Batista;Helder Araújo	2000		10.1109/ICPR.2000.903021	computer vision;tracking system;computer science;control theory;computer performance;model predictive control	Robotics	60.99694620072009	-32.02060126547926	18290

To that end, we use a monadic factorization of the second-order reduced density matrix originally proposed by E. R. Davidson [Chem Phys Lett 1995, 246, 209] that achieves a full separation of the interelectronic components into one-electron terms. The final computational effort is equivalent to that found in the integration of a one determinant wave function with as many orbitals as occupied functions in the correlated expansion. Similar strategies to extract the exchange and self-interaction contributions from the two-electron repulsion are also discussed, and several numerical results obtained in a few test systems are summarized.	computation;dna integration;density matrix;electron;numerical analysis;one-electron universe;quantum dots;quantum entanglement	Ángel Martín Pendás;Evelio Francisco;Marco A Blanco	2005	Journal of computational chemistry	10.1002/jcc.20173	chemistry;computational chemistry;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	Comp.	96.32495582530204	-4.366924357266957	18296

Just as the human heart provides energy to the muscles in the body, the robotic SMA heart distributes thermofluidic energy to arrays of SMA actuators that function as robotic muscles. Furthermore, the robotic heart draws from its own fluidic output to assist in the actuation of its own internal SMA actuators, just as a portion of the blood pumped by the human heart supplies energy to its own muscles. Dynamic modeling and simulation of the SMA actuators and pumping system are used to assist in optimizing the output of the heart. The effects of changing various parameters such as actuator length and actuation timing were explored via simulation and experiment. The current prototype of the SMA heart is capable of pumping 2.1 times more fluid than is required to sustain its own actuation. This is the first successful implementation of such a robotic heart, such that it has a net positive thermofluidic output to provide to other actuators while sustaining its own actuation via thermofluidic feedback. Furthermore, the SMA heart is capable of pumping a net output of 66 mL/min, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the output of other SMA “micro” pumps.	fleming valve;joule;mathematical optimization;multistage interconnection networks;prototype;pumping (computer systems);robot;simulation	Matthew D.

We expose the different problems involved by this decentralized setting, such as network aspects (data losses, latencies or bandwidth requirements) or data incest (double-counting information), and address them. In order to ease the data association process and also guarantee the consistency of the vehicles localizations, we introduce a new model to represent the natural drift affecting SLAM algorithms. By integrating this model, loop closures, associations between robots and absolute information can be easily taken into account. A general framework has been designed thus allowing to use any SLAM algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we applied it to a monocular solution. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that a monocular decentralized SLAM is presented. A multi-robot data association algorithm, based on geometric constraints is also exposed in this paper. The validation is performed thanks to a simulator presenting a realistic physics. The results show that the localizations consistency is preserved. It also demonstrates that multi-vehicle monocular SLAM is viable in urban environments.	algorithm;branch and bound;computation;correspondence problem;experiment;internationalization and localization;real-time computing;requirement;robot;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping;time complexity	Guillaume Bresson;Romuald Aufrère;Roland Chapuis	2013	Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion		computer vision;simulation;geography;control theory	Robotics	54.77731609502292	-39.10942510962404	18339

In this work, we detail a comprehensive solution for directly volume rendering block-structured (Berger-Colella) AMR data in the OSPRay interactive CPU ray tracing framework. In particular, we contribute a general method for representing and traversing AMR data using a kd-tree structure, and four different reconstruction options, one of which in particular (the basis function approach) is novel compared to existing methods. We demonstrate our system on two types of block-structured AMR data and compressed scalar field data, and show how it can be easily used in existing production-ready applications through a prototypical integration in the widely used visualization program ParaView.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;adaptive mesh refinement;basis function;central processing unit;computational science;graphics processing unit;high- and low-level;image quality;image scaling;isosurface;octree;ray tracing (graphics);refinement (computing);regular grid;simd;spmd;simulation;time series;tree structure;volume rendering	Ingo Wald;Carson Brownlee;Will Usher;Aaron Knoll	2017		10.1145/3139295.3139305	scalar field;computer graphics (images);rendering (computer graphics);computer vision;volume rendering;visualization;artificial intelligence;data exploration;basis function;computer science;ray tracing (graphics);adaptive mesh refinement	Visualization	69.47628338602966	-51.16559211921709	18343

On the basis of structure decomposition, all interaction transmitting channels to an individual control loop from all the other closed loops are decoupled and represented by elements of the decomposed relative interaction array (DRIA). Utilizing the decoupled interactions from both inputs and outputs, a decomposed relative gain array (DRGA) is constructed. DRGA is then employed to evaluate the overall interactions to individual control loop from another one. Consequently, the synthesis of the control structure can be evaluated in a straightforward manner by using a relative control performance index (RCPI).

However, the performance of this valuable feature can be seriously affected by external disturbances such as wind effects. The latter could be even more significant when dealing with small-size helicopters, which are commonly adopted as base platforms for developing unmanned aerial vehicles. Motivated by this context, this work proposes an augmented configuration for performing more stable hovering maneuvers that consists of the unmanned helicopter itself, a tether connecting the helicopter to the ground, and a device on ground adjusting the tether tension. A modeling analysis on the inherent benefits to the proposed configuration as well as the control guidelines to exploit such potentialities are presented in this paper. As a proof a concept, a first basic implementation of the control structure for the entire system is also included. Finally, several demonstrating simulations under artificially generated wind influences are presented to endorse the validity of the proposed approach.

937ff3a228a8e42709362ccb2f13376cc5dab131	finite-time decoupling direct control for hypersonic reentry vehicle with multiple disturbances via second-order adrc		In this paper, a novel finite-time decoupling direct control (FDDC) scheme is proposed for attitude tracking problem of hypersonic reentry vehicle (HRV) based on second-order active disturbance rejection control (SADRC). Unlike traditional control method which separates control system into outer-loop attitude control and inner-loop angular rate control, attitude is controlled by control actuator straightforward with single loop. Firstly, the attitude tracking problem is converted to the decoupling control problem of a three-input and three-output cross coupling system. In each channel, a SADRC controller, which is composed of tracking differentiator (TD), extended state observer (ESO) and nonlinear state error feedback (NLSEF), is designed to track attitude command of the corresponding channel in a finite-time sense. Finally, the obtained virtual control input is transformed into actual control input, which acts on the HRV model. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	angularjs;computer simulation;control system;control theory;coupling (computer programming);differentiator;heart rate variability;nonlinear system;rejection sampling	Yue Yu;Honglun Wang;Na Li;Huiping Zhang;Chang Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324831	differentiator;control engineering;control theory;control theory;actuator;attitude control;state observer;engineering;active disturbance rejection control;control system;communication channel	Robotics	66.91755340822142	-13.31126278299246	18382

A quaternion is a hyper complex number of rank 4 that can be utilized to avoid the inherent geometrical singularity when representing rigid body dynamics with Euler angles or the complexity of having coupled differential equations with the Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM). In the presented approach the novel contributions consist of: a) the quadrotor's attitude model and b) the proposed non-linear Proportional squared (P2) control algorithm, which have been proposed and experimentally evaluated fully in the quaternion space, without any transformations nor calculations in the Euler angle nor the DCM spaces. The established control scheme is combined with a quaternion based Madwick Complementary filter for estimating the attitude quadrotor's responses. Multiple experimental results, including the case where external disturbances are acting on the quadrotor, are being presented for proving the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed novel quaternion based controller.	algorithm;control theory;dicom;emoticon;euler;experiment;nonlinear system	Emil Fresk;George Nikolakopoulos	2015	2015 IEEE 20th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301555	conversion between quaternions and euler angles;acceleration;control engineering;estimation;angular velocity;automatic control;mathematical model;control theory;attitude control;statistics;quaternion	Robotics	67.64382893502119	-19.343350304804403	18397

The parameter uncertainties are allowed to be time-varying and norm-bounded, and appear in the system state matrix. The system measurements are subject to randomly varying sensor delays, which often occur in information transmission through network. The aim of this paper is to design an output feedback controller such that, for all admissible parameter uncertainties and all probabilistic sensor delays, the closed-loop system is Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable in the mean square (i.e. the system state is mean square bounded), and the steady-state variance of each state is not more than the individual prescribed upper bound. It is shown that such a controller design problem is feasible if there are positive definite solutions to a couple of algebraic Riccati-like inequalities or linear matrix inequalities.

To solve a state estimation problem,we construct continuous–discrete interval observers that are asymptotically stable in the absence of disturbances. These interval observers are composed of two copies of the studied system and of a framer, accompanied with appropriate outputs which give, componentwise, upper and lower bounds for the solutions of the studied system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the virtual structure, each mobile robot is modeled by an electric charge. The mobile robots move toward a circle, and due to repulsive forces between the identical charges, regular polygon formations of the mobile robots will be realized. For swarm formation, a virtual mobile robot is located at the center of the circle, and other mobile robots follow it. In the introduced approach, each mobile robot finds its position in the formation autonomously, and the formation can change automatically in the case of change in the number of the mobile robots. This paper also proposes a technique for avoiding obstacles based on the behavioral structure. In this technique, when a mobile robot gets close to an obstacle, while moving toward its target, a rotational potential field is applied to lead the mobile robot to avoid the obstacle, without locating in local minimum positions.	consensus dynamics;maxima and minima;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;swarm;the circle (file system)	Hamed Rezaee;Farzaneh Abdollahi	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2245612	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;electric charge;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;control theory;robot control	Robotics	58.020095966945625	-22.742688459650743	18440

The description of the underlying mechanisms stems from the basic principles of fluid dynamics and is translated into systems of partial or ordinary differential equations. The overall objective of this work is the study of these equations atrnthe continuous and discrete levels, their coupling and the development of a reliable and efficient computational framework to implement various numerical methods to approximate the solutions to these problems. The numerical simulations incorporate realistic geometries, are thoroughly validated against experimental data and target specific biomedical applications. The first chapter focuses on three-dimensional models,rnin which the motion of a biofluid in a complex, realistic geometry is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a domain with inlet and outlet boundaries, the main application in view being the study of the cerebral venous network. The purpose of Chapter 2 is two-fold: (i) first, we present contributions towards the elaboration of several reduced 0d models describing the coupled dynamics of different biofluids in the eye-rncerebral system; (ii) second, we describe a new splitting strategy for the numerical solving of coupled systems of partial and ordinary differential equations for fluid flows. In Chapter 3, the fluid dynamics description from the previous chapters is enriched to take into account the combined effects of flow and different structures, from a multiphysics perspective. The resulting framework is subsequently utilized for simulating blood flow inrnthe aorta, in view of a specific biomedical application and for the numerical simulation of particulate flows, with an emphasis on the issue of how to handle contacts.

The theory developed in the paper unifies and extends concepts and results known for continuoustime and discrete-time systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for a linear system on a time scale to be positive is presented. Properties of positive reachable sets are investigated and characterizations of various controllability properties are presented. A modified Gram matrix of the system is used to state necessary and sufficient condition of positive reachability of a positive system on an arbitrary time scale.	accessibility;coefficient;control system;gramian matrix;linear system;positive systems;reachability	Zbigniew Bartosiewicz	2013	MCSS	10.1007/s00498-013-0106-6	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	69.90678390038016	3.914536629746271	18505

The goal of this analysis is to study possible limit cycles in such systems. DFs of Nested 3rd and 4th order algorithms are obtained for the first time. Then, HB equation is used to analyze the real sliding motion in the HOSM system, where the sliding set converges to a limit cycle. Chattering (limit cycle) in the HOSM systems is studied, and the chattering parameters (amplitude and frequency) are computed. A definition of Tolerance Limits, which characterizes the acceptable performance in the real HOSM system, is applied to verify if the chattering parameters fit the amplitude and frequency limits. Next, Performance Phase Margin and Performance Gain Margin definitions, which give the metrics for robustness of real HOSM to unmodeled dynamics, are applied to assess the robustness of the limit cycle emerged in the real HOSM system. Examples and simulations that validate the obtained results are presented.	algorithm;bode plot;computation;direction finding;domain analysis;harmonic balance;limit cycle;numerical partial differential equations;performance tuning;phase margin;simulation	Antonio Rosales;Yuri B.

522f5ba8ea6b1935c254ed04c024ee7b7f8f0c5f	low-rank representation of both singing voice and music accompaniment via learned dictionaries		Recent research work has shown that the magnitude spectrogram of a song can be considered as a superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component, which appear to correspond to the instrumental part and the vocal part of the song, respectively. Based on this observation, one can separate singing voice from the background music. However, the quality of such separation might be limited, because the vocal part of a song can sometimes be lowrank as well. Therefore, we propose to learn the subspace structures of vocal and instrumental sounds from a collection of clean signals first, and then compute the low-rank representations of both the vocal and instrumental parts of a song based on the learned subspaces. Specifically, we use online dictionary learning to learn the subspaces, and propose a new algorithm called multiple low-rank representation (MLRR) to decompose a magnitude spectrogram into two low-rank matrices. Our approach is flexible in that the subspaces of singing voice and music accompaniment are both learned from data. Evaluation on the MIR-1K dataset shows that the approach improves the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and the source-to-interference ratio (SIR), but not the source-to-artifact ratio (SAR).	algorithm;dictionary;distortion;etsi satellite digital radio;interference (communication);machine learning;sparse matrix;spectrogram	Yi-Hsuan Yang	2013			machine learning;linear subspace;artificial intelligence;vocal music;speech recognition;superposition principle;magnitude (mathematics);subspace topology;matrix (mathematics);computer science;spectrogram;singing	ML	82.67295458070517	-36.513354182879404	18552

Although parametrically defined blocks of finite elements initially dominated mesh generation, the creation of complex solids forced mesh generation away from the direct use of parametrizations. This review emphasizes the earliest and most important techniques for mesh generation that relied on solid modeling. In addition to including a brief summary of parametrically defined meshes, this review also includes the more recent advancing front technique. This paper concludes with brief remarks that incorporate current directions and developments in automating mesh generation.	mesh generation;solid modeling	David A.

The reinforcement learning method employed learns an optimal policy by actuating the ankle joints to assert pressure at different points along the support foot, and to determine the next swing foot placement. The controller is learnt in simulation using an inverted pendulum model and the control policy transferred and tested on two small physical humanoid robots.	humanoid robot;inverted pendulum;reinforcement learning;simulation;stepping level	Bernhard Hengst;Manuel Lange;Brock White	2011	2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100814	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;robot locomotion;control theory;reinforcement learning	Robotics	62.77264828144659	-24.19004243337296	18594

Relaxed Lyapunov-based constraints are used in the MPC formulation to improve the economic performance. These constraints will enforce a Lyapunov decrease after every few steps. Recursive feasibility and asymptotical convergence to the steady state can be achieved using Lyapunov-like stability analysis. The proposed economic MPC can be applied to minimize energy consumption in HVAC control of commercial buildings. The Lyapunov-based constraints in the online MPC problem enable the tracking of the desired set-point temperature. The performance is demonstrated by a virtual building composed of two adjacent zones.	asymptote;building information modeling;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;performance tuning;recursion (computer science);steady state	Zheming Wang;Guoqiang Hu	2017	CoRR		control theory;control engineering;steady state;nonlinear system;recursion;hvac;energy consumption;mathematics;lyapunov redesign;lyapunov function;mathematical optimization;convergence (routing)	Robotics	58.57385704160161	-3.5762951628184	18603

The L2-gain performance analysis for the disturbance attenuation problem is considered via the dissipative systems theory. Finally simulation results are shown to verify the stability and L2-gain performance of the visual force feedback system.	dissipative system;feedback;haptic technology;lyapunov fractal;profiling (computer programming);simulation;systems theory	Hiroyuki Kawai;Toshiyuki Murao;Masayuki Fujita	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2007.4389445	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.79903295218168	-17.227217423359207	18606

However, reliability and quality of the numerical results strongly depend on the whole FE-model and especially on the modeling of the material behavior, which shows wide impact on calculated stresses and strains of sheet metal parts. Therefore, the experimental determination of characteristic material data concerning anisotropic and temperatureeffects is essential. In this paper the influence of temperature on the yielding and the hardening behavior of the magnesium sheet metal alloy AZ31 are investigated for different uniaxial and biaxial stress conditions. For that purpose an experimental setup has been developed at the Chair of Manufacturing Technology (LFT) which enables biaxial tensile testing of sheet metal. Yield loci of AZ31 are determined as a function of temperature and they are based on solely measurement data of the forming process itself.	finite element method;hardening (computing);layer four traceroute;numerical analysis	Manfred Geiger;Marion Merklein;Wolfgang Hußnätter;Martin Grüner	2008	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-008-0098-0	design process;engineering;magnesium;biaxial tensile test;metallurgy	Robotics	86.50767018456938	-13.598662441336495	18609
